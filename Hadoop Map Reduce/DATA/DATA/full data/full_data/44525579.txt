44525579	the gospel of the pentateuch  a set of parish sermons     preface to the first edition of the gospel of the pentateuch to the rev canon stanley    my dear stanley  i dedicate these sermons to you not that i may make you responsible for any doctrine or statement contained in them but as the simplest method of telling you how much they owe to your book on the jewish church and of expressing my deep gratitude to you for publishing that book at such a time as this  it has given to me and i doubt not to many other clergymen a fresh confidence and energy in preaching to my people the gospel of the old testament as the same with that of the new and without it many of these sermons would have been very different from and i am certain very inferior to what they are now by the help of your admirable book  brought up like all cambridge men of the last generation upon paleys evidences i had accepted as a matter of course and as the authoritative teaching of my university paleys opinions as to the limits of biblical criticism 0a quoted at large in dean milmans noble preface to his last edition of the history of the jews and especially that great dictum of his that it is an unwarrantable as well as unsafe rule to lay down concerning the jewish history that which was never laid down concerning any other that either every particular of it must be true or the whole false  i do not quote the rest of the passage first because you i doubt not know it as well as i and next in order that if any one shall read these lines who has not read paleys evidences he may be stirred up to look the passage out for himself and so become acquainted with a great book and a great mind  a reverent and rational liberty in criticism within the limits of orthodoxy is i have always supposed the right of every cambridge man and i was therefore the more shocked for the sake of free thought in my university at the appearance of a book which claimed and exercised a licence in such questions which i must after careful study of it call anything but rational and reverent  of the orthodoxy of the book it is not of course a private clergymans place to judge  that book seemed dangerous to the university of cambridge itself because it was likely to stir up from without attempts to abridge her ancient liberty of thought but it seemed still more dangerous to the hundreds of thousands without the university who being no scholars must take on trust the historic truth of the bible  for i found that book if not always read yet still talked and thought of on every side among persons whom i should have fancied careless of its subject and even ignorant of its existence but to whom i was personally bound to give some answer as to the book and its worth  it was making many unsettled and unhappy it was even worse pandering to the cynicism and frivolity of many who were already too cynical and frivolous and much as i shrank from descending into the arena of religious controversy i felt bound to say a few plain words on it at least to my own parishioners  but how to do so without putting into their heads thoughts which need be in no mans head and perhaps shaking the very faith which i was trying to build up was difficult to me and i think would have been impossible to me but for the opportune appearance of your admirable book  i could not but see that the book to which i have alluded like most other modern books on biblical criticism was altogether negative was possessed too often by that fanaticism of disbelief which is just as dangerous as the fanaticism of belief was picking the body of the scripture to pieces so earnestly that it seemed to forget that scripture had a spirit as well as a body or if it confessed that it had a spirit asserting that spirit to be one utterly different from the spirit which the scripture asserts that it possesses  for the scripture asserts that those who wrote it were moved by the spirit of god that it is a record of gods dealings with men which certain men were inspired to perceive and to write down  whereas the tendency of modern criticism is without doubt to assert that scripture is inspired by the spirit of man that it contains the thoughts and discoveries of men concerning god which they wrote down without the inspiration of god which difference seems to me and i hope to others utterly infinite and incalculable and to involve the question of the whole character honour and glory of god  there is without a doubt something in the old testament as well as in the new quite different in kind as well as in degree from the sacred books of any other people  an unique element which has had an unique effect upon the human heart life and civilization this remains after all possible deductions for ignorance of physical science errors in numbers and chronology interpolations mistakes of transcribers and so forth whereof we have read of late a great deal too much and ought to care for them and for their existence or nonexistence simply nothing at all because granting them allthough the greater part of them i do not grant as far as i can trust my critical facultythere remains that unique element beside which all these accidents are but as the spots on the sun compared to the great glory of his lifegiving light  the unique element is there and i cannot but still believe after much thought that itthe powerful and working element the inspired and divine element which has converted and still converts millions of soulsis just that which christendom in all ages has held it to be  the account of certain noble acts of gods and not of certain noble thoughts of manin a word not merely the moral but the historic element and that therefore the value of the bible teaching depends on the truth of the bible story  that is my belief  any criticism which tries to rob me of that i shall look at fairly but very severely indeed  if all that a man wants is a religion he ought to be able to make a very pretty one for himself and a fresh one as often as he is tired of the old  but the heart and soul of man wants more than that as it is written my soul is athirst for god even for the living god  those whom i have to teach want a living god who cares for men works for men teaches men punishes men forgives men saves men from their sins and him i have found in the bible and nowhere else save in the facts of life which the bible alone interprets  in the power of man to find out god i will never believe  the religious sentiment or godconsciousness so much talked of nowadays seems to me as i believe it will to all practical commonsense englishmen a faculty not to be depended on as fallible and corrupt as any other part of human nature apt to judge from history to develop itself into ugly forms not only without a revelation from god but too often in spite of oneinto polytheisms idolatries witchcrafts buddhist asceticisms phoenician molochsacrifices popish inquisitions american spirit rappings and what not  the hearts and minds of the sick the poor the sorrowing the truly human all demand a living god who has revealed himself in living acts a god who has taught mankind by facts not left them to discover him by theories and sentiments a judge a father a saviour and an inspirer in a word their hearts and minds demand the historic truth of the bibleof the old testament no less than of the new  what i needed therefore for my guidance was a book which should believe and confess all this without condemning or ignoring free criticism and its results which should make use of that criticism not to destroy but to build up which employed a thorough knowledge of the old testament history the manners of the jews the localities of the sacred events to teach men not what might not be in the bible but what was certainly therein which dealt with the bible after the only fair and trustful method that is to consider it at first according to the theory which it sets forth concerning itself before trying quite another theory of the commentators own invention and which combined with a courageous determination to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth that christian spirit of trust reverence and piety without which all intellectual acuteness is but blindness and folly  all this and more i found in your book enforced with a genius which needs no poor praise of mine and i hailed its appearance at such a crisis as a happy providence certain that it would be what i now know by experience it has been a balm to many a wounded spirit and a check to many a wandering intellect inclined in the rashness of youth to throw away the truth it already had for the sake of theories which it hoped that it might possibly verify hereafter  with your book in my hand i have tried to write a few plain sermons telling plain people what they will find in the pentateuch in spite of all present doubts as their fathers found it before them and as i trust their children will find it after them when all this present whirlwind of controversy has past   as dust that lightly rises up and is lightly laid again   i have told them that they will find in the bible and in no other ancient book that living working god whom their reason and conscience demand and that they will find that he is none other than jesus christ our lord  i have not apologised for or explained away the socalled anthropomorphism of the old testament  on the contrary i have frankly accepted it and even gloried in it as an integral and i believe invaluable element of scripture  i have deliberately ignored many questions of great interest and difficulty because i had no satisfactory solution of them to offer but i have said at the same time that those questions were altogether unimportant compared with those salient and fundamental points of the bible history on which i was preaching  and therefore i have dared to bid my people relinquish biblical criticism to those who have time for it and to say of it with me as abraham of the planets o my people i am clear of all these things  i turn myself to him who made heaven and earth  i do not wish believe me to make you responsible for any statement or opinion of mine  i am painfully conscious on reviewing for the press sermons which would never have been published save by special request how imperfect poor and weak they seem to mehow much worse then they will appear to other people how much more may be said which i have not the wit to say  but the bible can take care of itself i presume without my help  all i can do is to speak what i think as far as i see my way to record the obligation toward you under which i with thousands more now lie and to express my hope that we shall be always found together fellow workers in the cause of truth and that to you and in you may be fulfilled those noble and tender words in which you have spoken of samuel and of those who work in samuels spirit  in later times even in our own many names spring to our recollection of those who have trodden or in different degrees some known and some unknown are treading the same thankless path in the church of germany in the church of france in the church of russia in the church of england  wherever they are and whosoever they may be and howsoever they may be neglected or assailed or despised they like their great prototype and likeness in the jewish church are the silent healers who bind up the wounds of their age in spite of itself they are the good physicians who bind together the dislocated bones of a disjointed time they are the reconcilers who turn the hearts of the children to the fathers or of the fathers to the children  they have but little praise and reward from the partisans who are loud in indiscriminate censure and applause  but like samuel they have a far higher reward in the davids who are silently strengthened and nurtured by them in naioth of ramahin the glories of a new age which shall be ushered in peacefully and happily after they have been laid in the grave 0b  that such my dear stanley may be your work and your destiny is the earnest hope of  yours affectionately c kingsley eversley rectory july 1 1863    sermon i  god in christ    septuagesima sunday  genesis i  i  in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth  we have begun this sunday to read the book of genesis  i trust that you will listen to it as you oughtwith peculiar respect and awe as the oldest part of the bible and therefore the oldest of all known worksthe earliest human thought which has been handed down to us  and what is the first written thought which has been handed down to us by the providence of almighty god  in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth  how many other things how many hundred other things men might have thought fit to write down for those who should come after and say this is the first knowledge which a man should have this is the root of all wisdom all power all wealth  but god inspired moses and the prophets to write as they have written  they were not to tell men that the first thing to be learnt was how to be rich nor how to be strong nor even how to be happy  but that the first thing to be learnt was that god created the heaven and the earth  and why first  because the first question which man asksthe question which shows he is a man and not a brutealways has been and always will be where am i  how did i get into this world and how did this world get here likewise  and if man takes up with a wrong answer to that question then the man himself is certain to go wrong in all manner of ways  for a lie can never do anything but harm or breed anything but harm and lies do breed as fast as the blight on the trees or the smut on the corn  only being not according to nature or the laws of god they do not breed as natural things do after their kind  but belonging to chaos the kingdom of disorder and misrule they breed fresh lies unlike themselves of all strange and unexpected shapes so that when a man takes up with one lie there is no saying what other lie he may not take up with beside  wherefore the first thing man has to learn is truth concerning the first human question where am i  how did i come here and how did this world come here  to which the bible answers in its first line   in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth  how god created the bible does not tell us  whether he created as doubtless he could have done if he chose this world suddenly out of nothing full grown and complete or whether he created it as he creates you and me and all living and growing things now out of things which had been before itthat the bible does not tell us  perhaps if it had told us it would have drawn away our minds to think of natural things and what we now call science instead of keeping our minds fixed as it now does on spiritual things and above all on the spirit of all spirits him of whom it is written god is a spirit  for the bible is simply the revelation or unveiling of god  it is not a book of natural science  it is not merely a book of holy and virtuous precepts  it is not merely a book wherein we may find a scheme of salvation for our souls  it is the book of the revelation or unveiling of the lord god jesus christ what he was what he is and what he will be for ever  of jesus christ  how is he revealed in the text in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth  thusif you look at the first chapter of genesis and the beginning of the second you will see that god is called therein by a different name from what he is called afterwards  he is called god elohim the high or mighty one or ones  after that he is called the lord god jehovah elohim which means properly the high or mighty i am or jehovah a word which i will explain to you afterwards  that word is generally translated in our bible as it was in the greek the lord because the later jews had such a deep reverence for the name jehovah that they did not like to write it or speak it  but called god simply adonai the lord  so that we have three names for god in the old testament  first el or elohim the mighty one  by which so moses says god was known to the jews before his time and which sets forth gods power and majestythe first thing of which men would think in thinking of god  next jehovah  the i am the eternal and selfexistent being by which name god revealed himself to moses in the burning busha deeper and wider name than the former  and lastly adonai the lord the living ruler and master of the world and men by which he revealed himself to the later jews and at last to all mankind in the person of our lord jesus christ  now i need not to trouble your mind or my own with arguments as to how these three different names got into the bible  that is a matter of criticism of scholarship with which you have nothing to do  and you may thank god that you have not in such days as these  your business is not how the names got there which is a matter of criticism but why they have been left there by the providence of god which is a matter of simple religion and you may thank god i say again that it is so  for scholarship is marthas part which must be done and yet which cumbers a man with much serving  but simple heart religion is the better part which mary chose and of which the lord has said that it shall not be taken from her nor from those who like her sit humbly at the feet of the lord and hear his voice without troubling their souls with questions of words and endless genealogies which eat out the hearts of men  therefore all i shall say about the matter is that the first chapter of genesis and the first three verses of the second may be the writing of a prophet older than moses because they call god elohim which was his name before moses time and that moses may have used them and worked them into a book of genesis while he in the part which he wrote himself called god at first by the name jehovah elohim the lord god in order to show that jehovah and el were the same god and not two different ones and after he had made the jews understand that went on to call god simply jehovah and to use the two names as they are used through the rest of the old testament interchangeably  as we say sometimes god sometimes the lord sometimes the deity and so forth meaning of course always the same being  that i think is the probable and simple account which tallies most exactly with the bible  as for the first five books of the bible the pentateuch having been written by moses or at least by far the greater part of them i cannot see the least reason to doubt it  the bible itself does not say so and therefore it is not a matter of faith and men may have their own opinions on the matter without sin or false doctrine  but that moses wrote part at least of them our lord and his apostles say expressly  the tradition of the jews who really ought to know best has always been that moses wrote either the whole or the greater part  moses is by far the most likely man to have written them of all of whom we read in scripture  we have not the least proof and what is more never shall or can have that he did not write them  and therefore i advise you to believe as i do that the universal tradition of both jews and christians is right when it calls these books the books of moses 7  but now no more of these matters  we will think of a matter quite infinitely more important and that is who is this god whom the bible reveals to us from the very first verse of genesis  at least he is one and the same being  whether he be called el jehovah or adonai he is the same lord  it is the lord who makes the heaven and the earth the lord who puts man in a paradise lays on him a commandment and appears to him in visible shape  it is the lord who speaks to abraham  though abraham knew him only as elshaddai the almighty god  it is the lord who brings the israelites out of egypt who gives them the law on sinai  it is the lord who speaks to samuel to david to all the prophets and appears to isaiah while his glory fills the temple  in whatever divers manners and many portions as st paul says in the epistle to the hebrews he speaks to them he is the same being  and psalmists and prophets are most careful to tell us that he is the god not of the jews only but of the gentiles of all mankind as indeed he must be being jehovah the i am the one self existent and eternal being that from his throne he is watching and judging all the nations upon earth fashioning the hearts of all appointing them their bounds and the times of their habitation if haply they may seek after him and find him though he be not far from any one of them for in him they live and move and have their being  this is the message of moses of the psalmists and the prophets just as much as of st paul on mars hill at athens  so begins and so ends the old testament revealing throughout the lord  and how does the new testament begin  by telling us that a babe was born at bethlehem and called jesus the saviour  but who is this blessed babe  he too is the lord  a saviour which is christ the lord  and from thence through the gospels the acts the epistles the revelation of st john he is the lord  there is no manner of doubt of it  the apostles and evangelists take no trouble to prove it  they take it for granted they call jesus christ by the name by which the jews had for hundreds of years called the el of abraham the jehovah of moses the babe who is born at bethlehem who grows up as other human beings grow into the man christ jesus is none other than the lord god who created the universe who made a covenant with abraham who brought the israelites out of egypt who inspired the prophets who has been from the beginning governing all the earth  it is very awful  but you must believe that or put your bibles away as a dreamnew testament and old alike  not to believe that fully and utterly is not to believe the bible at all  for that is what the bible says and has been sent into the world to say  it is from beginning to end the book of the revelation or unveiling of jesus christ very god of very god  but some may say why tell us that  of course we believe it  we should not be christians if we did not  be it so  i hope it is so  but i think that it is not so easy to believe it as we fancy  we believe it i think more firmly than our forefathers did five hundred years ago on some points and therefore we have got rid of many dark and blasphemous superstitions about witches and devils about the evil of the earth and of our own bodies of marriage and of the common duties and bonds of humanity which tormented them because they could not believe fully that jesus christ had created and still ruled the world and all therein  but we are all too apt still to think of jesus christ merely as some one who can save our souls when we die and to forget that he is the lord who is and has been always ruling the world and all mankind  and from this come two bad consequences  people are apt to speak of the lord jesusor at least to admire preachers who speak of himas if he belonged to them and not they to him and therefore to speak of him with an irreverence and a familiarity which they dared not use if they really believed that this same jesus whose name they take in vain is none other than the living god himself their creator by whom every blade of grass grows beneath their feet every planet and star rolls above their heads  and nextthey fancy that the old testament speaks of our lord jesus christ only in a few mysterious propheciessome of which there is reason to suspect they quite misinterpret  they are slow of heart to believe all that the scriptures have spoken of him of whom moses and the prophets did write not in a few scattered texts but in every line of the old testament from the first of genesis to the last of malachi  and therefore they believe less and less that jesus christ is still the lord in any real practical sensenot merely the lord of a few elect or saints but the lord of man and of the earth and of the whole universe  they think of him as a lord who will come again to judgmentwhich is true and awfully true in the very deepest sense  but they do not think of himin spite of what he himself and his apostles declared of himas the living working lord to whom all power is given in heaven and earth and not merely over the souls of a few regenerate as the alpha and omega the first and the last of whom st paul says that the mystery of christ has been hid from the beginning of the world in god who created all things by jesus christ    that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are in earth  they fill their minds with fancies about the book of revelation most of which there is reason to fear are little else but fancies  while they overlook what that book really does say and what is the best news that the world ever heard that he is the prince of the kings of the earth  therefore they have fears for christs bible fears for christs church fears for the fate of the world which they could not have if they would recollect who christ is and believe that he is able to take care of his own kingdom and power and glory better than man can take care of it for him  surely surely faith in the living lord who rules the world in righteousness is fast dying out among us and many who call themselves christians seem to know less of christ and of the work which he is carrying on in the world than did the old psalmist who said of him the lord shall endure for ever he hath also prepared his seat for judgment  for he shall judge the world in righteousness and minister true judgment among the people  he fashioneth the hearts of all of them and understandeth all their works  who can say that he believes that who holds that this world is the devils world and that sinful man and evil spirits are having it all their own way till the day of judgment  who can say that he believes that who falls into pitiable terror at every new discovery of science or of scholarship for fear it should destroy the bible and the christian faith instead of believing that all which makes manifest is light and that all light comes from the father of lights by the providence of jesus christ his only begotten son who is the light of men and the inspiration of his spirit who leadeth into all truth  and how lastly can those say that they believe that who will lie and slander and have recourse to base intrigues in order to defend that truth and that church of which the lord himself has said that he has founded it upon a rock and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it  but if you believe indeed the message of the bible that jesus christ is the lord who made heaven and earth then it shall be said of you as it was of st peter blessed art thou  for flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee but my father which is in heaven  yes  blessed indeed is he who believes that who believes that the same person who was born in a stable had not where to lay his head went about healing the sick and binding up the broken heart suffered under pontius pilate was crucified dead and buried and rose again the third day and ascended into heavenascended thither that he might fill all things and is none other than the lord of the earth and of men the creator the teacher the saviour the guide the king the judge of all the world and of all worlds past present and to come  for to him who thus believes shall be fulfilled the promise of his lord come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest  he will find rest unto his soul  rest from that first and last question of which i said that all men down to the lowest savage ask it simply because they are men and not beasts  where am i how came i here  how came this world here likewise  for he can answer  i am in the kingdom of the babe of bethlehem  he put me here  and he put this world here likewise  and that is enough for me  he created all i see or can seei care little how provided that he created it for then i am sure that it must be very good  he redeemed me and all mankind when we were lost at the price of his most precious blood  he the lord is king therefore will i not be moved though the earth be shaken and the hills be carried into the midst of the sea  yea though the sun were turned to darkness and the moon to blood and the stars fell from heaven and all power and order all belief and custom of mankind were turned upside down yet there would still be one above who rules the world in righteousness whose eye is on them that fear him and put their trust in his mercy to deliver their soul from death and to feed them in the time of dearth  darkness may cover the land for awhile and gross darkness the people  but while i sit in darkness the lord shall be my light till the day when he shall say once more let there be light and light shall be  yes  to the man who is a good man and true who has any hearty christian feeling for his fellowmen and is not merely a selfish superstitious person caring for nothing but what he calls the safety of his own soul to the man i say who has anything of the loving spirit of christ in him what question can be more important than this is the world well made or ill  is it well governed or ill  is it on the whole going right or going wrong  and what can be more comforting to such a man than the answer which the bible gives him at the outset  this world is well made in love and care for christ the lord made it and behold it was very good  this world is going right and not wrong in spite of all appearances to the contrary for christ the lord is king  he sitteth between the cherubim be the earth never so unquiet  he is too strong and too loving to let the world go any way but the right  parts of it will often go wrong here and go wrong there  the sin and ignorance of men will disturb his order and rebel against his laws and strange and mad things terrible and pitiable things will happen as they have happened ever since the day when the first man disobeyed the commandment of the lord  but man cannot conquer the lord the lord will conquer man  he will teach men by their neighbours sins he will teach them by their own sins  he will chastise them by sore judgments  he will make fearful examples of wilful and conceited sinners and those who seem to escape him in this life shall not escape him in the life to come  but he is trying for ever every mans work by fire and against that fire no lie will stand  he will burn up the stubble and chaff and leave only the pure wheat for the use of future generations  his purpose will stand  his word will never return to him void but will prosper always where he sends it  he has made the round world so sure that it cannot be moved either by man or by worse than man  his everlasting laws will take effect in spite of all opposition and bring the world and man along the path and to the end which he purposed for them in the day when god made the heavens and the earth and in that even greater day when he said let us make man in our image after our likeness and man arose upright and knew that he was not as the beasts and asked who he was and where feeling with the hardly opened eyes of his spirit after that lord from whom he came and to whom he shall return as many as have eternal life in the day when christ the lord of life shall have destroyed death and put all enemies under his feet and given up the kingdom to god even the father that god may be all in all    sermon ii  the likeness of god    trinity sunday  genesis i 26  and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness  this is a hard saying  it is difficult at times to believe it to be true  if one looks not at what god has made man but at what man has made himself one will never believe it to be true  when one looks at what man has made himself at the back streets of some of our great cities at the thousands of poor germans and irish across the ocean bribed to kill and to be killed they know not why at the abominable wrongs and cruelties going on in poland at this momentthe cry whereof is going up to the ears of the god of hosts and surely not in vain when one thinks of all the cries which have gone up in all ages from the victims of mans greed lust cruelty tyranny and shrillest of all from the tortured victims of his superstition and fanaticism it is difficult to answer the sneer believe if you can that this foolish unjust cruel being called man is made in the likeness of god  man was never made in the image of god at all  he is only a cunninger sort of animal for better for worseand for worse as often as for better  another says not quite that  man was in the likeness of god once but he lost that by adams fall and now is only an animal with an immortal soul in him to be lost or saved  there is more truth in that latter notion than in the former  but if it be quite right if we did lose the likeness of god at adams fall how comes the bible never to say so  how comes the bible never to say one word on what must have been the most important thing which ever happened to mankind before the coming of our lord jesus christ  and how comes it also that the new testament says distinctly that man is still made in the likeness of god  for st paul speaks of man as the likeness and glory of god  and st james says of the tongue therewith bless we god even the father and therewith to our shame curse we men which are made in the likeness of god  but the great proof that man is made in the image and likeness of god is the incarnation of our lord jesus christ for if human nature had been as some think something utterly brutish and devilish and utterly unlike god how could god have become man without ceasing to be god  christ was man of the substance of his mother  that substance had the same human nature as we have  then if that human nature be evil what follows  something which i shall not utter for it is blasphemy  christ has taken the manhood into god  then if manhood be evil what follows again  something more which i shall not utter for it is blasphemy  but man is made in the image of god and therefore god in whose image he is made could take on himself his own image and likeness and become perfect man without ceasing to be perfect god  therefore my friends it is a comfortable and wholesome doctrine that man is made in the image of god and one for which we must thank the bible  for it is the bible which has revealed that truth to us in its very beginning and outset that we might have from the first clear and sound notions concerning man and god  the bible i say for the sacred books of the heathen say most of them nothing thereof  man has in all ages been tempted when he looks at his own wickedness and folly not only to despise himselfwhich he has good reason enough to dobut to despise his own human nature and to cry to god why hast thou made me thus  he has cursed his own human nature  he has said surely man is most miserable of all the beasts of the field  he has said i must get rid of my human naturei must give up wife family human life of all kinds i must go into the deserts and the forests and there try to forget that i am a man and become a mere spirit or angel  so said the buddhists of asia the deepest thinkers concerning man and god of all the heathens and so have many said since their time  but so does the bible not say  it starts by telling us that man is made in gods likeness and that therefore his human nature is originally and in itself not a bad but a perfectly good thing  all that has to be done to it is to be cured of its diseases and the bible declares that it can be cured  howsoever man may have fallen he may rise howsoever the likeness may be blotted and corrupted it can be cleansed and renewed  howsoever it may be perverted and turned right round and away from god and goodness to selfishness and evil it can be converted and turned back again to god  howsoever utterly far gone man may be from original righteousness still to original righteousness he can return by the grace of baptism and the renewing of the holy spirit  and what in us is the likeness of god  that is a deep question  only one answer will i make to it today  whatever in us is or is not the likeness of god at least the sense of right and wrong is to know right and wrong  so says the bible itself  behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil  not that he got the likeness of god by his fallof course not but that he became aware of his likeness and that in a very painful and common wayby sinning against it as st paul says in one of his deepest utterances by sin is the knowledge of the law  and you may see for yourselves how human nature can have gods likeness in that respect and yet be utterly fallen and corrupt  for a man mayand indeed every man doesknow good and yet be unable to do it and know evil and yet be a slave to it tied and bound with the chains of his sins till the grace of god release him from them  to know good and evil right and wrongto have a conscience a moral sensethat is the likeness of god of which i wish to preach today  because it is through that knowledge of good and evil and through it alone that we can know god and jesus christ whom he has sent  it is through our moral sense that god speaks to us through our sense of right and wrong through that i say god speaks to us whether in reproof or encouragement in wrath or in love to teach us what he is like and to teach us what he is not like  to know god  that is the side on which we must look at this text on trinity sunday  if man be made in the image of god then we may be able to know something at least of god and of the character of god if we have the copy we can guess at least at what the original is like  from the character therefore of every good man we may guess at something of the character of god  but from the character of jesus christ our lord who is the very brightness of his fathers glory and the express image of his person we may see perfectlyat least perfectly enough for all our needs in this life and in the life to comewhat is the character of god who made heaven and earth  i beseech you to remember thisi beseech you to believe this with your whole hearts and minds and souls and especially just now  for there are many abroad now who will tell you man can know nothing of god  answer them  if your god be a god of whom i can know nothing then he is not my god the god of the bible  for he is the god who has said of old they shall not teach each man his brother saying know the lord for all shall know me from the least unto the greatest  he is the god who through jesus christ our lord accused and blamed the jews because they did not know him which if they could not know him would have been no fault of theirs  of doctrines and notions and systems it is written and most truly i know in part and i prophesy in part and again if a man thinketh that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know  but of god it is written this is life eternal to know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent  but they will say man is finite and limited god is infinite and absolute and how can the finite comprehend the infinite  answer  those are fine words  i do not understand them and i do not care to understand them i do not deny that god is infinite and absolute though what that means i do not know  but i find nothing about his being infinite and absolute in the bible  i find there that he is righteous just loving merciful and forgiving and that he is angry too and that his wrath is a consuming fire and i know well enough what those words mean though i do not know what infinite and absolute mean  so that is what i have to think of for my own sake and the sake of all mankind  but they will say you must not take these words to the letter man is so unlike god and god so unlike man that gods attributes must be quite different from mans  when you read of gods love justice anger and so forth you must not think that they are anything like mans love mans justice mans anger but something quite different not only in degree but in kind  so that what might be unjust and cruel in man would not be so in god  my dear friends beware of that doctrine for out of it have sprung half the fanaticism and superstition which has disgraced and tormented the earth  beware of ever thinking that a wrong thing would be right if god did it and not you  and mind that is flatly contrary to the letter of the bible  in that grand text where abraham pleads with god what does he say  not of course if thou choosest to do it it must be right but shall not the judge of all the earth do right  abraham actually refers the almighty god to his own law and asserts an eternal rule of right and wrong common to man and to god which god will surely never break  answer  if that doctrine be true which i will never believe then the bible mocks and deceives poor miserable sinful man instead of teaching him  if gods love does not mean real actual lovegods anger actual angergods forgiveness real forgivenessgods justice real justicegods truth real truthgods faithfulness real faithfulness what do they mean  nothing which i can understand nothing which i can trust in  how can i trust in a god whom i cannot understand or know  how can i trust in a love or a justice which is not what i call love or justice or anything like them  the saints of old said i know in whom i have believed  and how can i believe in him if there is nothing in him which i can know nothing which is like mannothing to speak plainly like christ who was perfect man as well as perfect god  if that be so if man can know nothing really of god he is indeed most miserable of all the beasts of the field for i will warrant that he can know nothing really of anything else  and what is left for him but to remain for this life and the life to come in the outer darkness of ignorance and confusion misrule and misery wherein is most literallyas one may see in the history of every heathen nation upon earthwailing and gnashing of teeth  if gods goodness be not like mans goodness there is no rule of morality left no eternal standard of right and wrong  how can i tell what i ought to do or what god expects of me or when i am right and when i am wrong if you take from me the good plain old bible rule that man can be and must be like god  the bible rule is that everything good in man must be exactly like something good in god because it is inspired into him by the spirit of god himself  our lord jesus who spoke not to philosophers or scribes and pharisees but to plain human beings weeping and sorrowing suffering and sinning like ustold them to be perfect as our father in heaven is perfect by being good to the unthankful and the evil  and if man is to be perfect as his father in heaven is perfect then his father in heaven is perfect as man ought to be perfect  he told us to be merciful as our father in heaven is merciful  then our father in heaven is merciful with the same sort of mercy as we ought to show  we are bidden to forgive others even as god for christs sake has forgiven us  then if our forgiveness is to be like gods gods forgiveness is like ours  we are to be true because god is true  just because god is just  how can we be that if gods truth is not like what men call truth gods justice not like what men call justice  if i give up that rule of right and wrong i give up all rules of right and wrong whatsoever  no my friends if we will seek for god where he may be found then we shall know god whom truly to know is everlasting life  but we must not seek for him where he is not in long words and notions of philosophy spun out of mens brains and set up as if they were real things when words and notions they are and words and notions they will remain  we must look for god where he is to be found in the character of his only begotten son jesus christ who alone has revealed and unveiled gods character because he is the brightness of gods glory and the express image of his person  what christs character was we can find in the holy gospels and we can find it too scattered and in parts in all the good the holy the noble who have aught of christs spirit and likeness in them  whatsoever is good and beautiful in any human soul that is the likeness of christ  whatsoever thoughts words or deeds are true honest just pure lovely of good report whatsoever is true virtue whatsoever is truly worthy of praise that is the likeness of christ the likeness of him who was full of all purity all tenderness all mercy all selfsacrifice all benevolence all helpfulness full of all just and noble indignation also against oppressors and hypocrites who bound heavy burdens and grievous to be borne but touched them not themselves with one of their fingers who kept the key of knowledge and neither entered in themselves or let those who were trying enter in either  the likeness of an allnoble alljust allgracious allwise all good human being that is the likeness of christ and that therefore is the likeness of god who made heaven and earth  allgood utterly and perfectly good in every kind of goodness which we have ever seen or can ever imaginethat thank god is the likeness and character of almighty god in whom we live and move and have our being  to know that he is thatallgood is to know his character as far as sinful and sorrowful man need know and is not that to know enough  the mystery of the everblessed trinity as set forth so admirably in the athanasian creed is a mystery and it we cannot knowwe can only believe it and take it on trust  but the character of the everblessed trinityfather son and holy ghostwe can know while by keeping the words of the athanasian creed carefully in mind we may be kept from many grievous and hurtful mistakes which will hinder our knowing it  we can know that they are all good for such as the father is such is the son and such is the holy ghost that goodness is their one and eternal substance and majesty and glory which we must not divide by fancying with some that the father is good in one way and the son in another  that their goodness is eternal and unchangeable for they themselves are eternal and have neither parts nor passions  that their goodness is incomprehensible that is cannot be bounded or limited by time or space or by any notions or doctrines of ours for they themselves are incomprehensible and able to do abundantly more than we can ask or think  this is our god the god of the bible the god of the church the god who has revealed himself in jesus christ our lord  and him we can believe utterly for we know that he is faithful and true and we know what that means if there is any truth or faithfulness in us  we know that he is just and righteous and we know what that means if there is any justice and uprightness in ourselves  him we can trust utterly to him we can take all our cares all our sorrows all our doubts all our sins and pour them out to him because he is condescending and we know what that means if there be any condescension and real highmindedness in ourselves  we can be certain too that he will hear us just because he is so great so majestic so glorious because his greatness and majesty and glory is a moral and spiritual greatness which shows itself by stooping to the meanest by listening to the most foolish helping the weakest pitying the worst even while it is bound to punish  him we can trust i say because him we can know and can say of him let the infinite and the absolute mean what they may i know in whom i have believedgod the good  whatever else i cannot understand i can at least understand the lovingkindness of the lord however high his dwelling may be i know that he humbleth himself to behold the things in heaven and earth to take the simple out of the dust and the poor out of the mire  whatever else god may or may not be i know that gracious is the lord and righteous yea our god is merciful  the lord preserveth the simple for i was in misery and he helped me  whatsoever fine theories or new discoveries i cannot trust i can trust him for with him is mercy and with the lord is plenteous redemption and he shall redeem his people from all their sins  however dark and ignorant i may be i can go to him for teaching and say teach me to do the thing that pleaseth thee for thou art my god let thy loving spirit lead me forth into the land of righteousness  the land of righteousness  the one true heavenly land wherein god the righteous dwelleth from eternity to eternity righteous in all his ways and holy in all his works and therefore adorable in all his ways and glorious in all his works with a glory even greater than the glory of his almighty power  on that glory of his goodness we can gaze though afar off in degree yet near in kind while the glory of his wisdom and power is far far beyond my understanding of the intellect of god we can know nothing but we can know what is better the heart of god  for that glory of goodness we can understand and know and sympathize with in our heart of hearts and say if this be the likeness of god he is indeed worthy to be worshipped and had in honour  praise the lord o my soul for the lord is good  kings and all people princes and all judges of the world young men and maidens old men and children praise the name of the lord for his name only is excellent because his name is good  lift up your eyes and look upon the face of christ the god man crucified for you and behold therein the truth of all truths the doctrine of all doctrines the gospel of all gospels that the unknown and infinite and absolute god who made the universe bids you know him and know this of him that he is good and that his express image and likeness isjesus christ his son our lord    sermon iii  the voice of the lord god    preached also at the chapel royal st james sexagesima sunday  genesis iii 8  and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day  these words would startle us if we heard them for the first time i do not know but that they may startle us now often as we have heard them if we think seriously over them  that god should appear to mortal man and speak with mortal man  it is most wonderful  it is utterly unlike anything that we have ever seen or that any person on earth has seen for many hundred years  it is a miracle in every sense of the word  when one compares man as he was then weak and ignorant and yet seemingly so favoured by god so near to god with man as he is now strong and cunning spreading over the earth and replenishing it subduing it with railroads and steamships with agriculture and science and all strange and crafty inventions and all the while never visited by any divine or heavenly appearance but seemingly left utterly to himself by god to go his own way and do his own will upon the earth one asks with wonder can we be adams children  can the god who appeared to adam be our god likewise or has gods plan and rule for teaching man changed utterly  no  he is one god the same god yesterday today and for ever his will and purpose his care and rule over man have not changed  that is a matter of faith  of the faith which the holy church commands us to have  but it need not be a blind or unreasonable faith  that our god is the god of adam that the same lord god who taught him teaches us likewise need not be a mere matter of faith it may be a matter of reason likewise a thing which seems reasonable to us and recommends itself to our mind and conscience as true  consider my friends a babe when it comes into the world  the first thing of which it is aware is its mothers bosom  the first thing which it does as its eyes and ears are gradually opened to this world is to cling to its parents  it holds fast by their hand it will not leave their side  it is afraid to sleep alone to go alone  to them it looks up for food and help  of them it asks questions and tries to learn from them to copy them to do what it sees them doing even in play and the parents in return lavish care and tenderness on it and will not let it out of their sight  but after a while as the child grows the parents will not let it be so perpetually with them  it must go to school  it must see its parents only very seldom perhaps it must be away from them weeks or months  and why  not that the parents love it less  but that it must learn to take care of itself to act for itself to think for itself or it will never grow up to be a rational human being  and the parting of the child from the parents does not break the bond of love between them  it learns to love them even better neither does it break the bond of obedience  the child is away from its parents eye  but it learns to obey them behind their back to do their will of its own will to ask itself what would my parents wish me to do were they here and so learns if it will think of it a more true deep honourable and spiritual obedience than it ever would if its parents were perpetually standing over it saying do this and do that  in after life that child may settle far away from his fathers home  he may go up into the temptations and bustle of some great city  he may cross to far lands beyond the sea  but need he love his parents less need the bond between them be broken though he may never set eyes on them again  god forbid  he may be settled far away with children business interests of his own and yet he may be doing all the while his fathers will  the lessons of god which he learnt at his mothers knee may be still a lamp to his feet and a light to his path  amid all the bustle and labour of business his fathers face may still be before his eyes his fathers voice still sound in his ears bidding him be a worthy son to him still bidding him not to leave that way wherein he should go in which his parents trained him long long since  he may feel that his parents are near him in the spirit though absent in the flesh  yes though they may have passed altogether out of this world they may be to him present and near at hand and he may be kept from doing many a wrong thing and encouraged to do many a right one by the ennobling thought my father would have had it so my mother would have had it so had they been here on earth  and though in this world he may never see them again he may look forward steadily and longingly to the day when this lifes battle over he shall meet again in heaven those who gave him life on earth  my friends if this be the education which is natural and necessary from our earthly parents made in gods image appointed by gods eternal laws for each of us why should it not be the education which god himself has appointed for mankind  all which is truly human not sinful or fallen is an image and pattern of something divine  may not therefore the training which we find by the very facts of nature fit and necessary for our children be the same as gods training by which he fashioneth the hearts of the children of men  therefore we can believe the bible when it tells us that so it is  that god began the education of man by appearing to him directly keeping him as it were close to his hand and teaching him by direct and open revelation  that as time went on god left men more and more to themselves outwardly  but only that he might raise their minds to higher notions of religionthat he might make them live by faith and not merely by sight and obey him of their own hearty free will and not merely from fear or wonder  and therefore in these days when miraculous appearances have as far as we know entirely ceased yet god is not changed  he is still as near as ever to men still caring for them still teaching them and his very stopping of all miracles so far from being a sign of gods anger or neglect is a part of his gracious plan for the training of his church  for considerman was first put upon this earth with all things round him new and strange to him seeing himself weak and unarmed before the wild beasts of the forest not even sheltered from the cold as they are and yet feeling in himself a power of mind a cunning a courage which made him the lord of all the beasts by virtue of his mind though they were stronger than he in body  all that we read of adam and eve in the bible is as we should expect the history of childrenchildren in mind even when they were full grown in stature  innocent as children but like children greedy fanciful ready to disobey at the first temptation for the very silliest of reasons and disobeying accordingly  such creatures with such wonderful powers lying hid in them such a glorious future before them and yet so weak so wilful so ignorant so unable to take care of themselves liable to be destroyed off the face of the earth by their own folly or even by the wild beasts aroundsurely they needed some special and tender care from god to keep them from perishing at the very outset till they had learned somewhat how to take care of themselves what their business and duty were upon this earth  they needed it before they fell they needed it still more and their children likewise after they fell  and if they needed it we may trust god that he afforded it to them  but again  whence came this strange notion which man alone has of all the living things which we see of religion  what put into the mind of man that strange imagination of beings greater than himself whom he could not always see but who might appear to him  what put into his mind the strange imagination that these unseen beings were more or less his masters  that they had made laws for him which he must obey  that he must honour and worship them and do them service in order that they might be favourable to him and help and bless and teach him  all nations except a very few savages and we do not know but that their forefathers had it like the rest of mankind have had some such notion as this some idea of religion and of a moral law of right and wrong  where did they get it  where i ask again did they get it  my friends after much thought i answer there is no explanation of that question so simple so rational so probable as the one which the text gives  and they heard the voice of the lord god  some i know say that man thought out for himself in his own reason the notion of god that he by searching found out god  but surely that is contrary to all experience  our experience is that men left to themselves forget god lose more and more all thought of god and the unseen world believe more and more in nothing but what they can see and taste and handle and become as the beasts that perish  how then did man who now is continually forgetting god contrive to remember god for himself at first  how unless god himself showed himself to man  i know some will say that mankind invented for themselves false gods at first and afterwards cleared and purified their own notions till they discovered the true god my friends there is a homely old proverb which will well apply here  if there had been no gold guineas there would be no brass ones  if men had not first had a notion of a true god and then gradually lost it they would not have invented false gods to supply his place  and whence did they get i ask again the notion of gods at all  the simplest answer is in the bible  god taught them  i can find no better  i do not believe a better will ever be found  and why not  why not  i ask  to say that god cannot appear to men is simply silly for it is limiting gods almighty power  he that made man and all heaven and earth cannot he show himself to man if he shall so please  to say that god will not appear to man because man is so insignificant and this earth such a paltry little speck in the heavens is to limit gods goodness nay it is to show that a man knows not what goodness means  what grace what virtue is there higher than condescension  then if god be as he is perfectly good must he not be perfectly condescendingready and willing to stoop to man and all the more ready and the more willing the more weak ignorant and sinful this man is  in fact the greater need man has of god the more certain is it that god will help him in that need  yes my friends the bible is the revelation of a god who condescends to men and therefore descends to men  and the more a mans reason is spiritually enlightened to know the meaning of goodness and holiness and justice and love the more simple reasonable and credible will it seem to him that god at first taught men in the days of their early ignorance by the only method by which as far as we can conceive he could have taught them about himself namely by appearing in visible shape or speaking with audible voice and just as reasonable and credible awful and unfathomable mystery though it is will be the greater news that that same lord at last so condescended to man that he was conceived by the holy ghost born of the virgin mary suffered under pontius pilate was crucified dead and buried and rose the third day and ascended into heaven  credible and reasonable not indeed to the natural man who looks only at nature which he can see and hear and handle but credible and reasonable enough to the spiritual man whose mind has been enlightened by the spirit of god to see that the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal even justice and love mercy and condescension the divine order and the kingdom of the living god  and now one word on a matter which is tormenting the minds of many just now  it is often said that all that i have been saying is contrary to science  that this science and understanding of the world around us which has improved so marvellously in our days proves that the apparitions and miracles spoken of in the bible cannot be true that god or the angels of god can never have walked with man in visible shape  now my friends i do not believe this  i believe the very contrary  i entreat you to set your minds at rest on this point and to believe what is certainly true there is nothing in this new science to contradict the good old creed that the lord god of old appeared to his human children  it would take too much time of course to give you my reasons for saying this  and i must therefore ask you to take on trust from me when i tell you solemnly and earnestly that there is nothing in modern science which can if rightly understood contradict the glorious words of st paul that god at sundry times and in divers manners spake to the fathers by the prophets and hath at last spoken unto us by a son whom he hath appointed heir of all things  by whom also he made the worlds who is the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholdeth all things by the word of his power  even jesus christ god blessed for ever  amen  what then shall we think of these things  shall we say how much better off were our forefathers than we  ah that we were not left to ourselves  ah that we lived in the good old times when god and his angels walked with men  my friends what says solomon the wiseinquire not why the former times were better than these for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this  it is very natural for us to think that we could become more easily good men more certain of going to heaven if we saw divine apparitions and heard divine voices  a very natural thought  but natural things are not always the best or wisest things  spiritual things are surely higher and deeper than natural things  it is natural to wish to see christ or some heavenly being with our natural eyes and senses  but it is spiritual and therefore better for our souls to be content to see him by faith with the spiritual eyes of our heart and mind to love him with all our heart and mind and soul to worship him to put our whole trust in him to call upon him to honour his holy name and his word and to serve him truly all the days of our life  natural indeed to wish that we were back again in the old times but we must recollect that these old times were not good times but bad times and for that very reason the lord took pity on them that they were times of darkness and therefore it was that the people who sat in great darkness and in the valley of the shadow of death were allowed to see a great light  and that after that the fulness of time the very time which the lord chose that he might be incarnate of the virgin mary and came down upon this earth in human form was not a good time  on the contrary the fulness of time 1863 years ago was the very wickedest most faithless most unjust time that the world had ever seena time of which st paul said that there were none who did good no not one that adders poison was under all lips and all feet swift to shed blood and that the way of peace none had known  better far better to live in times like these in which there is among christian nations at least no great darkness even though there be no great light times in which the knowledge of the true god and his son jesus christ is spreading slowly but surely over all the earth and with it the fruit of the knowledge of the lord justice mercy charity fellowfeeling and a desire to teach and improve all mankind such as the world never saw before  these are the fruits of the scriptures of the lord and the sacraments of the lord and of the holy spirit of the lord and if that holy spirit be in our hearts and we yield our hearts to his gracious motions and obey them then we are really nearer to the lord jesus christ than if we saw him as adam did with our bodily eyes and yet rebelled against him as adam did in our hearts and disobeyed him in our actions  of old the lord treated men as babes and showed himself to their bodily eyes that so they might learn that he was and that he was near them  but us he treats as grown men who know that he is and that he is with us to the end of the world  and if he treats us as men my friends let us behave ourselves like men and not like silly children who cannot be trusted by themselves for a moment lest they do wrong or come to harm  let us obey god not with eyeservice just as long as we fancy that his eye is on us but with the deeper more spiritual more honourable obedience of faith  let us obey him for obedience sake and honour him for very honours sake as the young emigrant in foreign lands obeys and honours the parents whom he will never see again on earth and let us look forward like him to the day when him whom we cannot see on earth we may perhaps be permitted to see in heaven as the reward and for what higher reward can man wishof faith and obedience    sermon iv  noahs flood    quinquagesima sunday  genesis ix 13  i do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth  we all know the history of noahs flood  what have we learnt from that history  what were we intended to learn from it  what thoughts should we have about it  there are many thoughts which we may have  we may think how the flood came to pass what means god used to make it rain forty days what is meant by breaking up the fountains of the great deep  we may calculate how large the ark was and whether the bible really means that it held all kinds of living things in the world or only those of noahs own country or the animals which had been tamed and made useful to man  we may read long arguments as to whether the flood spread over the whole world or only over the country where noah and the rest of the sons of adam then lived  we may puzzle ourselves concerning the rainbow of which the text speaks  how it was to be a sign of a covenant from god  whether man had ever seen a rainbow before  whether there had ever been rain before in noahs country or whether he did not live in that land of which the second chapter of genesis says that the lord had not caused it to rain upon the earth but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the face of the ground as it does still in that high land in the centre of asia in which old traditions put the garden of eden and from which as far as we yet know mankind came at the beginning  we may puzzle our minds with these and a hundred more curious questions as learned men have done in all ages  butshall we become really the wiser by so doing  more learned we may become but being learned and being wise are two different things  true wisdom is that which makes a man a better man  and will such puzzling questions and calculations as these settle them how we may make us better men  will they make us more honest and just more generous and loving more able to keep our tempers and control our appetites  i cannot see that  will it make us better men merely to know that there was once a flood of waters on the earth i cannot see that  if we look at the hills of sand and gravel round us a little common sense will show us that there have been many floods of waters on the earth long long before the one of which the bible speaks  but shall we be better men for knowing that either  i cannot see why we should  now the bible was sent to make us better men  how then will the history of the flood do that  easily enough my friends if we will listen to the bible and thinking less about the flood itself think more about him who so the bible tells us sent the flood  the bible i have told you is the revelation of the living lord god even jesus christ who in his turn reveals to us the father and what we have to think of is how does this story of the flood reveal unveil to us the living lord of the world and his living government thereof  let us look at the matter in that way instead of puzzling ourselves with questions of words and endless genealogies which minister strife  let us look at the matter in that way instead of like too many men now and too many men in all ages being so busy in picking to pieces the shell of the bible that we forget that the bible has any kernel and so let it slip through our hands  let us look at the matter in that way as a revelation of the living god and then we shall find the history of the flood full of godly doctrine and profitable for these times and for all times whatsoever  god sent a flood on the earth  true but the important matter is that god sent it  god set the rainbow in the cloud for a token  true but the important matter is that god set it there  important  yes  what more important than to know that the flood did not come of itself that the rainbow did not come of itself and therefore that no flood comes of itself no rainbow comes of itself nothing comes of itself but all comes straight and immediately from the one living lord god  a man may say but the flood must have been caused by clouds and rain and there must have been some special natural cause for their falling at that place and that time  what of that  or that the fountains of the great deep must have been broken up by natural earthquakes such as break up the crust of the earth now what of that  or that the rainbow must have been caused by the suns rays shining through raindrops at a certain angle as all rainbows are now what of that  very probably it was  but if not what of that what we ought to know and what we ought to care for is what the bible tells us without a doubt that however they came god sent them  however they were made god made them  their manner their place their time was appointed exactly by god for a moral purpose to do something for the immortal souls of men to punish sinners to preserve the righteous to teach noah and his children after him a moral lesson concerning righteousness and sin concerning the wrath of god against sin concerning god that he governs the world and all in it and does not leave the world or mankind to go on of themselves and by themselves  you see i trust what a message this was and is and ever will be for men what a message and good news it must have been especially for the heathen of old time  for what would the heathen what actually did the heathen think about such sights as a flood or a rainbow  they thought of course that some one sent the flood  common sense taught them that  but what kind of person must he be thought they who sent the flood  surely a very dark terrible angry god who was easily and suddenly provoked to drown their cattle and flood their lands  but the rainbow so bright and gay the sign of coming fine weather could not belong to the same god who made the flood  what the fancies of the heathen about the rainbow were matters little to us but they fancied at least that it belonged to some cheerful bright and kind god  and so with other things  whatever was bright and beautiful and wholesome in the world like the rainbow belonged to kind gods whatever was dark ugly and destroying like the flood belonged to angry gods  therefore those of the heathen who were religious never felt themselves safe  they were always afraid of having offended some god they knew not how always afraid of some god turning against them and bringing diseases against their bodies floods drought blight against their crops storms against their ships in revenge for some slight or neglect of theirs  and all the while they had no clear notion that these gods made the world they thought that the gods were parts of the world just as men are and that beyond the gods there was the some sort of fate or necessity which even gods must obey  do you not see now what a comfortwhat a spring of hope and courage and peace of mind and patient industryit must have been to the men of old time to be told by this story of the flood that the god who sends the flood sends the rainbow also  there are not two gods nor many gods but one god of whom are all things  light and darkness storm or sunshine barrenness or wealth come alike from him  diseases storm flood blight all these show that there is in god an awfulness a sternness an anger if need bea power of destroying his own work of altering his own order but sunshine fruitfulness peace and comfort all show that love and mercy beauty and order are just as much attributes of his essence as awfulness and anger  they tell us he is a god whose will is to love to bless to make his creatures happy if they will allow him  they tell us that his anger is not a capricious revengeful proud selfish anger such as that of the heathen gods  but that it is an orderly anger a just anger a loving anger and therefore an anger which in its wrath can remember mercy  out of gods wrath shineth love as the rainbow out of the storm if it repenteth him that he hath made man it is only because man is spoiling and ruining himself and wasting the gifts of the good world by his wickedness  if he see fit to destroy man out of the earth he will destroy none but those who deserve and need destroying  he will save those whom like noah he can trust to begin afresh and raise up a better race of men to do his work in the world  if god send a flood to destroy all living things any when or anywhere he will show by putting the rainbow in the cloud that floods and destruction and anger are not his rule that his rule is sunshine and peace and order that though he found it necessary once to curse the ground once to sweep away a wicked race of men yet that even that was if one dare use the words of god against his gracious will that his will was from the beginning peace on earth and not floods and good will to men and not destruction and that in his heart in the abyss of his essence and of which it is written that god is lovein his heart i say he said i will not again curse the ground any more for mans sake even though the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth neither will i again smite everything living as i have done  while the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest summer and winter and day and night shall not cease  this is the god which the book of genesis goes on revealing and unveiling to us more and morea god in whom men may trust  the heathen could not trust their gods  the bible tells men of a god whom they can trust  that is just the difference between the bible and all other books in the world  but what a difference difference enough to make us say sooner that every other book in the world were lost and the bible preserved than that we should lose the bible and with the bible lose faith in god  and now my friends what shall we learn from this  what shall we learn  have we not learnt enough already  if we have learnt something more of who god is if we have learnt that he is a god in whom we can trust through joy and sorrow through light and darkness through life and death have we not learnt enough for ourselves  yes if even those poor and weak words about god which i have just spoken could go home into all your hearts and take root and bear fruit there they would give you a peace of mind a comfort a courage among all the chances and changes of this mortal life and a hope for the life to come such as no other news which man can tell you will ever give  but there is one special lesson which we may learn from the history of the flood of which i may as well tell you at once  the bible account of the flood will teach us how to look at the many terrible accidents as we foolishly call them which happen still upon this earth  there are floods still here and there earthquakes fires fearful disasters like that great colliery disaster of last year which bring death misery and ruin to thousands  the bible tells us what to think of them when it tells us of the flood  do i mean that these disasters come as punishments to the people who are killed by them  that is exactly what i do not mean  it was true of the flood  it is true no doubt in many other cases  but our blessed lord has specially forbidden us to settle when it is true to say that any particular set of people are destroyed for their sins  forbidden us to say that the poor creatures who perish in this way are worse than their neighbours  thinkest thou he says that those galilaeans whose blood pilate mingled with their sacrifices were sinners above all the galilaeans  or those eighteen on whom the tower in siloam fell and killed them think you that they were sinners above all who dwelt in jerusalem  i tell you nay  judge not he says and ye shall not be judged and therefore we must not judge  we have no right to say for instance that the terrible earthquake in italy two years ago came as a punishment for the sins of the people  we have no right to say that the twenty or thirty thousand human beings with innocent children among them by hundreds who were crushed or swallowed up by that earthquake in a few hours were sinners above all that dwelt in italy  we must not say that for the lord god himself has forbidden it  but this we may say for god himself has said it in the bible that these earthquakes and all other disasters great or small do not come of themselvesdo not come by accident or chance or blind necessity but that he sends them and that they fulfil his will and word  he sends them and therefore they do not come in vain  they fulfil his will and his will is a good will  they carry out his purpose but his purpose is a gracious purpose  god may send them in anger but in his anger he remembers mercy and his very wrath to some is part and parcel of his love to the rest  therefore these disasters must be meant to do good and will do good to mankind they may be meant to teach men to warn them to make them more wise and prudent for the future more humble and aware of their own ignorance and weakness more mindful of the frailty of human life that remembering that in the midst of life we are in death they may seek the lord while he may be found and call upon him while he is near  they may be meant to do that and to do a thousand things more  for gods ways are not as our ways or his thoughts as our thoughts  his ways are unsearchable and his paths past finding out  who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him or even settle what the lord means by doing this or that  all we can say isand that is a truly blessed thing to be able to saythat floods and earthquakes fire and storms come from the lord whose name is love the same lord who walked with adam in the garden who brought the children of israel out of egypt who was born on earth of the virgin mary who shed his lifeblood for sinful man who wept over jerusalem even when he was about to destroy it so that not one stone was left on another and who when he looked on the poor little children of judaea untaught or mistaught enslaved by the romans and but too likely to perish or be carried away captive in the fearful war which was coming on their land said of them it is not the will of your father in heaven that one of these little ones shall perish  him at least we can trust in the dark and dreadful things of this world as well as in the bright and cheerful ones and say with job though he slay me yet will i trust in him  i have received good from the hands of the lord and shall i not receive evil    sermon v  abraham    first sunday in lent  genesis xvii  1 2  and when abram was ninety years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect  i have told you that the bible reveals that is unveils the lord god jesus christ our lord and through him god the father almighty i have tried to show you how the bible does so step by step  i go on to show you another step which the bible takes and which explains much that has gone before  from whom did moses and the holy men of old whom moses taught get their knowledge of god the true god  the answer seems to befrom abraham  god taught moses more much more than he taught abraham  it was moses who bade men call god jehovah the i am but who hundreds of years before taught them to call him the almighty god  the answer seems to be abraham  god we read appeared to abraham and said to him get thee out of thy country and from thy fathers house unto a land that i shall show thee and i will make of thee a great nation  and again the lord said to him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect and thou shalt be a father of many nations  and abraham believed god and it was counted to him for righteousness  and he was called the friend of god  but from what did abraham turn to worship the living god  from idols  we are not certain  there is little or no mention of idols in abrahams time  he worshipped more probably the host of heaven the sun and moon and stars  so say the old traditions of the arabs who are descended from abraham through ishmael and so it is most likely to have been  that was the temptation in the east you read again and again how his children the jews turned back from god to worship the host of heaven and that false worship seems to have crept in at some very early time  the sun you must remember and the moon are far more brilliant and powerful in the east than here their power of doing harm or good to human beings and to the crops of the land is far greater while the stars shine in the east with a brightness of which we here have no notion  we do not know in this cloudy climate what st paul calls the glory of the stars nor see how much one star differs from another star in glory and therefore here in the north we have never been tempted to worship them as the easterns were  the sun the moon the stars were the old gods of the east the elohim the high and mighty ones who ruled over men over their good and bad fortunes over the weather the cattle the crops sending burning drought pestilence sunstrokes and those moonstrokes which we never have here but of which the psalmist speaks when he says the sun shall not smite thee by day neither the moon by night  and them the old easterns worshipped in some wild confused way  but to abraham it was revealed that the sun the moon and the stars were not elohimthe high and mighty ones  that there was but one elohim one high and mighty one the almighty maker of them all  he did not learn that perhaps at once  indeed the bible tells us how god taught him step by step as he teaches all men and revealed himself to him again and again till he had taught abraham all that he was to know  but he did teach him this as a beautiful old story of the arabs sets forth  they say how whether before or after god called him we cannot tell abraham at night saw a star  and he said this is my lord  but when the star set he said i like not those who vanish away  and when he saw the moon rising he said this is my lord  but when the moon too set he said verily if my lord direct me not in the right way i shall be as one who goeth astray  but when he saw the sun rising he said this is my lord  this is greater than star or moon  but the sun went down likewise  then said abraham o my people i am clear of these things  i turn my face to him who hath made the heaven and the earth  and was this all that abraham believedthat the sun and moon and stars were not gods but that there was a god besides who had made them all  my friends there have been thousands and tens of thousands since i fear who have believed as much as that and yet who cannot call abraham their spiritual father who are not justified by faith with faithful abraham  for merely to believe that is a dead faith which will never be counted for righteousness because it will never make man a righteous man doing righteous and good deeds as abraham did  of abraham it is written that what he knew he did  that his faith wrought with his works  and by his works his faith was made perfect  that when he gained faith in god he went and acted on his faith  when god called him he went out not knowing whither he went  his faith is only shown by his works  because he believed in god he went and did things which he would not have done if he had not believed in god  of him it is written that he obeyed the voice of the lord and kept his charge his commandments his statutes and his laws  in a word he had not merely found out that there was one god but that that one god was a good god a god whom he must obey and obey by being a good man  therefore his faith was counted to him for righteousness because it was righteousness and made him do righteous deeds  he believed that god was helping him therefore he had no need to oppress or overreach any man  he believed that gods eye was on him therefore he dared not oppress or overreach any man  his faith in god made him brave  he went forth he knew not whither but he had put his trust in god and he did not fear  he and his three hundred slaves born in his house were not afraid to set out against the four arab kings who had just conquered the five kings of the vale of jordan and plundered the whole land  abraham and his little party of faithful slaves follow them for miles and fall on them and defeat them utterly setting the captives free and bringing back all the plunder and then in return for all that he has done abraham will take nothingnot even he says a thread or a shoelatchetlest men should say we have made abraham rich and why  because his faith in god made him highminded generous and courteous as when he bids lot go whither he will with his flocks and herds  let there be no strife i pray thee between thee and me  if thou wilt take the left hand i will go to the right  he is then as again with the king of sodom and with the three strangers at the tent door and with the children of heth when he is buying the cave of machpelah for a buryingplace for sarah always and everywhere the same courteous selfrestrained high bred highminded man  it has been said that true religion will make a man a more thorough gentleman than all the courts in europe  and it is true  you may see simple labouring men as thorough gentlemen as any duke simply because they have learned to fear god and fearing him to restrain themselves and to think of other people more than of themselves which is the very root and essence of all good breeding  and such a man was abraham of olda plain man dwelling in tents helping to tend his own cattle fetching in the calf from the field himself and dressing it for his guests with his own hand but still as the children of heth said of him a mighty princenot merely in wealth of flocks and herds but a prince in manners and a prince in heart  but faith in god did more for abraham than this  it made him a truly pious manit made him the friend of god  there were others in abrahams days who had some knowledge of the one true god  lot his nephew abimelech aner eshcol mamre and others seem to have known whom abraham meant when he spoke of the almighty god  but of abraham alone it is said that he believed god that he trusted in god and rested on him was built up on god rested on god as a child in the mothers armsfor this we are told is the full meaning of the word in the bibleand looked to god as his shield and his exceeding great reward  he trusted in god utterly and it was counted to him for righteousness  and of abraham alone it is said that he was the friend of god that god spoke with him and he with god  he first of all men of whom we read at least since the time of adam knew what communion with god meant knew that god spoke to him as a friend a benefactor a preserver who was teaching and training him with a fathers love and care and felt that he in return could answer god could open his heart to him tell him not only of his wants but of his doubts and fears  yes we may almost say on the strength of the bible that abraham was the first human being as far as we know who prayed with his heart and soul who knew what true prayer meansthe prayer of the heart by which man draws near to god and finds that god is near to him  thisthis communion with god is the especial glory of abrahams character  this it is which has given him his name through all generations the friend of god  or as his descendants the arabs call him to this day simply the friend  this it is which gained him the name of the father of the faithful the father of all who believe whether they be descended from him or whether they be like us of a different nation  this it is which has made a wise man say of abraham that if we will consider what he knew and did and in what a dark age he lived we shall see that abraham may be unless we except moses the greatest of mere human beingsthat the human race may owe more to him than to any mortal man  but why need we learn from abraham we who being christians know and believe the true faith so much more clearly than abraham could do  ah my friends it is easier to know than to believe and easier to know than to do  easier to talk of abrahams faith than to have abrahams faith  easier to preach learned and orthodox sermons about how abraham was justified by his faith than to be justified ourselves by our own faith  and say not in your hearts it was easy for abraham to believe god i should have believed of course in his place  if god spoke to me of course i should obey him  my friends there is no greater and no easier mistake  god has spoken to many a man who has not believed him neither obeyed him and so he may to you  god spoke to abraham and he believed him and obeyed him  and why  because there was in abrahams heart something which there is not in all mens heartssomething which answered to gods call and made him certain that the call was from godeven the holy spirit of god  so god may call you and you may obey him if only the spirit of god be in you but not else  may call you did i say  god does call you and me does speak to us does command us far more clearly than he did abraham  we know the mystery of christ which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit  god who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke to the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken to us by his son jesus christ our lord and told us our duty and the reward which doing our duty will surely bring far more clearly than ever he did to abraham  but do we listen to him  do we say with abraham o my people i am clear of all these things which rise and set which are born and die which begin and end in time and turn my face to him that made heaven and earth  if so how is it that we see people everywhere worshipping not idols of wood and stone but other things all manner of things beside god and saying these are my elohim these are the high and mighty ones whom i must obey  these are the strong things on which depend my fortune and my happiness  i must obey them first and let plain doing right and avoiding wrong come after as it can  one worships the laws of trade and says i know this and that is hardly right but it is in the way of business and therefore i must do it  one worships public opinion and follows after the multitude to do evil doing what he knows is wrong simply because others do it and it is the way of the world  one worships the interest of his party whether in religion or in politics and does for their sake mean and false cruel and unjust things which he would not do for his own private interest  too many even in a free country worship great people and put their trust in princes saying i am sorry to have to do this  i know it is rather mean but i must or i shall lose such and such a great mans interest and favour  or i know i cannot afford this expense but if i do not i shall not get into good society and this person and that will not ask me to his house  all meanwhile except a few rich or poor worship money and believe more or less in spite of the lords solemn warning to the contrary that a mans life does consist in the abundance of the things which he possesses  these are the elohim of this world the high and mighty things to which men turn for help instead of to the living god who was before all things and will be after them and behold they vanish away and where then are those that have put their trust in them  but blessed is he whose trust is in god the almighty and whose hope is in the lord jehovah the eternal i am  blessed is he who like faithful abraham says to his family my people i am clear of all these things  i turn my face from them to him who hath made earth and heaven  i go through this world like abraham not knowing whither i go but like abraham i fear not for i go whither god sends me  i rest on god he is my defence and my exceeding great reward  to have known him loved him obeyed him is reward enough even if i do not as the world would say succeed in life therefore i long not for power and honour riches and pleasure  i am content to do my duty faithfully in that station of life to which god has called me and to be forgiven for all my failings and shortcomings for the sake of jesus christ our lord and that is enough for me for i believe in my father in heaven and believe that he knows best for me and for my children  he has not promised me as he promised abraham to make of me a great nation but he has promised that the righteous man shall never be deserted or his children beg their bread  he has promised to keep his covenant and mercy to a thousand generations with those who keep his commandments and do them and that is enough for me  in god have i put my trust and i will not fear what man or earth or heaven or any created thing can do unto me  blessed is that man whether he inherit honourably great estates from his ancestors or whether he make honourably great wealth and station for himself whether he spend his life quietly and honestly in the country farm or in the village shop or whether he simply earn his bread from week to week by plough and spade  blessed is he and blessed are his children after him  for he is a son of abraham and of him god hath said as of abraham i know him that he will command his children and household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring on him the blessing which he has spoken  yes blessed is that man  he has chosen his share of abrahams faith and he and his children after him shall have their share of abrahams blessing    sermon vi  jacob and esau    second sunday in lent  genesis xxv 2934  and jacob sod pottage  and esau came from the field and he was faint  and esau said to jacob feed me i pray thee with that same red pottage for i am faint  therefore was his name called edom  and jacob said sell me this day thy birthright and esau said behold i am at the point to die  and what profit shall this birthright do to me  and jacob said swear to me this day and he sware unto him  and he sold his birthright unto jacob then jacob gave esau bread and pottage of lentiles and he did eat and drink and rose up and went his way  thus esau despised his birthright  i have been telling you of late that the bible is the revelation of god  but how does the story of jacob and esau reveal god to us what further lesson concerning god do we learn therefrom  i think that if we will take the story simply as it stands we shall see easily enough  for it is all simple and natural enough  jacob and esau we shall see were men of like passions with ourselves men as we are mixed up of good and evil sometimes right and sometimes wrong  and god rewarded them when they did right and punished them when they did wrong just as he does with us now  they were men though of very different characters  we may see men like them now every day round us  esau we read was a huntera man of the field a bold fierce active man generous brave and kindhearted as the end of his story shows  but with just the faults which such a man would have  he was hasty reckless and fond of pleasure passionate too and violent  have we not seen just such men again and again and liked them for what was good in them and been sorry too that they were not more sober and reasonable and true to themselves  jacob was the very opposite kind of man  he was a plain manwhat we call a still solid prudent quiet manand a dweller in tents he lived peaceably looking after his fathers flocks and herds while esau liked better the sport and danger of hunting wild beasts and bringing home venison to his father  now jacob we see was of course a more thoughtful man than esau he kept more quiet and so had more time to think  and he had plainly thought a great deal over gods promise to his grandfather abraham  he believed that god had promised abraham that he would make his seed as the sand of the sea for multitude and give them that fair land of canaan and that in his seed all the families of the earth should be blessed and that seemed to him and rightly a very grand and noble thing  and he set his heart on getting that blessing for himself and supplanting his elder brother esau and being the heir of the promises in his stead  wellthat was mean and base and selfish perhaps  but there is somewhat of an excuse for jacobs conduct in the fact that he and esau were twins that in one sense neither of them was older than the other  and you must recollect that it was not at all a regular custom in the east for the eldest son to be his fathers heir as it is in england  you find that few or none of the great kings of the jews were eldest sons  the custom was not kept up as it is here  so jacob may have said to himself and not have been very wrong in saying it  i have as good a right to the birthright as esau  my father loves him best because he brings him in venison but i know the value of the honour which is before my family  surely the one of us who cares most about the birthright will be most fit to have it and ought to have it and esau cares nothing for it while i do  so jacob in his cunning bargaining way took advantage of his brothers weak hasty temper and bought his birthright of him as the text tells  that story shows us what sort of a man esau was  hasty careless fond of the good things of this life  he had no reason to complain if he lost his birthright  he did not care for it and so he had thrown it away  perhaps he forgot what he had done but his sin found him out as our sins are sure to find each of us out  the day came when he wanted his birthright and could not have it and found no place for repentancethat is no chance of undoing what he had donethough he sought it carefully with tears  he had sown and he must reap he had made his bed and he must lie on it  and so must jacob in his turn  now this i think is just what the story teaches us concerning god god chooses abrahams family to grow into a great nation and to be a peculiar people  the next question will be  if god favours that family will he do unjust things to help themwill he let them do unjust things to help themselves  the bible answers positively no god will not be unjust or arbitrary in choosing one man and rejecting another  if he chooses jacob it is because jacob is fit for the work which god wants done  if he rejects esau it is because esau is not fit  it is natural i know to pity poor esau but one has no right to do more  one has no right to fancy for a moment that god was arbitrary or hard upon him  esau is not the sort of man to be the father of a great nation or of anything else great  greedy passionate reckless people like him without due feeling of religion or of the unseen world are not the men to govern the world or help it forward or be of use to mankind or train up their families in justice and wisdom and piety  if there had been no people in the world but people like esau we should be savages at this day without religion or civilization of any kind  they are of the earth earthy dust they are and unto dust they will return  it is men like jacob whom god choosesmen who have a feeling of religion and the unseen world men who can look forward and live by faith and form plans for the futureand carry them out too against disappointment and difficulty till they succeed  look at one side of jacobs characterhis perseverance  he serves seven years for rachel because he loves her  then when he is cheated and leah given him instead he serves seven years more for racheland they seemed to him a short time for the love he bore to her and then he serves seven years more for the flocks and herds  a slave or little better than a slave of his own free will for oneandtwenty years to get what he wanted  those are the men whom god uses and whom god prospers  men with deep hearts and strong wills who set their minds on something which they cannot see and work steadfastly for it till they get it for god gives it to them in good timewhen patience has had her perfect work upon their characters and made them fit for success  esau we find got some blessingthe sort of blessing he was fit for  he loved his father and he was rewarded  and isaac his father answered and said unto him behold thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth and of the dew of heaven from above and by thy sword shalt thou live and shalt serve thy brother and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck  he was a brave generoushearted man in spite of his faults  he was to live the free hunters life which he loved and we find that he soon became the head of a wild powerful tribe and his sons after him  dukes of edom they were called for several generations but they never rose to any solid and lasting power they never became a great nation as jacobs children did  they were just what one would expectwild unruly violent people  they have long since perished utterly off the face of the earth  and what did jacob get who so meanly bought the birthright and cheated his father out of the blessing  trouble in the flesh vanity and vexation of spirit  he had to flee from his fathers house never to see his mother again to wander over the deserts to kinsmen who cheated him as he had cheated others to serve laban for twentyone years to crouch miserably in fear and trembling as a petitioner for his life before esau whom he had wronged and to be made more ashamed than ever by finding that generous esau had forgiven and forgotten all  then to see his daughter brought to shame his sons murderers plotting against their own brother his favourite son to see his grey hairs going down with sorrow to the grave to confess to pharaoh after one hundred and twenty years of life that few and evil had been the days of his pilgrimage  then did his faith in god win no reward  not so  that was his reward to be chastened and punished till his meanness was purged out of him  he had taken god for his guide and god did guide him accordingly though along a very different path from what he expected  god accepted his faith delivered his soul gave him rest and peace at last in his old age in egypt let him find his son joseph again in power and honour  but all along god punished his own inventionsas he will punish yours and mine my friends all the while that he may be accepting our faith and delivering our souls because we trust in him  so god rewarded jacob by giving him more light  by not leaving him to himself and his own darkness and meanness but opening his eyes to understand the wondrous things of gods law and showing him how gods law is everlasting righteous not to be escaped by any man how every action brings forth its appointed fruit how those who sow the wind will reap the whirlwind jacobs first notion was like the notion of the heathen in all times my god has a special favour for me therefore i may do what i like  he will prosper me in doing wrong he will help me to cheat my father  but god showed him that that was just not what he would do for him  he would help and protect him but only while he was doing right  god would not alter his moral laws for him or any man god would be just and righteous and jacob must be so likewise till he learnt to trust not merely in a god who happened to have a special favour to him but in the righteous god who loves justice and wishes to make men righteous even as he is righteous and will make them righteous if they trust in him  that was the reward of jacobs faiththe best reward which any man can have  he was taught to know god whom truly to know is everlasting life  and this it seems to me is the great revelation concerning god which we learn from the history of jacob and esau that god how much soever favour he may show to certain persons is still essentially and always a just god  and now my friends if any of you are tempted to follow jacobs example take warning betimes  you will be tempted  there are men among youthere are in every congregationwho are like jacob sober industrious careful prudent men and fairly religious too men who have the good sense to see that solomons proverbs are true and that the way to wealth and prosperity is to fear god and keep his commandments  may you prosper may gods blessing be upon your labour may you succeed in life and see your children well settled and thriving round you and go down to the grave in peace  but never forget my good friends that you will be tempted as jacob wasto be dishonest  i cannot tell why but professedly religious men in all countries in all religions are and always have been tempted in that wayto be mean and cunning and false at times  it is so and there is no denying it  when all other sins are shut out from them by their religious profession and their care for their own character and their fear of hell the sin of lying for some strange reason is left open to them and to it they are tempted to give way  for gods sakefor the sake of christ who was full of grace and truthfor your own sakesstruggle against that  unless you wish to say at last with poor old jacob few and evil have been the days of my pilgrimage struggle against that  if you fear god and believe that he is with you god will prosper your plans and labour but never make that an excuse for saying in your hearts like jacob god intends that i should have these good things therefore i may take them for myself by unfair means  the birthright is yours  it is you the steady prudent godfearing ones who will prosper on the earth and not poor wild hotheaded esau  but do not make that an excuse for robbing and cheating esau because he is not as thoughtful as you are  the lord made him as well as you and died for him as well as for you and wills his salvation as well as yours and if you cheat him the lord will avenge him speedily  if you give way to meanness covetousness falsehood as jacob did you will rue it the lord will enter into judgment with you quickly and all the more quickly because he loves you  because there is some right in youbecause you are on the whole on the right roadthe lord will visit you with disappointment and affliction and make your own sins your punishment  if you deceive other people other people shall deceive you as they did jacob  if you lay traps you shall fall into them yourselves as jacob did  if you fancy that because you trust in god god will overlook any sin in you as jacob did you shall see as jacob did that your sin shall surely find you out  the lord will be more sharp and severe with you than with esau  and why  because he has given you more and requires more of you and therefore he will chastise you and sift you like wheat till he has parted the wheat from the tares  the wheat is your faith your belief that if you trust in god he will prosper you body and soul  that is gods good seed which he has sown in you  the tares are your fancies that you may do wrong and mean things to help yourselves because god has an especial favour for you  that is the devils sowing which god will burn out of you by the fire of affliction as he did out of jacob and keep your faith safe as good seed in his garner for the use of your children after you that you may teach them to walk in gods commandments and serve him in spirit and in truth  for god is a god of truth and no liar shall stand in his sight let him be never so religious he requires truth in the inward parts and truth he will have and whom he loves he will chasten as he chastened jacob of old till he has made him understand that honesty is the best policy and that whatever false prophets may tell you there is not one law for the believer and another for the unbeliever but whatsoever a man sows that shall he reap and receive the due reward of the deeds done in the body whether they be good or evil    sermon vii  joseph    preached on the sunday before the wedding of the prince of wales march 8th third sunday in lent  genesis xxxix 9  how can i do this great wickedness and sin against god  the story of joseph is one which will go home to all healthy hearts every child can understand every child can feel with it  it is a story for all men and all times  even if it had not been true and not real fact but a romance of mans invention it would have been loved and admired by men far more then when we know that it is true that it actually did so happen that is part and parcel of the holy scriptures  we all surely know the storyhow josephs brethren envy him and sell him for a slave into egypthow there for a while he prospers how his masters wife tempts himhow he is thrown into prison on her slanderhow there again he prospershow he explains the dreams of pharaohs servantshow he lies long forgotten in the prisonhow at last pharaoh sends for him to interpret a dream for him and how he rises to power and great gloryhow his brothers come down to egypt to buy corn and how they find him lord of all the landhow subtilly he tries them to see if they have repented of their old sinhow his heart yearns over them in spite of all their wickedness to himhow at last he reveals himself and forgives them utterly and sends for his poor old father jacob down into egypt  whosoever does not delight in that story simply as a story whenever he hears it read cannot have a wholesome human heart in him  but why was this story of joseph put into holy scripture and at such length too  it seems at first sight to be simply a family historythe story of brothers and their father it seems at first sight to teach us nothing concerning our redemption and salvation it seems at first sight not to reveal anything fresh to us concerning god it seems at first sight not to be needed for the general plan of the bible history  it tells us of course how the israelites first came into egypt and that was necessary for us to know  but the bible might have told us that in ten verses  why has it spent upon the story of joseph and his brethren not ten verses but ten chapters  now we have a right to ask such questions as these if we do not ask them out of any carping faultfinding spirit trying to pick holes in the bible from which god defend us and all christian men  if we ask such questions in faith and reverencethat is believing and taking for granted that the bible is right and respecting it as the book of books in which our own forefathers and all christian nations upon earth for many ages have found all things necessary for their salvationif i say we question over the bible in that childlike simple respectful spirit which is the true spirit of wisdom and understanding by which our eyes will be truly opened to see the wondrous things of gods law  then we may not only seek as our lord bade us but we shall find as our lord prophesied that we should  we shall find some good reason for this story of joseph being so long and find that the story of joseph like all the rest of the bible reveals a new lesson to us concerning god and the character of god  i said that the story of joseph looks at first sight to be merely a family history  but suppose that that were the very reason why it is in the bible because it is a family history  suppose that families were very sacred things in the eyes of god  that the ties of husband and wife parent and child brother and sister were appointed not by man but by god  then would not josephs story be worthy of being in the bible  would it not as i said it would reveal something fresh to us concerning god and the character of god  consider now my friends  is it not one great differenceone of the very greatestbetween men and beasts that men live in families and beasts do not  that men have the sacred family feeling and beasts have not  they have the beginnings of it no doubt  the mother among beasts feels love to her children but only for a while  god has implanted in her something of that deepest holiest purest of all feelingsa mothers love  but as soon as her young ones are able to take care of themselves they are nothing to heramong the lower animals less than nothing  the fish or the crocodile will take care of her eggs jealously and as soon as they are hatched turn round and devour her own young  the feeling of a father to his child again you find is fainter still among beasts  the father as you all know not only cares little for his offspring even if he sometimes helps to feed them at first but is often jealous of them hates them will try to kill them when they grow up  husband and wife again  there is no sacredness between them among dumb animals  a lasting and an unselfish attachment not merely in youth but through old age and beyond the gravewhat is there like this among the animals except in the case of certain birds like the dove and the eagle who keep the same mate year after year and have been always looked on with a sort of affection and respect by men for that very reason  but where among beasts do you ever find any trace of those two sacred human feelingsthe love of brother to brother or of child to father  where do you find the notion that the tie between husband and wife is a sacred thing to be broken at no temptation but in man  these are the feelings which man has alone of all living animals  these then remember are the very family feelings which come out in the story of joseph  he honours holy wedlock when he tells his masters wife how can i do this great wickedness and sin against god  he honours his father when he is not ashamed of him wild shepherd out of the desert though he might be and an abomination to the egyptians while he himself is now in power and wealth and glory as a prince in a civilized country  he honours the tie of brother to brother by forgiving and weeping over the very brothers who have sold him into slavery  but what has all this to do with god  now man as we know is an animal with an immortal spirit in him he has as st paul so carefully explains to us a flesh and a spirita flesh like the beasts which perish a spirit which comes from god  now the bible teaches us that man did not get these family feelings from his flesh from the animal brute part of him  they are not carnal but spiritual  he gets them from his spirit and they are inspired into him by the spirit of god  they come not from the earth below but from the heaven above from the image of god in which man alone of all living things was made  for if it were not so we should surely see some family feeling in the beasts which are most like men  but we do not  in the apes which are in their shape and fleshly nature so strangely and shockingly like human beings there is not as much family feeling as there is in many birds or even insects  nay the wild negroes among whom they live hold them in abhorrence and believe that they were once men like themselves who were gradually changed into brute beasts by giving way to detestable sins while these very negroes themselves heathens and savages as they are have the family feelingthe feeling of husband for wife father for child brother for brother not indeed as strongly and purely as we or at least those of us who are really christian and civilized but still they have it and that makes between the lowest man and the highest brute a difference which i hold is as wide as the space between heaven and earth  it is man alone i say who has the idea of family and who has too the strange but most true belief that these family ties are appointed by godthat they are a part of his religionthat in breaking them by being an unfaithful husband a dishonest servant an unnatural son a selfish brother he sins not only against man and mans order and laws but against god  parent and child brother and sisterthose ties are not of the earth earthy but of the heaven of god eternal  they may begin in time of what happened before we came into this world we know nought  but having begun they cannot end  of what will happen after we leave this world that at least we know in part  parent and child brother and sister husband and wife likewise these are no ties of mans invention  they are ties of gods binding they are patterns and likenesses of his substance and of his being  of the eternal father who says for ever to the eternal son this day have i begotten thee  of the son who says for ever to the father i come to do thy will o god  of the son of god jesus christ who is not ashamed to call us his brethren but like a greater joseph was sent before by god to save our lives with a great deliverance when our forefathers were but savages and heathens  husband and wife likewiseare not they two divine words not human words at all  has not god consecrated the state of matrimony to such an excellent mystery that in it is signified and represented the mystical union between christ and his church  are not husbands to love their wives and give themselves for them as christ loved the church and gave himself for it  that indeed was not revealed in the old testament but it is revealed in the new and marriage like all other human ties is holy and divine and comes from god down to men  yes  these family ties are of god  it was to show us how sacred how godlike they arehow eternal and necessary for all mankind that josephs story was written in holy scripture  they are of god i say  and he who despises them despises not man but god who hath also given us his holy spirit to make us know how sacred these bonds are  he who looks lightly on the love of child to parent or brother to brother or husband to wife and bids each man please himself each man help himself and shift for himself would take away from men the very thing which raises them above the beasts which perish and lower them again to the likeness of the flesh that they may of the flesh reap corruption  they who under whatever pretence of religion part asunder families or tell children like the wicked pharisees of old that they may say to their parents corbani have given to god the service and help which as your child i should have given to youshall be called if not by men at least by god himself hypocrites who draw near to god with their mouths and honour him with their lips while their heart is far from him  i think now we may see that i was right when i saidperhaps the history of joseph is in the bible because it is a family history for see it is the history of a man who loved his family who felt that family life was holy and godappointed whom god rewarded with honour and wealth because he honoured family ties because he refused his masters wife because he rewarded his brothers good for evil because he was not ashamed of his father but succoured him in his old age  it is the history of a man whomore than four hundred years before god gave the ten commandments on sinai saying  honour thy father and mother  thou shalt not commit adultery  thou shalt not kill in revenge  thou shalt not covet aught of thy neighboursit is the history i say of a man who had those laws of god written in his heart by the holy spirit of god and felt that to break them was to sin against god  it is the history of a man who sorely tempted and unjustly persecuted kept himself pure and true who while all around him beginning with his own brothers were trampling under foot the laws of family felt that the laws were still there round him girding him in with everlasting bands and saying to him thou shalt and thou shalt not that he was not sent into the world to do just what was pleasant for the moment to indulge his own passions or his own revenge but that if he was indeed a man he must prove himself a man by obeying almighty god  it is the history of a man who kept his heart pure and tender and who thereby gained strange and deep wisdom that wisdom which comes only to the pure in heart that wisdom by which truly good men are enabled to see farther and to be of more use to their fellowcreatures than many a cunning and crooked politician whose eyes are blinded because his heart is defiled with sin  and now my friends if we prayas we are bound to prayfor that great prince who is just entering on the cares and the duties as well as the joys and blessings of family lifewhat better prayer can we offer up for him than that god would put into his heart that spirit which he put into the heart of joseph of oldthe spirit to see how divine and godappointed is family life  god grant that that spirit may dwell in him and possess him more and more day by day  that it may keep him true to his wife true to his mother true to his family true like joseph to all with whom he has to deal  that it may deliver him as it delivered joseph from the snares of wicked women from selfish politicians if they ever try to sow distrust and opposition between him and his kindred and from all those temptations which can only be kept down by the spirit of god working in mens hearts as he worked in the heart of joseph  for if that spirit be in the princeand i doubt not that that spirit is in him alreadythen will his fate be that of joseph then will he indeed be a blessing to us and to our children after us then will he have riches more real and power more vast than any which our english laws can give then will he gain like joseph that moral wisdom better than all worldly craft which cometh from abovefirst pure then gentle easy to be entreated without partiality and without hypocrisy then will he be able like joseph to deliver his people in times of perplexity and distress then will he by his example as his noble mother has done before him keep healthy pure and strong our english family lifeand as long as that endures old england will endure likewise    sermon viii  the bible the great civilizer    fourth sunday in lent  philippians iv 8  finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things  it may not be easy to see what this text has to do with the story of joseph which we have just been reading or with the meaning of the bible of which i have been speaking to you of late  nevertheless i think it has to do with them as you will see if you will look at the text with me  now the text does not say do these things  it only says think of these things  of course st paul wished us to do them also but he says first think of them not once in a way but often and continually  fill your mind with good and pure and noble thoughts and then you will do good and pure and noble things  for out of the abundance of a mans heart not only does his mouth speak but his whole body and soul behave  the man whose mind is filled with low and bad thoughts will be sure when he is tempted to do low and bad things  the man whose mind is filled with lofty and good thoughts will do lofty and good things  for thoughts are the food of a mans mind and as the mind feeds so will it grow  if it feeds on coarse and foul food coarse and foul it will grow  if it feeds on pure and refined food pure and refined it will grow  there are those who do not believe this  provided they are tolerably attentive to the duties of religion it does not matter much they fancy what they think of out of church  their souls will be saved at last they suppose and that is all that they need care for  saved  they do not see that by giving way to foul mean foolish thoughts all the week they are losing their souls destroying their souls defiling their souls lowering their souls and making them so coarse and mean and poor that they are not worth saving and are no loss to heaven or earth whatever loss they may be to the man himself  one man thinks of nothing but moneyhow he shall save a penny here and a penny there  i do not mean men of business for them there are great excuses for it is by continual saving here and there that their profits are made  i speak rather of people who have no excuse people of fixed incomespeople often wealthy and comfortable who yet will lower their minds by continually thinking over their money  but this i say and this i am sure that you will find that when a man in business or out of business accustoms himself as very many do to think of nothing but money money money from monday morning to saturday night he thinks of money a great part of sunday likewise  and so after a while the man lowers his soul and makes it mean and covetous  he forgets all that is lovely and of good report  he forgets virtuethat is manliness and praisethat is the just respect and admiration of his fellowmen and so he forgets at last things true honest and just likewise  he lowers his soul and therefore when he is tempted he does things mean and false and unjust for the sake of money which he has made his idol  take another case too common among men and women of all ranks high and low  how many there are who love gossip and scandal who always talk about people and never about thingscertainly not about things pure and lovely and of good report but rather about things foul and ugly and of bad report who do not talk because they do not think of virtue but of vice or of praise either because they are always finding fault with their neighbours  the man who loves a foul story or a coarse jestthe woman who gossips over every tittle tattle of scandal which she can pick up against her neighbourwhat do these people do but defile their own souls afresh after they have been washed clean in the blood of christ  foul their souls are and therefore their thoughts are foul likewise and the foulness of them is evident to all men by their tongues  out of their hearts proceed evil thoughts about their neighbours out of the abundance of their hearts their mouths speak them  now let such people if there be any such here seriously consider the harm which they are doing to their own characters  they may give way to the habits of scandal or of coarse talk without any serious bad intention but they will surely lower their own souls thereby  they will grow to the colour of what they feed on and become foul and cruel from talking cruelly and foully till they lose all purity and all charity all faith and trust in their fellowmen all power of seeing good in any one or doing anything but think evil and so lose the likeness of god and of christ for the likeness of some foul carrion bird which cares nothing for the perfume of all the roses in the world but if there be a carcase within miles of it will scent it out eagerly and fly to it ravenously  the truth is my friends that these souls of ours instead of being pure and strong are the very opposite and the article speaks plain truth when it says that we are every one of us of our own nature inclined to evil  that may seem a hard saying but if we look at our own thoughts we shall find it true  are we not inclined to take at first the worst view of everybody and of everything  are we not inclined to suspect harm of this person and of that  are we not inclined too often to be mean and cowardly to be hard and covetous to be coarse and vulgar to be silly and frivolous  do we not need to cool down to think a second time and a third time likewise to remember our duty to remember christs example before we can take a just and kind and charitable view  do we not want all the help which we can get from every quarter to keep ourselves highminded and refined to keep ourselves from bad thoughts mean thoughts silly thoughts violent thoughts cruel and hard thoughts if we have not found out that we must have looked a very little way into ourselves and know little more about ourselves than a dumb animal does of itself  how then shall we keep off coarseness of soul  how shall we keep our souls refined that is true and honest pure amiable full of virtue that is true manliness and deserve praise that is the respect and admiration of our fellowmen  by thinking of those very things says st paul  and in order to be able to think of them by reading of them  there are very few who can easily think of these things of themselves  their daily business the words and notions of the people with whom they have to do will run in their minds and draw them off from higher and better thoughts that cannot be helped the only thing that most men can do is to take care that they are not drawn off entirely from high and good thoughts by reading were it but for five minutes every day something really worth thinking of something which will lift them above themselves  above all it is wise at night after the care and bustle of the day is over to read but for a few minutes some book which will compose and soothe the mind which will bring us face to face with the true facts of life death and eternity which will make us remember that man doth not live by bread alone which will give us before we sleep a few thoughts worthy of a christian man with an immortal soul in him  and thank god no one need go far to look for such books  i do not mean merely religious books excellent as they are in these days  i mean any books which help to make us better and wiser and soberer and more charitable persons any books which will teach us to despise what is vulgar and mean foul and cruel and to love what is noble and highminded pure and just  we need not go far for them in our own noble english language we may read by hundreds books which will tell us of all virtue and of all praise  the stories of good and brave men and women of gallant and heroic actions of deeds which we ourselves should be proud of doing of persons whom we feel to be better wiser nobler than we are ourselves  in our own language we may read the history of our own nation and whatsoever is just honest and true  we may read of gods gracious providences toward this land  how he has punished our sins and rewarded our right and brave endeavours  how he put into our forefathers the spirit of courage and freedom the spirit of truth and justice the spirit of loyalty and order and how following the leading of that spirit in spite of many mistakes and failings we have risen to be the freest the happiest the most powerful people on earth a blessing and not a curse to the nations around  in our own english tongue too we may read such poetry as there is in no other language in the world poetry which will make us indeed see the beauty of whatsoever things are lovely and of good report some people have still a dislike of what they call foolish poetry books  if books are foolish let us have nothing to do with them but poetry ought not to be foolish for god sent it into the world to teach men not foolishness but the highest wisdom  he gave man alone of all living creatures the power of writing poetry that by poetry he might understand not only how necessary it was to do right but how beautiful and noble it was to do right  he sent it into the world to soften mens rough hearts and quiet their angry passions and make them love all which is tender and gentle loving and merciful and yet to rouse them up to love all which is gallant and honourable loyal and patriotic devout and heavenly  therefore whole books of the biblejob for example isaiah and the psalms are neither more nor less than actual poetry written in actual verse that their words might the better sink down into the ears and hearts of the old jews and of us christians after them  and therefore also we keep up still the good old custom of teaching children in school as much as possible by poetry that they may learn not only to know but to love and remember whatsoever things are lovely and of good report  lastly for those who cannot read or have really no time to read there is one means left of putting themselves in mind of what every one must remember lest he sink back into an animal and a savage  i mean by pictures which as st augustine said 1400 years ago are the books of the unlearned  i do not mean grand and expensive pictures i mean the very simplest prints provided they represent something holy or noble or tender or lovely  a few such prints upon a cottagewall may teach the people who live therein much without their being aware of it  they see the prints even when they are not thinking of them and so they have before their eyes a continual remembrancer of something better and more beautiful than what they are apt to find in their own daily life and thoughts  true to whom little is given of them is little required  but it must be said that morefar moreis given to labouring men and women now than was given to their forefathers  a hundred or even fifty years ago when there was very little schooling when the books which were put even into the hands of noblemens children were far below what you will find now in any village school when the only pictures which a poor woman could buy to lay on her cottage wall were equally silly and ugly  then there were great excuses for the poor if they forgot whatsoever things were lovely and of good report if they were often coarse and brutal in their manners and cruel and profligate in their amusements  but even in the rough old times there always were a few at least men and women who were above the rest who though poor people like the rest were still true gentlemen and ladies of gods making people who kept themselves more or less unspotted from the world who thought of what was honest and pure and lovely and of good report and who lived a life of simple manful christian virtue and received the praise and respect of their neighbours even although their neighbours did not copy them  there were always such people and there always will bethank god for it for they are the salt of the earth  but why have there always been such people and why do i say confidently that there always will be  because they have had the bible and because once having got the bible in a free country no man can take it from them  the bible it is which has made gentlemen and ladies of many a poor man and woman  the bible it is which has filled their minds with pure and noble ay with heavenly and divine thoughts  the bible has been their whole library  the bible has been their only counsellor  the bible has taught them all they know  but it has taught them enough  it has taught them what god is and what christ is  it has taught them what man is and what a christian man should be  it has taught them what a family means and what a nation means  it has taught them the meaning of law and duty of loyalty and patriotism  it has filled their minds with things honest and just and lovely and of good report with the histories of men and women like themselves who sinned and sorrowed and struggled like them in this hard battle of life but who conquered at last by trusting and obeying god  this one story of joseph which we have been reading again this sunday i do not doubt that it has taught thousands who had no other storybook to readwho could not even read themselves but had to listen to others reading that it has taught them to be good sons to be good brothers that it has taught them to keep pure in temptation and patient and honest under oppression and wrong that it has stirred in them a noble ambition to raise themselves in life and taught them at the same time that the only safe and sure way of rising is to fear god and keep his commandments and so has really done more to civilize and refine themto make them truly civilized men and gentlemen and not vulgar savagesthan if they had known a smattering of a dozen sciences  i say that the bible is the book which civilizes and refines and ennobles rich and poor high and low and has been doing so for fifteen hundred years and that any man who tries to shake our faith in the bible is doing what he canthough thank god he will not succeedto make such rough and coarse heathens of us again as our forefathers were five hundred years ago  and i tell you labouring people that if you want something which will make up to you for the want of all the advantages which the rich havego to your bibles and you will find it there  there you will find in the history of men like ourselvesand above all in the history of a man unlike ourselves the perfect manperfect man and perfect god togetherwhatsoever is true whatsoever is honest just pure lovely and of good report every virtue and every just cause of praise which mortal man can desire read of them in your bible think of them in your hearts feed on them with your souls that your souls may grow like what they feed on and above all read and study the story and character of jesus christ himself our lord that beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord you may be changed into his likeness from grace to grace and virtue to virtue and glory to glory  and that change and that growth are as easy for the poor as for the rich and as necessary for the rich as for the poor    sermon ix  moses    fifth sunday in lent  exodus iii 14  and god said unto moses i am that i am  and now my friends we are come on this sunday to the most beautiful and the most important story of the whole bible excepting of course the story of our lord jesus christthe story of how a family grew to be a great nation  you remember that i told you that the history of the jews had been only as yet the history of a family  now that family is grown to be a great tribe a great herd of people but not yet a nation one people with its own god its own worship its own laws but such a mere tribe or band of tribes as the gipsies are among us now a herd but not a nation  then the bible tells us how these tribes being weak i suppose because they had no laws nor patriotism nor fellowfeeling of their own became slaves and suffered for hundreds of years under crafty kings and cruel taskmasters  then it tells us how god delivered them out of their slavery and made them free men  and how god did that for god in general works by means by the means of a man a prophet and a hero one great wise and good man of their racemoses  it tells us too how god trained moses by a very strange education to be the fit man to deliver his people  let us go through the history of moses and we shall see how god trained him to do the work for which god wanted him  let us read from the account of the bible itself  i should be sorry to spoil its noble simplicity by any words of my own  and the children of israel were fruitful and increased abundantly and multiplied and waxed exceeding mighty and the land was filled with them  now there arose up a new king over egypt which knew not joseph  and he said unto his people behold the people of the children of israel are more and mightier than we  come on let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply and it come to pass that when there falleth out any war they join also unto our enemies and fight against us and so get them up out of the land therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens  and they built for pharaoh treasure cities pithon and raamses     and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son that is born ye shall cast into the river and every daughter ye shall save alive  and there went a man of the house of levi and took to wife a daughter of levi  and the woman conceived and bare a son  and when she saw him that he was a goodly child she hid him three months  and when she could no longer hide him she took for him an ark of bulrushes and daubed it with slime and with pitch and put the child therein  and she laid it in the flags by the rivers brink  and his sister stood afar off to wit what would be done to him  and the daughter of pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river and her maidens walked along by the rivers side and when she saw the ark among the flags she sent her maid to fetch it  and when she had opened it she saw the child and behold the babe wept  and she had compassion on him and said this is one of the hebrews children  then said his sister to pharaohs daughter shall i go and call to thee a nurse of the hebrew women that she may nurse the child for thee  and pharaohs daughter said to her go  and the maid went and called the childs mother  and pharaohs daughter said unto her take this child away and nurse it for me and i will give thee thy wages  and the woman took the child and nursed it  and the child grew and she brought him unto pharaohs daughter and he became her son  and she called his name moses  and she said because i drew him out of the water  moses the child of the water  st paul in the epistle to the hebrews says that moses was called the son of pharaohs daughter that is adopted by her  we read elsewhere that he was learned in all the wisdom of the egyptians of which there can be no doubt from his own writings especially that part called moses law  so that moses had from his youth vast advantages  brought up in the court of the greatest king of the world in one of the greatest cities of the world among the most learned priesthood in the world he had learned probably all statesmanship all religion which man could teach him in those old times  but that would have been little for him  he might have become merely an officer in pharaohs household and we might never have heard his name and he might never have done any good to his own people and to all mankind after them as he has done if there had not been something better and nobler in him than all the learning and statesmanship of the egyptians  for there was in moses the spirit of god the spirit which makes a man believe in god and trust god  and therefore says st paul he refused to be called the son of pharaohs daughter esteeming the reproach of christ better than all the treasures in egypt  and how did he do that  in this wise  the spirit of god and of christ is also the spirit of justice the spirit of freedom the spirit which hates oppression and wrong which is moved with a noble and divine indignation at seeing any human being abused and trampled on  and that spirit broke forth in moses  and it came to pass in those days when moses was grown that he went out unto his brethren and looked on their burdens  and he spied an egyptian smiting an hebrew one of his brethren  and he looked this way and that way and when he saw that there was no man he slew the egyptian and hid him in the sand  if he cannot get justice for his people he will do some sort of rough justice for them himself when he has an opportunity  but he will see fair play among his people themselves  they are as slaves are likely to be fallen and base unjust and quarrelsome among themselves  and when he went out the second day behold two men of the hebrews strove together  and he said to him that did the wrong wherefore smitest thou thy fellow  and he said who made thee a prince and a judge over us intendest thou to kill me as thou killedst the egyptian  and moses feared and said surely this thing is known now when pharaoh heard this thing he sought to slay moses  but moses fled from the face of pharaoh and dwelt in the land of midianthe wild desert between egypt and the holy land  so he bore the reproach of christ the reproach which is apt to fall on men in bad times when they try like our lord jesus christ to deliver the captive and let the oppressed go free and execute righteous judgment in the earth  he had lost all by trying to do right  he had been powerful and honoured in pharaohs court  now he was an outcast and wanderer in the desert  he had made his first trial and failed  as st stephen said of him after he supposed that his brethren would have understood how god would deliver them by his hand but they understood not  slavish base and stupid they were not fit yet for moses and his deliverance  and so forty years went on and moses was an old man of eighty years of age  yet god had not had mercy on his poor countrymen in egypt  it must have been a strange life for him the adopted son of pharaohs daughter brought up in the court of the most powerful and highly civilized country of the old world learned in all the learning of the egyptians and now married into a tribe of wild arabs keeping flocks in the lonely desert year after year  but no doubt thinking thinking year after year as he fed his flocks alone  thinking over all the learning which he had gained in egypt and wondering whether it would ever be of any use to him  thinking over the misery of his people in egypt and wondering whether he should ever be able to help them  thinking too and more than all of godof gods promise to abraham and his children  would that ever come true  would god help these wretched jews even if he could not  was god faithful and true just and merciful  that moses thought of god that he never lost faith in god for that forty years there can be no doubt  if he had not thought of god god would not have revealed himself to him  if he had lost faith in god he would not have known that it was god who spoke to him  if he had lost faith in god he would not have obeyed god at the risk of his life and have gone on an errand as desperate dangerous hopelessand humanly speaking as wild as ever man went upon  but moses never lost faith or patience  he believed and he did not make haste  he waited for god and he did not wait in vain  no man will wait in vain  when the time was ready when the jews were ready when pharaoh was ready when moses himself trained by forty years patient thought was ready then god came in his own good time  and moses led the flock to the back of the desert and came to the mountain of god even to horeb  and there he saw a bushprobably one of the low copses of acaciaburning with fire and behold the bush was not consumed  then out of the bush god spoke to moses with an audible voice as of a man so the bible says plainly and i see no reason to doubt that it is literally true  moreover he said i am the god of thy father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob  and moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon god  and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters for i know their sorrows and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites  then followed a strange conversation  moses was terrified at the thought of what he had to do and reasonably  moreover the israelites in egypt had forgotten god  and moses said unto god behold when i come unto the children of israel and shall say unto them the god of your fathers hath sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall i say unto them  and god said unto moses i am that i am  and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am hath sent me unto you  i am that was the new name by which god revealed himself to moses that message of god to moses was the greatest gospel and good news which was spoken to men before the coming of our lord jesus christ ay we are feeling now in our daily life in our laws and our liberty our religion and our morals our peace and prosperity in the happiness of our homes and i trust that of our consciences the blessed effects of that message which god revealed to moses in the wilderness thousands of years ago  and moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass and returned into the land of egypt to say to pharaoh thus saith the lord israel is my son even my firstborn let my son go that he may serve me and if thou let not my firstborn go then i will slay thy firstborn  a strange man on a strange errand  a poor man eighty years old carrying all that he had in the world upon an asss back going down to the great pharaoh the greatest king of the old world the great conqueror the child of the sun as his name means one of the greatest pharaohs who ever sat on the throne of egypt in the midst of all his princes and priests and armies with which he had conquered the nations far and wide and his great cities temples and palaces on which men may see at this day so we are told the face of that very pharaoh painted again and again as fresh in that rainless air as on the day when the paint was laid on with the features of a man terrible proud and cruel puffed up by power till he thought himself and till his people thought him a god on earth  and to that man was moses going to bid him set the children of israel free while he himself was one of that very slaverace of the israelites which was an abomination to the egyptians who held them all as lepers and unclean and would not eat with them and an outcast too who had fled out of egypt for his life and who might be killed on the spot as pharaohs only answer to his bold request certainly if moses had not had faith in god his errand would have seemed that of a madman  but moses had faith in god and of faith it is said that it can remove mountains for all things are possible to them who believe  so by faith moses went back into egypt how he fared there we shall hear next sunday  and what sort of man was this great and wonderful moses whose name will last as long as man is man  we know very little  we know from the bible and from the old traditions of the jews that he was a very handsome man a man of a noble presence as one can well believe a man of great bodily vigour so that when he died at the age of one hundred and twenty his eye was not dim nor his natural force abated  we know from his own words that he was slow of speech that he had more thought in him than he could find words forvery different from a good many loud talkers who have more words than thoughts and who get a great character as politicians and demagogues simply because they have the art of stringing fine words together which moses the true demagogue the leader of the people who led them indeed out of egypt had not  beyond that we know little  of his character one thing only is said  but that is most important  now the man moses was very meek  meek  we know that that cannot mean that he was meek in the sense that he was a poor cowardly abject sort of man who dared not speak his mind dared not face the truth and say the truth  we have seen that that was just what he was not brave determined outspoken he seems to have been from his youth  indeed if his had been that base sort of meekness he never would have dared to come before the great king pharaoh  if he had been that sort of man he never would have dared to lead the jews through the red sea by night or out of egypt at all  if he had been that sort of man indeed the jews would never have listened to him  no he hadthe bible tells us that he hadto say and do stern things again and again to act like the general of an army or the commander of a ship of war who must be obeyed even though mens lives be the forfeit of disobedience  but the man moses was very meek  he had learned to keep his temper indeed the story seems to say that he never lost his temper really but once and for that god punished him  never man was so tried save one even our lord jesus christ as was moses  and yet by patience he conquered  eighty years had he spent in learning to keep his temper and when he had learned to keep his temper then and not till then was he worthy to bring his people out of egypt that was a long schooling but it was a schooling worth having  and if we my friends spend our whole lives be they eighty years long in learning to keep our tempers then will our lives have been well spent  for meekness and calmness of temper need not interfere with a mans courage or justice or honest indignation against wrong or power of helping his fellowmen  moses meekness did not make him a coward or a sluggard  it helped him to do his work rightly instead of wrongly it helped him to conquer the pride of pharaoh and the faithlessness cowardice and rebellion of his brethren those miserable slavish jews  and so meekness an even temper and a gracious tongue will help us to keep our place among our fellowmen with true dignity and independence and to govern our households and train our children in such a way that while they obey us they will love and respect us at the same time    sermon x  the plagues of egypt    palm sunday  exodus ix 13 14  thus saith the lord god of the hebrews let my people go that they may serve me  for i will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart and upon thy servants and upon thy people that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth  you will understand i think the meaning of the ten plagues of egypt better if i explain to you in a few words what kind of a country egypt is what kind of people the egyptians were  some of you doubtless know as well as i but some here may not  it is for them i speak  egypt is one of the strangest countries in the world and yet one which can be most simply described  one long straight strip of rich flat land many hundred miles long but only a very few miles broad on either side of it barren rocks and deserts of sand and running through it from end to end the great river nilethe river of which the bible speaks  this river the egyptians looked on as divine  they worshipped it as a god for on it depended the whole wealth of egypt  every year it overflows the whole country leaving behind it a rich coat of mud which makes egypt the most inexhaustibly fertile land in the world and made the egyptians from very ancient times the best farmers of the world the fathers of agriculture  meanwhile when not in flood the river water is of the purest in the world the most delightful to drink and was supposed in old times to be a cure for all manner of diseases  to worship this sacred river the pride of their land to drink it to bathe in it to catch the fish which abound in it and which formed then and forms still the staple food of the egyptians was their delight  and now i have told you enough to show you why the plagues which god sent on egypt began first by striking the river  the river we read was turned into blood  what that meanswhether it was actual animal bloodwhat means god employed to work the miracleare just the questions about which we need not trouble our minds  we never shall know  and we need not know  the plain fact is that the sacred river pure and lifegiving became a detestable mass of rottennessand with it all their streams and pools and drinking water in vessels of wood and stonefor all remember came from the nile carried by canals and dykes over the whole land and the fish that were in the river died and the river stunk and there was blood through all the land of egypt  the slightest thought will show us what horror confusion and actual want and misery the loss of the river water even for a few days or even hours would cause  but there is more still in this miracle  these plagues are a battle between jehovah the one true and only god almighty and the false gods of egypt to prove which of them is master  pharaoh answers  who is jehovah the lord that i should let israel go  i know not the jehovah  i have my own god whom i worship  he is my father and i his child and he will protect me if i obey any one it will be him  be it so says moses in the name of god  thou shalt know that the idols of egypt are nothing that they cannot deliver thee nor thy people  thus saith jehovah thou shalt know which is master i or they thou shalt know that i am the lord  so the river was turned into blood  the sacred river was no god as they thought  jehovah was the lord and master of the river on which the very life of egypt depended  he could turn it into blood  all egypt was at his mercy  but pharaoh would not believe that  the magicians did likewise with their enchantmentsmade we may suppose water seem to turn to blood by some juggling trick at which the priests in egypt were but too well practised and pharaoh seemed to have made up his mind that moses miracle was only a juggling trick too  for men will make up their minds to anything however absurd when they choose to do so  when their pride and rage and obstinacy and covetousness draw them one way no reason will draw them the other way  they will find reasons and make reasons to prove if need be that there is no sun in the sky  then followed a series of plagues of which we have all often heard  learned men have disputed how far these plagues were miracles  some of them are said not to be uncommon in egypt others to be almost unknown  but whether theywhether the frogs for instance were not produced by natural causes just as other frogs are and the lice and the flies likewise that i know not my friends neither need i know  if they were not they were miraculous and if they were they were miraculous still  if they came as other vermin come they would have still been miraculous  god would still have sent them and it would be a miracle that god should make them come at that particular time in that particular country to work a truly miraculous effect upon the souls of pharaoh and the egyptians on the one hand and of moses and the israelites on the other  but if they came by some strange means as no vermin ever came before or since all i can say iswhy not  and the lord said unto moses say unto aaron stretch out thy rod and smite the dust of the land that it may become lice throughout all the land of egypt  whether that was meant only as a sign to the egyptians or whether the dust did literally turn into lice we do not know and what is more we need not know if god chose that it should be so so it would be  if you believe at all that god made the world it is folly to pretend to set any bounds to his power  as a wise man has said if you believe in any real god at all you must believe that miracles can happen  he makes you and me and millions of living things out of the dust of the ground continually by certain means why can he not make lice or anything else out of the dust of the ground without those means  i can give no reason nor any one else either  we know that god has given all things a law which they cannot break we know too that god will never break his own laws  but what are gods laws by which he makes things  we do not know  miracles may beindeed must beonly the effect of some higher and deeper laws of god  we cannot prove that he breaks his law or disturbs his order by them  they may seem contrary to some of the very very few laws of gods earth which we do know  but they need not be contrary to the very many laws which we do not know  in fact we know nothing about the matter and had best not talk of things that we do not understand  as for these things being too wonderful to be truethat is an argument which only deserves a smile  there are so many wonders in the world round us already all day long that the man of sense will feel that nothing is too wonderful to be true  the truth is that as a wise man says custom is the great enemy of faith and of reason likewise and one of the worst tricks which custom plays us is making us fancy that miraculous things cease to be miraculous by becoming common  what do i mean  this  which every child in this church can understand  you think it very wonderful that god should cause frogs to come upon the whole land of egypt in one day  but that god should cause frogs to come up every spring in the ditches does not seem wonderful to you at all  it happens every year therefore forsooth there is nothing wonderful in it  ah my dear friends it is custom which blinds our eyes to the wisdom of god and the wonders of god and the power of god and the glory of god and hinders us from believing the message with which he speaks to us from every sunbeam and every shower every blade of grass and every standing pool  is anything too hard for the lord  if any man here says that anything is too hard for the lord let him go this day to the nearest standing pool and look at the frogspawn therein and consider it till he confesses his blindness and foolishness  that spawn seems to you a foul thing the produce of mean ugly contemptible creatures  be it so  yet it is to the eyes of the wise man a yearly miracle a thing past understanding past explaining one which will make him feel the truth of that great 139th psalm  thou hast beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me  such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high i cannot attain unto it  whither shall i go from thy spirit or whither shall i flee from thy presence  if i ascend up into heaven thou art there  if i make my bed in hell behold thou art there also  that every one of those little black spots should have in it life what is life  how did it get into that black spot or to speak more carefully is the life in the black spot at all  is not the life in the spirit of god who is working on that spot as i believe  how has that black spot the power of growing and of growing on a certain and fixed plan merely by the quickening power of the suns heat and then of feeding itself and of changing its shape as you all know again and again tilland if that is not wonderful what isit turns into a frog exactly like its parent utterly unlike the black dot at which it began  is that no miracle is it no miracle that not one of those black spots ever turns into anything save a frog  why should not some of them turn into toads or efts  why not even into fishes or serpents  why not  the eggs of all those animals in their first and earliest stages are exactly alike the microscope shows no difference  ay even the mere animal and the human being strange and awful as it may be seem under the microscope to have the same beginning  and yet one becomes a mere animal and the other a member of christ a child of god and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven  what causes this but the power of god making of the same clay one vessel to honour and another to dishonour  and yet people will not believe in miracles  why does each kind turn into its kind  answer that  because it is a law of nature  not so  there are no laws of nature  god is a law to nature  it is his will that things so should be and when it is his will they will not be so but otherwise  not laws of nature but the spirit of god as the psalms truly say gives life and breath to all things  of him and by him is all  as the greatest chemist of our time says causes are the acts of god creation is the will of god  and he that is wise and strong enough to create frogs in one way in every ditch at this moment is he not wise and strong enough to create frogs by some other way if he should choose whether in egypt of old or now here this very day  whatsoever means or no means at all god used to produce those vermin the miracle remains the same  he sent them to do a work and they did it  he sent them to teach egyptian and israelite alike that he was the maker and lord and ruler of the world and all that therein is that he would have his way and that he could have his way  intensely painful and disgusting these plagues must have been to the egyptians for this reason that they were the most cleanly of all people  they had a dislike of dirt which had become quite a superstition to them  their priests magicians as the bible calls them never wore any garments but linen for fear of their harbouring vermin of any kind  and this extreme cleanliness of theirs the next plague struck at they were covered with boils and diseases of skin and the magicians could not stand before pharaoh by reason of the boils  they became unclean and unfit for their office they could perform no religious ceremonies and had to flee away in disgrace  after plagues of thunder hail and rain which seldom or never happen in that rainless land of egypt after a plague of locusts which are very rare there and have to come many hundred miles if they come at all of darkness seemingly impossible in a land where the sun always shines  then came the last and most terrible plague of all  after solemn warnings of what was coming the angel of the lord passed through the land of egypt and smote all the firstborn in egypt from the firstborn of pharaoh upon his throne to the firstborn of the captive in the dungeon and there arose a great cry in egypt for there was not a house in which there was not one dead  a terrible and heartrending calamity in any case enough to break the heart of all egypt and it did break the heart of egypt and the proud heart of pharaoh himself and they let the people go  but this was a religious affliction too  most of these firstborn childrenprobably all the firstborn of the priests and nobles and of pharaoh himselfwere consecrated to some god  they bore the name of the god to whom they belonged that god was to prosper and protect them and behold he could not  the lord jehovah the god of the hebrews was stronger than all the gods of egypt none of them could deliver their servants out of his hand  he was the only lord of life and death he had given them life and he could take it away in spite of all and every one of the gods of the egyptians  so the lord god showed himself to be the master and lord of all things  the lord of the sacred river nile the lord of the meanest vermin which crept on the earth the lord of the weatherable to bring thunder and hail into a land where thunder and hail was never seen before the lord of the locust swarmsable to bring them over the desert and over the sea to devour up every green thing in the land and then to send a wind off the mediterranean sea and drive the locusts away to the eastward the lord of lightwho could darken even in that cloudless land the very sun whom pharaoh worshipped as his god and his ancestor and lastly the lord of human life and deathable to kill whom he chose when he chose and as he chose  the lord of the earth and all that therein is before whom all men even proud pharaoh must bow and confess is anything too hard for the lord  and now i always tell you that each fresh portion of the old testament reveals to men something fresh concerning the character of god  you may say these plagues of egypt reveal gods mighty power but what do they reveal of his character  they reveal this  that there is in god that which for want of a better word we must call anger a quite awful sternness and severity not only a power to punish but a determination to punish if men will not take his warningsif men will not obey his will  there is no use trying to hide from ourselves that awful truthgod is not weakly indulgent  our god can be if he will a consuming fire  upon the sinner he will surely rain fire and brimstone storm and tempest of some kind or other  this shall be their portion too surely  vengeance is his and vengeance he will take  but upon whom  on the proud and the tyrannical on the cruel the false the unjust  so say the psalms again and again and so says the history of these plagues of egypt  therefore his anger is a loving anger a just auger a merciful anger a useful anger an anger exercised for the good of mankind  see in this case why did god destroy the crops of egypteven the firstborn of egypt  merely for the pleasure of destroying  god forbid  it was to deliver the poor israelites from their cruel taskmasters to force these egyptians by terrible lessons since they were deaf to the voice of justice and humanity to force them i sayto have mercy on their fellowcreatures and let the oppressed go free  therefore god was even in egypt a god of love who desired the good of man who would do justice for those who were unjustly treated even though it cost his love a pang for none can believe that god is pleased at having to punish pleased at having to destroy the works of his own hands or the creatures which he has made  no the lord was a god of love even when he sent his sore plagues on egypt and therefore we may believe what the bible tells us that that same lord showed as on this day a still greater proof of his love when as on this day he entered into jerusalem meek and lowly sitting on an ass and going as he well knew to certain death  before the week was over he would be betrayed mocked scourged crucified by the very people whom he came to save and yet he did it he endured it  instead of pouring out on them as on the egyptians of old the cup of wrath and misery he put out his hand took the cup of wrath and misery to himself and drank it to its very dregs  was not that too a miracle  ay a greater miracle than all the plagues of egypt  they were physical miracles this a moral miracle  they were miracles of nature this of grace  they were miracles of the lords power these of the lords love  think of that miracle of miracles which was worked in this passion weekthe miracle of the lord jehovah stooping to die for sinful man and say after that there is anything too hard for the lord    sermon xi  the god of the old testament is the god of the new    palm sunday  exodus ix 14  i will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart and upon thy servants and upon thy people that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth  we are now beginning passion week the week of the whole year which ought to teach us most theology that is most concerning god his character and his spirit  for in this passion week god did that which utterly and perfectly showed forth his glory as it never has been shown forth before or since  in this week jesus christ the incarnate god died on the cross for man and showed that his name his character his glory was lovelove without bound or end  it was to teach us this that the special services lessons collects epistles and gospels of this week were chosen  the second lesson the collects the epistles the gospel for to day all set before us the patience of christ the humility of christ the love of christ the selfsacrifice of christ the lamb without spot enduring all things that he might save sinful man  but if so what does this first lessonthe chapter of exodus from which my text is takenwhat does it teach us concerning god  does it teach us that his name is love  at first sight you would think that it did not  at first sight you would fancy that it spoke of god in quite a different tone from the second lesson  in the second lesson the words of jesus the son of god are all gentleness patience tenderness  a quiet sadness hangs over them all  they are the words of one who is come as he said himself not to destroy mens lives but to save them not to punish sins but to wash them away by his own most precious blood  but in the first lesson how differently he seems to speak  his words there are the words of a stern and awful judge who can and who will destroy whatsoever interferes with his will and his purpose  i will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart and on thy servants and all thy people that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth  the cattle and sheep shall be destroyed with murrain man and beast shall be tormented with boils and blains the crops shall be smitten with hail the locusts shall eat up every green thing in the land and at last all the firstborn of egypt shall die in one night and the land be filled with mourning horror and desolation before the anger of this terrible god who will destroy and destroy till he makes himself obeyed  can this be he who rode into jerusalem as on this day meek and lowly upon an asss colt who on the night that he was betrayed washed his disciples feet even the feet of judas who betrayed him who prayed for his murderers as he hung upon the cross father forgive them for they know not what they do  can these two be the same  is the lord jehovah of the old testament the lord jesus of the new  they are the same my friends  he who laid waste the land of egypt is he who came to seek and to save that which was lost  he who slew the children in egypt is he who took little children up in his arms and blessed them  he who spoke the awful words of the text is he who was brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before the shearers is dumb so he opened not his mouth  this is very wonderful  but why should it not be wonderful  what can god be but wonderful  his character just because it is perfect must contain in itself all other characters all forms of spiritual life which are without sin  and yet again it is not so very wonderful  have we not seeni have oftenin the same mortal man these two different characters at once  have we not seen soldiers and sailors brave men stern men men who have fought in many a bloody battle to whom it is a light thing to kill their fellowmen or to be killed themselves in the cause of duty and yet most full of tenderness as gentle as lambs to little children and to weak women nursing the sick lovingly and carefully with the same hand which would not shrink from firing the fatal cannon to blast a whole company into eternity or sink a ship with all its crew  i have seen such men brave as the lion and gentle as the lamb and i saw in them the likeness of christthe lion of judah and yet the lamb of god  christ is the lamb of god and in him there are the innocence of the lamb the gentleness of the lamb the patience of the lamb  but there is more  what words are these which st john speaks in the spirit  and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great and the rich and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every freeman hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and to the rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand  yes look at that awful book of revelation with which the bible ends and see if the bible does not end as it began by revealing a god who however loving and merciful longsuffering and of great goodness still wages war eternally against all sin and unrighteousness of man and who will by no means clear the guilty a god of whom the apostle st paul who knew most of his mercy and forgiveness to sinners could nevertheless say just as moses had said ages before him our god is a consuming fire  now i think it most necessary to recollect this in passion week ay and to do moreto remember it all our lives long  for it is too much the fashion now and has often been so before to think only of one side of our lords character of the side which seems more pleasant and less awful  people please themselves in hymns which talk of the meek and lowly jesus and in pictures which represent him with a sad weary delicate almost feminine face now i do not say that this is wrong  he is the same yesterday to day and for ever as tender as compassionate now as when he was on earth and it is good that little children and innocent young people should think of him as an altogether gentle gracious loveable being for with the meek he will be meek but again with the froward the violent and selfwilled he will be froward  he will show the violent that he is the stronger of the two and the self willed that he will have his will and not theirs done  so it is good that the widow and the orphan the weary and the distressed should think of jesus as utterly tender and true compassionate and merciful and rest their broken hearts upon him the everlasting rock  but while it is written that whosoever shall fall on that rock he shall be broken it is written too that on whomsoever that rock shall fall it will grind him to powder  it is good that those who wish to be gracious themselves loving themselves should remember that christ is gracious christ is loving  but it is good also that those who do not wish to be gracious and loving themselves but to be proud and selfwilled unjust and cruel should remember that the gracious and loving christ is also the most terrible and awful of all beings sharper than a twoedged sword piercing asunder the very joints and marrow discerning the most secret thoughts and intents of the heart a righteous judge strong and patient who is provoked every day  but if a man will not turn he will whet his sword  he hath bent his bow and made it ready and laid his arrows in order against the persecutors  what christs countenance my friends was like when on earth we do not know but what his countenance is like now we all may know for what says st john and how did christ appear to him who had been on earth his private and beloved friend  his head and his hair were white as snow and his eyes were like a flame of fire and his voice like the sound of many waters and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword and his countenance was as the sun when he shineth in his strength  and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead  that is the likeness of christ my friends and we must remember that it is his likeness and fall at his feet and humble ourselves before his unspeakable majesty if we wish that he should do to us at the last day as he did to st johnlay his hand upon us saying fear not i am the first and the last and behold i am alive for evermore amen  i have the keys of death and hell  yes it is good that we should all remember this  for if we do not we may fall as thousands fall into a very unwholesome and immoral notion about religion  we may get to fancy as thousands do rich and poor that because christ the lord is meek and gentle patient and longsuffering that he is therefore easy indulgent careless about our doing wrong and that we can in plain english trifle with christ and take liberties with his everlasting laws of right and wrong and so fancy that provided we talk of the meek and lowly jesus and of his blood washing away all our sins that we are free to behave very much as if jesus had never come into the world to teach men their duty and free to commit almost any sin which does not disgrace us among our neighbours or render us punishable by the law  my friends it is not so  and those who fancy that it is so will find out their mistake bitterly enough  infinite love and forgiveness to those who repent and amend and do right but infinite rigour and punishment to those who will not amend and do right this is the everlasting law of gods universe and every soul of man will find it out at last and find that the lord jesus christ is not a being to be trifled with and that the precious blood which he shed on the cross is of no avail to those who are not minded to be righteous even as he is righteous  but christ is so loving so tenderhearted that he surely will not punish us for our sins  this is the confused notion that too many people have about him  and the answer to it is that just because christ is so loving so tenderhearted therefore he must punish us for our sins unless we utterly give up our sins and do right instead of wrong  that false notion springs out of mens selfishness  they think of sin as something which only hurts themselves when they do wrong they think merely what punishment will god inflict on me for doing wrong  they are wrapt up in themselves  they forget that their sins are not merely a matter between them and christ but between them and their neighbours that every wrong action they commit every wrong word they speak every wrong habit in which they indulge themselves sooner or later more or less hurts their neighbours ay hurts all mankind  and does christ care only for them  does he not care for their neighbours  has he not all mankind to provide for and govern and guide  and can he allow bad men to go on making this world worse without punishing them any more than a gardener can allow weeds to hurt his flowers and not root them up  what would you say of a man who was so merciful to the weeds that he let them choke the flowers what would you say of a shepherd who was so merciful to the wolves that he let them eat his sheep  what would you say of a magistrate who was so merciful to thieves that he let them rob the honest men and do you fancy that christ is a less careful and just governor of the world than the magistrate who punishes the thief that honest men may live in safety  not so  not only will christ punish the wolves who devour his sheep but he will punish his sheep themselves if they hurt each other torment each other lead each other astray or in any way interfere with the just and equal rule of his kingdom and this not out of spite or cruelty but simply because he is perfect love  go therefore and think of christ this passion week as he was and is and ever will be  think of the whole christ and not of some part of his character which may specially please your fancy  think of him as the patient and forgiving christ who prayed for his murderers father forgive them for they know not what they do but remember that in this very passion week there came out of those most gentle lipsthe lips which blessed little children and cried to all who were weary and heavy laden to come to him and he would give them restthat out of those most gentle lips i say in this very passion week there went forth the most awful threats which ever were uttered woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites  ye serpents ye generation of vipers how can ye escape the damnation of hell  think of him as the lamb who offered himself freely on the cross for sinners  but think of him too as the lamb who shall one day come in glory to judge all men according to their works  think of him as full of boundless tenderness and humanity boundless longsuffering and mercy  but remember that beneath that boundless sweetness and tenderness there burns a consuming fire a fire of divine scorn and indignation against all who sin like pharaoh out of cruelty and pride against all which is foul and brutal mean and base false and hypocritical cruel and unjust a fire which burns and will burn against all the wickedness which is done on earth and all the misery and sorrow which is suffered on earth till the lord has burned it up for ever and there is nothing but love and justice order and usefulness peace and happiness left in the universe of god  oh think of these things and cast away your sins betimes at the foot of his everlasting cross lest you be consumed with your sins in his everlasting fire    sermon xii  the birthnight of freedom    easter day  exodus xii 42  this is a night to be much observed unto the lord for bringing the children of israel out of egypt  to be much observed unto the lord by the children of israel  and by us too my friends and by all nations who call themselves free  there are many and good ways of looking at easter day  let us look at it in this way for once  it is the day on which god himself set men free  consider the story  these israelites the children of abraham the brave wild patriarch of the desert have been settled for hundreds of years in the rich lowlands of egypt  there they have been eating and drinking their fill and growing more weak slavish luxurious fonder and fonder of the fleshpots of egypt fattening literally for the slaughter like beasts in a stall  they are spiritually deaddead in trespasses and sins  they do not want to be free to be a nation  they are content to be slaves and idolaters if they can only fill their stomachs  this is the spiritual death of a nation  i say they do not want to be free  when they are oppressed they cry outas an animal cries when you beat him  but after they are free when they get into danger or miss their meat they cry out too and are willing enough to return to slavery as the dog which has run away for fear of the whip will go back to his kennel for the sake of his food  because there were no graves in egypt hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness  wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us to carry us out of egypt  and again would god we had died by the hand of the lord in the land of egypt where we did sit by the fleshpots and eat meat to the full  brutalized in one word were these poor children of israel  then god took their cause into his own hand i say emphatically into his own hand  if that part of the story be not true i care nothing for the rest  if god did not personally and actually interfere on behalf of those poor slaves if the plagues of egypt are not true the passage of the red sea be not truethe story tells me and you nothing gives us no hope for ourselves no hope for mankind  for see  one says and truly god is good god is love god is just god hates oppression and wrong  but if god be love he must surely show his love by doing loving things  if god be just he must show his justice by doing just things  if god hates oppression then he must free the oppressed  if god hates wrong then he must set the wrong right  for what would you think of a man who professed to be loving and just and to hate oppression and wrong and yet never took the trouble to do a good action or to put down wrong when he had the power  you would call him a hypocrite you would think his love and justice very much on his tongue and not in his heart  and will you believe that god is like that man  god forbid  comfortable scholars and luxurious ladies may content themselves with a dead god who does not interfere to help the oppressed to right the wrong to bind up the brokenhearted but men and women who work who sorrow who suffer who partake of all the ills which flesh is heir tothey want a living god an acting god a god who will interfere to right the wrong  yesthey want a living god and they have a living godeven the god who interfered to bring the israelites out of egypt with signs and wonders and a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and executed judgment upon pharaoh and his proud and cruel hosts  and when they read in the bible of that god when they read in their bibles the story of the exodus their hearts answer this is right  this is the god whom we need  this is what ought to have happened  this is true  for it must be true  let comfortable folks who know no sorrow trouble their brains as to whether sixty or six hundred thousand fighting men came out of egypt with moses  we care not for numbers  what we care for is not how many came out but who brought them out and that he who brought them out was god  and the book which tells us that we will cling to will love will reverence above all the books on earth because it tells of a living god who works and acts and interferes for men who not only hates wrong but rights wrong not only hates oppression but puts oppressors down not only pities the oppressed but sets the oppressed free a god who not only wills that man should have freedom but sent freedom down to him from heaven  scholars have said that the old greeks were the fathers of freedom and there have been other peoples in the worlds history who have made glorious and successful struggles to throw off their tyrants and be free  and they have said we are the fathers of freedom liberty was born with us  not so my friends  liberty is of a far older and far nobler house liberty was born if you will receive it on the first easter night on the night to be much remembered among the children of israelay among all mankindwhen god himself stooped from heaven to set the oppressed free  then was freedom born  not in the counsels of men however wise or in the battles of men however brave  but in the counsels of god and the battle of godamid human agony and terror and the shaking of the heaven and the earth amid the great cry throughout egypt when a firstborn son lay dead in every house and the tempest which swept aside the red sea waves and the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night and the red sea shore covered with the corpses of the egyptians and the thunderings and lightnings and earthquakes of sinai and the sound as of a trumpet waxing loud and long and the voice most human and most divine which spake from off the lonely mountain peak to that vast horde of coward and degenerate slaves and said i am the lord thy god who brought thee out of the land of egypt  thou shalt obey my laws and keep my commandments to do them  oh the man who would rob his suffering fellowcreatures of that storyhe knows not how deep and bitter are the needs of man  then was freedom born  but not of man not of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of the will of god from whom all good things come and of christ who is the life and the light of men and of nations and of the whole world and of all worlds past present and to come  from god came freedom  to be used as his gift according to his laws for he gave and he can take away as it is written he shall take the kingdom of god from you and give it to a people bringing forth the fruits thereof  for there be many first that shall be last and last that shall be first  it is this which makes the jews indeed a peculiar people  the thought that the living god had actually and really done for them what they could not do for themselves that he had made them a nation and not they themselves it is this which makes the old testament an utterly different book with an utterly different lesson to the written history of any other nation in the world  and yet it is this which makes the history of the jews the key to every other history in the world  for in it jesus christ our lord the living god who makes history who governs all nations reveals and unveils himself and teaches not the jews only but us and all nations that it is he who hath made us and not we ourselves that we got not the land in possession by our own sword nor was it our own strength that helped us but thou o lord because thou hadst a favour unto us that not to us not to us is the praise of any national greatness or glory but to god from whom it comes as surely a free gift as the gift of liberty to the jews of old  i say the history of the jews is the history of the whole church and of every nation in christendom  as with the jews so with the nations of europe whenever they have trusted in themselves their own power and wisdom they have ended in weakness and folly  whenever they have trusted in christ the living god and said it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves they have risen to strength and wisdom  when they have forgotten the living god national life and patriotism have died in them as they died in the jews  when they have remembered that the most high god was their redeemer then in them as in the jews have national life and patriotism revived  and as it was with the jews in the wilderness so it has been with them since christs resurrection  they fancied that they were going at once into the promised land  so did the first christians  but the jews had to wander forty years in the wilderness and christendom has had to wander too in strange and bloodstained paths for one thousand eight hundred years and more  for why  the israelites were not worthy to enter at once into rest no more have the nation of christs church been worthy  the israelites brought out of egypt base and slavish passions which had to be purged out of them so have we out of heathendom  they brought out too heathen superstitions and mixed them up with the worship of god bearing about in the wilderness the tabernacle of moloch and the image of their god remphan and making the calf in horeb and so alas again and again has the church of christ  nay the whole generation save two who came out of egypt had to die in the wilderness and leave their bones scattered far and wide and so has mankind been dying by war and by disease and by many fearful scourges besides what is called nowadays natural decay  but all the while a new generation was springing up trained in the wilderness to be bold and hardy trained too under moses stern law to the fear of god to reverence and discipline and obedience without which freedom is merely brutal license and a nation is no nation but a mere flock of sheep or a herd of wolves  and so for these one thousand eight hundred years have the generations of christendom by the training of the church and the light of the gospel been growing in wisdom and knowledge growing in morality and humanity in that true discipline and loyalty which are the yokefellows of freedom and independence to make them fit for that higher state that heavenly canaan of which we know not when it will come nor whether its place will be on this earth or elsewhere but of which it is written and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband  and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god  and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain  for the former things are passed away  and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new  and i saw no temple therein  for the lord god almighty and the lamb are the temple of it  and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it  for the glory of god did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof  and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it  and the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day  for there shall be no night there  and they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it  and there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the lambs book of life  that the perfect easter day seems far enough off as yet but it will come  as the lord liveth it will come and to it may christ in his mercy bring us all and our childrens children after us amen    sermon xiii  korah dathan and abiram    first sunday after easter 1863  numbers xvi 3235  and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their houses and all the men that appertained unto korah and all their goods  they and all that appertained to them went down alive into the pit and the earth closed upon them  and they perished from among the congregation  and all israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them  for they said lest the earth swallow us up also  and there came out a fire from the lord and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense  i will begin by saying that there are several things in this chapter which i do not understand and cannot explain to you  be it so that is no reason why we should not look at the parts of the chapter which we can understand and can explain  there are matters without end in the world round us and in our own hearts and in the life of every one which we cannot explain and therefore we need not be surprised to find things which we cannot explain in the life and history of the most remarkable nation upon earththe nation whose business it has been to teach all other nations the knowledge of the true god and who was specially and curiously trained for that work  but the one broad commonsense lesson of this chapter it seems to me is one which is on the very surface of it one which every true englishman at least will see and see to be true when he hears the chapter read and that is the necessity of discipline  god has brought the israelites out of egypt and set them free  one of the first lessons which they have to learn is that freedom does not mean license and discorddoes not mean every one doing that which is right in the sight of his own eyes  from that springs selfwill division quarrels revolt civil war weakness profligacy and ruin to the whole people  without order discipline obedience to law there can be no true and lasting freedom and therefore order must be kept at all risks the law obeyed and rebellion punished  now rebellion may be and ought to be punished far more severely in some cases than in others  if men rebel here in great britain or ireland we smile at them and let them off with a slight imprisonment because we are not afraid of them  they can do no harm  but there are cases in which rebellion must be punished with a swift and sharp hand  on board a ship at sea for instance where the safety of the whole ship the lives of the whole crew depend on instant obedience mutiny may be punished by death on the spot many a commander has ere now and rightly too struck down the rebel without trial or argument and ended him and his mutiny on the spot by the sound rule that it is expedient that one man die for the people and that the whole nation perish not  and so it was with the israelites in the desert  all depended on their obedience  god had given them a lawa constitution as we should say nowperfectly fitted no doubt for them  if they once began to rebel and mutiny against that law all was over with them that great foolish ignorant multitude would have broken up probably fought among themselvescertainly parted company and either starved in the desert or have been destroyed piecemeal by the wild warlike tribes midianites moabites amalekiteswho were ready enough for slaughter and plunder  they would never have reached canaan  they would never have become a great nation  so they had to be by necessity under martial law  the word must be obey or die  as for any cruelty in putting korah dathan and abiram to death it was worth the death of a hundred suchor a thousandto preserve the great and glorious nation of the jews to be the teachers of the world  now this korah dathan and abiram rebel  they rebel against moses about a question of the priesthood  it really matters little to us what that question wasit was a question of moses law which of course is now done away  only remember this that these men were princesgreat feudal noblemen as we should say and that they rebelled on the strength of their rank and their rights as noblemen to make laws for themselves and for the people and that the mob of their dependents seem to have been inclined to support them  surely if moses had executed martial law on them with his own hand he would have been as perfectly justified as a captain of a ship of war or a general of an army would be now  but he did not do so  and why  because moses did not bring the people out of egypt  moses was not their king  god brought them out of egypt  god was their king  that was the lesson which they had to learn and to teach other nations also  they have rebelled not against moses but against god and not moses but god must punish and show that he is not a dead god but a living god one who can defend himself and enforce his own laws and execute judgmentand if need be vengeancewithout needing any man to fight his battles for him  and god does so  the powers of naturethe earthquake and the nether fireshall punish these rebels and so they do  and moses said hereby ye shall know that the lord hath sent me to do all these works for i have not done them of mine own mind  if these men die the common death of all men or if they be visited after the visitation of all men then the lord hath not sent me but if the lord make a new thing and the earth open her mouth and swallow them up with all that appertain to them and they go down quick into the pit then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the lord  men have thought differently of the story but i call it a righteous story and a noble story and one which agrees with my conscience and my reason and my notion of what ought to be and my experience also of what isof the way in which gods world is governed unto this day  what then are we to think of the earth opening and swallowing them up  what are we to think of a fire coming out from the lord and consuming two hundred and fifty men that offered incense  this first  that discipline and order are so absolutely necessary for the wellbeing of a nation that they must be kept at all risks and enforced by the most terrible punishments  it seems to me to speak with all reverence as if god had said to the jews i have set you free  i will make of you a great nation i will lead you into a good land and large  but if you are to be a great nation if you are to conquer that good land and large you must obey  and you shall obey  the earthquake and the fire shall teach you to obey and make you an example to the rest of the israelites and to all nations after you  but how hard some may think that the wives and the children should suffer for their parents sins  my friends we do not know that a single woman or child died then for whom it was not better that he or she should die  that is one of the deep things which we must leave to the perfect justice and mercy of god  and nextwhat is it after all but what we see going on round us all the day long  god does visit the sins of the fathers on the children  there is no denying it  wives do suffer for their husbands sins children and childrens children for whole generations after generations suffer for their parents sins and become unhealthy or superstitious or profligate or poor or slavish because their parents sinned and dragged down their children with them in their fall  it is a law of the world and therefore it is a law of god  and it is reasonable to be believed that god might choose to teach the israelites once and for all that it was a law of his world  for by swallowing up those women and children with the men god said to the israelites it seems to me in a way which could not be mistaken this is the consequence of lawlessness and disorderthat you not only injure yourselves but your children after you and involve your families in the same ruin as yourselves  but there was another lesson and a deep lesson in the earthquake and in the fire  and what was this that the earthquake and the fire came out from the lord  earthquakes have swallowed up not hundreds merely but many thousands in many countries and at many times  fire has come forth and still comes forth from the ground from the clouds from the consequences of mans own carelessness and destroys beast and man and the works of mans hands  then men ask in terror and doubt who sends the earthquake and the fire  do they come from the devilthe destroyer  do they come by chance from some brute and blind powers of nature  this chapter answers no  they come from the lord from whom all good things do come from the lord who delivered the israelites out of egypt who so loved the world that he spared not his only begotten son but freely gave him for us  now i say that is a gospel and good news which we want now as much as ever men did which the children of israel wanted then though not one whit more than we  many hundreds of years had these israelites been in egypt  storm lightning earthquake the fires of the burning mountains were things unknown to them  they were going into canaana good land and fruitful but a land of storms and thunders a land too of earthquakes and subterranean fires  the deepest earthquakecrack in the world is the valley of the jordan ending in the dead seaa long valley through which at different points the nether fires of the earth even now burst up at times  in abrahams time they had destroyed the five cities of the plain  the prophets mention them especially isaiah and micah as breaking out again in their own times and in our own lifetime earthquake and fire have done fearful destruction in the north part of the holy land  now what was to prevent the israelites worshipping the earthquake and the fire as gods  nothing  conceive the terror and horror of the jews coming out of that quiet land of egypt the first time they felt the ground rocking and rolling the first time they heard the roar of the earthquake beneath their feet the first time they saw in the magnificent words of micah the mountains molten and the valleys cleft as wax before the fire like water poured down a steep place and discovered that beneath their very feet was tophet the pit of fire and brimstone ready to burst up and overwhelm them they knew not when  what could they do but what the canaanites did who dwelt already in that land  what but to say the fire is king  the fire is the great and dreadful god and to him we must pray lest he devour us up  for so did the canaanites  they called the fire moloch which means simply the king and they worshipped this fireking and made idols of him and offered human sacrifices to him  they had idols of metal before which an everlasting fire burned and on the arms of the idol the priests laid the children who were to be sacrificed that they might roll down into the fire and be burnt alive  that is actual fact  in one case which we know of well hundreds of years after moses time the carthaginians offered two hundred boys of their best families to moloch in one day  this is that making the children pass through the fire to molochburning them in the fire to molochof which we read several times in the old testament as ugly and accursed a superstition as men ever invented  what deliverance was there for them from these abominable superstitions except to know that the firekingdom was gods kingdom and not molochs at all to know with micah and with david that the hills were molten like wax before the presence of the lord that it was the blast of his breath which discovered the foundations of the world that it was he who made the sea flee and drove back the jordan stream that it was before him that the mountains skipped like rams and the little hills like young sheep that the battles of shaking were gods battles with which he could fight for his people that it was he who ordained tophet and whose spirit kindled it  that it was heand that too in mercy as well as angerwho visited the land in isaiahs time with thunder and earthquake and great noise and storm and tempest and the flame of devouring fire that the earth opened and swallowed up those whom god chose and no others  that if fire came forth it came forth from the lord and burned where and what god chose and nothing else  yes  if you will only understand once and for all that the history of the jews is the history of the lords turning a people from the cowardly slavish worship of sun and stars of earthquakes and burning mountains and all the brute powers of nature which the heathen worshipped and teaching them to trust and obey him the living god the lord and master of all then the old testament will be clear to you throughout but if not then not  you cannot read your bibles without seeing how that great lesson was stamped into the very hearts of the hebrew prophets how they are continually speaking of the fire and the earthquake and yet continually declaring that they too obey god and do gods will and that the man who fears god need not fear themthat god was their hope and strength a very present help in trouble  therefore would they not fear though the earth was moved and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea  and we too need the same lesson in these scientific days  we too need to fix it in our hearts that the powers of nature are the powers of god that he orders them by his providence to do what he will and when and where he will that as the psalmist says the winds are his messengers and the flames of fire his ministers  and this we shall learn from the bible and from no other book whatsoever  god taught the jews this by a strange and miraculous education that they might teach it in their turn to all mankind  and they have taught it  for the bible bids usas no other book doesnot to be afraid of the world on which we live not to be afraid of earthquake or tempest or any of the powers of nature which seem to us terrible and cruel and destroying for they are the powers of the good and just and loving god  they obey our father in heaven without whom not a sparrow falls to the ground and our lord jesus christ who came not to destroy mens lives but to save them  and therefore we need not fear them or look on them with any blind superstition as things too awful for us to search into  we may search into their causes find out if we can the laws which they obey because those laws are given them by god our father try by using those laws to escape them as we are learning now to escape tempests or to prevent them as we are learning now to prevent pestilences  and where we cannot do that face them manfully saying it is my fathers will  these terrible events must be doing gods work  they may be punishing the guilty they may be taking the righteous away from the evil to come they may be teaching wise men lessons which will enable them years hence to save lives without number they may be preparing the face of the earth for the use of generations yet unborn  whatever they are doing they are and must be doing good for they are doing the will of the living father who willeth that none should perish and hateth nothing that he hath made  this my friends is the lesson which the bible teaches and because it teaches that lesson it is the book of books and the inspired word or message not of men concerning god but of god himself concerning himself his kingdom over this world and over all worlds and his good will to men    sermon xiv  balaam    numbers xxiii 19  god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent  hath he said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken and shall he not make it good  if i was asked for any proof that the story of balaam as i find it in the bible is a true story i should lay my hand on this one onlyand that is the deep knowledge of human nature which is shown in it  the character of balaam is so perfectly natural and yet of a kind so very difficult to unravel and explain that if the story was invented by man as poems or novels are it must have been invented very late indeed in the history of the jews at a time when they had grown to be a far more civilised people far more experienced in the cunning tricks of the human heart than they were as far as we can see from the bible before the babylonish captivity  but it was not invented late for no jew in these later times would have thought of making balaam a heathen to be a prophet of god or a believer in the true god at all  the later jews took up the notion that god spoke to and cared for the jews only and that all other nations were accursed  there is no reason therefore against simply believing the story as it stands  it seems a very ancient story indeed suiting exactly in its smallest details the place where moses or whoever wrote the book of numbers has put it  we in these days are accustomed to draw a sharp line between the good and the bad the converted and the unconverted the children of god and the children of this world those who have gods spirit and those who have not which we find nowhere in scripture and therefore when we read of such a man as balaam we cannot understand him  he is a bad man but yet he is a prophet  how can that be he knows the true god  more he has the spirit of god in him and thereby utters deep and wonderful prophecies and yet he is a bad man and a rogue  how can that be  the puzzle my friends is one of our own making  if instead of taking up doctrines out of books we will use our own eyes and ears and common sense and look honestly at this world as it is and men and women as they are we shall find nothing unnatural or strange in balaam we shall find him very like a good many people whom we know very likenay probably too likeourselves in some particulars  now bear in mind first that balaam is no impostor or magician  he is a wise man and a prophet of god  god really speaks to him and really inspires him  and bear in mind too that balaams inspiration did not merely open his mouth to say wonderful words which he did not understand but opened his heart to say righteous and wise things which he did understand  remember says the prophet micah o my people what balak king of moab consulted and what balaam the son of beor answered him from shittim unto gilgal that ye may know the righteousness of the lord  wherewith shall i come before the lord and bow myself before the high god  shall i come before him with burnt offerings with calves of a year old  will the lord be pleased with thousands of rams or with ten thousands of rivers of oil  shall i give my firstborn for my transgressions the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul  he hath shewed thee o man what is good and what doth the lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god  why what deeper or wiser words are there in the whole old testament  this man balaam had seen down into the deepest depths of all morality unto the deepest depths of all religion  the man who knew that knew more than ninetynine in a hundred do even in a christian country now and more than nine hundred and ninetynine thousand nine hundred and ninetynine in a million knew in those days  let no one after that speech doubt that balaam was indeed a prophet of the lord and yet he was a bad man and came deservedly to a bad end  so much easier my friends is it to know what is right than to do what is right  what then was wrong in balaam  this that he was doubleminded  he wished to serve god  true but he wished to serve himself by serving god as too many do in all times  that was what was wrong with himselfseeking and the bible story brings out that selfseeking with a delicacy a keenness and a perfect knowledge of human nature which ought to teach us some of the secrets of our own hearts  watch how balaam as a matter of course inquires of the lord whether he may go and refuses seemingly at first honestly  then how the temptation grows on him how when he feels tempted he fights against it in finesounding professions just because he feels that he is going to yield to it  then how he begins to tempt god by asking him again in hopes that god may have changed his mind  then when he has his foolish wish granted he goes  then when the terrible warning comes to him that he is on the wrong road that gods wrath is gone out against him and his angel ready to destroy him he is full still of hollow professions of obedience instead of casting himself utterly upon gods mercy and confessing his sin and entreating pardon  then how instead of being frightened at gods letting him have his way he is emboldened by it to tempt god more and more and begins offering bullocks and rams on altars first in this place and then in that in hopes still that god may change his mind and let him curse israel in hopes that god may be like one of the idols of the heathen who could so the heathen thought be coaxed and flattered round by sacrifices to do whatever their worshippers wished  then when he finds that all is of no use that he must not curse israel and must not earn balaks silver and gold he is forced to be an honest man in spite of himself and therefore he makes the best of his disappointment by taking mighty credit to himself for being honest while he wishes all the while he might have been allowed to have been dishonest  oh if all this is not poor human nature drawn by the pen of a truly inspired writer what is it  moreover it is curious to watch how as balaam is forced step by step to be an honest man so step by step he rises  a weight falls off his mind and heart and the spirit of god comes upon him  he feels for once that he must speak his mind that he must obey god  as he looks down from off the mountain top and sees the vast encampment of the israelites spread over the vale below for miles and miles as far as the eye can see all ordered disciplined arranged according to their tribes the spirit of god comes upon him and he gives way to it and speaks  the sight of that magnificent array wakens up in him the thought of how divine is older how strong is order how order is the life and root of a nation and how much more when that order is the order of god  how goodly are thy tents o jacob and thy tabernacles o israel as the valleys are they spread forth as gardens by the rivers side as the trees of lign aloes which the lord hath planted and as cedar trees beside the waters  his king shall be higher than agag and all his wild amalekite hordes  he will be a true nation civilized ordered loyal and united for god is teaching him  who can resist such a nation as that  god has brought him out of egypt  he has the strength of an unicorn  i shall see him he says but not now i shall behold him but not nigh  there shall come a star out of jacob and a sceptre shall rise out of israel and shall smite the corners of moab and destroy all the children of sheth  and when he looked on amalek he took up his parable and said amalek was the first of the nation but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever  and he looked on the kenites and took up his parable and said strong is thy dwellingplace and thou puttest thy nest in a rock  nevertheless the kenite shall be wasted till asshur shall carry thee away captive  alas who shall live when god doeth this  and then beyond all after all the canaanites and other syrian races have been destroyed he sees dimly and afar off another destruction still  in his home in the far east the fame of the ships of chittim has reached him the fame of the new people the searoving heroes of the greeks of whom old homer sang the handsomest cunningest most daring of mankind who are spreading their little trading colonies along all the isles and shores as we now are spreading ours over the world  those ships of chittim too have a great and glorious future before them  some day or other they will come and afflict asshur the great empire of the east out of which balaam probably came and afflict eber too the kingdom of the jews and they too shall perish for ever  dimly he sees it for it is very far away  but that it will come he sees and beyond that all is dark  he has said his say he has spoken the whole truth for once  balaks house full of silver and gold would not have bought him off and stopped his mouth when such awful thoughts crowded on his mind  so he returns to his placeto do what  if he cannot earn balaks gold by cursing israel he can do it by giving him cunning and politic advice  he advises balak to make friends with the israelites and mix them up with his people by enticing them to the feasts of his idols at which the women threw themselves away in shameful profligacy after the custom of the heathens of these parts  in the next chapter we read how moses and phinehas aarons grandson put down those filthy abominations with a high hand and how balaams detestable plot instead of making peace makes war and in chapter xxxi you read the terrible destruction of the whole nation of the midianites and among it this one short and terrible hint  balaam also the son of beor they slew with the sword  but what may we learn from this ugly story  recollect what i said at first that we should find balaam too like many people nowadays perhaps too like ourselves  too like indeed  for never were men more tempted to sin as balaam did than in these days when religion is all the fashion and pays a man and helps him on in life when indeed a man cannot expect to succeed without professing some sort of religion or other  thereby comes a terrible temptation to many men  i do not mean to hypocrites but to really wellmeaning men  they like religion they wish to be good they have the feeling of devotion  they pray they read their bibles they are attentive to services and to sermons and are more or less pious people  but soontoo soon they find that their piety is profitable  their business increases their credit increases  they are trusted and respected their advice is asked and taken  they gain power over their fellowmen what a fine thing it is they think to be pious  then creeps in the love of the world the love of money or power or admiration and they begin to value religion because it helps them to get on in the world  they begin more and more to love piety not for its own sake but for the sake of what it brings not because it pleases god but because it pleases the world not because it enables them to help their fellowmen but because it enables them to help themselves  so they get doubleminded unstable inconsistent as st james says in all their ways trying to serve god and mammon at once trying to do goodas long as doing good does not hurt them in the worlds eyes but longing oftener and oftener to do wrong if only god would not be angry  then comes on balaams frame of mind if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the commandment of the lord  oh no  they would not do a wrong thing for the worldonly they must be quite sure first that it is wrong  has god really forbidden it  why should they not take care of their interest  why should they not get on in the world  so they begin like balaam to tempt god to see how far they can go to see if god has forbidden this and that mean or cowardly or covetous or ambitious deed  so they soon settle for themselves what god has forbidden and what he has not and their rule of life becomes thisthat whatsoever is safe and whatsoever is profitable is pretty sure to be right and after that no wonder if like balaam they indulge themselves in every sort of sin provided only it is respectable and does not hurt them in the worlds eyes  and all the while they keep up their religion  ay they are often more attentive than ever to religion because their consciences pinch them at times and have to be silenced and drugged by continual churchgoings and chapelgoings and readings and prayings in order that they may be able to say to themselves with balaam thus saith balaam he who heard the word of god and had the knowledge of the most high  so they say to themselves i must be right  how religious i am how fond of sermons and of church services and church restorations and missionary meetings and charitable institutions and everything that is good and pious  i must be right with god deceiving their ownselves and saying to themselves i am rich and increased with goods i have need of nothing and not knowing that they are wretched and miserable and blind and naked  would god that such people of whom there are too many would take st johns warning and buy of the lord gold tried in the firethe true gold of honestythat they may be truly rich and anoint their eyes with eyesalve that they may see themselves for once as they are  but what does this story teach us concerning god  for remember as i tell you every sunday that each fresh story in the pentateuch reveals to us something fresh about the character of god  what does balaams story reveal  balaam himself tells us in the text god is not a man that he should lie nor the son of man that he should repent  hath he said and shall he not do it  yes  fancy not that any wishes or prayers of yours can persuade god to alter his everlasting laws of right and wrong  if he has commanded a thing he has commanded it because it is according to his everlasting laws which cannot change because they are made in his eternal image and likeness  therefore if god has commanded you a thing do it heartily fully without arguing or complaining  if you begin arguing with gods law excusing yourself from it inventing reasons why you need not obey it in this particular instance though every one else ought then you will end like balaam in disobeying the law and it will grind you to powder  but if you obey gods law honestly with a single eye and a whole heart you will find in it a blessing and peace and strength and everlasting life    sermon xv  deuteronomy    third sunday after easter  deut iv 39 40  know therefore this day and consider it in thine heart that the lord he is god in heaven above and upon the earth beneath  there is none else  thou shall keep therefore his statutes and his commandments which i command thee this day that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth which the lord thy god giveth thee for ever  learned men have argued much of late as to who wrote the book of deuteronomy  after having read a good deal on the subject i can only say that i see no reason why we should not believe the ancient account which the jews give that it was written or at least spoken by moses  no doubt there are difficulties in the book  if there had not been there would never have been any dispute about the matter but the plain broad commonsense case is this  the book of deuteronomy is made up of several great orations or sermons delivered says the work itself by moses to the whole people of the jews before they left the wilderness and entered into the land of canaan wherefore it is called deuteronomy or the second law  in it some small matters of the law are altered as was to be expected when the jews were going to change their place and their whole way of life  but the whole teaching and meaning of the book is exactly that of exodus and leviticus  moreover it is if possible the grandest and deepest book of the old testament  its depth and wisdom are unequalled  i hold it to be the sum and substance of all political philosophy and morality of the true life of a nation  the books of isaiah jeremiah and ezekiel grand as they are are as it were its children growths out of the root which deuteronomy reveals  now if moses did not write it who did  as for the style of it being different from that of exodus and leviticus the simple answer is why not  they are books of history and of laws  this is a book of sermons or orations spoken first and not written which of course would be in a different style besides why should not moses have spoken differently at the end of forty years such experience as never man had before or since every one who thinks writes or speaks in public knows how his style alters as fresh knowledge and experience come to him  are you to suppose that moses gained nothing by his experience  as for a few texts in it being like isaiah or jeremiah they are likely enough to be so for if as i believe deuteronomy was written long before those books what more likely than that isaiah and jeremiah should have studied it and taken some of its words to themselves when they were preaching to the jews just what deuteronomy preaches  as for any one else having written it in moses name hundreds of years after his death i cannot believe it  if there had been in israel a prophet great and wise enough to write deuteronomy we must have heard more about him for he must have been famous at the time when he did live while if he were great enough to write deuteronomy he would have surely written in his own name as isaiah and all the other prophets wrote instead of writing under a feigned name and putting words into moses mouth which he did not speak and laws he did not give  good men are not in the habit of telling lies  much less prophets of god  men do not begin to play cowardly tricks of that kind till after they have lost faith in the living god and got to believe that god was with their forefathers but is not with them  a jew of the time of the apocrypha or of the time of our lord might have done such a thing because he had lost faith in the living god but then his work would have been of a very different kind from this noble and heartstirring book  for the pith and marrow the essence and life of deuteronomy is that it is full of faith in the living god and for that very reason i am going to speak to you today  for the rest whether moses wrote the book down and put it together in the shape in which we now have it we shall never be able to tell  the several orations may have been put together into one book  alterations may have crept in by the carelessness of copiers sentences may have been added to it by later prophetsas of course the grand account of moses death which probably was at first the beginning of the book of joshua  and beyond that we need know nothingeven if we need know that  there the book is and people if they be wise will instead of trying to pick it to pieces read and study it in fear and trembling that the curses pronounced in it may not come and the blessings pronounced in it may come upon this english land  now these jews were to worship and obey jehovah the one true god and him only  and why  why indeed  you must understand why or you will never understand this book of deuteronomy or any part of the old testament and if you do not then you will understand very little if anything of the new  you must understand that this was not to be a mere matter of religion with the old jews this trusting and obeying the true god indeed the word religion so far as i know is never mentioned once in the old testament at all  by religion we now mean some plan of believing and obeying god which will save our souls after we die but moses said nothing to the jews about that  he never even anywhere told them that they would live again after this life  we do not know the reason of that  but we may suppose that he knew best  and as we believe that god sent him we must believe that god knew best also and that he thought it good for these jews not to be told too much about the next life perhaps for fear that they should forget that god was the living god the god of now as well as of hereafter the god of this life as well as of the life to come  my friends i sometimes think we need putting in mind of that in these days as much as those old jews did  however that may be what moses promised these jews if they trusted in the living god was that they should be a great nation they and their children after them that they should drive out the canaanites before them that they should conquer their enemies and that a thousand should flee before one of them that they should be blessed in their crops their orchards their gardens that they should have none of the evil diseases of egypt that there should be none barren among them or among their cattle  in a word that they should be thoroughly and always a strong happy prosperous people  this is what god promised them by moses and nothing else and therefore this is what we must think about and see whether it has anything to do with us when we read the book of deuteronomy and nothing else  on the other hand god warned them by the mouth of moses that if they forgot the lord god and went and worshipped the things round them men or beasts or sun and moon and stars then poverty misery and ruin of every kind would surely fall upon them  and that this last was no empty threat is proved by the plain facts of their sacred history  for they did forget god and worshipped baalim the sun moon and stars and ruin of every kind did come upon them till they were carried away captive to babylon  and this we must think of when we read the book of deuteronomy and nothing else  if they wished to prosper they were to know and consider in their hearts that jehovah was god and there was none else  yes this was the continual thought which a true jew was to have  the thought of a god who was his god the god of his fathers before him and the god of his children after him the god of the whole nation of the jews throughout all their generations  but not their god only  no  the god of the gentiles also of all the nations upon the earth  he was to believe that his god alone of all the gods of the nations was the true and only god who had made all nations and appointed them their times and the bounds of their habitations  we cannot understand now in these happier days all that that meant all the strength and comfort all the godly fear the feeling of solemn responsibility which that thought ought to have given and did give to the jewsthat they were the people of jehovah the one true god  for you must remember that all the nations round them then and all the great heathen nations afterwards were as far as we know the people of some god or other  religion and politics were with them one and the same thing  they had some god or gods whom they looked to as the head or king of their nation who had a special favour to them and would bless and prosper them according as they showed him special reverence and after that god the whole nation was often named  the ammonites god was ammon the hidden god the lord of their sheep and cattle  the zidonians had ashtoreth the moon  the phoenicians worshipped moloch the fire  many of the canaanites worshipped baal the lord or baalim the lordsthe sun moon and stars  the philistines afterwards for we read nothing of philistines in moses time worshipped dagon the fishgod and so forth  the egyptians had gods without numbergods invented out of beasts and birds and the fruits of the earth and the season and the weather and the sun and moon and stars  each class and trade from the highest to the lowest and each city and town throughout the land seems to have had its special god who was worshipped there and expected to take care of that particular class of men or that particular place  what a thought it must have been for the jewsall these people have their gods but they are all wrong  we have the right god the only true god  they are the people of this god or of that we are the people of the one true god  they look to many gods we look to the one god who made all things and beside whom there is none else they look to one god to bless them in one thing and another in another one to send them sunshine one to send them fruitful seasons one to prosper their crops another their flocks and herds and so forth  we look to one god to do all these things for us because he is lord of all at once and has made all  therefore we need not fear the gods of the heathen or cry to any of them even in our utmost distress for we belong to him who is before all gods the god of gods of whom it is written worship him all ye gods and it is the lord who made the heaven and the earth the sea and all that therein is  him only shalt thou worship and him only shalt thou serve  if we obey him and keep his commandments if we trust in him utterly through good fortune and through badthen we must prosper in peace and war we and our children after us because our prosperity is grounded on the real truth and that of the heathen on a lie and all that the heathen expect their false gods to do for them one here and another there all that the one real god will do for us himself alone  do you not see what a power and courage that thought must have given to the jews  do you not see how worshipping god and loving god and serving god must have been a very different a much deeper and a truly holier matter to them than the miserable selfish thing which is miscalled religion by too many people nowadays by which a man hopes to creep out of this world into heaven all by himself without any real care or love for his fellowcreatures or those he leaves behind him  no  an old jews faith in god and obedience to god was part of his family life part of his politics part of his patriotism  if he obeyed god and clave earnestly to god then a blessing would come on him in the field and in the house on his crops and on his cattle going out and coming in and on his children and his childrens children to a thousand generations  he would be helping if he obeyed and trusted god to advance his countrys prosperity to insure her success in war and peace to raise the name and fame of the jewish people among all the nations round that all might say surely this great nation is a wise and an understanding people  thus the duty he owed to god was not merely a duty which he owed his own conscience or his own soul it was a duty which he owed to his family to his kindred to his country  it was not merely an opinion that there was one god and not two it was a belief that the one and only true god was protecting him teaching him inspiring him and all his nation  that the true god would teach their hands to war and their fingers to fight  that the true god would cause their folds to be full of sheep  that their valleys should stand rich with corn that they should laugh and sing  that the true god would enable them to sit every man under his own vine and his own figtree and eat the labour of his hands he and his children after him to perpetual generations  this was the message and teaching which god gave these jews  it is very different from what many people nowadays would have given them if they had had the ordering of the matter and the making of those slaves into a free nation  but perhaps there is one proof that god did give it them and that the bible speaks truth when it says that not man but god gave them their law  no doubt man would have done it differently  but gods ways are not as mans ways nor gods thoughts as mans thoughts  and gods ways have proved themselves to be the right ways  his purpose has come to pass  this little nation of the jews inhabiting a country not as large as wales without seaport towns and commerce without colonies or conquestsand at last for its own sins conquered itself and scattered abroad over the whole civilized worldhas taught the whole civilized world has converted the whole civilized world has influenced all the good and all the wise unto this day so enormously that the world has actually gone beyond them and become christian by fully understanding their teaching and their bible while they have remained mere jews by not fully understanding it  truly if that is not a proof that god revealed something to the jews which they never found out for themselves which was too great for them to understand which was gods boundless message and not any narrow message of mans inventionif that does not prove it i sayi know not what proof men would have  but now i have told you that god bade these jews to look for blessings in this life and blessings on their whole nation and on their children after them if they obeyed and served him  does god not bid us to look for any such blessings  the jews were to be blessed in this world  are we only to be blessed in the next  to that the seventh article of our church gives a plain and positive answer  for it says that those are not to be heard who pretend that the old fathers ie moses and the prophets looked only for transitory promisesie for promises which would pass away  no they looked for eternal promises which could not pass away because they were according to the eternal laws of god which stand good both for this world and for all worlds for this life and for the life everlasting  yes my friends settle in your hearts that the book of deuteronomy is meant for you and for all the nations upon earth as much as for the old jews  that its promises and warnings are to you and to your children as surely as they were to the old jews  ay that they are meant for every nation that is or ever was or ever will be upon earth  if you would prosper on the earth fear god and keep his commandments and know and consider it in your heart that the lord jesus christ he is god in heaven above and on the earth beneath there is none else  he it is who gives grace and honour  he it is who delivers us out of the hands of our enemies  he it is who blesses the fruit of the womb and the fruit of the flock and the fruit of the garden and the field  he is the living god in whom this world as well as the world to come lives and moves and has its being and only by obeying his laws can man prosper he and his children after him upon this earth of god    sermon xvi  national wealth    fifth sunday after easter  deut viii 1118  beware that thou forget not the lord thy god in not keeping his commandments and his judgments and his statutes which i command thee this day  lest when thou hast eaten and art full and hast built goodly houses and dwelt therein and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied and all that thou hast is multiplied then thine heart be lifted up and thou forget the lord thy god which brought thee forth out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness wherein were fiery serpents and scorpions and drought where there was no water who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint who fed thee in the wilderness with manna which thy fathers knew not that he might humble thee and that he might prove thee to do thee good at thy latter end  and thou say in thine heart my power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth  but thou shall remember the lord thy god  for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers as it is this day  i told you before that the book of deuteronomy was the foundation of all sound politicsas one would expect it to be if its author were moses the greatest lawgiver whom the world ever saw  but here in this lesson is a proof of the truth of what i said  for here in the text is moses answer to the first great question in politics what makes a nation prosperous  to that wise men have always answered as moses answered good government government according to the laws of god  that alone makes a nation prosperous  but the multitudewho are not wise men nor likely to be for some time to comegive a different answer  they say what makes a nation prosperous is its wealth  if britain be only rich then she must be safe and right  to which moses being a wise lawgiver and having moreover in him the spirit of the lord who knoweth what is in man makes a reasonable liberal humane answer  moses does not deny that wealth is a good thing  he does not bid them not try to be rich  he takes for granted that they will grow rich that the national fruit of their good government will be that they will increase in cattle and in crops and in money and in all which makes an agricultural people rich  he takes for granted i say that these jews will grow very rich but he warns them that their riches like all other earthly things may be a curse or a blessing to them  nay that they are not good in themselves but mere tools which may be used for good or for evil  he warns them of a very great danger that riches will bring on them  and herein he shows his knowledge of the human heart for it is a certain fact that whenever any nation has prospered and their flocks and herds and silver and gold all that they had have multiplied then they have as moses warned the jews forgotten the lord their god and said my power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth  and it is true also that whenever any nation has begun to say that they have fallen into confusion and misery and sometimes into utter ruin till they repented and turned and remembered the lord their god and found out that the strength of a nation did not consist in riches but in virtue  for it is he that giveth the power to get wealth  he gives it in two ways  first god gives the raw material secondly he gives the wit to use it  you will all agree that god gives the first that he gives the soil the timber the fisheries the coal the iron  do you believe it  i hope and trust that you do  but i fear that nowadays many do not for they boast of the resources of britain as if we ourselves had made britain and not almighty god as if we had put the coal and the iron into the rocks and not almighty god ages before we were born  and if they will not say that openly at least they will say but the coal and iron and all other raw material would have been useless if it had not been for the genius and energy of the british race  of course not  but who gave them that genius and energy  who gave them the wit to find the coal and iron  god and god gave it to us when we needed it and not before  think of this i beseech you for it is true and wonderful and a thing of which i may say come and i will reason with you of the righteous acts of the lord  men say as long as england is ahead of the world in coal and iron she may defy the world  i do not believe it for if she became a wicked nation all the coal and iron in the universe would not keep her from being ruined  but even if it were true which it is not that the strength of britain lies in coal and iron and not in british hearts what right have we to boast of coal and iron  did our forefathers know of them when they came into this land  did they come after coal and iron  not they  they came here to settle as small yeomen to till miserable little patches of corn of which we should be now ashamed and to feed cattle on the moors and swine in the forestsand that was all they looked to  then they found that there was iron principally down south in sussex and surrey and they worked it clumsily enough with charcoal and for more than twelve hundred years they were here in england with no notion of the boundless wealth in iron and coal lying together in the same rocks which god had provided for them or if they did guess at it they could not use it because they could not work deep mines being unable to pump out the water for god had not opened their eyes and shown them how to do it  but just when it was wanted god did show them  about the middle of the last century the iron in the weald was all but worked out the charcoal wood was getting scarcer and scarcer and there was every chance that england instead of being ahead of all nations in iron would have fallen behind other nations and then where should we have been now  but just about one hundred years ago it pleased god to open the eyes of certain men and they invented steamengines  then they could pump the mines then they could discover and use the vast riches of our coalmines  then too sprung up a thousand useful arts and manufactures while the land not being wanted for charcoal and firewood as of old could be cleared of wood and thousands of acres set free to grow corn  population which had been all but standing still without increasing has now more than doubled and wealth inestimable has come to this generation of which our forefathers never dreamed  now what have we to boast of in that  what save to confess ourselves a very stupid race who for twelve hundred years could not discover or at least use the boundless wealth which god had given us because we had not wit enough to invent so simple a thing as a steamengine  all we should do instead of boasting is to bless god that he revealed to us just what we needed and at the very time at which we needed it and confess that it is he that giveth us power to get wealth  it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves  look again at another case even more extraordinary which has happened during our own timesindeed within the last ten yearsthe discovery of gold in australia  there had been rumours and whispers of gold for years before and yet no one looked for gold cared for it hardly believed in it god had dulled their understanding and blinded their eyes for some good purpose of his own  that is what the bible would have said of such a matter and that is what we should say  and at last some man finds lying out upon the downs a huge lump of goldby accident as men call it by the special providence of god as they ought to call it and at that every one starts up and awakes and begins looking for gold  and now that their eyes are opened behold the gold is everywhere  not merely in lonely forests and unexplored mountains but on farms where the sheep have been pastured for years past ay even melbourne streets were full of gold under the feet of the passengers and the wheels of the carriages there had the gold been all along but men could not see it till god opened their eyes  verily verily god is great and man is small  i do not say that this was a miracle in the common meaning of the word but i do say that this was a striking instance of that everlasting and special providence of the living god who ordereth all things in heaven and earth from the rise of a nation to the fall of a sparrow and does so not by breaking his own laws but by making his laws work exactly as he will when he will and where he will and i say that it is a fresh proof of the great saying that no man can see a thing unless god shows it to him  for it is the lord who gives us power to get wealth  it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves and in him we live and move and have our being  this then was what moses commandedto remember that they owed all to god  what they had they had of gods free gift  what they were they were by gods free grace  therefore they were not to boast of themselves their numbers their wealth their armies their fair and fertile land  they were to make their boast of god and of gods goodness  he that gloried was to glory in the lord and confess that a syrian ready to perish was their father jacob when the lord had mercy on him and made him the head of a great tribe and the father of a great nation that not themselves but god had brought them out of egypt with signs and wonders that they got not the land in possession by their own bow neither was it their own sword that helped them but that god had driven out before them nations greater and mightier than they  this they were to remember because it was true  and this we are to remember because it is more or less true of us  god has put us where we are  god has made of us a great nation god has discovered to us the immense riches of this land  it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves  but more  you will see that moses warns them that if they forget god the lord who brought them out of the land of egypt they would go after other gods  he cannot part the two things  if they forget that god brought them out of egypt they will turn to idolatry and so end in ruin  now why was this  why should not the jews have gone on worshipping one god even if they had forgotten that he brought them out of the land of egypt  some people nowadays think that they would and that they might have very well been what is called monotheists without believing all the story of the signs and wonders in egypt and the passage of the red sea and the giving of the law to moses  such men may be very learned but there is one thing of which they know very little and that is human nature  moses knew human nature and he knew that if men forgot that god was the living god the acting god who had helped them once and was helping them always and only believed about there being one god far away in heaven and not two that that sort of dead faith in a dead god would never keep them from idols  they would want gods who would help them who would hear their prayers to whom they could feel gratitude and trust and they would invent them for themselves and begin to worship things in the heavens above and the earth beneath because they had forgotten their true friend and helper the living god  and so shall we  if we forget that god is the living god who brought our forefathers into this land who has revealed to us the wealth of it step by step as we needed it who is helping and blessing us now every day and all the year roundthen we shall begin worshipping other gods  i do not mean that we shall worship idols though i do not see why our childrens children should not do so a few hundred years hence if we teach them to forget the living god  there are too many christians at this day who worship saints and idols of wood and stone and so may our descendants door do even worse  but we ourselves shall beginindeed we are doing it too much alreadyworshipping the socalled laws of nature instead of god who made the laws and so honouring the creature above the creator or else we shall worship the pomps and vanities of this world pride and power money and pleasure and say in our hearts these are our only gods which can help usthese must we obey  which if we do this land of england will come to ruin and shame as surely as did the land of israel in old time  if we do not believe in the living god we shall believe in something worse than even a dead god  for in a dead goda god who does nothing but lets mankind and the world go their own wayno man nor nation ever will care to believe  and now nay dear friends remember that a nation is after all only the people in that nation  you and i and our neighbours and our neighbours neighbours and so forth and that therefore in as far as we are wrong we do our worst to make the british nation wrong  if we give way to ungodly pride and selfsufficiency then we are injuring ourselves and not only that but injuring our neighbours and our children after us as far as we can  and therefore our duty is if we wish well to our nation not to judge our neighbour nor our neighbours neighbour but to judge ourselves  if we go on trusting in ourselves rather than god if we keep within us the hard selfsufficient spirit and boast to ourselves though we may be ashamed to boast to our neighbours my power and the strength of my hands have got me this and that and in fact live under the notion which too many have that we could do very well without gods help if god would let us alonethen we are heaping up ruin and shame for ourselves and for our children after us  ruin and shame i say  we are apt to forget how easy and common it is for god to turn the wisdom of men into folly to frustrate the tokens of the liars and make the prophets mad  how men blow great bubbles and god bursts them with the slightest touch  how when all seems well and men cry peace and safety sudden destruction comes upon them unawares  how when men say soul take thine ease eat drink and be merry thou hast much goods laid up for many years god answers thou fool this night shall thy soul be required of thee  my friends we see god doing thus in these very days by great nations by great branches of industry  look at the american war look at the manchester cotton famine and see how god can confound the strong and cunning and blind their eyes to the ruin which is coming till it is come in all its might  and then think if it be so easy for him to confound such as them is it less easy for him to confound you and me if we begin to fancy that we can do without him and ask doth god perceive it  or is there knowledge in the most high  we are they that ought to speak  who is lord over us  yes in this sense god is indeed a jealous god who will not give his honour to another  and a blessed thing for men it is that god is a jealous god that he will punish us for trusting in anything but himwill punish us for trusting in ourselves or in our wisdom or in wealth or in science or in armies and navies or in constitutions and laws in anything in short save the living god  for if he left us alone to go our own way without trusting or fearing him we should surely go down and down as the chinese seem to have gone down generation after generation till we became only a mere cunning and spiteful sort of animals hateful and hating one another  but when we are chastened for our folly we are chastened by him that we may be partakers of his holiness that we may be his children looking up to him as our father from whom comes every good and perfect gift the father of lights with whom is no variableness or shadow of turning and who therefore will and can give us his children light more and more to understand those his invariable and eternal laws by which he has made earth and heaven who has given us his son jesus christ our lord and will with him likewise freely give us all things    sermon xvii  the god of the rain    fifth sunday after easter  deut xi  11 12  the land whither ye go to possess it is a land of hills and valleys and drinketh water of the rain of heaven  a land which the lord thy god careth for  the eyes of the lord thy god are always upon it from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year  i told you when i spoke of the earthquakes of the holy land that it seems as if god had meant specially to train that strange people the jews by putting them into a country where they must trust him or become cowards and helpless that so they might learn not to fear the powers of nature which the heathen worshipped but to fear him the living god  in this chapter is another instance of the same  they were to be an agricultural people  their very worship was if you can understand such a thing nowadays to be agricultural  pentecost was a feast of the firstfruits of the harvest  the feast of tabernacles was a great national harvest home  the passover itself though not at first an agricultural festival became one by the waving of the paschal sheaf which gave permission to the people to begin their springharvestso thoroughly were they to be an agricultural and cattlefeeding people  they were going into a good land a land of milk and honey and oil olive a land of vines and figs and pomegranates a rich land but a most uncertain landa land which might yield a splendid crop one year and be almost barren the next  it was not as the land of egypta land which was humanly speaking sure to be fertile because always supplied with water brought out of the nile by dykes and channels which spread in a network over every field and whereas i believe is done nowthe labourer turned the water from one land to the other simply by moving the earth with his foot  it was a mountain land a land of hills and valleys and drank water of the rain of heaven a land of fountains of water which required to be fed continually by the rain  in that hot climate it depended entirely on gods providence from week to week whether a crop could grow  therefore it was a land which the lord cared fora land which needed his special help and it had it  the eyes of the lord god were always upon it from the beginning of the year unto the end of the year  beautiful simple noble true wordsdeeper than all the learned words however true they may be and true they are and to be listened to with respect which men talk about the laws of nature and of weather  who would change them for all the scientific phrases in the world  the eyes of the lord were upon the land  it needed his care and therefore his care it had  therefore the jew was to understand from his first entry into the land that his prosperity depended utterly on god  the laws of weather by which the rain comes up off the sea were unknown to him  they are all but unknown to us now  but they were known to god  not a drop could fall without his providence and will and therefore they were utterly in his power  and it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which i command you this day to love the lord your god and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul that i will give you the rain of your land in his due season the first rain and the latter rain that thou mayest gather in thy corn and thy wine and thine oil  and i will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle that thou mayest eat and be full  take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived and ye turn aside and serve other gods and worship them and then the lords wrath be kindled against you and he shut up the heaven that there be no rain and that the land yield not her fruit and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the lord giveth you  now the bible story is that this warning came true  more than once we read of droughtlong and severe and ruinous  in one famous case there was no rain for three years and ahab has to go out to search through the land for a scrap of pasture  peradventure we shall find grass enough to save the horses and mules alive  and most distinctly does the bible say that these droughts came at times when the jews had fallen into idolatry and profligacy therewith  that is the scripture account  and if you believe in the living god whose providence ordereth all things in heaven and earth that account will seem reasonable and credible to you  what special means god used to bring about these great droughts we cannot know any more than we can know why a storm or a shower should come one week and not another  and we need not know  god made the world and god governs the world and that is enough for us  be that as it may moses goes down to the very root and ground and true cause of the riches of the land and of the rainfall and of the prosperity of the jews and of the prosperity of any living nation on earth when he says therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul and bind them for a sign upon your hand that they may be as frontlets between your eyes  ye shall lay up these my words in your heart and your soul and teach them your children when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way when thou liest down and when thou risest up  that is thou shalt believe continually in a living goda god who is working everywhere at every moment about thy path and about thy bed and spying out all thy ways and not only about thee but about all that thou seest  from him comes alike rain and sunshine from him comes the life of man from him comes all which makes it possible for man to live upon the earth  and it is a plain fact that the jews for a long time did believe thisat least the prophets psalmists and good men among themto the most intense degree to a degree in which perhaps no nation has believed it since  with them god is everything and man nothing man finds out nothing  god reveals it to him  mans intellect does nothing  the spirit of god gives him understanding to do iteven says isaiah understanding to plough and to sow and to reap his crops in due season  it is the spirit of god according to the prophets and psalmists which makes the difference between a man and a beast  but upon the beasts too and the green things of the earth and on all nature the spirit of god works  he is the lord and giver of life  take only those four psalms the 8th 18th 29th 104th and learn from them what the old jews thought of this wonderful world in which we live  these all wait upon theeall living things by land and seathat thou mayest give them meat in due season  when thou givest it them they gather it  when thou openest thy hand they are filled with good  when thou hidest thy face they are troubled  when thou takest away their breath they die and are turned again to their dust  when thou lettest thy breath go forth they shall be made and thou shalt renew the face of the earth  so again in the world of man god is the living judge the living overlooker rewarder punisher of every man not only in the life to come but in this life  his providence is a special providence but not such a poor special providence as men are too apt to dream of nowadays which interferes only now and then on some great occasion or on behalf of some very favoured persons but a special providence looking after every special act of man and of the whole universe from the fall of a sparrow to the fall of an empire  and it is this intense faith in the living god which can only come by the inspiration of the spirit of god which proves the old testament to be truly inspired  this it is which makes it different from all books in the world  this it is i hold which marks the canon of scripture  for in the apocryphatrue noble and good as most of it isyou do not find the same intense faith in the living god or anything to be compared therewith and that for the simple reason that the jews at the time the apocrypha was written were losing that faith very fast  they felt themselves that there was an immense difference between anything that they could write and what the old psalmists and prophets had written  they felt that they could not write scripture  all they could do was to write commentaries about it and to carry out in their own fashion moses command thou shalt bind my words for a sign upon your hands and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes and thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thine house  they were right in that but as they lost faith in the living god they began to observe the command in the letter and neglect it in the spirit  you knowsome of you at leasthow these words were misused afterwards how the scribes and the pharisees in their zeal to carry out the letter of the law went about with texts of scripture on their foreheads and wrists and the hems of their robes enlarging their phylacteries as our lord said of them  but all the time they did not understand the texts or love them or get any good from them but only made them excuses for hating and scoffing at the rest of the world  they had them written only on their foreheads not on their heartsan outside and not an inside religion  they had lost all faith in the living god  god had spoken of course to their forefathers but they could not believe that he was speaking to themnot even when he spoke by his only begotten son the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person  god so they held had finished his teaching when malachi uttered his last prophecy  and now it was for them to teach and expound the law at secondhand  there could be no more prophets no more revelation and when one came and spoke with authority at first hand out of the depth of his own heart he was to be persecuted stoned crucified  no  they had the key of knowledge and no man could enter in unless they chose to open the door  nothing new could be true  john the baptist came neither eating nor drinking and they said he hath a devil  the son of man came eating and drinking and they said behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinners  and meanwhile the poor the ignorant those whose hearts were really in earnest were looking out for a prophet and a delivereroften going after false prophets with theudas and barcochab into the wilderness but going too to be baptized with the baptism of john and crowding in thousands to hear our lord preach to them of the living god of whom moses had preached of old while the scribes and pharisees sat at home wrapped up in their narrow shallow book divinity and said this people who knoweth not the law is accursed  nothing new could be true  it must be put down persecuted down lest the romans should come and take away their place and nation  but they did not succeed  our lord and his truth whom they crucified and buried rose again the third day and conquered and the romans came after all and took away their place and nation and so they failed as all will fail who will not believe in the living god  my friends all these things were written for our example  as it was then so may it be again  there may come a time in this land when people shall profess to worship the word of god and yet like those old scribes make it of none effect by their own commandments and traditions  when they shall command men like the scribes to honour every word and letter of the bible and yet forbid them to take the bible simply and literally as it stands but only their interpretation of the bible when they shall say with the scribes nothing new can be true god taught the apostles and therefore he is not teaching us  god worked miracles of old but whosoever thinks that god is working miracles now is a pantheist and a blasphemer  god taught men of old the thing which they knew not but whosoever dares to say that he does so now is bringing heresy and false doctrine and undermining the christian faith by science falsely so called  and all because they have lost all faith in the living godthe everworking everteaching everinspiring evergoverning god whom our lord jesus christ revealed to men in whom the apostles and the fathers and the great middleage schoolmen and the reformers believed and therefore learned more and more and taught men more and more concerning god and the dealings of god as time went on  and then when they see ignorant people running after quacks and impostors spiritrappers and tableturners st simonians and mormons and false prophets of every kind they will have nothing to say but this people which knoweth not the law is accursed  while when they see anything like new truth or new teaching from god appear instead of welcoming the light and going to meet the light and accepting the light they will say what shall we do  for all men will believe on him and then the powers of this world will come and take away our station and our order  as if christ could not take better care of his church for which he died than they can in his stead  and so they will persecute gods servants in the name of god and call upon the law to put down by force the men whom they cannot put down by reason  from ever falling into that state of stupid lipbelief and outward religion and loss of faith in the living god  good lord deliver us  from all blindness of heart from pride vainglory and hypocrisy from envy hatred and malice and all uncharitableness  good lord deliver us  from all false doctrine heresy and schism from hardness of heart and contempt of thy word and commandment  good lord deliver us  for if people ever fall into that frame of mind as did the scribes and pharisees and the good lord do not deliver them from it it will surely happen to them as it is written in the bible  the powers of this world will come and take away their place and their power and their station  but meanwhile the truth which they think that they have stifled will rise again for christ who is the truth will raise it again and it shall conquer and leaven the hearts of men till all be leavened and while the scribes and pharisees shall be cast into the outer darkness of discontented and hopeless bigotry the kingdoms of the world which they fancied were the devils dominion shall become the kingdoms of god and of his christ and be adopted into that holy and evergrowing church of which it is written that the gates of hell shall not prevail against it for in it is the spirit of god to lead it into all truth  to which blessed end may god bring us and our children after us amen    sermon xviii  the death of moses    first sunday after trinity  deut xxxiv 5 6  so moses the servant of the lord died there in the land of moab according to the word of the lord  and he buried him in a valley in the land of moab over against bethpeor but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day  some might regret that the last three chapters of deuteronomy are not read among our sunday lessons  there was not however room for them and i do not doubt that those who chose our lessons knew better than i what chapters they ought to choose  we may however read them for ourselves not only in the daily lessons but as often as we choose  and well worth reading they are  for i know of no stronger proof of the truth of the book of deuteronomy and of the whole pentateuch than its ending so differently from what we should have expected or indeed wished  if things went in this world as they do in novels and fables according to mans notion of what is right and good then moses and his history would have had a very different ending  and if the story of moses had been of mans invention we should have heardi think from what we know of the fables myths as they call them now which nations have invented about themselves and their own early history we may guess fairly what we should have heardhow moses brought the jews into the land of canaan and established his laws and reigned over them and died in honour and great gloryif he died at all and was not taken up into the skies and changed into a star or into a god and how he was buried with great pomp and how his sepulchre did remain among the jews until that day and probably how men worshipped at it and miracles were worked at it and so forth  also we should have heard how as soon as the israelites came into the land of canaan they began forthwith to serve the lord with all their heart and soul as they never did afterwards and to keep moses law while it was yet fresh in their minds more exactly than ever they did afterwards and in short we should have had one of those stories of a golden age a good old time a patterntime of early purity and devotion of which nations and churches of all tongues and all creeds have been so ready to dream in their own case and which they have used not altogether ill to rebuke vice in their own day by saying look how perfect your forefathers were  look how you their unworthy children have fallen from their faith and their virtue  this i think is what we should have been told if the pentateuch had been the invention of man  this is exactly what we are not told but on the contrary the very opposite  what we are told is disappointing sad gloomy full of dark fears and warnings about what the jews will be and what they will have to endure  but it is far more true to human nature and to the facts which we see in the world about us than any story of a good old time would have been  they are still wandering in the land of moab when the time draws near when moses must die  he is a hundred and twenty years old but hale and vigorous still  his eye is not dim nor his natural force abated  but the lord has told him that his death is near  he gives the command of the army of israel to joshua the son of nun and then he speaks his last words  songs they are dark and rugged like all the higher hebrew poetry but like it full of the very spirit of godthe spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of faith and of the fear of the lord  there are three of these songs which seem to belong to those last days of his  the prayer of moses the man of godwhich is our 90th psalm our burial psalm  we all know the sadness of that psalm its weariness as of one who had laboured long and would fain be at rest its confession of mans frailtyfading away suddenly like the grass its confession of gods strength god from everlasting before the mountains were brought forth its eternal gospel of hope and comfort that the strength of god takes pity on the weakness of man lord thou hast been our refuge from one generation to another  then comes the song of the rockthe song of which it seems the lord said to him write this song and teach it the children of israel that it may be a witness for me against them  and so moses writes and seemingly before all the congregation of israel according to the custom of those times he chants his death song the song of the rock  it is such a song as we should expect from him  god is the rock  he was thinking it may be of the everlasting rocks of sinai where god had appeared to him of old but god is the true everlasting rock on which all things rest the eternal the selfexistent the i am whom he was sent to preach to men  but he is a good and righteous god likewise  his work is perfect  a god of truth and without iniquity just and right is he  in him moses can trust but not in the children of israel they are a perverse and crooked generation who have waxen fat and kicked god has done all for them but they will not obey him  even in the wilderness they have worshipped strange gods and sacrificed to devils not to god and so they will do after moses is gone and then on them will come all the curses of which he has so often warned them  the sword without and terror within shall destroy both the young man and the virgin the suckling also with the man of gray hairs  o that they were wise that they understood this that they would consider their latter end  how should one chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight  what a people they might be and what a future there is before them if they would but be true to god  but they will not  and so moses deathsong like his lifes wish ends in disappointment and sadness and dread of the evils which are coming upon his beloved countrymen  lastly he blesses them tribe by tribe in strange and grand words such as dying men utter who looking earnestly across the dark river of death see further than they ever saw amid the cares and temptations of life  and he blesses them  he will say nothing of them but good  he will speak not of what they will be but of what they ought to be and can be  but not in their own strengthonly in the strength of god  man is to be nothing to the last and god is all in all  there is none like unto the god of jeshurun who rideth upon the heaven in thy help and in his excellency on the sky  the eternal god is thy refuge and underneath are the everlasting arms  happy art thou o israel  who is like unto thee o people saved by the lord the shield of thy help and who is the sword of thy excellency and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee and thou shalt tread upon their high places  those are the last words of moses  then he goes up into the mountain top never to return and the children of israel are left alone with god and their own souls to obey and prosper or disobey and die  the time of their schooling is past and their schoolmaster is gone for ever  they are no more to be under a human tutor  they are come to mans estate and mans responsibility and they are to work out their own fortunes by their own deeds like every other soul of man  for moses himself must not enter into the promised land  in spite of all his faith his courage his endurance his patriotism he has sinned against god and he must be punished and punished too in kindin the very thing which he will feel most deeply in being shut out from the very happiness on which he has set his heart all along  he who has brought the jews to the edge of the promised land must not have the honour and glory of taking them into it  he must have no honour and glory  that must be gods alone  man must be nothing and god all in all  moses must die in faith not having received the promises as many another saint of god has died  and why  to teach him and the jews and us that man is nothing and god is all in all  moses had given way to the very temptation which would beset such a man  he had spoken unadvisedly with his lips and said hear now ye rebels or ye fools must we bring you water out of this rock we and not god  he had claimed for himself the power and glory of working miracles  the miracles he thought for a moment were his and not gods  and it may be that this was not the only time that he had so sinned  he may naturally have thought that he had some special power and influence with god  but be that as it may the jews were trained to believe that the miracles were gods gods immediate work and not performed by the wisdom or sanctity or supernatural power of any saint or prophet whatsoever  let the jews once learn to give the honour and glory to moses and not to god and the whole of their strange education went for nothing  instead of worshipping god they would begin to worship saints  instead of trusting in god they would begin to trust in men whether on earth or in heaven matters not  if moses was to have the honour and glory the jews would surely grow into a superstitious saint worshipping miraclemongering people and come to ruin and slavery thereby  they were to fear god and nought else  to trust in god and nought else  so moses must vanish out of their sight sadly and mysteriously all they know of him is that he is punished for a sin which he committed long ago as you and i may be  all they know of his death and burial is that his body was not left foully to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field for the lord buried him  they know not how and did not need to know  and we need not know  enough for them and for us to know that no dishonour was done to the grand old man that as he died far away on the lonely mountain top without a child to close his eyes his last look fixed upon the good land and large which lay spread out below of entering which he had been dreaming for fortyit may be for more than fortyyears  enough for us to know that the kindly earth received his body again into her bosom and that the true mosesthe immortal spirit of the man returned to god who created him and inspired him and sustained him to be perhaps the greatest mansave one who was more than manwho ever trod this earth  so our human feelings like those of the jews are satisfied  but moses is not to be worshipped by them or by us no splendid temple is to rise over his bones no lamps are to burn or priest to chant round his shrine no miracles are to be worked by his relics no man is to invoke his patronage and intercession in their prayers  the people whom he has brought out of egypt are to be freefree from the slavery of the body free from the more degrading slavery of the soul  and so they go on over jordan to fulfil their strange destiny to fight their way into the promised land to root out the canaanite tribes whose iniquity was full whose sins had made them a nuisance not to be suffered on the earth of god  but do they go to establish a golden age to become a perfect people  nothing less  to become according to the book of judges just what moses foretoldan ignorant selfish often profligate and disorderly people doing each what is right in his own eyes falling continually into idolatry civil war and slavery to the heathens round about  nothing more shows the truth of this history than its humility its continual confession of sin its readiness to confess the ugly truth that the jews are a foolish ignorant unmanageable lawless sensual race stiffnecked and rebellious always resisting the holy spirit  the immense difference between the old testament history and that of all other nations is that it is a history not of their virtues but of their sins and a history on the other hand of gods punishments and mercies  god in the old testament is all and the jews are nothing and one may say that it differs from all other histories in this that it is not a history of the jews themselves at all but a history of gods dealings with them  if any man chooses to explain that by saying that the story was all invented by priests and prophets afterwards to rebuke the people for falling into idolatry he must have his fancy  thought is free for the present at leastthough it is written that for every idle word that men speak they shall give account at the day of judgment but one question i must ask and i am sure that british common sense and british honesty will ask it too  if these prophets were really good men fearing god and wishing to make their countrymen fear him likewise would it not have been a rather strange way of showing that they feared god to tell their countrymen a set of fables and lies  good men are not in the habit of telling lies now and never have been for no lie is of the truth or can possibly help the truth in any way and all liars have their portion in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone  and that such men as the prophets of whom we read in the old testament did not know that and therefore invented this history or invented anything else is a thing incredible and absurd  here we have the old testament an infinitely good book giving us infinitely good advice and good news and news too concerning god gods laws gods providence gods dealings such as we get nowhere else  and shall we believe that this infinitely good book is founded upon falsehood or that the good men who wrote it could fancy it necessary to stoop to falsehood and take the devils tools wherewith to do gods work  that they may have been imperfectly informed on some points there is no doubt for the bible tells us that they were men of like passions with ourselves and they may not always have been true to the spirit of god who was teaching them even as we are not though he teaches us  they only knew in part and prophesied in part and now that which is perfect is come that which is in part is done away the mystery of christ was not revealed to them as it has been to us by the holy apostles and prophets of the new dispensation of which st paul says comparing it with the knowledge which the old jews had when the gospel came that the glory of the law had no glory by reason of the more excellent glory of the gospel  they may i say have made slight errors in unimportant matters though it is far more probable that those errors have crept into the text as the scriptures were copied again and again through many centuries by different scribes of whose perfect good sense and honesty we cannot be certain  but who that really values his bible cares for them any more than he cares for the spots on the sun which he can find through a telescope  the sun still shines and gives light to the whole earth and the bible still shines and gives light to every soul of man who will read it in reverence and faith  but that the prophets ever invented or ever dared to tamper with truth is a thing not to be believed of men whose writings are plainly by their own meaning and end inspired by the holy spirit of god  one more reasonand a reason which to me is unanswerablefor believing like our forefathers that the old testament is true the old testament as well as the new tells us of the noble acts of the lordof certain gracious and merciful and just things which the lord did to the children of israel  but if that be not true what follows  that god has not done the noble acts which men thought he had and therefore that god is not as noble as men thought he was that men have actually fancied for themselves a better god than the god who exists already  absurd  absurd truly and if you choose to call it by a harder name still you have a right to do so  do not you think that god must be better not worse more generous not less more condescending not less more just not less more helpful not less than man can fancy or describe  are not the riches of christ unsearchable and the mercies of the lord boundless  is he not able and willing to do exceeding abundantly beyond all that we can ask or think  did not even st paul say that he only knew in part and prophesied in part  and must it not be true of the whole bible what the beloved apostle st john says of his own gospel and there are many other things which jesus did the which if they should be written every one i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written  bear that in mind remembering always that the god of the old testament is the god of the new likewise and whenever you read either in the old or new testament of the noble acts of the lord say boldly as millions of hearts have said already when the good news of the bible came to them this is so beautiful that it must be true  the spirit of god in the bible and the judgment of the church in all ages bears witness with my spirit that this is true so ought god to have done and therefore surely so hath god done shall not the judge of all the earth do right    footnotes  0a  evidences part iii  cap iii  0b  lectures on the jewish church lect xviii p 401  7  i must say that all attempts to put a later date on these books seems to me to fail simply from want of evidence  i must say also that all attempts to distinguish between jehovistic and elohistic documents with the exception perhaps of the first chapter of genesis seem to me to fail likewise and that the theory of an elohistic and a jehovistic sect has received its reductionem ad absurdum in a certain recent criticism of the psalms
