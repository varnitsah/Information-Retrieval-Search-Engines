73173512	the disentanglers by andrew lang   with illustrations by h j ford  second impression  longmans green and co 39 paternoster row london new york and bombay 1903  to herbert hills esq these studies of life and character are dedicated     preface   it has been suggested to the author that the incident of the berbalangs in the adventure of the fair american is rather improbable  he can only refer the sceptical to the perfectly genuine authorities cited in his footnotes     i  the great idea   the scene was a dusky shabby little room in ryder street  to such caves many repair whose days are passed and whose food is consumed in the clubs of the adjacent thoroughfare of cooperative palaces pall mall  the furniture was battered and dingy the sofa on which logan sprawled had a certain historic interest it was covered with cloth of horsehair now seldom found by the amateur  a bookcase with glass doors held a crowd of books to which the amateur would at once have flown  they were in boards of faded blue and the paper labels bore alluring names they were all first editions of the most desirable kind  the bottles in the liqueur case were antique a coat of arms not undistinguished was in relief on the silver stoppers  but the liquors in the flasks were humble and conventional  merton the tenant of the rooms was in a zingari cricketing coat he occupied the armchair while logan in evening dress maintained a difficult equilibrium on the slippery sofa  both men were of an age between twentyfive and twentynine both were pleasant to the eye  merton was if anything under the middle height fair slim and active  as a freshman he had coxed his college eight later he rowed bow in that vessel  he had won the hurdles but been beaten by his cambridge opponent he had taken a fair second in greats was believed to have been runner up for the newdigate prize poem and might have won other laurels but that he was found to do the female parts very fairly in the dramatic performances of the university a thing irreconcilable with study  his father was a rural dean  mertons most obvious vice was a thirst for general information  i know it is awfully bad form to know anything he had been heard to say but everyone has his failings and mine is occasionally useful  logan was tall dark athletic and indolent  he was in a way the last of an historic scottish family and rather fond of discoursing on the ancestral traditions  but any satisfaction that he derived from them was so far all that his birth had won for him  his little patrimony had taken to itself wings  merton was in no better case  both as they sat together were gloomily discussing their prospects  in the penumbra of smoke and the malignant light of an ill trimmed lamp the great idea was to be evolved  what consequences hung on the great idea  the peace of families insured at a trifling premium  innocence rescued  the defeat of the subtlest criminal designers undreamed of benefits to natural science  but i anticipate  we return to the conversation in the ryder street den  it is a case of emigration or the workhouse said logan  emigration  what can you or i do in the colonies  they provide even their own ushers  my only available assets a little greek and less latin are drugs in the melbourne market answered merton they breed their own dominies  protection  in america they might pay for lessons in the english accent     said logan  but not said merton in the scotch which is yours oh distant cousin of a marquis  consequently by rich american lady pupils you are not one to be desired  tommy you are impertinent said logan  oh hang it where is there an opening a demand for the broken the stoney broke  a man cannot live by casual paragraphs alone  and these generally reckoned too hightoned for our readers said merton  if i could get the secretaryship of a golf club logan sighed  if you could get the chancellorship of the exchequer  i reckon that there are two million applicants for secretaryships of golf clubs  or a land agency logan murmured  oh be practical cried merton  be inventive  be modern  be up to date  think of something new  think of a felt want as the covenanting divine calls it a real public need hitherto but dimly present and quite a demand without a supply  but that means thousands in advertisements said logan even if we ran a hairrestorer  the ground bait is too expensive  i say i once knew a fellow who groundbaited for salmon with potted shrimps  make a paragraph on him then said merton  but results proved that there was no felt want of potted shrimpsor not of a fly to follow  your collaboration in the search the hunt for money the quest consists merely in irrelevancies and objections growled merton lighting a cigarette  lucky devil peter nevison  meets an heiress on a channel boat with 4000l a year and there he is  logan basked in the reflected sunshine  cut by her people thoughand other people  i could not have faced the row with her people said merton musingly  i dont wonder they moved heaven and earth and her uncle the bishop to stop it  not eligible peter was not however you took him logan reflected  took too much of this he pointed to the heraldic flask  well she took him  it is not much that parents still less guardians can do now when a girls mind is made up  the emancipation of woman is the opportunity of the indigent male struggler  women have their way logan reflected  and the youth of the modern aged is the opportunity of our sisters the girls on the make said merton  what a lot of old men of title are marrying young women as hard up as we are  and then said logan the offspring of the deceased marchionesses make a fuss  in fact marriage is always the signal for a family row  it is the infernal family row that i never could face  i had a chance  merton seemed likely to drop into autobiography  i know said logan admonishingly  well hanged if i could take it and sheshe could not stand it either and both of us  do not be elegiac interrupted logan  i know  still i am rather sorry for peoples people  the unruly affections simply poison the lives of parents and guardians aye and of the children too  the aged are now so hasty and imprudent  what would not tala have given to prevent his grace from marrying mrs tankerville  merton leapt to his feet and smote his brow  wait dont speak to mea great thought flushes all my brain  hush  i have it and he sat down again pouring seltzer water into a half empty glass  have what asked logan  the felt want  but the accomplices  but the advertisements suggested logan  a few pounds will cover them  i can sell my books merton sighed  a lot of advertising your first editions will pay for  why even to launch a hairrestorer takes  oh but merton broke in this want is so widely felt acutely felt too hair is not in it  but where are the accomplices  if it is gentleman burglars i am not concerned  no raffles for me  if it is venal physicians to kill off rich relations the lives of the logans are sacred to me  bosh said merton i want lady friends as tennyson says nice girls well born well bred trying to support themselves  what do you want them for  to support them  i want them as accomplices said merton  as collaborators  blackmail asked logan  has it come to this  i draw the line at blackmail  besides they would starve first good girls would or marry lord methusalem or a beastly south african richard  robert logan of restalrig that should bemerton spoke impressivelyyou know me to be incapable of practices however lucrative which involve taint of crime  i do not prey upon the society which i propose to benefit  but where are the girls  where are they not logan asked  dawdling as jesters from country house to country house  in the british museum verifying references for literary gents if they can get references to verify  asking leave to describe their friends parties in the leidys news  trying for places as golfing governesses or bridge governesses or gymnastic mistresses at girls schools or lady laundresses or typewriters or lady teachers of cookery or pegs to hang costumes on at dressmakers  the most beautiful girl i ever saw was doing that once i met her when i was shopping with my aunt who left her money to the armenians  you kept up her acquaintance  the girls i mean merton asked  we have occasionally met  in fact  yes i know as you said lately merton remarked  thats one anyhow and there is mary willoughby who got a second in history when i was up she would do  better business for her than the british museum  i know three or four  i know five or six  but what for logan insisted  to help us in supplying the widely felt want which is my discovery said merton  and that is  disentanglersof both sexes  a large and varied staff calculated to meet every requirement and cope with every circumstance  merton quoted an unwritten prospectus  i dont follow  what the deuce is your felt want  what we were talking about  ground bait for salmon logan reverted to his idea  no  family rows about marriages  nasty letters  refusals to recognise the choice of a son a daughter or a widowed but youthful old parent among the upper classes  harsh words  refusals to allow meetings or correspondence  broken hearts  improvident marriages  preaching down a daughters heart or an aged parents heart or a nephews or a nieces or a wards or anybodys heart  peace restored to the household intended marriage off and nobody a penny the worse unless  unless what said logan  practical difficulties said merton will occur in every enterprise but they wont be to our disadvantage the reverseif they dont happen too often  and we can guard against that by a scientific process  now will you explain logan asked or shall i pour this whisky and water down the back of your neck  he rose to his feet menace in his eye  bear fighting barred  we are no longer boys  we are menbroken men sit down dont play the bear said merton  well explain or i fire  dont you see  the problem for the family for hundreds of families is to get the undesirable marriage off without the usual row  very few people really like a row  daughter becomes anaemic foreign cures are expensive and no good  son goes to the devil or the cape  aged and opulent but amorous parent leaves everything he can scrape together to disapproved of new wife  relations cut each other all round  not many people really enjoy that kind of thing  they want a pacific solutionmarriage off no remonstrances  and how are you going to do it  why said merton by a scientific and thoroughly organised system of disengaging or disentangling  we enlist a lot of girls and fellows like ourselves beautiful attractive young or not so young well connected intellectual athletic and of all sorts of types but all broke all without visible means of subsistence  they are people welcome in country houses but travelling third class and devilishly perplexed about how to tip the servants how to pay if they lose at bridge and so forth  we enlist them we send them out on demand carefully selecting our agents to meet the circumstances in each case  they go down and disentangle the amorous bywell by entangling them  the lovers are off with the old love the love which causes all the worry without being on with the new loveour agent  the thing quietly fizzles out  quietly logan snorted  i like quietly  they would be on with the new love  dont you see you born gomeral that the person man or woman who deserts the inconvenient ai put an a b casefalls in love with your agent b and your b is by the nature of the thing more ineligible than atoo poor  a babe could see that  you disappoint me merton  you state said merton one of the practical difficulties which i foresaw  not that it does not suit us very well  our comrade and friend man or woman gets a chance of a good marriage and logan there is no better thing  but parents and guardians would not stand much of that of people marrying our agents  of course they wouldnt  your idea is crazy  wait a moment said merton  the resources of science are not yet exhausted  you have heard of the epochmaking discovery of jenner and its beneficent results in checking the ravages of smallpox that scourge of the human race  oh dont talk like a printed book logan remonstrated  everybody has heard of vaccination  and you are aware that similar prophylactic measures have been adopted with more or less of success in the case of other diseases  i am aware said logan that you are in danger of personal suffering at my hands as i already warned you  what is love but a disease merton asked dreamily  a french savant monsieur janet says that nobody ever falls in love except when he is a little bit off colour i forget the french equivalent  i am coming for you logan arose in wrath  sit down  well your objection which it did not need the eyes of an argus to discover is that the patients the lovers young whose loves are disapproved of by the family will fall in love with our agents insist on marrying them and so the last state of these afflicted parentsor childrenwill be worse than the first  is that your objection  of course it is and crushing at that logan replied  then science suggests prophylactic measures something akin to vaccination merton explained  the agents must be warranted immune nice new word  how  the object merton answered is to make it impossible or highly improbable that our agents after disentangling the affections of the patients curing them of one attack will accept their addresses offered in a second fit of the fever  in brief the agents must not marry the patients or not often  but how can you prevent them if they want to do it  by a process akin in the emotional region of our strangely blended nature to inoculation  hanged if i understand you  you keep on repeating yourself  you dodder  our agents must have got the disease already the pretty fever and be safe against infection  there must be on the side of the agent a prior attachment  now dont interrupt there always is a prior attachment you are in love i am in love he she and they all of the broken brigade are in love all the more because they have not a chance cursed be the social wants that sin against the strength of youth  so you see our agents will be quite safe not to crown the flame of the patients not to accept them if they do propose or expect a proposal every security from infection guaranteed  there is the felt want  here is the remedy not warranted absolutely painless but salutary and tending to the amelioration of the species  so we have only to enlist the agents and send a few advertisements to the papers  my first editions must go  farewell shelley tennyson keats uncut waverleys byron the waltz early kiplings at a vast reduction on account of the overflooded state of the market  farewell kilmarnock edition of burns and colonel lovelace his lucasta and tamerlane by mr poe and the rest  the money must be raised  merton looked resigned  i have nothing to sell said logan but an entire set of clubs by philp  guaranteed unique and in exquisite condition  you must part with them said merton  we are like palissy the potter feeding his furnace with the drawingroom furniture  but how about the recruiting logan asked  its like one of these novels where you begin by collecting desperados from all quarters and then the shooting commences  well we need not ransack the colonies merton replied  patronise british industries  we know some fellows already and some young women  i say logan interrupted what a dab at disentangling lumley would have been if he had not got that professorship of toxicology at edinburgh and been able to marry miss wingan at last  yes and miss wingan would have been useful  what a lively girl ready for everything merton replied  but these we can still get at logan asked how are you to be sure that they arevaccinated  the inquiry is delicate merton admitted but the fact may be almost taken for granted  we must give a dinner a preliminary expense to promising collaborators and champagne is a great promoter of success in delicate inquiries  in vino veritas  i dont know if there is money in it but there is a kind of larkiness logan admitted  yes i think there will be larks  about the dinner  we are not to have johnnies disguised as hansom cabbies driving about and picking up men and women that look the right sort in the streets and compelling them to come in  oh no that expense we can cut  it would not do with the women obviously heavens what queer fishes that net would catch  the flag of the disentanglers shall never be stained byanything  you know some likely agents i know some likely agents  they will suggest others as our field of usefulness widens  of course there is the oath of secrecy we shall administer that after dinner to each guest apart  jolly difficult for those that are mixed up with the press to keep an oath of secrecy  logan spoke as a press man  we shall only have to do with gentlemen and ladies  the oath is not going to sanction itself with religious terrors  good formwe shall appeal to a sense of formnow so widely diffused by university extension lectures on the beautiful the fitting the  oh shut up cried logan  you always haver after midnight  for look here here is an objection this precious plan of yours parents and others could work it for themselves  i dare say they do  when they see the affections of a son or a daughter or a bereaved father beginning to stray towards a they probably invite b to come and stay and act as a lightning conductor  they dont need us  oh dont they  they seldom have an eligible and satisfactory lightning conductor at hand somebody to whom they can trust their dear one  or if they have the dear one has already been bored with the intended lightning conductor who is old or plain or stupid or familiar at best and they wont look at him or her  now our disentanglers are not going to be plain or dull or old or stale or commonplacewell take care of that  my dear fellow dont you know how dismal the parti selected for a man or girl invariably is  now we provide a different and superior article a fresh article too not a familiar bore or a neighbour  well there is a good deal in that as you say logan admitted  but decent people will think the whole speculation shady  how are you to get round that  there is something you have forgotten  what merton asked  why it stares you in the face  references  unexceptionable references people will expect them all round  please dont say unexceptionable say references beyond the reach of cavil  merton was a purist  it costs more in advertisements but my phrase at once enlists the sympathy of every liberal and elegant mind but as to references and i am glad that you have some common sense logan there is let me see there is the dowager  the divine althaeamarchioness of bowton  the same said merton  the oldest woman and the most recklessly up todate in london  she has seen bien dautres and wants to see more  she will do and my aunt logan said  not oh of course not the one who left her money to the armenians merton asked  no another  and theres old lochmabens young wife my cousin widely removed by marriage  she is american you know and perhaps you know her book social experiments  yes it is not half bad merton conceded and her heart will be in what i fear she will call the new departure  and she is pretty and highly respected in the parish  and theres my aunt i spoke of or great aunt miss nicky maxwell  the best old thing a beautiful monument of old gentility and she would give her left hand to help any one of the clan  she will do  and theres mrs brownsmith lord yarrows daughter who married the patent soap man  elle est capable de tout  a real good woman but full of her fun  that will do for the lady patronesses  we must secure them at once  but wont the clients blab logan suggested  they cant merton said  they would be laughed at consumedly  it will be their interest to hold their tongues  well let us hope that they will see it in that light  logan was not too sanguine  merton had a better opinion of his enterprise  people if they come to us at all for assistance in these very delicate and intimate affairs will have too much to lose by talking about them they may not come we can only try but if they come they will be silent as the grave usually is  well it is late and the whisky is low said logan in mournful tones may the morrows reflections justify the inspiration ofthe whisky good night  good night said merton absently  he sat down when logan had gone and wrote a few notes on large sheets of paper  he was elaborating the scheme  if collaboration consists in making objections as the french novelist said logan is a rare collaborator merton muttered as he turned out the pallid lamp and went to bed  next morning before dressing he revolved the scheme  it bore the change of light and survived the inspiration of alcohol  logan looked in after breakfast  he had no new objections  they proceeded to action     ii  from the highways and hedges   the first step towards mertons scheme was taken at once  the lady patronesses were approached  the divine althaea instantly came in  she had enjoyed few things more since the duchess of richmonds ball on the eve of waterloo  miss nicky maxwell at first professed a desire to open her coffers only anticipating she said an eventwhich logan declined in any sense to anticipate  lady lochmaben said that they would have a lovely time as experimental students of society  mrs brownsmith instantly offered her own services as a disentangler her lord being then absent in america studying the negro market for detergents  i think she said he expects brownsmiths brand to make an ethiopian change his skin and then means to exhibit him as an advertisement  and settle the negro question by making them all white men said logan as he gracefully declined the generous but compromising proposal of the lady  yet after all thought he is she not right  the prophylactic precautions would certainly be increased morally speaking if the disentanglers were married  but while he pigeonholed this idea for future reference at the moment he could not see his way to accepting mrs brownsmiths spirited idea  she reluctantly acquiesced in his view of the case but like the other dames promised to guarantee if applied to the absolute respectability of the enterprise  the usual vows of secrecy were made and what borders on the supernatural they were kept  mertons first editions went to sothebys property of a gentleman who is changing his objects of collection  a russian archduke bought logans unique set of golf clubs by philp  funds accrued from other sources  logan had a friend dearer friend had no man one trevor a pleasant bachelor whose sister kept house for him  his purse or rather his cheque book gaped with desire to be at logans service but had gaped in vain  finding logan grinning one day over the advertisement columns of a paper at the club his prophetic soul discerned a good thing and he wormed it out in dern privacy  he slapped his manly thigh and insisted on being in itas a capitalist  the other stoutly resisted but was overcome  you need an office you need retaining fees you need outfits for the accomplices and it is a legitimate investment  ill take interest and risks said trevor  so the money was found  the inaugural dinner for the engaging of accomplices was given in a private room of a restaurant in pall mall  the dinner was gay but a little pathetic  neatness rather than the gloss of novelty though other gloss there was characterised the garments of the men  the toilettes of the women were modest that amount of praise and it is a good deal they deserved  a young lady miss maskelyne an amberhued beauty who practically lived as a female jester at the houses of the great shone resplendent indeed but magnificence of apparel was demanded by her profession  i am so tired of it she said to merton  fancy being more and more anxious for country house invitations  fancy an artists feelings when she knows she has not been a success  and then when the woman of the house detests you  she often does  and when they ask you to give your imitation of soandso and forget that his niece is in the room  do you know what they would have called people like me a hundred years ago  toad eaters  there is one of us in an old novel i read a bit of once  she goes about an old maid to houses  once she arrived in a snow storm and a hearse  am i to come to that  i keep learning new drawingroom tricks  and when you fall ill as i did at eckford and you cant leave and you think they are tired to death of you  oh it is i who am tired and time passes and one grows old  i am a hag  merton said what he ought to have said and what indeed was true  he was afraid she would tell him what she owed her dressmakers  therefore he steered the talk round to sport then to the highlands then to knoydart then to alastair macdonald of craigiecorrichan and then merton knew by a tone in the voice a drop of the eyelashes that miss maskelyne wasvaccinated  prophylactic measures had been taken this agent ran no risk of infection  there was alastair  merton turned to miss willoughby on his left  she was tall dark handsome but a little faded and not plump few of the faces round the table were plump and well liking  miss willoughby in fact dwelt in one room in bloomsbury and dined on cocoa and bread and butter  these were for her the rewards of the higher education  she lived by copying crabbed manuscripts  do you ever go up to oxford now said merton  not often  sometimes a st ursula girl gets a room in the town for me i have coached two or three of them at little reading parties  it gets one out of town in autumn bloomsbury in august is not very fresh  and at oxford one can tout or cadge for a little work  but there are so many of us  what are you busy with just now  vatican transcripts at the record office  any exciting secrets  oh no only how much the priests here paid to rome for their promotions secrets then perhaps not thrilling now  no schemes to poison people  not yet no plots for novels and oh such longwinded pontifical latin and such awful crabbed hands  it does not seem to lead to much  to nothing in no way  but one is glad to get anything  jephson of lincoln whom i used to know is doing a book on the knights of st john in their relations to the empire said merton  is he said miss willoughby after a scarcely distinguishable but embarrassed pause and she turned from merton to exhibit an interest in the very original scheme of mural decoration behind her  it is quite a new subject to most people said merton and he mentally ticked off miss willoughby as safe for jephson whom he had heard that she liked was a very poor man living on his fellowship and coaching  he was sorry he had never liked or trusted jephson  it is a subject sure to create a sensation isnt it asked miss willoughby a little paler than before  it might get a man a professorship said merton  there are so many of us of them i mean said miss willoughby and merton gave a small sigh  not much larkiness here he thought and asked a transient waiter for champagne  miss willoughby drank a little of the wine the colour came into her face  by jove shes awfully handsome thought merton  it was very kind of you to ask me to this festival said the girl  why have you asked us me at least  perhaps for many besides the obvious reason said merton  you may be told later  then there is a reason in addition to that which most people dont find obvious  have you come into a fortune  no but i am coming  my ship is on the sea and my boat is on the shore  i see faces that i know  there is that tall handsome girl miss markham with real gold hair next mr logan  we used to call her the venus of milo or milo for short at st ursulas  she has mantles and things tried on her at madame claudines and stumpy purchasers argue from the effect neglecting the cause that the things will suit them her people were ruined by australian gold mines  and there is miss martin who does stories for the penny story papers at a shilling the thousand words  the fathers have backed horses and the childrens teeth are set on edge  is it a neochristian dinner  we are all so poor  you have sought us in the highways and hedges  where the wild roses grow said merton  i dont know many of the men though i see faces that one used to see in the high  there is mr yorker the athletic man  what is he doing now  he is subvicesecretary of a cricket club  his income depends on his bat and his curl from leg  but he has a rich aunt  cricket does not lead to much any more than my ability to read the worst handwritings of the darkest ages  who is the man that the beautiful lady opposite is making laugh so asked miss willoughby without moving her lips  merton wrote bulstrode of trinity on the back of the menu  what does he do  nothing said merton in a low voice  been alligator farming or ostrich farming or ranching and come back shorn they all come back  he wants to be an ecclesiastical chucker out and cope with mr kensitt and co  new profession  he ought not to be here  he can ride and shoot  he is the only son of his mother and she is a widow  he ought to go out  my only brother is out  i wish i were a man  i hate dawdlers  she looked at him her eyes were large and grey under black lashes they were dark and louring  have you by any chance a spark of the devil in you asked merton taking a social header  i have been told so and sometimes thought so said miss willoughby perhaps this one will go out by fasting if not by prayer  yes i have a spark of the accuser of the brethren  tant mieux thought merton  all the people were talking and laughing now  miss maskelyne told a story to the table  she did a trick with a wine glass forks and a cork  logan interviewed miss martin who wrote tales for the penny fiction people on her methods  had she a moral aim a purpose  did she create her characters first and let them evolve their fortunes or did she invent a plot and make her characters fit in  miss martin said she began with a situation i wish i could get one somewhere as secretary to a man of letters  they cant afford secretaries said logan  besides they are family men married men and so  and so what  go look in any glass and say said logan laughing  but how do you begin with a situation  oh anyhow  a lot of men in a darkened room  pitch dark  a seance  no a conspiracy  they are in the dark that when arrested they may swear they never saw each other  they could swear that anyhow  conspirators have consciences  then there comes a red light shining between the door and the floor  then the door breaks down under a hammer the light floods the room  there is a man in it whom the others never saw enter  how did he get in  he was there before they came  then the fighting begins  at the end of it where is the man  well where is he  what was he up to  i dont know yet said miss martin it just comes as i go on  it has just got to come  it is a fourteen hours a day business  all writing  i crib things from the french  not whole stories  i take the opening situation say the two men in a boat on the river who hook up a sack  i dont read the rest of the frenchman i work on from the sack and guess what was in it  what was in the sack  in the sack  a name for a story  anything from the corpse of a freak good idea corpse of a freak with no arms and legs or with too many to a model of a submarine ship or political papers  but i am tired of corpses  they pervade my works  they give a bouquet a fragrance as mr talbot twysden said about his cheap claret  you read the old masters  the obsolete thackeray  yes i know him pretty well  what are you publishing just now  this to an author  dont you know  i blush said logan  unseen said miss martin scrutinising him closely  well you do not read the serials to which i contribute she went on i have two or three things running  there is the judges secret  what was that  he did it himself  did what  killed the bishop  he is not a very plausible judge in english in french he would be all right a juge dinstruction the man who cross examines the prisoners in private you know  judges dont do that in england said logan  no but this case is an exception  the judge was such a very old friend a college friend of the murdered bishop  so he takes advantage of his official position and steals into the cell of the accused  my public does not know any better and of course i have no reviewers  i never come out in a book  and why did the judge assassinate the prelate  the prelate knew too much about the judge who sat in the court of probate and divorce  satan reproving sin asked logan  yes exactly and the bishop being interested in the case  no scandal about mrs proudie  no not that exactly still you see the motive  i do said logan  and the conclusion  the bishop was not really dead at all  it takes some time to explain the corpus delictiyou see i know my subjectwas somebody else  and the bishop was alive and secretly watching the judge disguised as mr sherlock holmes  oh i know it is too much in dickenss manner  but my public has not read dickens  you interest me keenly said logan  i am glad to hear it  and the penny public take freely  our circulation goes up  i asked for a rise of three pence on the thousand words  now this is what i call literary conversation said logan  it is like reading the british weekly bookman  did you get the threepence if the inquiry is not indelicate  i got twopence  but you see there are so many of us  tell me more  are you serialising anything else  serialising is the right word  i see you know a great deal about literature  yes i am serialising a featured tale  a featured tale  you dont know what that is  you do not know everything yet  it is called myself  why myself  oh because the narrator did itthe murder  a stranger is found in a wood hung to a tree  nobody knows who he is  but he and the narrator had met in paraguay  he the murdered man came home visited the narrator and fell in love with the beautiful being to whom the narrator was engaged  so the narrator lassoed him in a wood  why  oh the old stock reason  he knew too much  what did he know  why that the narrator was living on a treasure originally robbed from a church in south america  but if it was a treasure who would care  the girl was a catholic  and the murdered man knew more  how much more  this to find out about the treasure the narrator had taken priests orders and of course could not marry  and the other man being in love with the girl threatened to tell and so the lasso came in handy it is a protestant story and instructive  jolly instructive  but miss martin you are the guy boothby of your sex  at this supreme tribute the girl blushed like dawn upon the hills  my word she is pretty thought logan but what he said was you know mr tierney your neighbour  out of a job as a composition master almost reduced to university extension lectures on the didactic drama  tierney was talking eagerly to his neighbour a fascinating lady laundress la belle blanchisseuse about starch  further off a lady instructress in cookery miss frere was conversing with a tutor of bridge  tierney said logan in a pause may i present you to miss martin then he turned to miss markham formerly known at st ursulas as milo she had been a teacher of golf hockey cricket fencing and gymnastics at a very large school for girls in a very small town  here she became society to such an alarming extent no party being complete without her while the colonels and majors never left her in peace that her connection with education was abruptly terminated  at present raiment was draped on her magnificent shoulders at madame claudines  logan as he had told merton occasionally met her and logan had the strongest reasons for personal conviction that she was absolutely proof against infection in the trying circumstances to which a disentangler is professionally exposed  indeed she alone of the women present knew from logan the purpose of the gathering  cigarettes had replaced the desire of eating and drinking  merton had engaged a withdrawing room where he meant to be closeted with his guests one by one administer the oath and prosecute delicate inquiries on the important question of immunity from infection  but after a private word or two with logan he deemed these conspicuous formalities needless  we have material enough to begin with said logan  we knew beforehand that some of the men were safe and certain of the women  there was a balcony  the providence of nature had provided a full moon and a night of balm  the imaginative maintained that the scent of hay was breathed among other odours over pall mall the blest  merton kept straying with one guest or another into a corner of the balcony  he hinted that there was a thing in prospect  would the guest hold himself or herself ready at need  next morning if the promise was given the guest might awake to peace of conscience  the scheme was beneficent and incidentally cheerful  to some he mentioned retainers money down to speak grossly  most accepted on the strength of mertons assurances that their services must always be ready  there were difficulties with miss willoughby and miss markham  the former lady who needed it most flatly refused the arrangement  merton pleaded in vain  miss markham the girl known to her contemporaries as milo could not hazard her present engagement at madame claudines  if she was needed by the scheme in the dead season she thought that she could be ready for whatever it was  nobody was told exactly what the scheme was  it was only made clear that nobody was to be employed without the full and exhaustive knowledge of the employers for whom merton and logan were merely agents  if in doubt the agents might apply for counsel to the lady patronesses whose very names tranquilised the most anxious inquirers  the oath was commuted for a promise on honour of secrecy  and indeed little if anything was told that could be revealed  the thing was not political spies on russia or france were not being recruited  that was made perfectly clear  anybody might withdraw if the prospect when beheld nearer seemed undesirable  a mystified but rather merry gathering walked away to remote lodgings miss maskelyne alone patronising a hansom  on the day after the dinner logan and merton reviewed the event and its promise taking trevor into their counsels  they were not ill satisfied with the potential recruits  there was one jolly little thing in white said trevor  so pretty and flowering  cherries ripe themselves do cry a line in an old song thats what her face reminded me of  who was she  she came with miss martin the penny novelist said logan  she is stopping with her  a country parsons daughter come up to town to try to live by typewriting  she will be of no use to us said merton  if ever a young woman looked fancyfree it is that girl  what did you say her name is logan  i did not say but though you wont believe it her name is miss blossom miss florry blossom  her godfathers and godmothers must bear the burden of her appropriate christian name the other the surname is a coincidencedesigned or not  well she is not suitable said merton sternly  misplaced affections she might distract but then after she had distracted them she might reciprocate them  as a conscientious manager i cannot recommend her to clients  but said trevor she may be useful for all that as well as decidedly ornamental  merton youll want a typewriter for your business correspondence and miss blossom typewrites it is her profession  well said merton i am not afraid  i do not care too much for that garden in her face for your cherryripe sort of young person  if a typewriter is necessary i can bear with her as well as another  i admire your courage and resignation said trevor so now let us go and take rooms for the society  they found rooms lordly rooms which trevor furnished in a stately manner hanging a selection of his mezzotints on the wallsladies of old years after romney reynolds hoppner and the rest  a sober opulence and comfort characterised the chambers a wellselected set of books in a sheraton bookcase was intended to beguile the tedium of waiting clients the typewriter miss blossom accepted the situation occupied an inner chamber opening out of that which was to be sacred to consultations  the firm traded under the title of messrs gray and graham  their advertisementin all the newspapersaddressed itself to parents guardians children and others  it set forth the sorrows and anxieties which beset families in the matter of undesirable matrimonial engagements and entanglements  the advertisers proposed by a new method to restore domestic peace and confidence  no private inquiries will in any case be made into the past of the parties concerned  the highest references will in every instance be given and demanded  intending clients must in the first instance apply by letter to messrs gray and graham  no charge will be made for a first interview which can only be granted after satisfactory references have been exchanged by letter  if that does not inspire confidence said merton i dont know what will  nothing short of it will do said logan  but the mezzotints will carry weight said trevor and a few good cloisonnes and enamelled snuffboxes and bronzes will do no harm  so he sent in some weedings of his famous collection     iii  adventure of the first clients   merton was reading the newspaper in the office expecting a client  miss blossom was typewriting in the inner chamber the door between was open the office boy knocked at mertons outer door and the sound of that boys strangled chuckling was distinctly audible to his employer  there is something irritating in the foolish merriment of a youthful menial  no conduct could be more likely than that of the office boy to irritate the first client arriving on business of which it were hard to exaggerate the delicate and anxious nature  these reflections flitted through mertons mind as he exclaimed come in with a tone of admonishing austerity  the office boy entered  his face was scarlet his eyes goggled and ran water  hastily and loudly exclaiming mr and miss apsley which ended with a crow he stuffed his red pocket handkerchief into his mouth and escaped  at the sound of the names merton had turned towards the inner door open behind him whence came a clear and piercing trill of feminine laughter from miss blossom  merton angrily marched to the inner door and shut his typewriter in with a bang  his heart burned within him nothing could be so insulting to clients nothing so ruinous to a nascent business  he wheeled round to greet his visitors with a face of apology his eyes on the average level of the human countenance divine  there was no human countenance divine  there was no human countenance at that altitude  his eyes encountered the opposite wall and a print of mrs pelham feeding chickens  in a moment his eyes adjusted themselves to a lower elevation  in front of him were standing hand in hand a pair of small children a boy of nine in sailor costume but with bare knees not usually affected by naval officers and a girl of seven with her finger in her mouth  the boy bowed gravely  he was a pretty little fellow with a pale oval face arched eyebrows promise of an aquiline nose and two large black eyes  i think sir said the child i have the pleasure of redressing myself to mr gray or mr graham  graham at your service said merton gravely may i ask you and miss apsley to be seated  there was a large and imposing armchair in green leather the clients chair  mr apsley lifted his little sister into it and sat down beside her himself  she threw her arms round his neck and laid her flaxen curls on his shoulder  her blue eyes looked shyly at merton out of her fleece of gold  the four shoes of the clients dangled at some distance above the carpet  you are the author of this article i think mr graham said mr apsley showing his hand which was warm and holding out a little crumpled ball of paper not precisely fresh  merton solemnly unrolled it it contained the advertisement of his firm  yes he said i wrote that  you got our letters for you answered them said mr apsley with equal solemnity  why do you want bats and me  the ladys name is bats said merton wondering why he was supposed to want either of the pair  my name is batsy  i like you you are pretty said miss apsley  merton positively blushed he was unaccustomed to compliments so frank from a member of the sex at an early stage of a business interview  he therefore kissed his fair client who put up a pair of innocent damp lips and then allowed her attention to be engrossed by a coin on his watchchain  i dont quite remember your case sir or what you mean by saying i wanted you though i am delighted to see you he said to mr apsley  we have so many letters  with your permission i shall consult the letter book  the article says to parents guardians children and others  it was in print remarked mr apsley with a heavy stress on children and she said you wanted us  the mystified merton wondering who she was turned the pages of the letter book mumbling abernethy applecombe ap davis apsley  here we are he began to read the letter aloud  it was typewritten which when he saw his clients not a little surprised him  gentlemen the letter ran having seen your advertisement in the daily diatribe of today may 17 i desire to express my wish to enter into communication with you on a matter of pressing importancei am in the name of my sister miss josephine apsley and myself  faithfully yours thomas lloyd apsley  thats the letter said mr apsley and you wrote to us  and what did i say asked merton  something about preferences which we did not understand  references perhaps said merton  mr apsley may i ask whether you wrote this letter yourself  no nonesopretty printed it on a kind of sewing machine  she told us to come and see you so we came  i called her nonesopretty out of a fairy story  she does not mind  gran says she thinks she rather likes it  i shouldnt wonder if she did said merton  but what is her real name  she made me promise not to tell  she was staying at the home farm when we were staying at grans  is gran your grandmother  yes replied mr apsley  hereon bats remarked that she was velly hungalee  to be sure said merton  luncheon shall be brought at once  he rang the bell and going out interpellated the office boy  why did you laugh when my friends came to luncheon  you must learn manners  please sir the kid the young gentleman i mean said he came on business answered the boy showing apoplectic symptoms  so he did luncheon is his business  go and bring luncheon forfive and see that there are chicken cutlets tartlets apricots and ginger beer  the boy departed and merton reflected  a hoax somebodys practical joke he said to himself  i wonder who miss nonesopretty is  then he returned assured batsy that luncheon was even at the doors and leaving her to look at punch led mr apsley aside  tommy he said having seen his signature where do you live  the boy named a street on the frontiers of st johns wood  and who is your father  major apsley dso  and how did you come here  in a hansom  i told the man to wait  how did you get away  father took us to lords with miss limmer and there was a crowd and bats and i slipped out for nonesopretty said we ought to call on you  who is miss limmer  our governess  have you a mother  the childs brown eyes filled with tears and his cheeks flushed  it was in india that she  yes be a man tommy  i am looking the other way which merton did for some seconds  now tommy is miss limmer kind to you  the childs face became strangely set and blank his eyes looking vacant miss limmer is very kind to us  she loves us and we love her dearly ask batsy he said in a monotonous voice as if he were repeating a lesson  batsy come here he said in the same voice  is miss limmer kind to us  batsy threw up her eyesit was like a stage effect we love miss limmer dearly and she loves us  she is very very kind to us like our dear mamma  her voice was monotonous too  i never can say the last part said tommy  batsy knows it about dear mamma  indeed said merton  tommy why did you come here  i dont know  i told you that nonesopretty told us to  she did it after she saw that when we were bathing  tommy raised one of his little loose breeks that did not cover the knee  that was not pleasant to look on it was on the inside of the right thigh  how did you get hurt there asked merton  the boys monotonous chant began again his eyes were fixed and blank as before  i fell off a tree and my leg hit a branch on the way down  curious accident said merton and nonesopretty saw the mark  yes  and asked you how you got it  yes and she saw blue marks on batsy all over her arms  and you told nonesopretty that you fell off a tree  yes  and she told you to come here  yes she had read your printed article  well here is luncheon said merton and bade the office boy call miss blossom from the inner chamber to share the meal  batsy had as low a chair as possible and was disposing her napkin to do the duty of a pinafore  miss blossom entered from within with downcast eyes  nonesopretty  nonesopretty shouted the children while tommy rushed to throw his arms round her neck to meet which she stooped down concealing a face of blushes  batsy descended from her chair waddled up climbed another chair and attacked the girl from the rear  the office boy was arranging luncheon  merton called him to the writingtable scribbled a note and said take that to dr maitland with my compliments  maitland had been one of the guests at the inaugural dinner  he was entirely devoid of patients and was living on the anticipated gains of a great work on clinical psychology  tell dr maitland he will find me at luncheon if he comes instantly said merton as the boy fled on his errand  i see that i need not introduce you to my young friends miss blossom said merton  may i beg you to help miss apsley to arrange her tucker  miss blossom almost unbecomingly brilliant in her complexion did as she was asked  batsy had cold chicken new potatoes green peas and two helpings of apricot tart  tommy devoted himself to cutlets  a very mild shandygaff was compounded for him in an old oriel pewter  both children made love to miss blossom with their eyes  it was not at all what merton felt inclined to do the lady had entangled him in a labyrinth of puzzledom  nonesopretty exclaimed tommy i am glad you told us to come here your friends are nice  merton bowed to tommy i am glad too he said  miss blossom knew that we were kindred souls same kind of chaps i mean you and me you know tommy  miss blossom became more and more like the fabled peony the crimson variety  luckily the office boy ushered in dr maitland who exchanging glances of surprise with merton over the childrens heads began to make himself agreeable  he had nearly as many tricks as miss maskelyne  he was doing the shortsighted man eating celery and unable to find the salt because he is unable to find his eyeglass  merton seeing his clients absorbed in mirth murmured something vague about business and spirited miss blossom away to the inner chamber  sit down pray miss blossom  there is no time to waste  what do you know about these children  why did you send them here  the girl who was pale enough now said i never thought they would come  they are here however  what do you know about them  i went to stay lately at the home farm on their grandmothers place we became great friends  i found out that they were motherless and that they were being cruelly illtreated by their governess  miss limmer  yes  but they both said they loved her dearly  they always said that when asked  i gathered from their grandmother old mrs apsley that their father would listen to nothing against the governess  the old lady cried in a helpless way and said he was capable of marrying the woman out of obstinacy if anybody interfered  i had your advertisement and i thought you might disentangle him  it was a kind of joke  i only told them that you were a kind gentleman  i never dreamed of their really coming  well you must take them back again presently there is the address  you must see their father you must wait till you see him  and how are you to explain this escapade  i cant have the children taught to lie  they have been taught that lesson already  i dont think they are aware of it said merton  miss blossom stared  i cant explain but you must find a way of keeping them out of a scrape  i think i can manage it said miss blossom demurely  i hope so  and manage if you please to see this miss limmer and observe what kind of person she is said merton with his hand on the door handle adding please ask dr maitland to come here and do you keep the children amused for a moment  miss blossom nodded and left the room there was laughter in the other chamber  presently maitland joined merton  look here said merton we must be rapid  these children are being cruelly illtreated and deny it  will you get into talk with the boy and ask him if he is fond of his governess say miss limmer and notice what he says and how he says it  then we must pack them away  all right said maitland  they returned to the children  miss blossom retreated to the inner room bats simplified matters by falling asleep in the clients chair  maitland began by talking about schools  was tommy going to eton  tommy did not know  he had a governess at home  not at a preparatory school yet  a big fellow like you  tommy said that he would like to go to school but they would not send him  why not  tommy hesitated blushed and ended by saying that they didnt think it safe as he walked in his sleep  you will soon grow out of that said maitland but it is not very safe at school  a boy i knew was found sound asleep on the roof at school  he might have fallen off said tommy  yes  thats why your people keep you at home  but in a year or two you will be all right  know any latin yet  tommy said that miss limmer taught him latin  are you and she great friends  tommys face and voice altered as before while he mechanically repeated the tale of the mutual affection which linked him with miss limmer  thats all very jolly said maitland  now tommy said merton we must waken batsy and miss blossom is going to take you both home  hope we shall often meet  he called miss blossom batsy kissed both of her new friends  merton conducted the party to the cab and settled in spite of tommys remonstrances with the cabman who made a good thing of it and nodded when told to drive away as soon as he had deposited his charges at their door  then merton led maitland upstairs and offered him a cigar  what do you think of it he asked  common posthypnotic suggestion by the governess said maitland  i guessed as much but can it really be worked like that  you are not chaffing  simplest thing to work in the world said maitland  a lot of nonsense however that the public believes in cant be done  the woman could not sit down in st johns wood and will tommy to come to her if he was in the next room  at least she might will till she was black in the face and he would know nothing about it  but she can put him to sleep and make him say what he does not want to say in answer to questions afterwards when he is awake  youre sure of it  it is as certain as anything in the world up to a certain point  the girl said something that the boy did not say more gushing about his dead mother  the hypnotised subject often draws a line somewhere  the woman must be a fiend said merton  some of them are now and then said the author of clinical psychology        miss blossoms cab the driver much encouraged by tommy who conversed with him through the trap in the roof dashed up to the door of a house close to lords  the horse was going fast and nearly cannoned into another cabhorse also going fast which was almost thrown on its haunches by the driver  inside the other hansom was a tall man with a pale face under the tan who was nervously gnawing his moustache  miss blossom saw him tommy saw him and cried father  halfhidden behind a blind of the house miss blossom beheld a womans face expectant  clearly she was miss limmer  all the while that they were driving miss blossoms wits had been at work to construct a story to account for the absence and return of the children  now by a flash of invention she called to her cabman drive onfast  major apsley saw his lost children with their arms round the neck of a wonderfully pretty girl the pretty girl waved her parasol to him with a smile beckoning forwards the children waved their arms calling out a race a race  what could a puzzled parent do but bid his cabman follow like the wind miss blossoms cab flew past lords dived into regents park leading by two lengths reached the zoological gardens and there its crew alighted demurely waiting for the major  he leaped from his hansom and taking off his hat strode up to miss blossom as if he were leading a charge the children captured him by the legs  what does this mean madam  what are you doing with my children  who are you  shes nonesopretty said tommy by way of introduction  miss blossom bowed with grace and raising her head shot two violet rays into the eyes of the major which were of a bistre hue  but they accepted the message like a receiver in wireless telegraphy  no man let be a major could have resisted nonesopretty at that moment  come into the gardens she said and led the way  you would like a ride on the elephant tommy she asked master apsley  and you batsy  the children shouted assent  how in the world does she know them thought the bewildered officer  the children mounted the elephant  now major apsley said miss blossom i have found your children  i owe you thanks madam i have been very anxious but  it is more than your thanks i want  i want you to do something for me a very little thing said miss blossom with the air of a supplicating angel the violet eyes dewy with tears  i am sure i shall be delighted to do anything you ask but  will you promise  it is a very little thing indeed and her hands were clasped in entreaty  please promise  well i promise  then keep your word it is a little thing  take tommy home this instant let nobody speak to him or touch himandmake him take a bath and see him take it  take a bath  yes at once in your presence  then ask him    any questions you please but pay extreme attention to his answers and his face and the sound of his voice  if that is not enough do the same with batsy  and after that i think you had better not let the children out of your sight for a short time  these are very strange requests  and it was by a strange piece of luck that i met you driving home to see if the lost children were found and secured your attention before it could be preengaged  but where did you find them and why  miss blossom interrupted him here is the address of dr maitland i have written it on my own card he can answer some questions you may want to ask  later i will answer anything  and now in the name of god said the girl reverently with sudden emotion you will keep your promise to the letter  i will said the major and miss blossom waved her parasol to the children  you must give the poor elephant a rest he is tired she cried and the tenderhearted batsy needed no more to make her descend from the great earthshaking beast  the children attacked her with kisses and then walked off looking back each holding one of the paternal hands and treading after the manner of childhood on the paternal toes  miss blossom walked till she met an opportune omnibus  about an hour later a fourwheeler bore a woman with blazing eyes and a pile of trunks gaping untidily from the majors house in st johns wood road  the honourable company had won its first victory major apsley having fulfilled miss blossoms commands had seen what she expected him to see and was disentangled from miss limmer  the children still call their new stepmother nonesopretty     iv  adventure of the rich uncle   his god is his belly mr graham said the client and if the text strikes you as disagreeably unrefined think how it must pain me to speak thus of an uncle if only by marriage  the client was a meagre matron of fortyfive or thereabouts  her dark scant hair was smooth and divided down the middle  acerbity spoke in every line of her face which was of a dusky yellow where it did not rather verge on the faint hues of a violet past its prime  she wore thread gloves and she carried a battered reticule of early victorian days in which merton suspected that tracts were lurking  she had an anxious peevish mouth in truth she was not the kind of client in whom mertons heart delighted  and yet he was sorry for her especially as her rich uncles cook was the goddess of the gentleman whose god had just been denounced in scriptural terms by the client a mrs gisborne  she was sad as well she might be for she was a struggler with a large family and great expectations from the polytheistic uncle who adored his cook and one of his nobler organs  what has his history been this gentlemansmr fulton i think you called him  he was a drysalter in the city sir and across mertons mind flitted a vision of a dark shop with finnan haddocks bacon and tongues in the window and smelling terribly of cheese  oh a drysalter he said not daring to display ignorance by asking questions to corroborate his theory of the drysalting business  a drysalter sir and isinglass importer  merton was conscious of vagueness as to isinglass and was distantly reminded of a celebrated racehorse  however it was clear that mr fulton was a retired tradesman of some kind  he went out of isinglassbefore the cheap scientific substitute was invented it is made out of old quill penswith seventyfive thousand pounds  and it ought to come to my children  he has not another relation living but ourselves he married my aunt  but we never see him he said that he could not stand our sunday dinners at hampstead  a feeling not remote from sympathy with mr fulton stole over mertons mind as he pictured these festivals  is his god veryvoluminous  mrs gisborne stared  is he a very portly gentleman  no mr graham he is next door to a skeleton though you would not expect it considering  considering his devotion to the pleasures of the table  gluttony shameful waste i call it  and he is a stumbling block and a cause of offence to others  he is a patron of the city and suburban college of cookery and founded two scholarships there for scholars learning how to pamper the  the epicure said merton  he knew the city and suburban college of cookery  one of his band a miss frere was a fellow and tutor of that academy  and about what age is your uncle he asked  about sixty and not a white hair on his head  then he may marry his cook  he will sir  and is very likely to have a family  mrs gisborne sniffed and produced a pocket handkerchief from the early victorian reticule  she applied the handkerchief to her eyes in silence merton observed her with pity  we need the money so there are so many of us said the lady  do you think that mr fulton ispassionately in love with his domestic  he only loves his meals said mrs gisborne he does not want to marry her but she has a hold over him throughhis  passions not of the heart said merton hastily  he dreaded an anatomical reference  he is afraid of losing her  he and his cronies give each other dinners jealous of each other they are and he actually pays the woman two hundred a year  and beer money said merton  he had somewhere read or heard of beer money as an item in domestic finance  i dont know about that  the cruel thing is that she is a woman of strict temperance principles  so am i  i am sure it is an awful thing to say mr graham but satan has sometimes put it into my heart to wish that the woman like too too many of her sort was the victim of alcoholic temptations  he has a fearful temper and if once she was not fit for duty at one of his dinners this awful gnawing anxiety would cease to ride my bosom  he would pack her off  very natural  she is free from the besetting sin of the artistic temperament  if you mean drink she is and that is one reason why he values her  his last cook and his last but one  here mrs gisborne narrated at some length the tragic histories of these artists  providential i thought it but now she said despairingly  she certainly seems a difficult woman to dislodge said merton  a dangerous entanglement  any followers allowed  could anything be done through the softer emotions  would a guardsman for instance  she hates the men  never one of them darkens her kitchen fire  offers she has had by the score but they come by post and she laughs and burns them  old mr potter one of his cronies tried to get her away that way but he is over seventy and old at that and she thought she had another chance to better herself  and shell take it mr graham if you cant do something shell take it  will you permit me to say that you seem to know a good deal about her perhaps you have some sort of means of intelligence in the enemys camp  the kitchen maid said mrs gisborne purpling a little is the sister of our servant and tells her things  i see said merton  now can you remember any little weakness of this i must frankly admit admirable artist and exemplary woman  you are not going to take her side a scheming redfaced hussy mr graham  i never betrayed a client madam and if you mean that i am likely to help this person into your uncles arms you greatly misconceive me and the nature of my profession  i beg your pardon sir but i will say that your heart does not seem to be in the case  it is not quite the kind of case with which we are accustomed to deal said merton  but you have not answered my question  are there any weak points in the defence  to venus she is cold of bacchus she is disdainful  i never heard of the gentlemen i am sure sir but as to her weaknesses she has the temper of a  here mrs gisborne paused for a comparison her knowledge of natural history and of mythology the usual sources of parallels failed to provide a satisfactory resemblance to the cooks temper  the temper of a megaera said merton admitting to himself that the word was not though mythological what he could wish  of a megaera as you know that creature sir and impetuous  if everything is not handy if that poor girl is not like clockwork with the sauces and herbs and things if a saucepan boils over or a ham falls into the fire if the girl treads on the tail of one of the catsand the woman keeps a dozenthen she flies at her with anything that comes handy  she is fond of cats said merton really this lady has sympathetic points and he patted the grey russian puss kutuzoff which was a witness to these interviews  she dotes on the nasty things and you may well say lady  her siamese cat a wild beast he is took the first prize at the crystal palace show the papers said miss blowsers rangoon bred by the exhibitor  miss blowser  i dont know what the world is coming to  he stands on the doorsteps the cat like a lynx and as fierce as a lion  why he got her into the policecourt flew at a dog and nearly tore his owner a clergyman to pieces  there were articles about it in the papers  i seem to remember it said merton  christianos ad leones  in fact he had written this humorous article himself  but is there nothing else he asked  only a temper so natural to genius disturbed or diverted in the process of composition and a passion for the felidae such as has often been remarked in the great  there was charles baudelaire mahomet  i dont know what you mean sir and said mrs gisborne rising and snapping her reticule i think i was a fool for answering your advertisement  i did not come here to be laughed at and i think common politeness  i beg a thousand pardons said merton  i am most distressed at my apparent discourtesy  my mind was preoccupied by the circumstances of this very difficult case and involuntarily glided into literary anecdote on the subject of cats and their owners  they are my passioncatsand i regret that they inspire you with antipathy  here he picked up kutuzoff and carried him into the inner room  it is not that i object to any of heavens creatures kept in their place said mrs gisborne somewhat mollified but you must make allowances sir for my anxiety  it sours a mother of nine  friday is one of his gorging dinnerparties and who knows what may happen if she pleases him  the kitchen maid says i mean i hear that she wears an engaged ring already  that is very bad said merton with sympathy  the dinner is on friday you say and he made a note of the date  yes 15 albany grove on the regents canal  you can think of nothing elseno weakness to work on  no sir just her awful temper i would save him from it for he has another as bad  and besides hopes from him have kept me up so long his only relation and times are so hard and schooling and boots and everything so dear and we so many in family  tears came into the poor ladys eyes  ill give the case my very best attention he said shaking hands with the client  to mertons horror she tried heaven help her to pass a circular packet wrapped in paper into his hand  he evaded it  it was a first interview for which no charge was made  what can be done shall be done though i confess that i do not see my way and he accompanied her downstairs to the street  i behaved like a cad with my chaff he said to himself but hang me if i see how to help her  and i rather admire that cook  he went into the inner room wakened the sleeping partner logan on the sofa and unfolded the case with every detail  what can we do que faire  theres an exhibition of modern mediaeval ancient and savage cookery at earls court the cookeries said logan  couldnt we seduce an artist like miss blowser there i mean thither of course the night before the dinner and get her up into the great wheel and somehow stop the wheeland make her too late for her duties  and how are you going to stop the wheel  speak to the man at the wheel  bribe the beggar  dangerous and awfully expensive  then think of all the other people on the wheel  logan vous chassez de race  the old restalrig blood is in your veins  my ancestors nearly nipped off with a king and why cant i carry off a cook  hustle her into a hansom  oh bah these are not modern methods  il ny a rien tel que denlever said logan  i never shall stain the cause with policecourts said merton  it would be fatal  ive heard of a cook who fell on his sword when the fish did not come up to time  now a raid on the fish  she might fall on her carving knife when they did not arrive or leap into the flames of the kitchen fire like oenone dont you know  bosh  vatel was far from the sea and he had not a fishmongers shop round the corner  be modern  logan rumpled his hair cant i get her to lunch at a restaurant and ply her with the wines of eastern france  no she is temperance personified cant we send her a forged telegram to say that her mother is dying servants seem to have such lots of mothers always inconveniently or conveniently moribund  i wont have forgery  great heavens how obsolete you are  besides that would not put her employer in a rage  could i go and consult  he mentioned a specialist  he is a man of ideas  he is a man of the purest principlesand an uncommonly hard hitter  it is his purity i want  my own mind is hereditarily lawless  i want something not immoral yet efficacious  there was that parson whom you say the womans cat nearly devoured  like paul with beasts he fought the cat  now i wonder if that injured man is not meditating some priestly revenge that would do our turn and get rid of miss blowser  merton shook his head impatiently  his own invention was busy but to no avail  miss blowser seemed impregnable  kutuzoff hedzoff the puss stalked up to logan and leaped on his knees  logan stroked him kutuzoff purred and blinked logan sought inspiration in his topaz eyes  at last he spoke will you leave this affair to me merton  i think i have found out a way  what way  thats my secret  you are so beastly moral you might object  one thing i may tell youit does not compromise the honourable company of disentanglers  you are not going to try any detective work to find out if she is a woman with a past with a husband living  you are not going to put a live adder among the eels  i daresay drysalters eat eels  it is the reading of sensational novels that ruins our youth  what a suspicious beggar you are  certainly i am neither a detective nor a murderer a la montepin  no practical jokes with the victuals  of course not  no kidnapping miss blowser  certainly no kidnappingmiss blowser  now honour bright is your plan within the law  no policecourt publicity  no the police will have no say or show in the matter at least said logan as far as my legal studies inform me they wont  but i can take counsels opinion if you insist on it  then you are sailing near the wind  really i dont think so not really what you call near  i am sorry for that unlucky mrs gisborne said merton musingly  and with two such tempers as the cooks and mr fultons the match could not be a happy one  well logan i suppose you wont tell me what your game is  better not i think but i assure you honour is safe  i am certain that nobody can say anything  i rather expect to earn public gratitude on the whole  you cant appear in any way nor the rest of us  bythe bye do you remember the address of the parson whose dog was hurt  i think i kept a cutting of the police case it was amusing said merton looking through a kind of album and finding presently the record of the incident  it may come in handy or it may not said logan  he then went off and had merton followed him he might not have been reassured  for logan first walked to a chemists shop where he purchased a quantity of a certain drug  next he went to the fencing rooms which he frequented took his fencing mask and glove borrowed a fencing glove from a left handed swordsman whom he knew and drove to his rooms with this odd assortment of articles  having deposited them he paid a call at the dwelling of a fair member of the disentanglers miss frere the lady instructress in the culinary art at the city and suburban college of cookery whereof as we have heard mr fulton the eminent drysalter was a patron and visitor  logan unfolded the case and his plan of campaign to miss frere who listened with intelligent sympathy  do you know the man by sight he asked  oh yes and he knows me perfectly well  last year he distributed the prizes at the city and suburban school of cookery and paid me the most extraordinary compliments  well deserved i am confident said logan and now you are sure that you know exactly what you have to do as i have explained  yes i am to be walking through albany grove at a quarter to four on friday  be punctual  you may rely on me said miss frere  logan next day went to trevors rooms in the albany he was the capitalist who had insisted on helping to finance the disentanglers  to trevor he explained the situation unfolded his plan and asked leave to borrow his private hansom  delighted said trevor  ill put on an old suit of tweeds and a seedy bowler and drive you myself  it will be fun  or should we take my motor car  no it attracts too much attention  suppose we put a number on my cab and paint the wheels yellow like pirates you know when they are disguising a captured ship  it wont do to look like a private cab  these strike me as judicious precautions trevor and worthy of your genius  that is if we are not caught  oh we wont be caught said trevor  but in the meantime let us find that place you mean to go to on a map of london and ill drive you there now in a dogcart  it is better to know the lie of the land  logan agreed and they drove to his objective in the afternoon it was beyond the border of known west hammersmith  trevor reconnoitred and made judicious notes of short cuts  on the following day which was thursday logan had a difficult piece of diplomacy to execute  he called at the rooms of the clergyman a bachelor and a curate whose dog and person had suffered from the assaults of miss blowsers siamese favourite  he expected difficulties for a good deal of ridicule including mertons article christianos ad leones had been heaped on this martyr  logan looked forward to finding him crusty but after seeming a little puzzled the holy man exclaimed why you must be logan of trinity  the same said logan who did not remember the face or name which was wilkinson of his host  why i shall never forget your running catch under the scoringbox at lords exclaimed mr wilkinson i can see it now  it saved the match i owe you more than i can say he added with deep emotion  then be grateful and do me a little favour  i wantjust for an hour or twoto borrow your dog and he stooped to pat the animal a foxterrier bearing recent and glorious scars  borrow scout  why what can you want with him  i have suffered myself through an infernal wild beast of a cat in albany grove said logan and i have a schemeit is unchristian i ownof revenge  the curates eyes glittered vindictively scout is no match for the brute he said in a tone of manly regret  oh scout will be all right  there is not going to be a fight  he is only needed togive tone to the affair  you will be able to walk him safely through albany grove after tomorrow  wont there be a row if you kill the cat  he is what they think a valuable animal  i never could stand cats myself  the higher vermin said logan  but not a hair of his whiskers shall be hurt  he will seek other haunts thats all  but you dont mean to steal him asked the curate anxiously  you see suspicion might fall on me as i am known to bear a grudge to the brute  i steal him  not i said logan  he shall sleep in his owners arms if she likes  but albany grove shall know him no more  then you may take scout said mr wilkinson  you have a cab there shall i drive to your rooms with you and him  do said logan and then dine at the club  which they did and talked much cricket mr wilkinson being an enthusiast        next day about 340 pm a hansom drew up at the corner of albany grove  the fare alighted and sauntered past mr fultons house rangoon the siamese puss was sitting in a scornful and leonine attitude in a tree of the garden above the railings outside the open kitchen windows whence came penetrating and hospitable smells of good fare  the stranger passed and as he returned dropped something here and there on the pavement  it was valerian which no cat can resist  miss blowser was in a culinary crisis and could not leave the kitchen range  her face was of a fiery complexion her locks were in a fine disorder  is rangoon in his place mary she inquired of the kitchen maid  yes maam in his tree said the maid  in this tree rangoon used to sit like a thug dropping down on dogs who passed by  presently the maid said maam rangoon has jumped down and is walking off to the right after a gentleman  after a sparrow i dare say bless him said miss blowser  two minutes later she asked has rangy come back  no maam  just look out and see what he is doing the dear  hes walking along the pavement maam sniffing at something  and oh theres that curates dog  yelping little brute  i hope rangy will give him snuff said miss blowser  hes flown at him cried the maid ambiguously in much excitement  oh maam the gentleman has caught hold of rangoon  hes got a wire mask on his face and great thick gloves not to be scratched  hes got rangoon hes putting him in a bag but by this time miss blowser brandishing a saucepan with a long handle had rushed out of the kitchen through the little garden cannoned against mr fulton who happened to be coming in with flowers to decorate his table knocked him against a lamppost opened the garden gate and armed and bareheaded as she was had rushed forth  you might have deemed that you beheld bellona speeding to the fray  what miss blowser saw was a man disappearing into a hansom whence came the yapping of a dog  another cab was loitering by empty and this cabman had his orders  logan had seen to that  to hail that cab to leap in to cry follow the scoundrel in front a sovereign if you catch him was to the active miss blowser the work of a moment  the man whipped up his horse the pursuit began there was racing and chasing on cannobie lee marylebone rang with the screams of female rage and distress  mr fulton he also leaped up and rushed in pursuit wringing his hands  he had no turn of speed and stopped panting  he only saw miss blowser whisk into her cab he only heard her yells that died in the distance  mr fulton sped back into his house  he shouted for mary whats the matter with your mistress with my cook he raved  somebodys taken her cat sir and is off in a cab and her after him  after her cat  d her cat cried mr fulton  my dinner will be ruined  it is the last she shall touch in this house  out she packspack her things mary no dontdo what you can in the kitchen i must find a cook  her cat and with language unworthy of a drysalter mr fulton clapped on his hat and sped into the street with a vague idea of hurrying to fortnum and masons or some restaurant or a friends house indeed to any conceivable place where a cook might be recruited impromptu  she leaves this very day he said aloud as he all but collided with a lady a quiet coollooking lady who stopped and stared at him  oh miss frere said mr fulton raising his hat with a wild gleam of hope in the trouble of his eyes i have had such a misfortune  what has happened mr fulton  oh maam ive lost my cook and me with a dinnerparty on today  lost your cook  not by death i hope  no maam she has run away in the very crisis as i may call it  with whom  with nobody  after her cat  in a cab  i am undone  where can i find a cook  you may know of some one disengaged though it is late in the day and dinner at seven  cant you help me  can you trust me mr fulton  trust you how maam  let me cook your dinner at least till your cook catches her cat said miss frere smiling  you dont mean it a lady  but a professed cook mr fulton and anxious to help so nobly generous a patron of the art    if you can trust me  trust you maam said mr fulton raising to heaven his obsecrating hands  why youre a genius  it is a miracle a mere miracle of good luck  by this time of course a small crowd of little boys and girls amateurs of dramatic scenes was gathering  we have no time to waste mr fulton  let us go in and let me get to work  i dare say the cook will be back before i have taken off my gloves  not her nor does she cook again in my house  the shock might have killed a man of my age said mr fulton breathing heavily and leading the way up the steps to his own door  her cat the hussy he grumbled  mr fulton kept his word  when miss blowser returned with her saucepan and rangoon she found her trunks in the passage corded by mr fultons own trembling hands and she departed for ever  her chase had been a stern chase a long chase the cab driven by trevor had never been out of sight  it led her in the western wilds to a home for decayed and destitute cats and it had driven away before she entered the lane leading to the home  but there she found rangoon  he had just been deposited there in a seedy old travellers furlined sleeping bag the matron of the home averred by a very pleasant gentleman who said he had found the cat astray lost and thinking him a rare and valuable animal had deemed it best to deposit him at the home  he had left money to pay for advertisements  he had even left the advertisement typewritten by miss blossom  found  a magnificent siamese cat  apply to the home for destitute and decayed cats water lane west hammersmith  very thoughtful of the gentleman said the matron of the home  no he did not leave any address  said something about doing good by stealth  stealth why he stole my cat exclaimed miss blowser  he must have had the advertisement printed like that ready beforehand  its a conspiracy and she brandished her saucepan  the matron who was prejudiced in favour of logan and his two sovereigns which now need not be expended in advertisements was alarmed by the hostile attitude of miss blowser  theres your cat she said drily it aint stealing a cat to leave it with money for its board and to pay for advertisements in a wellconducted charitable institution with a duchess for president  and he even left five shillings to pay for the cab of anybody as might call for the cat  there is your money  miss blowser threw the silver away  take your old cat in the bag said the matron slamming the door in the face of miss blowser        after the trial for breach of promise of marriage and after paying the very considerable damages which miss blowser demanded and received old mr fulton hardened his heart and engaged a male chef  the gratitude of mrs gisborne now free from all anxiety was touching but merton assured her that he knew nothing whatever of the stratagem scarcely a worthy one he thought as she reported it by which her uncle was disentangled  it was logans opinion and it is mine that he had not been guilty of theft but perhaps of the wrongous detention or imprisonment of rangoon but he said the habeas corpus act has no clause about cats and in scottish law which is good enough for me there is no property in cats  you cant legally steal them  how do you know asked merton  i took the opinion of an eminent sheriff substitute  what is that  oh a fearfully swagger legal official you have nothing like it  rum country scotland said merton  rum country england said logan indignantly  you have no property in corpses  merton was silenced  neither could foresee how momentous to each of them the question of property in corpses was to prove  o pectora caeca        miss blowser is now mrs potter  she married her aged wooer and rangoon still wins prizes at the crystal palace     v  the adventure of the office screen   it is not to be supposed that all the enterprises of the company of disentanglers were fortunate  nobody can command success though on the other hand a number of persons civil and military are able to keep her at a distance with surprising uniformity  there was one class of business which merton soon learned to renounce in despair just as some sorts of maladies defy our medical science  it is curious and not very creditable to our chemists merton said that love philtres were once as common as seidlitz powders while now we have lost that secret  the wrong persons might drink love philtres as in the case of tristram and iseult  or an unskilled rural practitioner might send out the wrong drug as in the instance of lucretius who went mad in consequence  perhaps remarked logan the chemist was voting at the comitia and it was his boy who made a mistake about the mixture  very probably but as a rule the love philtres worked  now with all our boasted progress the secret is totally lost  nothing but a love philtre would be of any use in some cases  there is lord methusalem eighty if he is a day  methusalem has been unco wastefu in wives said logan  his family have been consulting methe women in tears  he will marry his grandchildrens german governess and there is nothing to be done  in such cases nothing is ever to be done  you can easily distract an aged mans volatile affections and attach them to a new charmer  but she is just as ineligible as the first marry he will always a young woman now if a respectable virgin or widow of say fifty could hand him a love philtre and gain his heart appearances would more or less be saved  but short of philtres there is nothing to be done  we turn away a great deal of business of that sort  the society of disentanglers then reluctantly abandoned dealings in this class of affairs  in another distressing business merton as a patriot was obliged to abandon an attractive enterprise  the marquis of seakail was serving his country as a volunteer and had been mentioned in despatches  but to the misery of his family he had entangled himself before his departure with a young lady who taught in a high school for girls  her character was unimpeachable her person graceful still as her father was a butcher the duke and duchess were reluctant to assent to the union  they consulted merton and assured him that they would not flinch from expense  a great idea flashed across mertons mind  he might send out a stalwart band of disentanglers who disguised as the enemy might capture seakail and carry him off prisoner to some retreat where the fairest of his female staff of course with a suitable chaperon would await him in the character of a daughter of the hostile race  the result would probably be to detach seakails heart from his love in england  but on reflection merton felt that the scheme was unworthy of a patriot  other painful cases occurred  one lady a mother of resolute character consulted merton on the case of her son  he was betrothed to an excitable girl a neighbour in the country who wrote long literary letters about mr george merediths novels and when abroad was a perfect baedeker or murray or mr augustus hare instructing through correspondence  so the matron complained but this was not the worst of it  there was an unhappy family history of a kind infinitely more common in fiction than in real life  to be explicit even according to the ideas of the most abject barbarians the young people unwittingly were too near akin for matrimony  there is nothing for it but to tell both of them the truth said merton  this is not a case in which we can be concerned  the resolute matron did not take his counsel  the man was told not the girl who died in painful circumstances still writing  her letters were later given to the world though obviously not intended for publication and only calculated to waken unavailing grief among the sentimental and to make the judicious tired  there was however a case in which merton may be said to have succeeded by a happy accident  two visitors ladies were ushered into his consulting room they were announced as miss baddeley and miss crofton  miss baddeley was attired in black wore a thick veil and trembled a good deal  miss crofton whose dress was a combination of untoward but decisive hues and whose hat was enormous and flamboyant appeared to be the other young ladys confidante and conducted the business of the interview  my dear friend miss baddeley she began when miss baddeley took her hand and held it as if for protection and sympathy  my dear friend repeated miss crofton has asked me to accompany her and state her case  she is too highly strung to speak for herself  miss baddeley wrung miss croftons hand and visibly quivered  merton assumed an air of sympathy  the situation is grave he asked  my friend said miss crofton thoroughly enjoying herself is the victim of passionate and unavailing remorse are you not julia  julia nodded  deeply as i sympathise said merton it appears to me that i am scarcely the person to consult  a mother now  julia has none  or a father or sister  but for me julia is alone in the world  then said merton there are many periodicals especially intended for ladies  there is the woman of the world the girls guardian angel fashion and passion and so on  the editors in their columns reply to questions in cases of conscience  i have myself read the replies to correspondents and would especially recommend those published in a serial conducted by miss annie swan  miss crofton shook her head  miss baddeleys social position is not that of the people who are answered in periodicals  then why does she not consult some discreet and learned person her spiritual director  remorse entirely due no doubt to a conscience too delicately sensitive is not in our line of affairs  we only advise in cases of undesirable matrimonial engagements  so we are aware said miss crofton  dear julia is engaged or rather entangled inhow many cases dear  julia shook her head and sobbed behind her veil  is it one julianod when i come to the exact numbertwo three four  at the word four julia nodded assent  merton very much wished that julia would raise her veil  her figure was excellent and with so many sins of this kind on her remorseful head her face merton thought must be worth seeing  the case was new  as a rule clients wanted to disentangle their friends and relations  this client wanted to disentangle herself  this case said merton will be difficult to conduct and the expenses would be considerable  i can hardly advise you to incur them  our ordinary method is to throw in the way of one or other of the engaged or entangled persons some one who is likely to distract their affections of course he added to a more eligible object  how can i hope to find an object more eligible miss crofton than i must conceive your interesting friend to be  miss crofton caressingly raised julias veil  before the victim of remorse could bury her face in her hands merton had time to see that it was a very pretty one  julia was dark pale with eyes like billiard balls as a celebrated amateur once remarked with a beautiful mouth but with a somewhat wildly enthusiastic expression  how can i hope merton went on to find a worthier and more attractive object  nay how can i expect to secure the services not of one but of four  three would do mr merton explained miss crofton  is it not so julia dearest  julia again nodded assent and a sob came from behind the veil which she had resumed  even three said merton gallantly struggling with a strong inclination to laugh present difficulties  i do not speak the idle language of compliment miss crofton when i say that our staff would be overtaxed by the exigencies of this case  the expense also even of three  expense is no object said miss crofton  but would it not though i seem to speak against my own interests be the wisest most honourable and infinitely the least costly course for miss baddeley openly to inform her suitors three out of the four at least of the actual posture of affairs  i have already suggested that as the lady takes the matter so seriously to heart she should consult her director or if of the anglican or other protestant denomination her clergyman who i am sure will agree with me  miss crofton shook her head  julia is unattached she said  i had gathered that to one of the four miss baddeley wasnot indifferent said merton  i meant said miss crofton severely that miss baddeley is a christian unattached  my friend is sensitive passionate and deeply religious but not a member of any recognised denomination  the clergy  they never leave one alone said julia in a musical voice  it was the first time that she had spoken  besides she added and paused  besides dear julia isentangled with a young clergyman whom almost in despair she consulted on her caseat a picnic said miss crofton adding he is prepared to seek a martyrs fate but he insists that she must accompany him  how unreasonable murmured merton who felt that this recalcitrant clergyman was probably not the favourite out of the field of four  that is what i say remarked miss crofton  it is unreasonable to expect julia to accompany him when she has so much work to overtake in the home field  but that is the way with all of them  all of them exclaimed merton  are all the devoted young men under vows to seek the crown of martyrdom  does your friend act as recruiting sergeant if you will pardon the phrase for the noble army of martyrs  three of them have made the most solemn promises  and the fourth  he is not in holy orders  am i to understand that all the three admirers about whom miss baddeley suffers remorse are clerics  yes  julia has a wonderful attraction for the church said miss crofton and that is what causes her difficulties  she cant write to them or communicate to them in personal interviews as you advised that her heart is no longer  theirs said merton  but why are the clergy more privileged than the laity  i have heard of such things being broken to laymen  indeed it has occurred to many of us and we yet live  i have urged the same facts on julia myself said miss crofton  indeed i know by personal experience that what you say of the laity is true they do not break their hearts when disappointed  but julia replies that for her to act as you and i would advise might be to shatter the young clergymens ideals  to shatter the ideals of three young men in holy orders said merton  yes for julia is their idealjulia and duty said miss crofton as if she were naming a firm  she lives only here julia twisted the hand of miss crofton she lives only to do good  her fortune entirely under her own control enables her to do a great deal of good  merton began to understand that the charms of julia were not entirely confined to her beaux yeux  she is a true philanthropist  why she rescued me from the snares and temptations of the stage said miss crofton  oh now i understand said merton i knew that your face and voice were familiar to me  did you not act in a revival of the country wife  hush said miss crofton  and lady teazle at an amateur performance in the canterbury week  these are days of which i do not desire to be reminded said miss crofton  i was trying to explain to you that julia lives to do good and has a heart of gold  no my dear mr merton will much misconceive you unless you let me explain everything  this remark was in reply to the agitated gestures of julia  thrown much among the younger clergy in the exercise of her benevolence julia naturally awakens in them emotions not wholly brotherly  her sympathetic nature carries her off her feet and she sometimes says yes out of mere goodness of heart when it would be wiser for her to say no dont you julia  merton was reminded of one of m paul bourgets amiable married heroines who erred out of sheer goodness of heart but he only signified his intelligence and sympathy  then poor julia miss crofton went on hurriedly finds that she has misunderstood her heart  recently ever since she met captain lestrangeof the guards  the fourth asked merton  miss crofton nodded  she has felt more and more certain that she had misread her heart  but on each occasion she has felt thisafter meeting thewell the next one  i see the awkwardness murmured merton  and then remorse has set in with all her horrors  julia has wept oh for nights on my shoulder  happy shoulder murmured merton  and so as she dare not shatter their ideals and perhaps cause them to plunge into excesses moral or doctrinal this is what she has done she has said to each that what the church any church needs is martyrs and that if they will go to benighted lands where the crown of martyrdom may still be won then if they return safe in five years then shewill think of naming a day  you will easily see the attractions of this plan for julia mr merton  no ideals were shattered the young men being unaware of the circumstances  they might forget her  impossible cried merton  they might forget her or perhaps they  miss crofton hesitated  perhaps they might never asked merton  yes said miss crofton perhaps they might not  that would be all to the good for the church no ideals would be shatteredthe reverseand dear julia would  cherish their pious memories said merton  i see that you understand me said miss crofton  merton did understand and he was reminded of the wicked lady who when tired of her lovers had them put into a sack and dropped into the seine  but he asked has this ingenious system failed to work  i should suppose that each young man on distant and on deadly shores was far from causing inconvenience  the defect of the system said miss crofton is that none of them has gone or seems in a hurry to go  the firstthat was mr bathe julia  julia nodded  mr bathe was to have gone to turkey during the armenian atrocities and to have forced england to intervene by taking the armenian side and getting massacred  julia was intensely interested in the armenians  but mr bathe first said that he must lead julia to the altar before he went and then the massacres fell off and he remains at cheltenham and is very tiresome  and then there is mr clancy he was to go out to china and denounce the gods of the heathen chinese in the public streets  but he insisted that julia should first be his and he is at leamington and not a step has he taken to convert the boxers  merton knew the name of clancy  clancy had been his fag at school and merton thought it extremely improbable that the martyrs crown would ever adorn his brow  thenand this is the last of them of the clergy at leastmr brooke he was to visit the new hebrides where the natives are cannibals and utterly unawakened  he is as bad as the others  he wont go alone  now julia is obliged to correspond with all of them in affectionate terms she keeps well out of their way and this course of what she feels to be duplicity is preying terribly on her conscience  here julia sobbed hysterically  she is afraid too that by some accident though none of them know each other they may become aware of the state of affairs or captain lestrange to whom she is passionately attached may find it out and then not only may their ideals be wrecked but  yes i see said merton it is awkward very  the interview an early one had lasted for some time  merton felt that the hour of luncheon had arrived and after luncheon it had been his intention to go up to the university match  he also knew from various sounds that clients were waiting in the antechamber  at this moment the door opened and the office boy entering laid three cards before him  the gentlemen asked when you could see them sir  they have been waiting some time  they say that their appointment was at one oclock and they wish to go back to lords  so do i thought merton sadly  he looked at the cards repressed a whistle and handed them silently to miss crofton bidding the boy go and return in three minutes  miss crofton uttered a little shriek and pressed the cards on julias attention  raising her veil julia scanned them wrung her hands and displayed symptoms of a tendency to faint  the cards bore the names of the rev mr bathe the rev mr brooke and the rev mr clancy  what is to be done asked miss crofton in a whisper  cant you send them away  impossible said merton firmly  if we go out they will know me and suspect julia  miss crofton looked round the room with eyes of desperate scrutiny  they at once fell on a large oldfashioned screen covered with engravings which merton had picked up for the sake of two or three old mezzotints barbarously pasted on to this article of furniture by some ignorant owner  saved we are saved  hist julia hither said miss crofton in a stage whisper  and while merton murmured highly unprofessional the skirts of the two ladies vanished behind the screen  miss crofton had not played lady teazle for nothing  ask the gentlemen to come in said merton when the boy returned  they entered three fair young curates nervous and inclined to giggle shades of difference of ecclesiastical opinion declared themselves in their hats costume and jewellery  be seated gentlemen said merton and they sat down on three chairs in identical attitudes  we hope said the man on the left that we are not here inconveniently  we would have waited but you see we have all come up for the match  how is it going asked merton anxiously  cambridge four wickets down for 115 but and the young man stared it must be it is pussy merton  and you clancy minor why are you not converting the heathen chinee you deserve a death of torture  goodness  how do you know that asked clancy  i know many things answered merton  i am not sure which of you is mr bathe  clancy presented mr bathe a florid young evangelist who blushed  armenia is still suffering mr bathe and mr brooke said merton detecting him by the method of residues the oven is still hot in the new hebrides  what have you got to say for yourselves  the curates shifted nervously on their chairs  we see merton said clancy that you know a good deal which we did not know ourselves till lately  in fact we did not know each other till the church congress at leamington  then the other men came to tea at my rooms and saw  a portrait of a lady each of you possessed a similar portrait said merton  how the devi mean how do you know that  by a simple deductive process said merton  there were also letters he said  here a gurgle from behind the screen was audible to merton  we did not read each others letters said clancy blushing  of course not said merton  but the handwriting on the envelopes was identical clancy went on  well and what can our society do for you  why we saw your advertisements never guessed they were yours of course pussy andnone of us is a man of the world  i congratulate you said merton  so we thought we had better take advice it seemed rather a lark too dont you know  the fact isyou appear to have divined it somehowwe find that we are all engaged to the same lady  we cant fight and we cant all marry her  in thibet it might be practicable martyrdom might also be secured there said merton  martyrdom is not good enough said clancy  not half said bathe  a man has his duties in his own country said brooke  may i ask whether in fact your sorrows at this discovery have been intense asked merton  i was a good deal cut up at first said clancy i being the latest recruit  bathe had practically given up hope and had seen some one else  mr bathe drooped his head and blushed  brooke laughed  indeed we all laughed though we felt rather foolish  but what are we to do should we write her a round robin  bathe says he ought to be the man because he was first man in and i say i ought to be the man because i am not out  i would not build much on that said merton and he was sure that he heard a rustle behind the screen and a slight struggle  julia was trying to emerge restrained by miss crofton  i knew said clancy that there was somethingthat there were other fellows  but that i learned more or less under the seal of confession so to speak  at a picnic said merton  at this moment the screen fell with a crash and julia emerged her eyes blazing while miss crofton followed her hat somewhat crushed by the falling screen  the three young men in holy orders all of them desirable young men arose to their feet trembling visibly  apostates cried julia who had by far the best of the dramatic situation and pressed her advantage  recreants was it for such as you that i pointed to the crown of martyrdom  was it for your shattered ideals that i have wept many a night on serenas faithful breast  she pointed to miss crofton who enfolded her in an embrace you julia went on aiming at them the finger of conviction  i am but a woman weak i may have been wavering i may have been but i took you for men  i chose you to dare perhaps to perish for a cause  but now triflers that you are boys mere boys back with you to your silly games back to the thoughtless throng  i have done  julia attended by miss crofton swept from the chamber under her indignation which was quite as real as any of her other emotions the happiest woman in london  she had no more occasion for remorse no ideals had she sensibly injured  her entanglements were disentangled she inhaled the fragrance of orange blossoms from afar and heard the marriage music in the chapel of the guards  meanwhile the three curates and merton felt as if they had been whipped  trust a woman to have the best of it muttered merton admiringly  and now clancy may i offer a hasty luncheon to you and your friends before we go to lords  your business has been rather rapidly despatched  the conversation at luncheon turned exclusively on cricket     vi  a lover in cocky   it cannot be said that the bearers of the noblest names in the land flocked at first to the offices of messrs gray and graham  in fact the reverse in the beginning was the case  members even of the more learned professions held aloof indeed barristers and physicians never became eager clients  on the other hand messrs gray and graham received many letters in such handwritings such grammar and such orthography that they burned them without replying  a common sort of case was that of the young farmer whose widowed mother had set her heart on marriage with a bonny labouring boy a ploughman  we can do nothing with these people merton remarked  we cant send down a young and elegant friend of ours to distract the affections of an elderly female agriculturist  the bonny labouring boy would punch the fashionable head or at all events would prove much more attractive to the widow than our agent  then there are the members of the hebrew community  they hate mixed marriages and quite right too  i deeply sympathise  but if leah has let her affections loose on young timmins an anglosaxon and a christian what can we do  how stop the mesalliance  we have not in our little regiment one fair hebrew boy to smile away her maiden blame among the hebrew mothers of maida vale and to cut out timmins  and of course it is as bad with the men  if young isaacs wants to marry miss julia timmins i have no rebecca to slip at him  the semitic demand though large and perhaps lucrative cannot be met out of a purely aryan supply  business was pretty slack and so merton rather rejoiced over the application of a mrs nicholson from the laburnums waltonondove derbyshire  mrs nicholsons name was not in burkes landed gentry and the laburnums could hardly be estimated as one of the stately homes of england  still the lady was granted an interview  she was what the scots call a buddy that is she was large round attired in black between two ages and not easily to be distinguished by an unobservant eye from buddies as a class  after greetings and when enthroned in the clients chair mrs nicholson stated her case with simplicity and directness  it is my ward she said barbara monypenny  i must tell you that she was left in my charge till she is twentysix  i and her lawyers make her an allowance out of her property which she is to get when she marries with my consent at whatever age  may i ask how old the lady is at present said merton  she is twentytwo  your kindness in taking charge of her is not not wholly uncompensated  no an allowance is made to me out of the estate  an allowance which ends on her marriage if she marries with your consent  yes it ends then  her uncle trusted me a deal more than he trusted barbara  she was strange from a child  fond of the men as if that were an unusual and unbecoming form of philanthropy  i see and she being an heiress the testator was anxious to protect her youth and innocence  mrs nicholson merely sniffed but the sniff was affirmative though sarcastic  her property i suppose is considerable  i do not ask from impertinent curiosity nor for exact figures  but as a question of business may we call the fortune considerable  most people do  it runs into six figures  merton who had no mathematical head scribbled on a piece of paper  the result of his calculations which i not without some fever of the brow have personally verified proved that six figures might be anything between 100000l and 999000l 19s 1175d  certainly it is very considerable merton said after a few minutes passed in arithmetical calculation  am i too curious if i ask what is the source of this opulence  wiltons panmedicon or heal all a patent medicine  he sold the patent and retired  merton shuddered  it would be pammedicum if it could be anything he thought but it cant linguistically speaking  invaluable as a subterfuge said mrs nicholson obviously with an indistinct recollection of the advertisement and of the properties of the drug  merton construed the word as febrifuge silently and asked have you taken the young lady much into society has she had many opportunities of making a choice  you are dissatisfied with the choice i understand which she has made  i dont let her see anybody if i can help it  fire and powder are better kept apart and she is powder a minx  only a fisher or two comes to the perch thats the inn at waltonondove and they are mostly old gentlemen pottering with their rods and things  if a young man comes to the inn i take care to trapes after her through the nasty damp meadows  is the young lady an angler  she ismost unwomanly i call it  mertons idea of the young lady rose many degrees  you said the young lady was strange from a child very strange  fond of the men  happily for our sex and for the world it is not so very strange or unusual to take pity on us  she has always been queer  you do not hint at any cerebral disequilibrium asked merton  would you mind saying that again asked mrs nicholson  i meant nothing wrong here merton said laying his finger on his brow  no not so bad as that said mrs nicholson but just queer  uncommon tells odd stories aboutnonsense  she is wearing with her dreams  she reads books on i dont know how to call ittipsycake tipsicakical search  histories i call it  yes i understand said merton psychical research  thats it and hyptonism said mrs nicholson as many ladies do  ah hyptonism so called from its founder hypton the eminent anglo french chemist he was burned at rome one of the latest victims of the inquisition said merton  i dont hold with popery sir but it served him right  that is all the queerness then  that and general discontentedness  girls will be girls said merton she wants society  want must be her master then said mrs nicholson stolidly  but about the man of her choice have you anything against him  no but nothing for him i never even saw him  then where did miss monypenny make his acquaintance  well like a fool i let her go to pass christmas with some distant cousins of my own who should have known better  they stupidly took her to a dance at tutbury and there she met him just that once  and they became engaged on so short an acquaintance  not exactly that  she was not engaged when she came home and did not seem to mean to be  she did talk of him a lot  he had got round her finely told her that he was going out to the war and that they were sister spirits  he had dreamed of meeting her he said and that was why he came to the ball for he did not dance  he said he believed they had met in a state of presomething meaning if you understand me before they were born which could not be the case she not being a twin still less his twin  that would be the only way of accounting for it certainly said merton  but what followed  did they correspond  he wrote to her but she showed me the letter and put it in the fire unopened  he had written his name marmaduke ingles on a corner of the envelope  so far her conduct seems correct even austere said merton  it was at first but then he wrote from south africa where he volunteered as a doctor  he was a doctor at tutbury  she opened that letter  yes and showed it to me  he kept on with his nonsense asking her never to forget him and sending his photograph in cocky  pardon said merton  in uniform  and if he fell she would see his ghost in cocky crossing her room he said  in fact he knew how to get round the foolish girl  i believe he went out there just to make himself interesting  did you try to find out what sort of character he had at home  yes there was no harm in it only he had no business to speak of everybody goes to dr younghusband  then really if he is an honest young man as he seems to be a patriotic fellow are you certain that you are wise in objecting  i do object said mrs nicholson and indeed her motives for refusing her consent were only too obvious  are they quite definitely engaged asked merton  yes they are now by letter and she says she will wait for him till i die or she is twentysix if i dont give my consent  he writes every mail from places with outlandish names in africa  and she keeps looking in a glass ball like the labourers women some of them shes sunk as low as that so superstitious and sometimes she tells me that she sees what he is doing and where he is and now and then when his letters come she shows me bits of them to prove she was right  but just as often shes wrong only she wont listen to me  she says its telly tellyopathy  i say its flat nonsense  i quite agree with you said merton with conviction  after all though honest as far as you hear     oh yes honest enough but thats all interrupted mrs nicholson with a hearty sneer  though he bears a good character from what you tell me he seems to be a very silly young man  silly johnny to silly jenny put in mrs nicholson  a pair with ideas so absurd could not possibly be happy  merton reasoned  why dont you take her into the world and show her life with her fortune and with you to take her about she would soon forget this egregiously foolish romance  and me to have her snapped up by some whippersnapper that calls himself a lord  not me mr graham said mrs nicholson  the money that her uncle made by the panmedicon is not going to be spent on horses and worse if i can help it  then said merton all i can do for you is by our ordinary methodto throw some young man of worth and education in the way of your ward and attempt todivert her affections  and have him carry her off under my very nose  not much mr graham why where do i come in in this pretty plan  do not suppose me to suggest anything sodetrimental to your interests mrs nicholson  is your ward beautiful  a toad said mrs nicholson with emphasis  very well  there is no danger  the gentleman of whom i speak is betrothed to one of the most beautiful girls in england  they are deeply attached and their marriage is only deferred for prudential reasons  i dont trust one of them said mrs nicholson  very well madam answered merton severely i have done all that experience can suggest  the gentleman of whom i speak has paid especial attention to the mental delusions under which your ward is labouring and has been successful in removing them in some cases  but as you reject my suggestionhe rose so did mrs nicholsoni have the honour of wishing you a pleasant journey back to derbyshire  a bullet may hit him said mrs nicholson with much acerbity  thats my best hope  then merton bowed her out  the old woman will never let the girl marry anybody except some adventurer who squares her by giving her the full value of her allowance out of the estate thought merton adding i wonder how much it is  six figures is anything between a hundred thousand and a million  the man he had thought of sending down to divert miss monypennys affections from the young doctor was jephson the history coach at that hour waiting for a professorship to enable him to marry miss willoughby  however he dismissed mrs nicholson and her ward from his mind  about a fortnight later merton received a letter directed in an uneducated hand another of the agricultural classes he thought but looking at the close of the epistle he saw the name of eliza nicholson  she wrote     sirbarbara has been at her glass ball and seen him being carried    on board a ship  if she is right and she is not always wrong he is    on his way home  though i will never give my consent this spells    botheration for me  you can send down your young man that cures by    teleopathy a thing that has come up since my time  he can stay at    the perch and take a fishing rod then they are safe to meet  i    trust him no more than the rest but she may fall between two stools    if the doctor does come home     your obedient servant     eliza nicholson  merely to keep ones hand in thought merton in the present disappointing slackness of business ill try to see jephson  i dont like or trust him  i dont think he is the man for miss willoughby  so if he ousts the doctor and catches the heiress why there was more lost at shirramuir as logan says  merton managed to go up to oxford and called on jephson  he found him anxious about a good quiet cheap place for study  do you fish asked merton  when i get the chance said jephson  he was a dark rather clumsy but not unprepossessing young don with a very slight squint  if you fish did you ever try the perchi mean an inn not the fish of the same nameat waltonondove  a pretty quiet place two miles of water local history perhaps interesting  it is not very far from tutbury where queen mary was kept i think  it sounds well said jephson ill write to the landlord and ask about terms  you could not do better said merton and he took his leave  now am i thought merton as he walked down the broad to put jephson up to it  if i dont of course i cant reap the benefit of one single pin for the society jephson not being a member  but the money anyhow would come from that old harpy out of the girls estate  olet  i dont like the fragrance of that kind of cash  but if the girl really is plain a toad nothing may happen  on the other hand jephson is sure to hear about her position from local gossipthat she is rich and so on  perhaps she is not so very plain  they are sure to meet or mrs nicholson will bring them together in her tactful way  she has not much time to lose if the girls glass ball yarn is true and it may be true by a fluke  jephson is rather bitten by a taste for all that teleopathy business as the old malaprop calls it  on the whole i shall say no more to him but let him play the game if he goes to walton off his own bat  presently merton received a note from jephson dated the perch waltonon dove  jephson expressed his gratitude the place suited his purpose very well  he had taken a brace and a half of trout bordering on two pounds one and a quarter thought merton  and what wont interest you his letter said i have run across a curiously interesting subject what you would call hysterical  but what after all is hysteria c c  laffaire est dans le sac said merton to himself  jephson and miss monypenny have met  weeks passed and one day on arriving at the office merton found miss willoughby there awaiting his arrival  she was the handsome miss willoughby jephsons betrothed a learned young lady who lived but poorly by verifying references and making researches at the record office  merton at once had a surmise nor was it mistaken  the usual greetings had scarcely passed when the girl with cheeks on fire and eyes aflame said  mr merton do you remember a question rather unconventional which you put to me at the dinner party you and mr logan gave at the restaurant  i ought not to have said it said merton but then it was an unconventional gathering  i asked if you  your words were had i a spark of the devil in me  well i have  can i  turn it to any purpose  you can miss willoughby and i shall have the honour to lay the method before you of course only for your consideration and under seal of secrecy  indeed i was just about to write to you asking for an interview  merton then laid the circumstances in which he wanted miss willoughbys aid before her but these must be reserved for the present  she listened was surprised was clearly ready for more desperate adventures she came into his views and departed  jephson has played the game off his own batand won it thought merton to himself  what a very abject the fellow is  but after all i have disentangled miss willoughby she was infinitely too good for the man with his squint  as merton indulged in these rather pharisaical reflections mrs nicholson was announced  merton greeted her and gave orders that no other client was to be admitted  he was himself rather nervous  was mrs nicholson in a rage  no her eyes beamed friendly geniality clothed her brow  he has squared her thought merton  indeed the lady had warmly grasped his hand with both of her own which were imprisoned in tight new gloves while her bonnet spoke of regardlessness of expense and recent prodigality  she fell back into the clients chair  oh sir she said when first we met we did not part or i did notyou were quite the gentlemanon the best of terms  but now how can i speak of your wise advice and how much dont i owe you  merton answered very gravely you do not owe me anything madam  please understand that i took absolutely no professional steps in your affair  what cried mrs nicholson  you did not send down that blessed young man to the perch  i merely suggested that the inn might suit a person whom i knew who was looking for country quarters  your name never crossed my lips nor a word about the business on which you did me the honour to consult me  then i owe you nothing  nothing at all  well i do call this providential said mrs nicholson with devout enthusiasm  you are not in my debt to the extent of a farthing but if you think i have accidentally been  an instrument said mrs nicholson  well an unconscious instrument perhaps you can at least tell me why you think so  what has happened  you really dont know  i only know that you are pleased and that your anxieties seem to be relieved  why he saved her from being burned and the brave said mrs nicholson deserve the fair not that she is a beauty  do tell me all that happened  and tell you i can for that precious young man took me into his confidence  first when i heard that he had come to the perch i trampled about the damp riverside with barbara and sure enough they met he being on the perchs side of the fence and barbaras line being caught high up in a tree on ours as often happens  well i asked him to come over the fence and help her to get her line clear which he did very civilly and then he showed her how to fish and then i asked him to tea and left them alone a bit and when i came back they were talking about teleopathy and her glass ball and all that nonsense  and he seemed interested but not to believe in it quite  i could not understand half their tipsycakical lingo  so of course they often met again at the river and he often came to tea and she seemed to take to himshe was always one for the men  and at last a very queer thing happened and gave him his chance  it was a very hot day in july and she fell asleep on a seat under a tree with her glass ball in her lap she had been staring at it i suppose  any way she slept on till the sun went round and shone full on the ball and just as he mr jephson that is came into the gate the glass ball began to act like a burning glass and her skirt began to smoke  well he waited a bit i think till the skirt blazed a little and then he rushed up and threw his coat over her skirt and put the fire out  and so he saved her from being a molochaust like you read about in the bible  merton mentally disengaged the word molochaust into moloch and holocaust  and there she was when i happened to come by acrying and carrying on with her head on his shoulder  a pleasing group and so they were engaged on the spot asked merton  not she  she held off and thanked her preserver but she would be true she said to her lover in cocky  but before that mr jephson had taken me into his confidence  and you made no objection to his winning your ward if he could  no sir i could trust that young man i could trust him with barbara  his arguments said merton must have been very cogent  he understood my situation if she married and what i deserved said mrs nicholson growing rather uncomfortable and fidgeting in the clients chair  merton too understood and knew what the sympathetic arguments of jephson must have been  and after all merton asked the lover has prospered in his suit  this is how he got round her  he said to me that night in private mrs nicholson said he your niece is a very interesting historical subject  i am deeply anxious apart from my own passion for her to relieve her from a singular but not very uncommon delusion  meaning her lover in cocky i said  there is no lover in cocky says he  no dr ingles said i  yes there is a dr ingles but he is not her lover and your niece never met him  i bicycled to tutbury lately and after examining the scene of queen marys captivity i made a few inquiries  what i had always suspected proved to be true  dr ingles was not present at that ball at the bear at tutbury  well mrs nicholson went on you might have knocked me down with a feather  i had never asked my second cousins the question not wanting them to guess about my affairs  but down i sat and wrote to maria and got her answer  barbara never saw dr ingles only heard the girls mention him and his going to the war  and then after that by mr jephsons advice i went and gave barbara my mind  she should marry mr jephson who saved her life or be the laughing stock of the country  i showed her up to herself with her glass ball and her teleopathy and her sham loveletters that she wrote herself and all her humbug  she cried and she fainted and she carried on but i went at her whenever she could listen to reason  so she said yes and i am the happy woman  and mr jephson is to be congratulated on so sensible and veracious a bride said merton  oh he says it is by no means an uncommon case and that he has effected a complete cure and they will be as happy as idiots said mrs nicholson as she rose to depart  she left merton pensive and not disposed to overrate human nature  but there cant be many fellows like jephson he said  i wonder how much the six figures run to  but that question was never answered to his satisfaction     vii  the adventure of the exemplary earl   i  the earls longlost cousin   a jilt in time saves nine says the proverbial wisdom of our forefathers adding one jilt makes many  in the last chapter of the book of this chronicle we told how the mercenary mr jephson proved false to the beautiful miss willoughby who supported existence by her skill in deciphering and transcribing the manuscript records of the past we described the consequent visit of miss willoughby to the office of the disentanglers and how she reminded merton that he had asked her once if she had a spark of the devil in her  she had that morning received in fact a letter crawling but explicit from the unworthy jephson her lover  retired he said to the rural loneliness of derbyshire he had read in his own heart and what he there deciphered convinced him that as a man of honour he had but one course before him he must free miss willoughby from her engagement  the lady was one of those who suffer in silence  she made no moan and no reply to jephsons letter but she did visit merton and practically gave him to understand that she was ready to start as a corsair on the seas of amorous adventure  she had nailed the black flag to the mast unhappy herself she was apt to have no mercy on the sentiments and affections of others  merton as it chanced had occasion for the services of a lady in this mood a lady at once attractive and steelyhearted resolute to revenge on the whole of the opposite sex the baseness of a fellow of his college  such is the frenzy of an injured loveillogical indeed for we are not responsible for the errors of isolated members of our sex but primitive natural to women and even to some men in miss willoughbys position  the occasion for such services as she would perform was provided by a noble client who on visiting the office had found merton out and logan in attendance  the visitor was the earl of embleton of the north entering the rooms he fumbled with the string of his eyeglass and after capturing it looked at logan with an air of some bewilderment  he was a tall erect slim and wellpreserved patrician with a manner really shy though hasty critics interpreted it as arrogant  he was between two ages a very susceptible period in the history of the individual  i think we have met before said the earl to logan  your face is not unfamiliar to me  yes said logan i have seen you at several places and he mumbled a number of names  ah i remember nowat lady lochmabens said lord embleton  you are i think a relation of hers     a distant relation my name is logan  what of the restalrig family said the earl with excitement  a faroff kinsman of the marquis said logan adding may i ask you to be seated  this is really very interesting to mesurprisingly interesting said the earl  what a strange coincidence  how small the world is how brief are the ages  our ancestors mr logan were very intimate long ago  indeed said logan  yes  i would not speak of it to everybody in fact i have spoken of it to no one but recently examining some documents in my munimentroom i made a discovery as interesting to me as it must be to you  our ancestors three hundred years agoin 1600 to be exactwere fellow conspirators  ah the old gowrie game to capture the king asked logan who had once kidnapped a cat  his knowledge of history was mainly confined to that obscure and unexplained affair in which his wicked old ancestor is thought to have had a hand  that is it said the visitorthe gowrie mystery  you may remember that an unknown person a friend of your ancestor was engaged  yes said logan he was never identified  was his name harris  the peer half rose to his feet flushed a fine purple twiddled the obsolete little grey tuft on his chin and sat down again  i think i said mr logan that the hitherto unidentified associate of your ancestor was a member of my own family  our name is not harrisa name very honourably borneour family name is guevara  my ancestor was a cousin of the brave lord willoughby  most interesting  you must pardon me but as nobody ever knew what you have just found out you will excuse my ignorance said logan who to be sure had never heard of the brave lord willoughby  it is i who ought to apologise said the visitor  your mention of the name of harris appeared to me to indicate a frivolity as to matters of the past which i must confess is apt to make me occasionally forget myself  noblesse oblige you know we respect ourselvesin our progenitors  unless he wants to prevent someone from marrying his greatgrandmother i wonder what he is doing with his tales of a grandfather here thought logan but he only smiled and said assuredlymy own opinion i wish i could respect my ancestor  the gentleman of whom i speak the associate of your own distant progenitor was the founder of our house as far as mere titles are concerned  we were but squires of northumbria of ancient celtic descent before the time of queen elizabeth  my ancestor at that time  oh bother his pedigree thought logan  was a young officer in the english garrison of berwick and he i find was your ancestors unknown correspondent  i am not skilled in reading old hands and i am anxious to secure a trustworthy personreally trustworthyto transcribe the manuscripts which contain these exciting details  logan thought that the office of the disentanglers was hardly the place to come to in search of an historical copyist  however he remembered miss willoughby and said that he knew a lady of great skill and industry of good family too upon whom his client might entirely depend she is a miss willoughby he added  not one of the willoughbys of the wicket a most worthy though unfortunate house nearly allied as i told you to my own about three hundred years ago said the earl  yes she is a daughter of the last squire  ruined in the modern race for wealth like so many exclaimed the peer and he sat in silence deeply moved his lips formed a name familiar to law courts  excuse my emotion mr logan he went on  i shall be happy to see and arrange with this lady who i trust will as my cousin accept my hospitality at rookchester  i shall be deeply interested as you no doubt will also be in the result of her researches into an affair which so closely concerns both you and me  he was silent again musing deeply while logan marvelled more and more what his real original business might be  all this affair of the documents and the munimentroom had arisen by the merest accident and would not have arisen if the earl had found merton at home  the earl obviously had a difficulty in coming to the point many clients had  to approach a total stranger on the most intimate domestic affairs even if his ancestor and yours were in a big thing together three hundred years ago is to a sensitive patrician no easy task  in fact even members of the middle class were as clients occasionally affected by shyness  mr logan said the earl i am not a man of today  the cupidity of our age the eagerness with which wealthy aliens are welcomed into our best houses and families is to me i may say distasteful  better that our coronets were dimmed than that they should be gilded with the gold eagles of chicago or blazing with the diamonds of kimberley  my feelings on this point are unusuallyi do not think that they are undulyacute  logan murmured assent  i am poor said the earl with all the expansiveness of the shy but i never held what is called a share in my life  it is long said logan with perfect truth since anything of that sort was in my own possession  in that respect my scutcheon so to speak is without a stain  how fortunate i am to have fallen in with one of sentiments akin to my own unusual as they are said the earl  i am a widower he went on and have but one son and one daughter  he is coming to business now thought logan  the former i fear is as good almost as affiancedis certainly in peril of betrothalto a lady against whom i have not a word to say except that she is inordinately wealthy the sole heiress of  here the earl gasped and was visibly affected  you may have heard sir the patrician went on of a commercial transaction of nature unfathomable to myselfi have not sought for information he waved his hand impatiently a transaction called a straddle  logan murmured that he was aware of the existence of the phrase though unconscious of its precise meaning  the ladys wealth is based on a successful straddle operated by her only known male ancestor inbristleshogs bristles and lard said the earl  miss bangs exclaimed logan knowing the name wealth and the source of the wealth of the ruling chicago heiress of the day  i am to be understood to speak of miss bangsas her name has been pronounced between uswith all the respect due to youth beauty and an amiable disposition said the peer but bristles mr logan hogs bristles and lard  and a straddle  lucky devil scremerston thought logan for scremerston was the only son of lord embleton and he as it seemed had secured that coveted prize of the youth of england the heart of the opulent miss bangs  but logan only sighed and stared at the wall as one who hears of an irremediable disaster  if they really were betrothed said lord embleton i would have nothing to say or do in the way of terminating the connection however unwelcome  a mans word is his word  it is in these circumstances of doubt when the fortunes of a house ancient though titularly of mere tudor noblesse hang in the balance that despairing of other help i have come to you  but asked logan have things gone so very far  is the disaster irremediable  i am acquainted with your son lord scremerston in fact he was my fag at school  may i speak quite freely  certainly you will oblige me  well by the candour of early friendship scremerston was called the arcadian an allusion to a certain tenderness of heart allied withhma rather confident and sanguine disposition  i think it may console you to reflect that perhaps he rather overestimates his success with the admirable young lady of whom we spoke  you are not certain that she has accepted him  no said the earl obviously relieved  i am sure that he has not positively proposed to her  he knows my opinion he is a dutiful son but he did seem very confidentseemed to think that his honour was engaged  i think we may discount that a little said logan and hope for the best  i shall try to take that view said the earl  you console me infinitely mr logan  logan was about to speak again when his client held up a gently deprecating hand  that is not all mr logan  i have a daughter  logan chanced to be slightly acquainted with the daughter lady alice guevara a very nice girl  is she attached to a south african jew logan thought  in this case said the client there is no want of blood royal in origin if it comes to that  to the house of bourbon i have no objection in itself that would be idle affectation  logan gasped  was this extraordinary man anxious to reject a lady multimillionaire for his son and a crown of some sort or other for his daughter  but the stain of illgotten goldsilver toois ineffaceable  it really cannot be bristles this time thought logan  and a dynasty based on the roulettetable      oh the prince of scalastro cried logan  i see that you know the worst said the earl  logan knew the worst fairly well  the prince of scalastro owned a percentage of two or three thousand which logan had dropped at the tables licensed in his principality  to the prince personally i bear no illwill said the earl  he is young brave scientific accomplished and this unfortunate attachment began before he inherited hishmdominions  i fear it is on both sides a deep and passionate sentiment  and now mr logan you know the full extent of my misfortunes what course does your experience recommend  i am not a harsh father  could i disinherit scremerston which i cannot the loss would not be felt by him in the circumstances as to my daughter  the peer rose and walked to the window  when he came back and resumed his seat logan turned on him a countenance of mournful sympathy  the earl silently extended his hand which logan took  on few occasions had a strain more severe been placed on his gravity but unlike a celebrated diplomatist he could command his smile  your case he said is one of the most singular delicate and distressing which i have met in the course of my experience  there is no objection to character and poverty is not the impediment the reverse you will permit me no doubt to consult my partner mr merton we have naturally no secrets between us and he possesses a delicacy of touch and a power of insight which i can only regard with admiring envy  it was he who carried to a successful issue that difficult case in the family of the sultan of mingrelia you will observe that i use a fictitious name i can assure you lord embleton that polygamy presents problems almost insoluble problems of extreme delicacyor indelicacy  i had not heard of that affair said the earl  like eumaeus in homer and in mr stephen phillips i dwell among the swine and come rarely to the city  the matter never went beyond the inmost diplomatic circles said logan the sultans favourite son the jam or crown prince of mingrelia jamreal they called him loved four beautiful bollachians sistersagain i disguise the nationality  sisters exclaimed the peer i have always given my vote against the deceased wifes sister bill but four and all alive  the law of the prophet as you are aware is not monogamous said logan and the eastern races are not averse to connections which are reprobated by our western ideas  the real difficulty was that of religion     oh why from the heretic girl of my soul    should i fly to seek elsewhere an orthodox kiss  hummed logan rather to the surprise of lord embleton  he went on it is not so much that the mingrelians object to mixed marriages in the matter of religion but the bollachians being christians do object and have a horror of polygamy  it was a cruel affair  all four girls and the jamreal himself were passionately attached to each other  it was known too that for political reasons the maidens had received a dispensation from the leading archimandrite their metropolitan to marry the proud paynim  the mingrelian sultan is suzerain of bollachia his native subjects are addicted to massacring the bollachians from religious motives and the bollachian church nestorians as you know hoped that the four brides would convert the jamreal to their creed and so solve the bollachian question  the end they said justified the means  jesuitical said the earl shaking his head sadly  that is what my friend and partner mr merton thought said logan when we were applied to by the sultan  merton displayed extraordinary tact and address  all was happily settled the sultan and the jamreal were reconciled the young ladies met other admirers and learned that what they had taken for love was but a momentary infatuation  the earl sighed renovare dolorem  my family said he is and has long beenever since the gunpowder plotfirmly if not passionately attached to the church of england  the prince of scalastro is a catholic  had we a closer acquaintance with the parties concerned murmured logan  you must come and visit us at rookchester said the earl  in any case i am most anxious to know better one whose ancestor was so closely connected with my own  we shall examine my documents under the tuition of the lady you mentioned miss willoughby if she will accept the hospitality of a kinsman  logan murmured acquiescence and again asked permission to consult merton which was granted  the earl then shook hands and departed obviously somewhat easier in his mind  this remarkable conversation was duly reported by logan to merton  what are we to do next asked logan  why you can do nothing but reconnoitre  go down to rookchester  it is in northumberland on the coqueta pretty place but there is no fishing just now  then we must ask lord embleton to meet miss willoughby  the interview can be here miss willoughby will arrive chaperoned by miss blossom after the earl makes his appearance  that will do as far as his bothering old manuscripts are concerned but how about the real businessthe two undesirable marriages  we must first see how the land lies  i do not know any of the lovers what sort of fellow is scremerston  nothing remarkable about himgood plucky vain little fellow  i suppose he wants money like the rest of the world but his father wont let him be a director of anything though he is in the house and his name would look well on a list  so he wants to marry dollars  i suppose he has no objection to them but have you seen miss bangs  i dont remember her said merton  then you have not seen her  she is beautiful by jove and i fancy clever and nice and gives herself no airs  and she has all that money and yet the old gentleman objects  he can not stand the bristles and lard said logan  then the prince of scalastrohim i have come across  you would never take him for a foreigner said merton bestowing on the royal youth the highest compliment which an englishman can pay but adding only he is too intelligent and knows too much  no there is nothing the matter with him logan admittednothing but happening to inherit a gambling establishment and the garden it stands in  he is a scientific charactera scientific soldier  i wish we had a few like him  well it is a hard case said merton  they all seem to be very good sort of people  and lady alice guevara  i hardly know her at all but she is pretty enoughtall yellow hair brown eyes  and as good a girl as lives added logan  very religious too  she wont change her creed asked merton  she would go to the stake for it said logan  she is more likely to convert the prince  that would be one difficulty out of the way said merton  but the gambling establishment  there is the rub  and the usual plan wont work  you are a captivating person logan but i do not think that you could attract lady alices affections and disentangle her in that way besides the prince would have you out  then miss bangs dollars not to mention herself must have too strong a hold on scremerston  it really looks too hard a case for us on paper  you must go down and reconnoitre  logan agreed and wrote asking lord embleton to come to the office where he could see miss willoughby and arrange about her visit to him and his manuscripts  the young lady was invited to arrive rather later bringing miss blossom as her companion  on the appointed day logan and merton awaited lord embleton  he entered with an air unwontedly buoyant and was introduced to merton  the first result was an access of shyness  the earl hummed began sentences dropped them and looked pathetically at logan  merton understood  the earl had taken to logan on account of their hereditary partnership in an ancient iniquity and it was obvious that he would say to him what he would not say to his partner  merton therefore withdrew to the outer room they had met in the inner and the earl delivered himself to logan in a little speech  since we met mr logan said he a very fortunate event has occurred the prince of scalastro in a private interview has done me the honour to take me into his confidence  he asked my permission to pay his addresses to my daughter and informed me that finding his ownership of the gambling establishment distasteful to her he had determined not to renew the lease to the company  he added that since his boyhood having been educated in germany he had entertained scruples about the position which he would one day occupy that he had never entered the rooms that haunt of vice and that his acquaintance with my daughter had greatly increased his objections to gambling though his scruples were not approved of by his confessor a very learned priest  that is curious said logan  very said the earl  but as i expect the prince and his confessor at rookchester where i hope you will join us we may perhaps find out the reasons which actuate that no doubt respectable person  in the meantime as i would constrain nobody in matters of religion i informed the prince that he had my permission towell to plead his cause for himself with lady alice  logan warmly congratulated the earl on the gratifying resolve of the prince and privately wondered how the young people would support life when deprived of the profits from the tables  it was manifest however from the buoyant air of the earl that this important question had never crossed his mind  he looked quite young in the gladness of his heart he smelled april and may he was clad becomingly in summer raiment and to logan it was quite a pleasure to see such a happy man  some fifteen years seemed to have been taken from the age of this buxom and simplehearted patrician  he began to discuss with logan all conceivable reasons why the princes director had rather discouraged his idea of closing the gamblingrooms for ever  the father father riccoboni is a jesuit mr logan said the earl gravely  i would not be uncharitable i hope i am not prejudiced but members of that community i fear often prefer what they think the interests of their church to those of our common christianity  a portion of the great wealth of the scalastros was annually devoted to masses for the souls of the playersabout fifteen per cent i believewho yearly shoot themselves in the gardens of the establishment  no more suicides no more subscriptions i suppose said logan but the practice proved that the reigning princes of scalastro had feeling hearts  while the earl developed this theme miss willoughby accompanied by miss blossom had joined merton in the outer room  miss blossom being clad in white with her blue eyes and appleblossom complexion looked like the month of may  but merton could not but be struck by miss willoughby she was tall and dark with large grey eyes a greek profile and a brow which could on occasion be thunderous and lowering so that miss willoughby seemed to all a remarkably fine young woman while the educated spectator was involuntarily reminded of the beautiful sister of the beautiful helen the celebrated clytemnestra  the young lady was clad in very dark blue with orange points so to speak and compared with her transcendent beauty miss blossom as logan afterwards remarked seemed a     wee modest crimsontippit beastie  he intending to quote the poet burns  after salutations merton remarked to miss blossom that her wellknown discretion might prompt her to take a seat near the window while he discussed private business with miss willoughby  the goodhumoured girl retired to contemplate life from the casement while merton rapidly laid the nature of lord embletons affairs before the other lady  you go down to rookchester as a kinswoman and a guest you understand and to do the business of the manuscripts  oh i shall rather like that than otherwise said miss willoughby smiling  then as to the regular business of the society there is a prince who seems to be thought unworthy of the daughter of the house and the son of the house needs disentangling from an american heiress of great charm and wealth  the tasks might satisfy any ambition said miss willoughby  is the idea that the prince and the viscount should both neglect their former flames  and burn incense at the altar of venus verticordia said merton with a bow  it is a large order replied miss willoughby in the simple phrase of a commercial age but as merton looked at her and remembered the vindictive feeling with which she now regarded his sex he thought that she if anyone was capable of executing the commission  he was not of course as yet aware of the moral resolution lately arrived at by the young potentate of scalastro  the manuscripts are the first thing of course he said and as he spoke logan and lord embleton reentered the room  merton presented the earl to the ladies and miss blossom soon retired to her own apartment and wrestled with the correspondence of the society and with her typewritingmachine  the earl proved not to be nearly so shy where ladies were concerned  he had not expected to find in his remote and longlost cousin miss willoughby a magnificent being like persephone on a coin of syracuse but it was plain that he was prepossessed in her favour and there was a touch of the affectionate in his courtesy  after congratulating himself on recovering a kinswoman of a longseparated branch of his family and after a good deal of genealogical disquisition he explained the nature of the ladys historical tasks and engaged her to visit him in the country at an early date  miss willoughby then said farewell having an engagement at the record office where as the earl gallantly observed she would make a sunshine in a shady place  when she had gone the earl observed bon sang ne peut pas mentir  to think of that beautiful creature condemned to waste her lovely eyes on faded ink and yellow papers  why she is as the modern poet says a sight to make an old man young  he then asked logan to acquaint merton with the new and favourable aspect of his affairs and after fixing logans visit to rookchester for the same date as miss willoughbys he went off with a juvenile alertness  i say said logan i dont know what will come of this but something will come of it  i had no idea that girl was such a paragon  take care logan said merton  you ought only to have eyes for miss markham  miss markham the precise student may remember was the lady once known as the venus of milo to her young companions at st ursulas  now mantles were draped on her stately shoulders at madame claudines and logan and she were somewhat hopelessly attached to each other  take care of yourself at rookchester merton went on or the disentangler may be entangled  i am not a viscount and i am not an earl said logan with a reminiscence of an old popular song nor i am not a prince but a shade or two wuss and i think that miss willoughby will find other marks for the artillery of her eyes  we shall have news of it said merton    ii  the affair of the jesuit   trains do not stop at the little rookchester station except when the high and puissant prince the earl of embleton or his visitors or his ministers servants solicitors and agents of all kinds are bound for that haven  when logan arrived at the station a bowery flowery amateurlooking depot like one of the model villages that we sometimes see off the stage he was met by the earl his son lord scremerston and miss willoughby  logans baggage was spirited away by menials who doubtless bore it to the house in some ordinary conveyance and by the vulgar road  but lord embleton explained that as the evening was warm and the woodland path by the river was cool they had walked down to welcome the coming guest  the walk was beautiful indeed along the top of the precipitous red sandstone cliffs with the deep dark pools of the coquet sleeping far below  now and then a heron poised or a rock pigeon flew by between the river and the clifftop  the opposite bank was embowered in deep green wood and the place was very refreshing after the torrid bricks and distressing odours of the july streets of london  the path was narrow there was room for only two abreast  miss willoughby and scremerston led the way and were soon lost to sight by a turn in the path  as for lord embleton he certainly seemed to have drunk of that fountain of youth about which the old french poet pontus de tyard reports to us and to be going back not forward in age  he looked very neat slim and cool but that could not be the only cause of the miracle of rejuvenescence  closely regarding his host in profile logan remarked that he had shaved off his moustache and the little obsolete irongrey chintuft which in moments of perplexity he had been wont to twiddle  its loss was certainly a very great improvement to the cleancut features of this patrician  we are a very small party said lord embleton only the prince my daughter father riccoboni miss willoughby my sister scremerston and you and i  miss willoughby came last week  in the mornings she and i are busy with the manuscripts  we have found most interesting things when their plot failed your ancestor and mine prepared a ship to start for the western seas and attack the treasureships of spain  but peace broke out and they never achieved that adventure  miss willoughby is a cousin well worth discovering so intelligent and so wonderfully attractive  so scremerston seems to think was logans idea for the further he and the earl advanced the less if possible they saw of the pair in front of them indeed neither was visible again till the party met before dinner  however logan only said that he had a great esteem for miss willoughbys courage and industry through the trying years of poverty since she left st ursulas  the prince we have not seen very much of said the earl as is natural for you will be glad to know that everything seems most happily arranged except so far as the religious difficulty goes  as for father riccoboni he is a quiet intelligent man who passes most of his time in the library but makes himself very agreeable at meals  and now here we are arrived  they had reached the south side of the housean eighteenthcentury building in the red sandstone of the district giving on a grassy terrace  there the hosts maiden sister lady mary guevara was seated by a teatable surrounded by dogstwo collies and an aberdeenshire terrier  beside her were father riccoboni with a newspaper in his hand lady alice with whom logan had already some acquaintance and the prince of scalastro  logan was presented and took quiet notes of the assembly while the usual chatter about the weather and his journey got itself transacted and the view of the valley of the coquet had justice done to its charms  lady mary was very like a feminine edition of the earl refined shy and with silvery hair  lady alice was a pretty quiet type of the english girl who is not up to date with a particularly happy and winning expression  the prince was of a teutonic fairness for the royal caste whatever the nationality is to a great extent made in germany and retains the physical characteristics of that ancient forest people whom the roman historian never having met them so lovingly idealised  the prince was tall wellproportioned and looked every inch a soldier there were a great many inches  as for father riccoboni the learned have remarked that there are two chief clerical types the dark ascetic type to be found equally among unitarians baptists anglicans presbyterians and catholics and the burly wellfed genial type which cometh eating and drinking  the father was of this second kind a lusty mannot that you could call him a sensuallooking man still less was he a noisy humourist but he had a considerable jowl a strong jaw a wide firm mouth and large teeth very white and square  logan thought that he too had the makings of a soldier and also felt almost certain that he had seen him before  but wherefor logans acquaintance with the clergy especially the foreign clergy was not extensive  the father spoke english very well with a slight german accent and a little hoarseness his voice too did not sound unfamiliar to logan  but he delved in his subconscious memory in vain there was the father a man with whom he certainly had some associations yet he could not place the man  a bell jangled somewhere without as they took tea and tattled and looking towards the place whence the sound came logan saw a little group of italian musicians walking down the avenue which led through the park to the east side of the house and the main entrance  they entered with many obeisances through the old gate of floreated wrought iron and stopping there about forty yards away they piped while a girl in the usual contadina dress clashed her cymbals and danced not ungracefully the father who either did not like music or did not like it of that sort sighed rose from his seat and went into the house by an open french window  the prince also rose but he went forward to the group of italians and spoke to them for a few minutes  if he did not like that sort of music he took the more excellent way for the action of his elbow indicated a movement of his hand towards his waistcoatpocket  he returned to the party on the terrace and the itinerant artists after more obeisances walked slowly back by the way they had come  they are genoese said the prince tramping north to scotland for the holiday season  they will meet strong competition from the pipers said logan while the earl rose and walked rapidly after the musicians  i do not like the pipes myself logan went on but when i hear them in a london street my heart does warm to the skirl and the shabby tartans  i feel with you said the prince when i see the smiling faces of these poor sons of the south amongwell your english faces are not usually joyousif one may venture to be critical  he looked up and his eyes meeting those of lady alice he had occasion to learn that every rule has its exceptions  the young people rose and wandered off on the lawn while the earl came back and said that he had invited the foreigners to refresh themselves  i saw father riccoboni in the hall and asked him to speak to them a little in their own lingo he added though he does not appear to be partial to the music of his native land  he seems to be of the romansch districts logan said his accent is almost german  i daresay he will make himself understood said the earl  do you understand this house mr logan  it looks very modern does it not  early georgian surely said logan  the shell at least on this side is early georgiani rather regret it but the interior northward except for the rooms in front here is of the good old times  we have secret stairsnot that there is any secret about themand odd cubicles in the old border keep which was refaced about 1750 and we have a priests hole or two in which father riccoboni might have been safe but would have been very uncomfortable three hundred years ago  i can show you the places tomorrow indeed we have very little in the way of amusement to offer you  do you fish  i always take a trout rod about with me in case of the best said logan but this is soolky july you know and the trout usually seem sound asleep  their habits are dissipated here said lord embleton  they begin to feed about ten oclock at night  did you ever try night fishing with the bustard  the bustard asked logan  it is a big fluffy fly like a draggled mayfly fished wet in the dark i used to be fond of it but age sighed the earl and fear of rheumatism have separated the bustard and me  i should like to try it very much said logan  i often fished tweed and whitadder at night when i was a boy but we used a small dark fly  you must be very careful if you fish at night here said lady mary  it is so dark in the valley under the woods and the coquet is so dangerous the flat sandstone ledges are like the floor of a room and then a step may land you in water ten feet deep flowing in a narrow channel  i am always anxious when anyone fishes here at night  you can swim  logan confessed that he was not destitute of that accomplishment and that he liked of all things to be by a darkling river where you came across the night side of nature in the way of birds beasts and fishes  mr logan can take very good care of himself i am sure said lord embleton and fenwick knows every inch of the water and will go with him  fenwick is the waterkeeper mr logan and represents man in the fishing and shooting stage  his one thought is the destruction of animal life  he is a very happy man  i never knew but one keeper who was not said logan  that was in galloway  he hated shooting he hated fishing  my impression is that he was what we call a stickit minister  nothing of that about fenwick said the earl  i daresay you would like to see your room  thither logan was conducted through a hall hung with pikes and guns and bows and clubs from the south seas and zulu shields and assegais while a few empty figures in tilting armour lance in hand stood on pedestals  thence up a broad staircase along a little gallery up a few steps of an old turnpike staircase logan reached his room which looked down through the trees of the cliff to the coquet  dinner passed in the silver light of the long northern day that threw strange blue reflections softer than sapphire on the ancient platethe ambassadorial plate of a jacobean ancestor  it should all have gone to the meltingpot for king charless service said the earl with a sigh but my ancestor of that day stood for the parliament  logans position at dinner was better for observation than for entertainment  he sat on the right hand of lady mary where the prince ought to have been seated but lady alice sat on her fathers left and next her of course the prince  love rules the camp the court the grove and love deranged the accustomed order for the prince sat between lady alice and logan  opposite logan and at lady marys left was the jesuit and next him scremerston beside whom was miss willoughby on the earls right  inevitably the conversation of the prince and lady alice was mainly directed to each otherso much so that logan did not once perceive the princely eyes attracted to miss willoughby opposite to him though it was not easy for another to look at anyone else  logan in the pauses of his rather conventional entertainment by lady mary did look and he was amazed no less by the beauty than by the spirits and gaiety of the young lady so recently left forlorn by the recreant jephson  this flower of the record office and of the british museum was obviously not destined to blush unseen any longer she manifestly dazzled scremerston who seemed to remember miss bangs her charms and her dollars no more than miss willoughby appeared to remember the treacherous don  scremerston was very unlike his father he was a small rather fair man with a slight moustache a closeclipped beard and little grey eyes with pink lids  his health was not good he had been invalided home from the imperial yeomanry after a slight wound and a dangerous attack of enteric fever and he had secured a pair for the rest of the session  he was not very clever but he certainly laughed sufficiently at what miss willoughby said who also managed to entertain the earl with great dexterity and aplomb  meanwhile logan and the jesuit amused the excellent lady mary as best they might which was not saying much  lady mary though extremely amiable was far from brilliant and never having met a jesuit before she regarded father riccoboni with a certain hereditary horror as an animal of a rare species and of habits perhaps startling and certainly perfidious  however the lady was philanthropic in a rural way and father riccoboni enlightened her as to the reasons why his enterprising countrymen leave their smiling land and open small iceshops in little english towns or less ambitious invest their slender capital in a monkey and a barrelorgan  i dont so very much mind barrelorgans myself said logan i dont know anything prettier than to see the little girls dancing to the music in a london side street  but do not the musicians all belong to that dreadful camorra asked the lady  not if they come from the north madam said the jesuit  and do not all your irish reapers belong to that dreadful land league or whatever it is called  they are all pap said lady mary who then stopped blushed and said with some presence of mind paupers i fear but they are quite safe and wellbehaved on this side of the irish channel  and so are our poor people said the jesuit  if they occasionally use the knife a littlenaturam expellas furca mr logan but the knife is a different thingit is only in a homely war among themselves that they handle it in the eastend of london  coelum non animum said logan determined not to be outdone in classical felicities and indeed he thought his own quotation the more appropriate  at this moment a great silverygrey persian cat which had sat hitherto in a stereotyped egyptian attitude on the arm of the earls chair leaped down and sprang affectionately on the shoulder of the jesuit  he shuddered strongly and obviously repressed an exclamation with difficulty as he gently removed the cat  fie meriamoun said the earl as the puss resumed her egyptian pose beside him  shall i send the animal out of the room  i know some people cannot endure a cat and he mentioned the gallant field marshal who is commonly supposed to share this infirmity  by no means my lord said the jesuit who looked strangely pale  cats have an extraordinary instinct for caressing people who happen to be born with exactly the opposite instinct  i am like the man in aristotle who was afraid of the cat  i wish we knew more about that man said miss willoughby who was stroking meriamoun  are you afraid of cats lord scremerstonbut you i suppose are afraid of nothing  i am terribly afraid of all manner of flying things that buzz and bite said scremerston  except bullets said miss willoughbybeauty rewarding valour with a smile and a glance so dazzling that the good little yeoman blushed with pleasure  it is a shame thought logan  i dont like it now i see it  as to horror of cats said the earl i suppose evolution can explain it  i wonder how they would work it out in science jottings  there is a great deal of electricity in a cat  evolution can explain everything said the jesuit demurely but who can explain evolution  as to electricity in the cat said logan i daresay there is as much in the dog only everybody has tried stroking a cat in the dark to see the sparks fly and who ever tried stroking a dog in the dark for experimental purposesdid you lady mary  lady mary never had tried but the idea was new to her and she would make the experiment in winter  deer skins stroked do sparkle said logan i read that in a book  i daresay horses do only nobody tries  i dont think electricity is the explanation of why some people cant bear cats  electricity is the modern explanation of everythinglove faith everything remarked the jesuit but as i said who shall explain electricity  lady mary recognising the orthodoxy of these sentiments felt more friendly towards father riccoboni  he might be a jesuit but he was bien pensant  what i am afraid of is not a cat but a mouse said miss willoughby and the two other ladies admitted that their own terrors were of the same kind  what i am afraid of said the prince is a banging door by day or night  i am not otherwise of a nervous constitution but if i hear a door bang i must go and hunt for it and stop the noise either by shutting the door or leaving it wide open  i am a sound sleeper but if a door bangs it wakens me at once  i try not to notice it  i hope it will leave off  then it does leave offthat is the artfulness of itand just as you are falling asleep knock it goes  a double knock sometimes  then i simply must get up and hunt for that door upstairs or downstairs  or in my interrupted miss willoughby and stopped thinking better of it and not finishing the quotation which passed unheard  that research has taken me into some odd places the prince ended and logan reminded the society of the bravest of the brave  what he was afraid of was a pair of tight boots  these innocent conversations ended and after dinner the company walked about or sat beneath the stars in the fragrant evening air the earl seated by miss willoughby scremerston smoking with logan while the white dress of lady alice flitted ghostlike on the lawn and the tip of the princes cigar burned red in the neighbourhood  in the drawingroom lady mary was tentatively conversing with the jesuit that mild but probably dangerous animal  she had the curiosity which pious maiden ladies feel about the member of a community which they only know through novels  certainly this jesuit was very unlike aramis  and who is he like  logan happened to be asking scremerston at that moment  i know the facei know the voice hang itwhere have i seen the man  now you mention it said scremerston i seem to remember him too but i cant place him  what do you think of a game of billiards father he asked rising and addressing lord embleton  rosamondmiss willoughby i mean  oh we are cousins lord embleton says and you may call me rosamond  i have never had any cousins before interrupted the young lady  rosamond said scremerston with a gulp is getting on wonderfully well for a beginner  then let us proceed with her education it is growing chilly too said the earl and they all went to billiards the jesuit marking with much attention and precision  later he took a cue and was easily the master of every man there though better acquainted he said with the foreign game  the late pope used to play he said nearly as well as mr herbert spencer  even for a beginner miss willoughby was not a brilliant player but she did not cut the cloth and her arms were remarkably beautifulan excellent but an extremely rare thing in woman  she was rewarded finally by a choice between bedroom candles lit and offered by her younger and her elder cousins and after a momentary hesitation accepted that of the earl  how is this going to end thought logan when he was alone  miss bangs is out of the running that is certain millions of dollars cannot bring her near miss willoughby with scremerston  the old gentleman ought to like thatit relieves him from the bacon and lard and the dollars and the associations with a straddle and then miss willoughbys family is all right but the girl is reckless  a demon has entered into her she used to be so quiet  id rather marry miss bangs without the dollars  then it is all very well for scremerston to yield to venus verticordia and transfer his heart to this new enchantress  but if i am not mistaken the earl himself is much more kind than kin  the heart has no age and he is a very wellpreserved peer  you might take him for little more than forty though he quite looked his years when i saw him first  well i am safe enough in spite of mertons warning this new helen has no eyes for me and the prince has no eyes for her i think but who is the jesuit  logan fought with his memory till he fell asleep but he recovered no gleam of recollection about the holy man  it did not seem to logan next day that he was in for a very lively holiday  his host carried off miss willoughby to the munimentroom after breakfast that was an advantage he had over scremerston who was decidedly restless and ill at ease  he took logan to see the keeper and they talked about fish and examined local flies and logan arranged to go and try the trout with the bustard some night and then they pottered about and ate cherries in the garden and finally the earl found them half asleep in the smokingroom  he routed the jesuit out of the library where he was absorbed in a folio containing the works of the sainted father parsons and then the earl showed logan and father riccoboni over the house  from a window of the gallery scremerston could be descried playing croquet with miss willoughby an apparition radiant in white  the house was chiefly remarkable for queer passages which beginning from the roof of the old tower above the fathers chamber radiated about emerging in unexpected places  the priests holes had offered to the persecuted clergy of old times the choice between being grilled erect behind a chimney or of lying flat in a chamber about the size of a coffin near the roof where the martyr jesuits lived on suction like the snipe absorbing soup from a long straw passed through a wall into a neighbouring garret  those were cruel times said father riccoboni who presently at luncheon showed that he could thoroughly appreciate the tender mercies of the present or christian era  logan watched him and once when something that interested him being said the father swept the table with his glance without raising his head a memory for a fraction of a moment seemed to float towards the surface of logans consciousness  even as when an angler having hooked a salmon a monster of the stream long the fish bores down impetuous seeking the sunken rocks disdainful of the steel and the dark wave conceals him then anon is beheld a gleam of silver and again is lost to view and the heart of the man rejoiceseven so fugitive a glimpse had logan of what he sought in the depths of memory  but it fled and still he was puzzled  logan loafed out after luncheon to a seat on the lawn in the shade of a tree  they were all to be driven over to an abbey not very far away for indeed in july there is little for a man to do in the country logan sat and mused  looking up he saw miss willoughby approaching twirling an open parasol on her shoulder  her face was radiant of old it had often looked as if it might be stormy as if there were thunder behind those dark eyebrows  logan rose but the lady sat down on the garden seat and he followed her example  this is better than bloomsbury mr logan and cocoa pour tout potage singed cocoa usually  the potage here is certainly all that heart can wish said logan  the chrysalis said miss willoughby in its wildest moments never dreamed of being a butterfly as the man said in the sermon and i feel like a butterfly that remembers being a chrysalis  look at me now  i could look for ever said logan like the sportsman in keatss grecian urn for ever let me look and thou be fair  i am so sorry for people in town said miss willoughby  dont you wish dear old milo was here  milo was the affectionate nicknamea tribute to her charmsborne by miss markham at st ursulas  how can i wish that anyone was here but you asked logan  but indeed as to her being here i should like to know in what capacity she was a guest  the clytemnestra glance came into miss willoughbys grey eyes for a moment but she was not to be put out of humour  to be here as a kinswoman and an historian with a maidfancy me with a maidand everything handsome about me is sufficiently excellent for me mr logan and if it were otherwise do you disapprove of the proceedings of your own society  but there is lord scremerston calling to us and a fourinhand waiting at the door  and i am to sit on the boxseat  oh this is better than the dingy old record office all day  with these words miss willoughby tripped over the sod as lightly as the fairy queen and logan slowly followed  no he did not approve of the proceedings of his society as exemplified by miss willoughby and he was nearly guilty of falling asleep during the drive to winderby abbey scremerston was not much more genial for his father was driving and conversing very gaily with his fair kinswoman  talk about a distant cousin thought logan who in fact felt illtreated  however deep in love a man may be he does not like to see a fair lady conspicuously much more interested in other members of his sex than in himself  the abbey was a beautiful ruin and father riccoboni did not conceal from lady mary the melancholy emotions with which it inspired him  when shall our prayers be heard he murmured  when shall england return to her mothers bosom  lady mary said nothing but privately trusted that the winds would disperse the orisons of which the father spoke  perhaps nuns had been bricked up in these innocentlooking mossy walls thought lady mary whose ideas on this matter were derived from a scene in the poem of marmion  and deep in lady marys heart was a halfformed wish that if there was to be any bricking up miss willoughby might be the interesting victim  unlike her brother the earl she was all for the bangs alliance  scremerston took the reins on the homeward way the earl being rather fatigued and after dinner two white robes flitted ghostlike on the lawn and the light which burned red beside one of them was the cigartip of scremerston  the earl had fallen asleep in the drawingroom and logan took a lonely stroll much regretting that he had come to a house where he felt decidedly out of it  he wandered down to the river and stood watching  he was beside the darkbrown water in the latest twilight beside a long pool with a boat moored on the near bank  he sat down in the boat pensively and thenwhat was that  it was the sound of a heavy trout rising  plop plop  they were feeding all round him  by jove  ill try the bustard tomorrow night and then ill go back to town next day thought logan  i am doing no good here and i dont like it  i shall tell merton that i have moral objections to the whole affair  miserable mercenary fraud  thus feeling very moral and discontented logan walked back to the house carefully avoiding the ghostly robes that still glimmered on the lawn and did not reenter the house till bedtime  the following day began as the last had done lord embleton and miss willoughby retiring to the munimentroom the lovers vanishing among the walks  scremerston later took logan to consult fenwick who visibly brightened at the idea of nightfishing  you must take one of those long landingnets logan said scremerston they are about as tall as yourself and as stout as lanceshafts  they are for steadying you when you wade and feeling the depth of the water in front of you  scremerston seemed very pensive  the day was hot they wandered to the smokingroom  scremerston took up a novel which he did not read logan began a letter to mertona gloomy epistle  i say logan suddenly said scremerston if your letter is not very important i wish you would listen to me for a moment  logan turned round  fire away he said my letter can wait  scremerston was in an attitude of deep dejection  logan lit a cigarette and waited  logan i am the most miserable beggar alive  what is the matter  you seem rather inandout in your moods said logan  why you know i am in a regular tight place  i dont know how to put it  you see i cant help thinking thatthati have rather committed myselfit seems a beastly conceited thing to saythat theres a girl who likes me im afraid  i dont want to be inquisitive but is she in this country asked logan  no shes at homburg  has it gone very far  have you said anything asked logan  no my father did not like it  i hoped to bring him round  have you written anything  do you correspond  no but im afraid i have looked a lot  as the viscount scremerstons eyes were by no means fitted to express with magnetic force the language of the affections logan had to command his smile  but why have you changed your mind if you liked her he asked  oh you know very well  can anybody see her and not love her said scremerston with a vagueness in his pronouns but referring to miss willoughby  logan was inclined to reply that he could furnish at first hand an exception to the rule but this appeared tactless  no one i daresay whose affections were not already engaged could see her without loving her but i thought yours had been engaged to a lady now at homburg  so did i said the wretched scremerston but i was mistaken  oh logan you dont know the difference  this is genuine biz remarked the afflicted nobleman with much simplicity  he went on then theres my fatheryou know him  he was against the other affair but if he thinks i have committed myself and then want to back out why with his ideas hed rather see me dead  but i cant go on with the other thing now i simply can not  ive a good mind to go out after rabbits and pot myself crawling through a hedge  oh nonsense said logan that is stale and superfluous  for all that i can see there is no harm done  the young lady depend upon it wont break her heart  as a matter of fact they dontwe do  you have only to sit tight  you are no more committed than i am  you would only make both of you wretched if you went and committed yourself now when you dont want to do it  in your position i would certainly sit tight dont commit yourselfeither here or there so to speak or if you cant sit tight make a bolt for it  go to norway  i am very strongly of opinion that the second plan is the best  but anyhow keep up your pecker  you are all righti give you my word that i think you are all right  thanks old cock said scremerston  sorry to have bored you but i had to speak to somebody         best thing you could do said logan  youll feel ever so much better that kind of worry comes of keeping things to oneself till molehills look mountains  if you like ill go with you to norway myself  thanks awfully said scremerston but he did not seem very keen  poor little scremerston  logan breasted the brae from the riverside to the house  his wading boots were heavy for he had twice got in over the tops thereof heavy was his basket that fenwick carried behind him but light was logans heart for the bustard had slain its dozens of good trout  he and the keeper emerged from the wood on the level of the lawn  all the great mass of the house lay dark before them  logan was to let himself in by the locked french window for it was very lateabout two in the morning he had the key of the windowdoor in his pocket  a light moved through the long gallery he saw it pass each window and vanish  there was dead silence not a leaf stirred  then there rang out a pistolshot or was it two pistolshots  logan ran for the window his rod which he had taken down after fishing in his hand  hurry to the back door fenwick he said and fenwick throwing down the creel but grasping the long landingnet flew to the back way  logan opened the drawingroom window took out his matchbox with trembling ringers lit a candle and with the candle in one hand the rod in the other sped through the hall and along a back passage leading to the gunroom  he had caught a glimpse of the earl running down the main staircase and had guessed that the trouble was on the ground floor  as he reached the end of the long dark passage fenwick leaped in by the back entrance of which the door was open  what logan saw was a writhing groupthe prince of scalastro struggling in the arms of three men a long white heap lay crumpled in a corner  fenwick at this moment threw the landingnet over the head of one of the princes assailants and with a twist held the man half choked and powerless  fenwick went on twisting and with the leverage of the long shaft of the net dragged the wretch off the prince and threw him down  another of the men turned on logan with a loud guttural oath and was raising a pistol  logan knew the voice at lastknew the jesuit now  rien ne va plus he cried and lunged with all the force and speed of an expert fencer at the fellows face with the point of the rod  the metal joints clicked and crashed through the mans mouth his pistol dropped and he staggered cursing through his blood against the wall  logan picked up the revolver as the prince whose hands were now free floored the third of his assailants with an upper cut  logan thrust the revolver into the princes hand  keep them quiet with that he said and ran to where the earl who had entered unseen in the struggle was kneeling above the long white crumpled heap  it was scremerston dead in his night dress poor plucky little scremerston         afterwards before the trial the prince told logan how matters had befallen  i was wakened he saidyou were very late you know and we had all gone to bedi was wakened by a banging door  if you remember i told you all on the night of your arrival at rookchester how i hated that sound  i tried not to think of it and was falling asleep when it banged againa double knock  i was nearly asleep when it clashed again  there was no wind my window was open and i looked out i only heard the river murmuring and the whistle of a passing train the stillness made the abominable recurrent noise more extraordinary  i dressed in a moment in my smokingclothes lit a candle and went out of my room listening  i walked along the gallery  it was your candle that i saw as i crossed the lawn said logan  when a door opened the prince went onthe door of one of the rooms on the landingand a figure all in whiteit was scremerstonemerged and disappeared down the stairs  i followed at the top of my speed  i heard a shot or rather two pistols that rang out together like one  i ran through the hall into the long back passage at rightangles to it down the passage to the glimmer of light through the partly glazed door at the end of it  then my candle was blown out and three men set on me they had nearly pinioned me when you and fenwick took them on both flanks  you know the rest  they had the boat unmoored a light cart ready on the other side and a steamyacht lying off warkworth  the object of course was to kidnap me and coerce or torture me into renewing the lease of the tables at scalastro  poor scremerston who was a few seconds ahead of me not carrying a candle had fired in the dark and missed  the answering fire which was simultaneous killed him  the shots saved me for they brought you and fenwick to the rescue  two of the fellows whom we damaged were  the genoese pipers of course said logan  and you guessed from the cry you gave who my confessor he banged the door of course to draw me turned out to be  yes the head croupier at scalastro years ago but he wore a beard and blue spectacles in the old time when he raked in a good deal of my patrimony said logan  but how was he planted on you  my old friend father costa had died and it is too long a tale of forgery and fraud to tell you how this wretch was forced on me  he had been a jesuit but was unfrocked and expelled from society for all sorts of namable and unnamable offences  his community believed that he was dead  so he fell to the profession in which you saw him and when the gambling company saw that i was disinclined to let that hell burn any longer on my rock ingenious treachery did the rest  by jove said logan        the prince of scalastro impoverished by his own generous impulse now holds high rank in the japanese service  his beautiful wife is much admired in yokohama  the earl was nursed through the long and dangerous illness which followed the shock of that dreadful july night by the unwearying assiduity of his kinswoman miss willoughby  on his recovery the bride for the earl won her heart and hand who stood by him at the altar looked fainter and more ghostly than the bridegroom  but her dark hour of levity was passed and over  there is no more affectionate pair than the earl and countess of embleton  lady mary who lives with them is once more an aunt and spoils it is to be feared the young viscount scremerston a fine but mischievous little boy  on the fate of the exjesuit we do not dwell enough to say that his punishment was decreed by the laws of our country not of that which he had disgraced  the manuscripts of the earl have been edited by him and the countess for the roxburghe club     viii  the adventure of the lady patroness   i cannot bring myself to refuse my assent  it would break the dear childs heart  she has never cared for anyone else and oh she is quite wrapped up in him  i have heard of your wonderful cures mr merton i mean successes in cases which everyone has given up and though it seems a very strange step to me i thought that i ought to shrink from no remedy  however unconventional said merton smiling  he felt rather as if he were being treated like a quack doctor to whom people if foolish enough appeal only as the last desperate resource  the lady who filled and amply filled the clients chair mrs malory of upwold in yorkshire was a widow obviously a widow indeed  in weed was an unworthy calembour which flashed through mertons mind since mrs malorys undying regret for her lord a most estimable man for a coal owner was explicitly declared or rather was blazoned abroad in her costume  mrs mallory in fact was what is derisively styled early victorianmiddle would have been historically more accurate  her religion was mildly evangelical she had been brought up on the memoirs of the fairchild family by mrs sherwood tempered by miss yonge and the waverley novels  on these principles she had trained her family  the result was that her sons had not yet brought the family library and the family romneys and hoppners to christies  not one of them was a director of any company and the name of malory had not yet been distinguished by decorating the annals of the courts of bankruptcy or of divorce  in short a family more deplorably not up to date and more out of the swim could scarcely be found in england  such and of such connections was the lady fair faded with mildly aquiline features and an aspect at once distinguished and dowdy who appealed to merton  she sought him in what she at least regarded as the interests of her eldest daughter an heiress under the will of a maternal uncle  merton had met the young lady who looked like a portrait of her mother in youth  he knew that miss malory now wrapped up in her betrothed lover would in a few years be equally absorbed in her boys  she was pretty blonde dull good and cast by providence for the part of one of the best of mothers and the despair of what man soever happened to sit next her at a dinner party  such women are the safeguards of societythough sneered at by the frivolous as british matrons  i have laid the case before thewhere i always take my troubles said mrs malory and i have not felt restrained from coming to consult you when i permitted my daughters engagement of course after carefully examining the young mans worldly position i was not aware of what i know now  matilda met him at a visit to some neighbourshe really is very attractive and very attentiveand it was not till we came to london for the season that i heard the stories about him  some of them have been pointed out to me in print in the dreadful french newspapers others came to me in anonymous letters  as far as a mother may i tried to warn matilda but there are subjects on which one can hardly speak to a girl  the vidame in fact said mrs malory blushing is celebratedi should say infamousboth in france and italy poland too as what they call un homme aux bonnes fortunes  he has caused the breakup of several families  mr merton he is a rake whispered the lady in some confusion  he is still young he may reform said merton and no doubt a pure affection will be the saving of him  so matilda believes but though a protestanthis ancestors having left france after the revocation of the edict of nancynantes i meani am certain that he is not under conviction  why does he call himself vidame the vidame de la lain asked merton  it is an affectation said mrs malory  none of his family used the title in england but he has been much on the continent and has lands in france and i suppose has romantic ideas  he is as much french as english more i am afraid  the wickedness of that country  and i fear it has affected ours  even nowi am not a scandalmonger and i hope for the bestbut even last winter he was talked about mrs malory dropped her voice with a lady whose husband is in america mrs brown smith  a lady for whom i have the very highest esteem said merton for indeed mrs brownsmith was one of his references or lady patronesses he knew her well and had a respect for her character au fond as well as an admiration for her charms  you console me indeed said mrs malory  i had heard  people talk a great deal of illnatured nonsense said merton warmly do you know mrs brownsmith  we have met but we are not in the same set we have exchanged visits but that is all  ah said merton thoughtfully  he remembered that when his enterprise was founded mrs brownsmith had kindly offered her practical services and that he had declined them for the moment  mrs malory he went on after thinking awhile may i take your case into my considerationthe marriage is not till october you say we are in juneand i may ask for a later interview  of course you shall be made fully aware of every detail and nothing shall be done without your approval  in fact all will depend on your own cooperation  i dont deny that there may be distasteful things but if you are quite sure about this gentlemans  character said mrs malory  i am so sure that it has cost me many a wakeful hour  you will earn my warmest gratitude if you can do anything  almost everything will depend on your own energy and tolerance of our measures  but we must not do evil that good may come said mrs malory nervously  no evil is contemplated said merton  but mrs malory while consenting so far did not seem quite certain that her estimate of evil and mertons would be identical  she had suffered poignantly as may be supposed before she set the training of a lifetime aside and consulted a professional expert  but the urbanity and patience of merton with the high and unblemished reputation of his association consoled her  we must yield where we innocently may she assured herself to the changes of the times  lest one good order and ah how good the early victorian order had been should corrupt the world  mrs malory knew that line of poetry  then she remembered that mrs brownsmith was on the list of mertons references and that reassured her more or less  as for merton he evolved a plan in his mind and consulted bradshaws invaluable railway guide  on the following night merton was fortunate or adroit enough to find himself seated beside mrs brownsmith in a conservatory at a party given by the montenegrin ambassador  other occupants of the fairylike bower of blossoms musical with all the singing of the innumerable fountains could not but know however preoccupied that mrs brownsmith was being amused  her laughter rang merry and loud as the poet says though not a word of her whispered conversation was audible  conservatories in novels are dangerous places for confidences but the pale and angry face of miss malory did not suddenly emerge from behind a grove of gardenias and startle the conspirators  indeed miss malory was not present she and her sister had no great share in the elegant frivolities of the metropolis  it all fits in beautifully said mrs brownsmith  just let me look at the page of bradshaw again  merton handed to her a page of closely printed matter  917 pm 950 pm read mrs brownsmith aloud it gives plenty of time in case of delays  oh this is too delicious  you are sure that these trains wont be altered  it might be awkward  i consulted anson said merton  anson was famous for his mastery of timetables and his prescience as to railway arrangements  of course it depends on the widow said mrs brownsmith i shall see that johnnie is up to time  he hopes to undersell the opposition soap mr brownsmith was absent in america in the interests of that soap of his which is familiar to all and he is in the best of humours  then their grouse  we have disease on our moors in perthshire i was in despair  but the widow needs delicate handling  you wont forgeti know how busy you areher cards for your party  they shall be posted before i sleep the sleep of conscious innocence  and real benevolence said merton  and revenge added mrs brownsmith  i have heard of his bragging the monster  he has talked about me  and i remember how he treated violet lebas  at this moment the vidame de la lain a tall fair young man vastly too elegant appeared and claimed mrs brownsmith for a dance  with a look at merton and a sound which from less perfect lips might have been described as a suppressed giggle mrs brownsmith rose then turning post the page to me mr merton she said  merton bowed and folding up the page of the timetable he consigned it to his cigarette case         mrs malory received with a blending of emotions the invitation to the party of mrs brownsmith  the social popularity and the wealth of the hostess made such invitations acceptable  but the wealth arose from trade in soap not in coal and coal like the colza bean is a product of the soil the result of creative forces which in the geological past have worked together for the good of landed families  soap on the other hand is the result of human artifice and is certainly advertised with more of emphasis and of ingenuity than of delicacy  but by her own line of descent mrs brownsmith came from a scottish house of ancient standing historically renowned for its assassins traitors and time servers  this partly washed out the stain of soap  again mrs malory had heard the name of mrs brownsmith taken in vain and that in a matter nearly affecting her matildas happiness  on the other side merton had given the lady a valuable testimonial to character  moreover the vidame would be at her party and mrs malory told herself that she could study the ground  above all the girls were so anxious to go they seldom had such a chance  therefore while the early victorian moralist hesitated the mother accepted  they were all glad that they went  susan the younger miss malory enjoyed herself extremely  matilda danced with the vidame as often as her mother approved  the conduct of mrs brownsmith was correctness itself  she endeared herself to the girls invited them to her place in perthshire and warmly congratulated mrs malory on the event approaching in her family  the eye of maternal suspicion could detect nothing amiss thanks mainly to mrs brownsmith the girls found the season an earthly paradise and mrs malory saw much more of the world than she had ever done before  but she remained vigilant and on the alert  before the end of july she had even conceived the idea of inviting mrs brownsmith fatigued by her toils to inhale the bracing air of upwold in the moors but she first consulted merton who expressed his warm approval  it is dangerous though she has been so kind sighed mrs malory  i have observed nothing to justify the talk which i have heard but i am in doubt  dangerous it is safety said merton  how  merton braced himself for the most delicate and perilous part of his enterprise  the vidame de la lain will be staying with you  naturally said mrs malory  and if there is any truth in what was whispered  he will be subject to temptation said merton  mrs brownsmith is so pretty and so amusing and dear matilda she takes after my dear husbands family though the best of girls matilda has not that flashing manner  but surely no such thing as temptation should exist for a man so fortunate as de la lain  and if it did would his conduct not confirm what you have heard and open the eyes of miss malory  it seems so odd to be discussing such things withso young a man as younot even a relation sighed mrs malory  i can withdraw at once said merton  oh no please dont speak of that  i am not really at all happy yet about my daughters future  well suppose the worst by way of argument suppose that you saw that miss malory saw  matilda has always refused to see or to listen and has spoken of the reforming effects of a pure affection  she would be hard indeed to convince that anything was wrong but once certaini know matildas charactershe would never forgive the insult never  and you would rather that she suffered some present distress  than that she was tied for life to a man who could cause it  certainly i would  then mrs malory as it is awkward to discuss these intimate matters with me might i suggest that you should have an interview with mrs brownsmith herself  i assure you that you can trust her and i happen to know that her view of the man about whom we are talking is exactly your own  more i could say as to her reasons and motives but we entirely decline to touch on the past or to offer any opinion about the characters of our patientsthe persons about whose engagements we are consulted  he might have murdered his grandmother or robbed a church but my lips would be sealed  do you not think that mrs brownsmith would be very much surprised if i consulted her  i know that she takes a sincere interest in miss malory and that her advice would be excellentthough perhaps rather startling said merton  i dislike it very much  the world has altered terribly since i was matildas age said mrs malory but i should never forgive myself if i neglected any precaution and i shall take your advice  i shall consult mrs brownsmith  merton thus retreated from what even he regarded as a difficult and delicate affair  he fell back on his reserves and mrs brownsmith later gave an account of what passed between herself and the representative of an earlier age  she first when she had invited me to her dreary place explained that we ought not she feared to lead others into temptation  if you think that man de la lains temptation is to drag my fathers name and my husbands in the dust i answered let me tell you that i have a temptation also  dear mrs brownsmith she answered this is indeed honourable candour  not for the world would i be the occasion  i interrupted her my temptation is to make him the laughing stock of his acquaintance and if he has the impudence to give me the opportunity i will  and then i told her without names of course that story about this vidame potter and violet lebas  i did not said merton  but why vidame potter  his father was a mr potter his grandfather married a miss lalaini know all about itand this creature has wormed out or invented some story of a vidameship or whatever it is hereditary in the female line and has taken the title  and this is the man who has had the impertinence to talk about me a ker of graden  but did not the story you speak of make her see that she must break off her daughters engagement  no  she was very much distressed but said that her daughter matilda would never believe it  and so you are to go to upwold  yes it is a mournful place i never did anything so goodnatured  and with the widows knowledge i am to do as i please till the girls eyes are opened  i think it will need that stratagem we spoke of to open them  you are sure that you will be in no danger from evil tongues  they say what say they  let them say answered mrs brownsmith quoting the motto of the keiths  the end of july found mrs brownsmith at upwold where it is to be hoped that the bracing qualities of the atmosphere made up for the want of congenial society  susan malory had been discreetly sent away on a visit  none of the men of the family had arrived  there was a party of local neighbours who did not feel the want of anything to do but lived in dread of flushing the vidame and matilda out of a window seat whenever they entered a room  as for the vidame being destitute of all other entertainment he made love in a devoted manner  but at dinner after mrs brownsmiths arrival though he sat next matilda mrs malory saw that his eyes were mainly bent on the lady opposite  the pingpong of conversation even was played between him and mrs brownsmith across the table the county neighbours were quite lost in their endeavours to follow the flight of the ball  though the drawingroom window after dinner was open on the fragrant lawn though matilda sat close by it in her wonted place the vidame was hanging over the chair of the visitor and later played billiards with her a game at which matilda did not excel  at family prayers next morning the service was conducted by mrs malory the vidame appeared with a white rosebud in his buttonhole mrs brownsmith wearing its twin sister  he took her to the stream in the park where she fished matilda following in a drooping manner  the vidame was much occupied in extracting the flies from the hair of mrs brownsmith in which they were frequently entangled  after luncheon he drove with the two ladies and mrs malory to the country town the usual resource of ladies in the country and though he sat next matilda mrs brownsmith was beaming opposite and the pair did most of the talking  while mrs malory and her daughter shopped it was the vidame who took mrs brownsmith to inspect the ruins of the abbey  the county neighbours had left in the morning a new set arrived and while matilda had to entertain them it was mrs brownsmith whom the vidame entertained  this kind of thing went on when matilda was visiting her cottagers it was the vidame and mrs brownsmith whom visitors flushed in window seats  they wondered that mrs malory had asked so dangerous a woman to the house they marvelled that she seemed quite radiant and devoted to her lively visitor  there was a school feast it was the vidame who arranged hurdleraces for children of both sexes so improper and who started the competitors  meanwhile mrs malory so unusually genial in public held frequent conventicles with matilda in private  but matilda declined to be jealous they were only old friends she said these flagitious two dear anne that was the vidames christian name was all that she could wish  you know the place is so dull mother the brave girl said  even grandmamma who was a saint says so in her domestic outpourings religious memoirs privately printed in 1838  we cannot amuse mrs brownsmith and it is so kind and chivalrous of anne  to neglect you  no to do duty for tom and dick who were her brothers and who would not greatly have entertained the fair visitor had they been present  matilda was the kind of woman whom we all adore as represented in the characters of fieldings amelia and sophia  such she was so gracious and yielding in her overt demeanour but alas poor matildas pillow was often wet with her tears  she was loyal she would not believe evil she crushed her natural jealousy as a vice of blood upon the threshold of the mind  mrs brownsmith was nearly as unhappy as the girl  the more she hated the vidameand she detested him more deeply every daythe more her heart bled for matilda  mrs brownsmith also had her secret conferences with mrs malory  nothing will shake her belief in that man said mrs malory  your daughter is the best girl i ever met said mrs brownsmith  the best tempered the least suspicious the most loyal  and i am doing my worst to make her hate me  oh i cant go on  here mrs brownsmith very greatly surprised her hostess by bursting into tears  you must not desert us now said the elder lady  the better you think of poor matildaand she is a good girlthe more you ought to help her  it was the 8th of august no other visitors were at the house a shooting party was expected to arrive on the 11th  mrs brownsmith dried her tears  it must be done she said though it makes me sick to think of it  next day she met the vidame in the park and afterwards held a long conversation with mrs malory  as for the vidame he was in feverish high spirits he devoted himself to matilda in fact mrs brownsmith had insisted on such dissimulation as absolutely necessary at this juncture of affairs  so matilda bloomed again like a rose that had been washed just washed in a shower  the vidame went about humming the airs of the country which he had honoured by adopting it as the cradle of his ancestry  on the morning of the following day while the vidame strayed with matilda in the park mrs brownsmith was closeted with mrs malory in her boudoir  everything is arranged said mrs brownsmith  i guilty and reckless that i am have only to sacrifice my character and all my things  but i am to retain methven my maid  that concession i have won from his chivalry  how do you mean asked mrs malory  at seven he will get a telegram summoning him to paris on urgent business  he will leave in your station brougham in time to catch the 950 up train at wilkington  or rather so impatient is he he will leave half an hour too early for fear of accidental delays  i and my maid will accompany him  i have thought honesty the best policy and told the truth like bismarck and the same said mrs brownsmith hysterically with intent to deceive  i have pointed out to him that my best plan is to pretend to you that i am going to meet my husband who really arrives at wilkington from liverpool by the 917 though the vidame thinks that is an invention of mine  so you see i leave without any secrecy or fuss or luggage and when my husband comes here he will find me flown and will have to console himself with my luggage and jewels  hethis frenchified beast i meanhas written a note for your daughter which he will give to her maid and of course the maid will hand it to you  so he will have burned his boats  and then you can show it to matilda and so said mrs brownsmith the miracle of opening her eyes will be worked  johnnie my husband and i will be hungry when we return about halfpast ten  and i think you had better telegraph that there is whooping cough or bubonic plague or something in the house and put off your shooting party  but that would be an untruth said mrs malory  and what have i been acting for the last ten days asked mrs brown smith rather tartly  you must settle your excuse with your conscience  the cooks mother really is ill said mrs malory and she wants dreadfully to go and see her  that would do  all things work together for good  the cook must have a telegram also said mrs brownsmith  the day which had been extremely hot clouded over  by five it was raining by six there was a deluge  at seven matilda and the vidame were evicted from their dusky window seat by the butler with a damp telegraph envelope  the vidame opened it and handed it to matilda  his presence at paris was instantly demanded  the vidame was desolated but his absence could not be for more than five days  bradshaw was hunted for and found the 950 train was opportune  the vidames man packed his clothes  mrs brownsmith was apprised of these occurrences in the drawingroom before dinner  i am very sorry for dear matilda she cried  but it is an ill wind that blows nobody good  i will drive over with the vidame and astonish my johnnie by greeting him at the station  i must run and change my dress  she ran she returned in morning costume she heard from mrs malory of the summons by telegram calling the cook to her moribund mother  i must send her over to the station in a dogcart said mrs malory  oh no cried mrs brownsmith with impetuous kindness not on a night like this it is a cataclysm  there will be plenty of room for the cook as well as for methven and me and the vidame in the brougham  or he can sit on the box  the vidame really behaved very well  the introduction of the cook to quote an old novelist had formed no part of his profligate scheme of pleasure  to elope from a hospitable roof with a married lady accompanied by her maid might be an act not without precedent  but that a cook should come to form une partie carree on such an occasion that a lover should be squeezed with three women in a brougham was a trying novelty  the vidame smiled an artist so excellent he said deserves a far greater sacrifice  so it was arranged  after a tender and solitary five minutes with matilda the vidame stepped last into the brougham  the coachman whipped up the horses matilda waved her kerchief from the porch the guilty lovers drove away  presently mrs malory received from her daughters maid the letter destined by the vidame for matilda  mrs malory locked it up in her despatch box  the runaways after a warm and uncomfortable drive of threequarters of an hour during which the cook wept bitterly and was very unwell reached the station  contrary to the vidames wish mrs brownsmith in an ulster and a veil insisted on perambulating the platform buying the whole of mr hall caines works as far as they exist in sixpenny editions  bells rang porters stationed themselves in a line like fielders a train arrived the 917 from liverpool twenty minutes late a short stout gentleman emerged from a smoking carriage mrs brownsmith starting from the vidames side raised her veil and threw her arms round the neck of the traveller  you didnt expect me to meet you on such a night did you johnnie she cried with a break in her voice  awfully glad to see you tiny said the short gentleman  on such a night  after thus unconsciously quoting the merchant of venice mr brownsmith turned to his valet  dont forget the fishingrods he said  i took the opportunity of driving over with a gentleman from upwold said mrs brownsmith  let me introduce him  methven to her maid where is the vidame de la lain  i heard him say that he must help mrs andrews the cook to find a seat maam said the maid  he really is kind said mrs brownsmith but i fear we cant wait to say goodbye to him  threequarters of an hour later mr brownsmith and his wife were at supper at upwold  next day as the cooks departure had postponed the shooting party they took leave of their hostess and returned to their moors in perthshire  weeks passed with no message from the vidame  he did not answer a letter which mrs malory allowed matilda to write  the mother never showed to the girl the note which he had left with her maid  the absence and the silence of the lover were enough  matilda never knew that among the four packed in the brougham on that night of rain one had been eloping with a married ladywho returned to supper  the papers were requested to state that the marriage announced between the vidame de la lain and miss malory will not take place  why it did not take place was known only to mrs malory mrs brownsmith and merton  matilda thought that her lover had been kidnapped and arrested by the secret police of france for his part in a scheme to restore the royal house the white flag the lilies the children of st louis  at mrs brownsmiths place in perthshire in the following autumn matilda met sir aylmer jardine  then she knew that what she had taken for love in the previous year had been     not love but loves first flush in youth  they always do make that discovery bless them  lady jardine is now wrapped up in her baby boy  the mother of the cook recovered her health     ix  adventure of the lady novelist and the vaccinationist   mr frederick warrenso merton read the card presented to him on a salver of limoges enamel by the officeboy  show the gentleman in  mr warren entered  he was a tall and portly person with a red face red whiskers and a tightly buttoned frockcoat which more expressed than hid his goodly and prominent proportions  he bowed and merton invited him to be seated  it struck merton as a singular circumstance that his visitor wore on each arm the crimson badge of the newly vaccinated  mr warren sat down and taking a red silk handkerchief out of the crown of his hat he wiped his countenance  the day was torrid and mr merton hospitably offered an effervescent draught  without the whisky if you please sir said mr warren in a provincial accent  he pointed to a blue ribbon in the buttonhole of his coat indicating that he was conscientiously opposed to the use of alcoholic refreshment in all its forms  two glasses of apollinaris water said merton to the officeboy and the innocent fluid was brought while merton silently admired his clients arrangement in blue and crimson  when the thirst of that gentleman had been assuaged he entered upon business thus  sir i am a man of principle  merton congratulated him the age was lax he said and principle was needed  he wondered internally what he was going to be asked to subscribe to or whether his vote only was required  sir have you been vaccinated asked the client earnestly  really said merton i do not quite understand your interest in a matter so purely personal  personal sir  not at all  it is the first of public dutiesthe debt that every man woman and child owes to his or her country  have you been vaccinated sir  why if you insist on knowing said merton i have though i do not see  recently asked the visitor  yes last month but i cannot conjecture why  enough sir said mr warren  i am a man of principle  had you not done your duty in this matter by your country i should have been compelled to seek some other practitioner in your line  i was not aware that my firm had any competitors in our line of business said merton  but perhaps you have come here under some misapprehension  there is a firm of family solicitors on the floor above and next them are the offices of a company interested in a patent explosive  if your affairs or your political ideas demand a legal opinion or an outlet in an explosive which is widely recommended by the continental press  for what do you take me sir asked mr warren  for a temperance anarchist merton would have liked to reply judging by your colours but he repressed this retort and mildly answered perhaps it would be as much to the purpose to ask for what do you take me  for the representative of messrs gray  graham the specialists in matrimonial affairs answered the client and merton said that he would be happy if mr warren would enter into the details of his business  i am the exmayor of bulcester said mr warren and as i told you a man of principle  my attachment to the temperance causeand he fingered his blue ribbonprocured for me the honour of a defeat at the last general election but endeared me to the consciences of the nonconformist element in the constituency  yet sir i am at this moment the most unpopular man in bulcester but i shall fight it outi shall fight it to my latest breath  is bulcester then such an intemperate constituency  i had understood that the nonconformist interest was strong there said merton  so it is sir so it is but the interest is now bound to the chariot wheels of the truckling toryism of our timeto the sycophants who basely made vaccination permissive and paltered with the conscientious objector  these badges sirthe client pointed to his own crimson decorationsproclaim that i have been vaccinated on both arms as a testimony to the immortal though in bulcester maligned discovery of the great jenner  sir i am hooted in the public streets of my native town where antivaccinationism is a frenzy  mr rider haggard the author of dr therne has been burned in effigy for his thrilling and manly protest to which i owe my own conversion  then the conversion is relatively recent asked merton  it dates since my reading of that powerful argument sir that appeal to reason which overcame my prejudice for i was a prominent a v  ave asked merton  a v sirantivaccinationist  a c d a too and always he added proudly but merton did not think it prudent to ask for further explanations  an a v  i was an a v  i am no longer and i defy popular clamour accompanied by brickbats to shake my principles  justum et tinacem propositi virum murmured merton adding all that is very interesting but my dear sir while i admire the tenacity of your principles will you permit me to ask what has vaccination to do with the special business of our firm  why sir i have a family and my eldest son  does he decline to be vaccinated asked merton in a sympathetic voice  no sir or he would never darken my doorway exclaimed this more than roman father  but he is engaged and i can never give my consent and if he marries that girl the firm ceases to be warren  son waxcloth manufacturers  thats all sirthats all  mr warren again applied his red handkerchief to his glowing features  and what may i ask are the grounds of your objection to this engagement  social inequality asked merton  no the young lady is the daughter of one of our leading ministers mr trumanauthor of the bishops to the blockbut principles are concerned  you cannot mean that the young lady is excessively addicted to thewine cup asked merton gravely  in melancholy cases of that kind mr hall caine in a romance has recommended hypnotic treatment but we do not venture to interfere  you misunderstand me sir replied mr warren frowning  the young woman on principle as they call it has never been vaccinated  like most of our prominent citizens her father otherwise an excellent man objects to what he calls the worship of the calf on grounds of conscience  conscience  it is a hard thing to constrain the conscience murmured merton quoting a remark of queen mary to john knox  what is conscience without knowledge sir asked the client usingwithout knowing itthe very argument of mr knox to the queen  you have no other objections to the alliance asked merton  none whatever sir  she is a good and goodlooking girl  on most important points we are thoroughly agreed  she won a prize essay on bacons authorship of shakespeares plays  of course shakespeare could not have written thema thoroughly uneducated man who never could have passed the fourth standard  but look at the plays  there are things in them that with all our modern advantages are beyond me  i admit they are beyond me  to be and to do and to suffer declaimed mr warren apparently under the impression that this is part of hamlets soliloquyshakespeare could never have written that  where did he learn grammar  where indeed replied merton  but as the lady is in all other respects so suitable a match cannot this one difficulty be got over  impossible sir my son could not slice the sleeve in her dress and inflict this priceless boon on her with affectionate violence  even the hero of dr therne failed there  and rather irritated his pretty jane added merton who remembered this heroic adventure  it is a very hard case he went on but i fear that our methods are powerless  the only chance would be to divert young mr warrens affections into some other more enlightened channel  that expedient has often been found efficacious  is he very deeply enamoured would not the society of another pretty and intelligent girl perhaps work wonders  perhaps it might sir but i dont know where to find any one that would attract my james  except for political meetings and a literary lecture or two with a magiclantern and a piano we have not much social relaxation at bulcester  we object to promiscuous dancing on grounds of conscience  also of course to the stage  ah so you do allow for the claims of conscience do you  for what do you take me sir  only of course the conscience must be enlightened said mr warren as other earnest people usually do  certainly certainly said merton nothing so dangerous as the unenlightened conscience  why in this very matter of marriage the conscience of the mormons leads them to singular aberrations while that of the arunta tribebut i should only pain you if i pursued the subject you said that your society indulged in literary lectures is your programme for the season filled up  i am president of the bulcester literary society said mr warren and i ought to know  we have a vacancy for friday week but why do you inquire  in fact i want a lecturer on the use and abuse of novels now you ask  our people somehow always want their literary lectures to be about novels  i try to make the lecturers take a lofty moral tone and usually entertain them at my house where i probe their ideas and warn them that we must have nothing loose  once sir we had a lecturer on the oldest novel in the world  he gave us a terrible shock sir  i never saw so many red cheeks in a bulcester audience  and the man seemed quite unaware of the effect he was producing  shortsighted perhaps said merton  ever since we have been very careful  but sir we seem to have got away from the subject  it is only seeming said merton  i have an idea which may be of service to you  thank you most kindly said mr warren  but as how  does your society ever employ lady lecturers  we prefer them we are all for enlarging the sphere of womans activityvirtuous activity i mean  that is fortunate remarked merton  you said just now that to try the plan of a counterattraction was difficult because there was little of social relaxation in your society and you knew no lady who had the opportunities necessary for presenting an agreeable alternative to the charms of miss truman  a young mans fancy is often caught merely by the juxtaposition of a single member of the opposite sex with whom he contracts a custom of walking home from chapel  thats mostly the way at bulcester said mr warren  well merton went on you are in the habit of entertaining the lecturers at your house  now i know a young ladyone of our staff in factwho is very well qualified to lecture on the use and abuse of novels  she is a novelist herself one of the most serious and improving of our younger writers  in her works virtue after struggles is always rewarded and vice especially if gilded is held up to execration though never allowed to display itself in colours which would bring a blush to the cheek ofa white rabbit  here is her portrait said merton taking up a family periodical the young girl  this blameless journal was publishing a serial story by miss martin one of the ladies who had been enlisted at the dinner given by logan and merton when they founded their society  a photograph of miss martin in white and in a large shadowy hat was published in the young girl and certainly no one could have recognised in this conscientiously innocent and domestic portrait the fair author of romances of social adventure and unimagined crime  there you see our young friend said merton and the magazine to which she is a regular contributor is a voucher for her character as an author  mr warren closely scrutinised the portrait which displayed loveliness and candour in a very agreeable way and arranged in the extreme of modest simplicity  that is a young woman who bears her testimonials in her face said mr warren  she is one whom a father can trustbut has she been vaccinated  early and often answered merton reassuringly  girls with faces like hers do not care to run any risks  jane truman does though my son has put it to her i know on the ground of her looks  nothing she said will ever induce me to submit to that filthy that revolting operation  conscience doth make cowards of us all as bacon says replied merton or at least of such of us as are unenlightened  but to come to business  what do you think of asking our young friend down to lectureon friday week i think you saidon the use and abuse of novels  you could easily persuade her i dare say to stay over sundaylonger if necessaryand then young mr warren would at least find out that there is more than one young woman in the world  i shall be delighted to see your friend answered mr warren  at bulcester we welcome intellect and a real novelist of moral tendencies would make quite a sensation in our midst  they are but too scarce at present merton answerednovelists of high moral tone  she is not a christian scientist asked mr warren anxiously  they reject vaccination like all other means appointed and rely on miracles which ceased with the apostolic age being no longer necessary  the lady i can assure you is not a christian scientist said merton but comes of an evangelical family  shall i give you her address  in my opinion it would be best to write to her from bulcester on the official paper of the literary society  for merton wished to acquaint miss martin with the nature of her mission lecturing being an art which she had never cultivated  there is just one thing remarked mr warren hesitatingly  this young lady if our james lets his affections loose on herhow would that be sir  merton smiled  why no great harm would be done mr warren  you need not fear any complication any new matrimonial difficulty  the affection would be all on one side and that side would not be the lady lecturers  i happen to know that she has a prior attachment  vaccinated cried mr warren letting a laugh out of him  exactly said merton  mr warren now gladly concurred in the plan of his adviser after which the interview was concerned with financial details  merton usually left these vague but in mr warren he saw a client who would feel more confidence if everything was put on a strictly business footing  the client retired in a hopeful frame of mind and merton went to look for miss martin at her club where she was usually to be found at the hour of tea  he was fortunate enough to find her dressed by no means after the style of her portrait in the young girl but still very well dressed  she offered him the refreshment of tea and toastvery good toast merton thoughtand he asked how her craft as a novelist was prospering  friends of miss martin were obliged to ask for they did not read the young girl or the other and less domestic serials in which her works appeared  i am doing very well thank you said miss martin  my tale the curates family has raised the circulation of the young girl and mind you it is no easy thing for a novelist to raise the circulation of any periodical  for example if the quarterly review published a new romance even by mr thomas hardy i doubt if the end would justify the proceedings  it would take about four years to get finished in a quarterly said merton  and the nonagenarians who read quarterlies said miss martin with the flippancy of youth would go to their graves without knowing whether the heroine found a lenient jury or not  i have six heroines in the curates family and i own their love affairs tend to get a little mixed  i have rigged up a small stage with puppets in costume to represent the characters and keep them straight in my mind but ethelinda who is engaged to the photographer as nearly as possible eloped with the baronet last week  anything else on asked merton  an uptodate story all heredity and evolution said miss martin  the father has his legs bitten off by a shark and it gets on the nerves of his wife the marchioness and two of the girls are born like mermaids they have immense popularity at bathingplaces on the french coast but it is not easy for them to go into general society  what nonsense exclaimed merton  not worse than other stuff that is highly recommended by eminent reviewers said miss martin  anything else  oh yes there is the popes poisoner a tale of the borgias  that is a historical romance i got it up out of histories of the renaissance the hero lionardo da vinci is the popes bravo and in love with lucrezia borgia  are the dates all right asked merton  oh bother the dates  of course he is a bravo pour le bon motif and frustrates the pontifical designs  i want you said merton you have such a fertile imagination to take part in a little plot of our own  beneficent of course but i admit that my fancy is baffled  could we find a room less crowded  this is rather private business  there is never anybody in the smokingroom at the top of the house said miss martin becauseto let out a secretnone of us ever smoke except at public dinners to give tone  but you may  she led merton to a sepulchral little chamber upstairs and he told her all the story of mr warren his son and the daughter of the minister  why dont they elope asked miss martin  the nonconformist conscience is unfriendly to elopements and the young man has no accomplishment by which he could support his bride except the art of making oilcloth  well what do you want me to do  merton unfolded the scheme of the lady lecturer and prepared miss martin to receive an invitation from mr warren  can you write a lecture on the use and abuse of novels before friday week he asked  say seven thousand words  i could do it by tomorrow morning said miss martin  you know you must be very careful  style of answers to correspondents in the young girl said miss martin  i know my way about  then you really will essay the adventure  like a bird answered the lady  it will be great fun  i shall pick up copy about the habits of the middle classes in the midlands  they wont recognise you as the author of your more criminal romances  how can they  i sign them passion flower and nightshade and la tofana and so on  you will dress as in your photograph in the young girl  i will and take a fichu to wear in the evening  they always wear fichus in evening dress  but look here do you want a happy ending to this romance  how can it be happy if you are to be successful  miss jane truman will be miserable and mr james warren will die of remorse and a broken heart when you  fail to crown his flame and jane has too much pride to welcome back the wanderer  im afraid that or something like that will be the end of it said merton and perhaps on reflection we had better drop the affair  but suppose i could manage a happy ending  suppose i reconcile mr warren to the union  i am all for happy endings myself  i drink to king charles ii who declared that while he was king all tragedies should end happily  you dont mean that you can persuade jane to be vaccinated  one never knows till one tries  youll find that i shall make a happy conclusion to my borgia novel and that is not so easy  you see lionardo goes to the popes jeweller and exchanges the  miss martin paused and remained absorbed in thought  suddenly she danced round the room with much grace and abandon while merton smoking in an armchair that had lost a castor gently applauded the performance  you have your idea he asked  i have it  happy ending  hurrah  miss martin spun round like a dancing dervish and finally fell into another armchair overcome by the heat and the intoxication of genius  we owe a candle to saint alexander borgia she said when she recovered her breath  miss martin said merton gravely this is a serious matter  you are not going i trust to poison the lemons for the elder mr warrens lemon squash  he is strictly temperance you know  poison the lemons  with a hypodermic syringe asked miss martin  no that is good business  i have made one of my villains do that but that is not my idea  perfectly harmless my idea  but sensational i fear asked merton  some very cultured critics might think so the lady admitted  but i am sure to succeed and i hear the merry merry wedding bells of the bulcester tabernacle ringing a peal for the happy pair  well what is the plan  that is my secret  but i must know  i am responsible  tell me or i telegraph to mr warren lecturer never vaccinated sorry for my mistake  that would not be true said miss martin  a noble falsehood said merton  but i assure you that if my plan fails no harm can possibly be caused or suspected  and if it succeeds then the thing is done either mr warren is reconciled to the marriage orthe marriage is broken off as he desires  by whom  by the conscientious objectrix if that is the feminine of objectorby miss jane truman  why should jane break it off if the old gentleman agrees  because jane would be a silly girl  mr merton i will promise you one thing  the plan shall not be tried without the approval of the lover himself  none but he shall be concerned in the affair  you wont hypnotise the girl and let him vaccinate her when she is in the hypnotic sleep  no nor even will i give her a posthypnotic suggestion to vaccinate herself or go to the doctors and have it done when she is awake though said miss martin that is not bad business either  i must make a note of that  but i cant hypnotise anybody  i tried lots of girls when i was at st ursulas and nothing ever came of it  thank you for the idea all the same  by the way i first must sterilise the pontifical  she paused  the what  that is my secret  dont you see how safe it is  none but the lover shall have his and her fate in his hands  cest a prendre ou a laisser  merton was young and adventurous  you give me your word that your idea is absolutely safe and harmless  it involves no crime  none and if you like said miss martin i will bring you the highest professional opinion and she mentioned an eminent name in the craft of healing  he was our doctor when we were children said the lady and we have always been friends  well merton said what is good enough for sir josiah wilkinson is good enough for me  but you will bring me the document  the day after tomorrow said miss martin and with that assurance merton had to be content  sir josiah was almost equally famous in the world as a physician and in a smaller but equally refined circle as a virtuoso and collector of objects of art  his opinions about the beneficent effects of vaccination were known to be at the opposite pole from those of the intelligent population of bulcester  on the next day but one miss martin again entertained merton at her club and demurely presented him with three documents  these were mr warrens invitation her reply in acceptance and a formal signed statement by sir josiah that her scheme was perfectly harmless and commanded his admiring approval  now said miss martin  i own that i dont like it said merton  logan thinks that it is all right but logan is a born conspirator  however as you are set on it and as sir josiahs opinion carries great weight you may go  but be very careful  have you written your lecture  here is the scenario said miss martin handing a typewritten synopsis to merton     use and abuse of novels     all good things capable of being abused  alcohol not one of these    alcohol always pernicious  fiction on the other hand a good    thing  antiquity of fiction  in early days couched in verse    civilisation prefers prose  fiction from the earlier ages intended    to convey moral instruction  opinion of aristotle defended against    that of plato  morality in mediaeval romance  criticism of mr    frederic harrison  opinion of moliere  yet french novels usually    immoral and why  remarks on popery  to be avoided  morality of    richardson and of sir walter scott  impropriety reintroduced by    charlotte bronte  unwillingness of lecturer to dwell on this topic    the novel is now the whole of literature  the people have no time to    read anything else  responsibilities of the novelist as a teacher    the novel the proper vehicle of theological scientific social and    political instruction  mr hall caine miss corelli  fallacy of    thinking that the novel should amuse  abuse of the novel as a source    of mischievous and false opinions  case of the woman who did    sacredness of marriage  study of the novel becomes an abuse if it    leads to the neglect of the morning and evening newspapers  sir    walter besant on the novel  none but the newest novels ought to be    read  mr w d howells on this subject  experience of the lecturer    as a novelist  gratifying letters from persons happily influenced by    the lecturer  anecdotes  case of miss a c  case of mr j    r  unhappy endings demoralising  marriage the true end of the    novel but the beginning of the happy life  lecturer wishes her    audience happy endings and true beginnings  conclusion  will that do asked miss martin anxiously  yes if you dont exceed your plan or run into chaff  i wont said miss martin  it is all chaff but they wont see it  i think i would drop that about popery said mertonit may lead to letters in the newspapers and do be awfully careful about impropriety in novels  ill put in vice to be condemned not described said miss martin pencilling a note on the margin of her paper  that seems safe said merton  but it cuts out some of our most powerful teachers  serve them right said miss martin  teachers the arrant humbugs  you will report at once on your return said merton  i shall be on tenterhooks till i see you again  if i knew what you are really about id take counsels opinion  medical opinion does not satisfy me i want legal  how nervous you are said miss martin  counsel would be rather stuck up i think it is a new kind of case and the lady laughed in an irritating way  ill tell you what ill do she said  ill telegraph to you on the monday morning after the lecture  if everything goes well ill telegraph happy ending  if anything goes wrongbut it cantill telegraph unhappy ending  if you do i shall be off to callao     on no condition    is extradition    allowed in callao  said merton  but if there is any uncertaintyand there may be said miss martin ill telegraph will report        merton passed a miserable week of suspense and perplexity of mind  never had he been so imprudent he felt sure of that and it was the only thing of which he did feel sure  the newspapers contained bulletins of an epidemic of smallpox at bulcester  how would that work into the plot then the high animal spirits and daring fancy of miss martin might carry her into undreamedof adventures  but they wont let her have even a glass of champagne reflected merton  one glass makes her reckless  it was with a trembling hand that merton about ten on the monday morning took the telegraphic envelope of fate  i cant face it he said to logan  read the message to me  merton was unmanned  logan carelessly opened the envelope and read  happy ending but awfully disappointed  will call at one oclock  oh thanks to all gracious powers said merton falling limply on to a sofa  ring logan and order a small whiskyandsoda  i wont said logan  horrid bad habit  would you like me to send out for smellingsalts  be a man merton  pull yourself together  you dont know that awful girl said merton slowly recovering self control  however as she is disappointed though the ending is happy her infernal plan must have been miscarried whatever it was  it must be all right though i shant be quite happy till i see her  i am no coward logan and merton was later to prove that he possessed coolness and audacity in no common measure but it is the awful sense of responsibility  she is quite capable of getting us into the newspapers  you funk being laughed at said logan  merton lay on the sofa smoking too many cigarettes till punctually at one oclock a peal at the bell announced the arrival of miss martin  she entered radiant smiling and in her costume of innocence she looked like a sylph  it is all rightthey are engaged with mr warrens full approval she exclaimed  were we on the stage i should embrace you exclaimed merton rapturously  we are not on the stage replied miss martin demurely  and i have no occasion to congratulate myself  my plot did not come off never had a look in  do you want to be vaccinated  if so shake hands and miss martin extended her own hands ungloved  i do not want to be vaccinated said merton  then dont shake hands said miss martin  what on earth do you mean asked merton  look there said the lady lifting her hand to his eyes  merton kissed it  oh take care shrieked miss martin  it would be awkwardon the lips  do you see my ring  merton and logan examined her ring  it was a beautiful cinque cento jewel in white and blue enamel with a high gold top containing a pointed ruby  its very pretty said mertonquite of the best period  but what is the mystery  it is a poison ring of the borgias said miss martin  i borrowed it from sir josiah wilkinson  if it scratched you here she exhibited the mechanism of the jewel why there you are  where  poisoned  no  vaccinated said miss martin  it is full of the stuff they vaccinate you with but it is quite safe as far as the old poison goes sir josiah sterilised it in case of accidents before he put in the glycerinated lymph  my own idea  he was delighted  shall i shake hands with the officeboyit might do him goodor would kutuzoff give a paw  kutuzoff was the russian cat  by no meansnot for worlds said merton  kutuzoff is a conscientious objector  but were you going to shake hands with miss truman with that horrible ring  sacred emblems enamelled on it said merton gingerly examining the jewel  no i was not going to do that replied miss martin  my idea was to acquire the confidence of the loverthe younger mr warrenexplain to him how the thing works lend it to him and then let him press his janes wrist with it in some shady arbour  then his jane would have been all that the heart of mr warren pere could desire  but it did not come off  thank goodness ejaculated merton  there might have been an awful row  i dont know what the offence would have been in the eye of the law  vaccinating a conscientious objector without consent yet without violencewhat would the law say to that  we might make it hamesucken under trust in scotland said logan if it was done on the premises of the young ladys domicile  we have not that elegant phrase in england said merton  perhaps it would have been a common assault but anyhow it would have got into the newspapers  never again be officer of mine miss martin  but how did all end happily asked logan  why you may call it happily and so may the lovers but i call it very disappointing said miss martin  tell us all about it cried logan  well i went down simple as you see me  simplex munditiis said merton  and was met at the station by young mr warren  his father with the wisdom of a nonconformist serpent had sent him alone to make my acquaintance and be fascinated  my things were put on a fourwheeler  i was all young enthusiasm in the manner of the young girl  he was a goodlooking boy enough though in a bowler hat with turndown collar but he was gloomy  i was curious about the public buildings ecstatic about the town hall and a kind of moesogothic tabernacle if it was not moesogothic in style i dont know what it was where the rev mr truman holds forth  but i could not waken him up he seemed miserable  i soon found out the reason  the placards of the local newspapers shrieked in big type with     spread of smallpox    135 cases  when i saw that i took young mr warrens hand  were you wearing the ring asked merton  no it was in my dressingbag  i said mr warren i know what care clouds your brow  you are brooding over the fate of the young the fair the belovedthe unvaccinated  i know the story of your heart  how the d i mean how do you know miss martin about my private affairs  a little bird has told me i said style of the young girl you know  i have friends in bulcester who esteem you  no i must not mention names but i come not too late i hope to bring you security she shall be preserved from this awful scourge and you shall be her preserver  he wanted to know how it was to be done of course and after taking his word of honour for secrecy i told him that the remedy would lie in his own hands showed him the ring and taught him how to work it  mr squeers went on miss martin had never wopped a boy in a cab before and i had never beheld a scene of passionate emotion beforein a fourwheeler  he called me his preserver he said that i was an angel he knelt at my feet and if we had been on the stageas mr merton said  and were you on the stage asked merton  that is neither here nor there  it was an instructive experience and you little know the treasures of passion that may lie concealed in the heart of a young oilcloth manufacturer  happy young oilcloth manufacturer murmured merton  they are both happy but i did not manage my fortunate conclusion in my own way  when young mr warren had moderated the transports of his gratitude we were in the suburbs of bulcester where the millowners live in houses of the most promiscuous architecture tudor jacobean queen anne bedford park queen anne chalets chineseries all standing naked in the open air for the trees have not grown up round them yet then we came to a gate without a lodge the cabman got down and opened it and we were in the visible presence of mr warrens villa  the style is the scottish baronial all pepperpots gables and crowsteps  what a lovely old place i said to my companion  have you secret passages and sliding panels and dark turnpike stairs  what a house for conspiracies  there is a real turret window cant you fancy it suddenly shot up and the kings face popped out very red and bellowing treason  at that moment when my imagination was in full career the turret window was shot up and a face very red with red whiskers was popped out  that is my father said young mr warren and we alighted and a very small maidservant opened the portals of the baronial hall while the cabman carried up my trunk and mr warren senior greeted me in the hall  welcome to bulcester he said with a florid air and hoped james and i had made friends on the way and then he actually winked  he is a widower and i was dying for tea but there we sat and when the little maid came in it was to say that a gentleman wanted to see mr warren in the study  so he went out and then james being the victim of gratitude i took my courage in both hands and asked if i might have tea james said that they usually had it after the lecture was over which would not be till nine and that some people had been asked to meet me then i knew that i was got among a strange outlandish race who eat strange meats and keep high teas and my spirit fainted within me  oh mr james i said if you love me have a cup of tea and some breadandbutter sent up to my room and tell the maid to show me the way to it  so he sent for her and she showed me to the best spare room with oleographs of highland scenery on the walls and coloured landseer prints and tartan curtains and everything made of ormolu that can be made of ormolu  in about twenty minutes the girl returned with tea and poached eggs and toast and jam and marmalade  so i dressed for the lecture which was to begin at eightjust when people ought to be diningand came down into the drawingroom  the elder mr warren was sitting alone reading the daily news and he rose with an air of happy solemnity and shook hands again  you can let james alone now miss martin he said and he winked again rubbed his hands and grinned all over his expansive face  let james alone i said  yes dont go upsetting the ladhes not used to young ladies like you  you leave james to himself  james will do very well  i have a little surprise for james  he certainly had a considerable surprise for me but i merely asked if it was jamess birthday which it was not  luckily james entered  all his gloom was gone thanks to me and he was remarkably smiling and particularly attentive to myself  mr warren seemed perplexed  james have you heard any good news he asked  you seem very gay all of a sudden  james caught my eye  no father he said  what news do you mean  anything in business  a large order from sarawak  mr warren was silent but presently took me into a corner on the pretence of showing me some horrible objet darta treacly bronze  i say he said you must have made great play in the cab coming from the station  james looks a new man  i never would have guessed him to be so fickle  but mind you no more of it  let james behe will do very well  how was james to do very well  why were my fascinations not to be exercised as per contract  i began to suspect the worst and i was thinking of nothing else while we drove to the premises of the bulcester literary society  could jane have drowned herself out of the way or taken smallpox which might ruin her charms  well i had not a large audience on account of fear of infection i suppose and all the people present wore the red badge like mr warren only he wore one on each arm  this somewhat amazed me but as i had never spoken in public before i was rather in a flutter  however i conquered my girlish shyness and if the audience was not large it was enthusiastic  when i came to the peroration about wishing them all happy endings and real beginnings of true life dont you know the audience actually rose at me and cheered like anything  then someone proposed three cheers for young warren and they gave them like mad i did not know why nor did he he looked quite pale  then his father with tears in his voice proposed a vote of thanks to me and said that he and the brave hearts of old bulcester his old friends and brothers in arms were once more united and the people stormed the platform and shook his hand and slapped him on the back  at last we got out by a back way where our cab was waiting  young mr warren was as puzzled as myself and his father was greatly overcome and sobbing in a corner  we got into the house where people kept arriving and at last a fine old clericallooking bird entered with a red badge on one arm and a very pretty girl in white on the other  she had a red badge too  young mr warren who was near me when they came in gave a queer sort of cry and then i understood  the girl was his jane and she had been vaccinated also her father that afternoon owing to the awful panic the old man got into after reading the evening papers about the smallpox  the gentleman whom mr warren went to see in the study just after my arrival had brought him this gratifying intelligence and he had sent the gentleman back to ask the trumans to a high tea of reconciliation  the people at the lecture had heard of this and that was why they cheered so for young warren because his affair was as commonly known to all bulcester as that of romeo and juliet at verona they are hearty people at bulcester and not without elements of old english romance  old mr warren publicly embraced jane truman and then brought her and presented her to me as jamess bride  we both cried a little i think and then we all sat down to high tea and i am scarcely yet the woman i used to be  it was a height  and a weight  and a length  after tea mr warren made a speech and said that bulcester had come back to him and i was afraid that he would brag dreadfully but he did not he was too happy i think  and then mr truman made a speech and said that though they felt obliged to own that they had come to the conclusion that though antivaccination was a holy thing still in the circumstances vaccination was good enough  but they yet clung to principles for which hampden died on the field and russell on the scaffold and many of their own citizens in bed  there must be no coercion  everyone who liked must be allowed to have smallpox as much as he pleased  all other issues were unimportant except that of freedom  here i rosei was rather excitedand said that i hoped the reverend speaker was not deserting the sacred principle of compulsory temperance would the speaker allow people freedom to drink  all other issues were unimportant compared with that of freedom except the interest of depriving a poor man of his beer  to catch smallpox was a britons birthright but not to take a modest quencher  no freedom to drink down with the drink i cried and drained my teacup and waved it amidst ringing cheers  mr truman admitted that there were exceptionsone exception at least  disease must be free to all not alcohol nor ritualism  he thanked his young friend the gifted lecturer for recalling him to his principles  the principles of the good old cause the puritan cause were as pure as glycerinated lymph and he proposed to found a liberal vaccinationist league  they are great people for leagues at bulcester and they like the initials l v l  there was no drinking of toasts for there was nothing to drink them in anddo you know mr mertoni think it must be nearly luncheon time  champagne appears to me to be indicated said merton who rang the bell and then summoned miss blossom from her typewriting  we have done nothing merton said but heaven only knows what we have escaped in the adventure of the lady novelist and the vaccinationist  on taking counsels opinion merton learned with a shudder that if young warren had used the borgia ring and if jane had resented it he might have been indicted for a common assault under 24 and 25 victoria cap 100 sec 24 for unlawfully and maliciously administering a noxious thing with intent to annoy  i dont think she could have proved the intent to annoy said the learned counsel  you dont know a bulcester jury as it was before the epidemic said merton  and i might have been an accessory before the fact and anyhow we should all have got into the newspapers  miss martin was the most admired of the bridesmaids at the warrentruman marriage     x  adventure of the fair american   i  the prize of a ladys hand   yes i guess that pappa was reckoned considerable of a crank  a great educational reformer and a progressive democratic stalwart that is the kind of hairpin pappa was  but it is awkward for me some  these remarks though of an obsolete and exaggerated transatlantic idiom were murmured in the softest of tones in the most english of silken accents by the most beautiful of young ladies  she occupied the clients chair in mertons office and as she sat there and smiled merton acknowledged to himself that he had never met a client so charming and so perplexing  miss mccabe had been educated as merton knew at an aristocratic irish convent in paris a sanctuary of old names and old creeds  this was the plan of her late father spoken of by her as pappa an educational reformer of eccentric ideas who though of ancient indeed royal irish descent was of american birth  the young lady had thus acquired abroad much against her will that kind of english accent which some of her countrywomen reckon affected  but her intense patriotism had induced her to study in the works of american humourists and to reproduce in her discourse the flowers of speech of which a specimen has been presented  the national accent was beyond her but at least she could be true to what she erroneously believed to be the national idiom  your case is peculiar said merton thoughtfully and scarcely within our province  as a rule our clients are the parents guardians or children of persons entangled in undesirable engagements  but you i understand are dissatisfied with the matrimonial conditions imposed by the will of the late mr mccabe  i want to take my own pick out of the crowd said miss mccabe  i can readily understand said merton bowing that the throng of wooers is enormous and he vaguely thought of penelope  the scheme will be popular  it will hit our people right where they live said miss mccabe not appropriating the compliment  you see pappa struck ile early and struck it often  he was what our howells calls a multimillionaire and im his only daughter  pappa loved me but he loved the people better  guess pappa was not mean not worth a cent  he was a white man  miss mccabe with a glow of lovely enthusiasm contemplated the unprecedented whiteness of the paternal character  what the people want pappa used to say is education  they want it short and they want it striking  that was why he laid out five millions on his celebrated museum of freaks with a staff of competent professors and lecturers  the mccabe museum of natural varieties lectures and all is open gratuitously to the citizens of our republic and to intelligent foreigners  that was how pappa put it  i say that he deadheaded creation  truly republican munificence said merton worthy of your great country  well i should smile said miss mccabe  butexcuse my insular ignorancei do not exactly understand how a museum of freaks admirably organised as no doubt it is contributes to the cause of popular education  you have museums even in london asked miss mccabe  merton assented  are they not educational  the british museum is mainly used by the children of the poor as a place where they play a kind of subdued hideandseek said merton  thats because they are not interested in tinned egyptian corpses and broken greek statuary ware answered the fair republican  now mr merton did you ever see or hear of a popular museum a museum that the people would give its cents to see  i have heard of mr barnums museum said merton  thats the idea it is right there said miss mccabe  but old man barnum was not scientific  he saw what our people wanted but he did not see pappa said how to educate them through their natural instincts barnums mermaid was not genuine business  it confused the popular mind and fostered superstitionand got found out  the result was scepticism both religious and scientific  now pappa used to argue the lives of our citizens are monotonous  they see yellow dogs say but each yellow dog has only one tail  they see men and women but almost all of them have only one head and even a hand with six fingers is not common  this is why the popular mind runs into grooves  this causes what they call the dead level of democracy  even our men of genius pappa allowed for he was a very fairminded man do not go ahead of the european ticket but rather the reverse  your tennyson has the inner tracks of our longfellow your thackeray gives our bertha runkle his dust  the papers called pappa unpatriotic and a bad american  but he was not he was a white man  when he saw his countrys faults he put his finger on them right there and tried to cure them  a noble policy murmured merton  miss mccabe was really so pretty and unusual that he did not care how long she was in coming to the point  well pappa argued that there was more genius or had been since the declaration of independence even in england than in the states  and why he asked  why because they have more variety in england things are not all on one level there  our dogs have only one tail apiece said merton in spite of the proverb as proud as a dog with two tails and a plurality of heads is unusual even among british subjects  yes answered miss mccabe but you have varieties among yourselves you have a king and a queen and your peerage is rich in differentiated species  a baronet is not a marquis nor is a duke an earl  he may be both said merton but miss mccabe continued to expose the parental philosophy  now pappa would not hear of aristocratic distinctions in our country  he was a hail columbia man on the democratic ticket  but something is wanted he said to get us out of grooves and break the monotony  that something said pappa nature has mercifully provided in freaks  the citizens feel this unconsciously thats why they spend their money at barnums  but barnum was not scientific and barnum was not straight about his mermaid  so pappa founded his museum of natural varieties all of them honest injun  here the lecturers show off the freaks and explain how nature works them and how she can always see them and go one better  we have the biggest gold nugget and the weeniest cunning least gold nugget the biggest diamond and the smallest diamond the tallest man and the smallest man the whitest negro and the yellowest red man in the world  we have the most eccentric beasts and the queerest fishes and everything is explained by lecturers of worldwide reputation on the principles of evolution as copyrighted by our asa gray and our agassiz that is what pappa called popular education and it hits our citizens right where they live  miss mccabe paused in a flush of filial and patriotic enthusiasm  merton inwardly thought that among the queerest fishes the late mr mccabe must have been preeminent  but what he said was the scheme is most original  our educationists to employ a term which they do not disdain such as mr herbert spencer sir joshua fitch and others have i thought out nothing like this  our capitalists never endow education on this more than imperial scale  guess they are scaly varmints interposed miss mccabe  merton bowed his acquiescence in the sentiment  but he went on i still do not quite understand how your own prospects in life are affected by mr mccabes most original and i hope promising experiment  pappa loved me but he loved his country better and taught me to adore her and be ready for any sacrifice  miss mccabe looked straight at merton like an iphigenia blended with a joan of arc  i do sincerely trust that no sacrifice is necessary said merton  the circumstances do not call for sounexampled a victim  i am to be lady principal of the museum when i come to the age of twenty five that is in six years said miss mccabe proudly  you dont call that a sacrifice  merton wanted to say that the most magnificent of natural varieties would only be in its proper place  but the man of business and the manager of a great and beneficent association overcame the mere amateur of beauty and he only said that the position of lady principal was worthy of the ambition of a patriot and a friend of the species  well i reckon  but a clause in pappas will is awkward for me some it is about my marriage said miss mccabe bravely  merton assumed an air of grave interest  pappa left it in his will that i was to marry the man under the age of fiveandthirty and of unimpeachable character and education who should discover and add to the museum the most original and unheardof natural variety whether found in the old or the new world  merton could scarcely credit the report of his ears  would you oblige me by repeating that statement he said and miss mccabe repeated it in identical terms obviously quoting textually from the will  now i understand your unhappy position said merton thoroughly agreeing with the transatlantic critics who had pronounced the late mr mccabe considerable of a crank  but this is far too serious a matter for mefor our association  i am no legist but i am convinced that at least british and i doubt not american law would promptly annul a testatory clause so utterly unreasonable and unprecedented  unreasonable exclaimed miss mccabe rising to her feet with eyes of flame i am my fathers daughter and his wish is my law whatever the laws that men make may say  her affectation of slang had fallen off she was absolutely natural now and entirely in earnest  merton rose also  one moment he said  it would be impertinence in me to express my admiration of youof what you say  as the question is not a legal one in such i am no fit adviser i shall think myself honoured if you will permit me to be of any service in the circumstances  they are less unprecedented than i hastily supposed  history records many examples of fathers even of royal rank who have attached similar conditions to the disposal of their daughters hands  merton was thinking of the kings in the treatises of monsieur charles perrault madame daulnoy and other historians of fairyland of monarchs who give their daughters to the bold adventurers that bring the smallest dog or the singing rose or the horse magical  what you really want i think he went on as miss mccabe resumed her seat is to have your choice as you said among the competitors  yes replied the fair american that is only natural  but then said merton much depends on who decides as to the merits of the competitors  with whom does the decision rest  with the people  with the people  yes with the popular vote as expressed through the newspaper that my father foundedthe yellow flag  the public is to see the exhibits the new varieties of nature and the majority of votes is to carry the day  trust the people that was pappas word  then anyone who chooses of the age character and education stipulated under the clause in the will may go and bring in whatever variety of nature he pleases and take his chance  that is it all the time said the client  there is a trust and the trustees friends of pappas decide on the qualifications of the young men who enter for the competition  if the trustees are satisfied they allot money for expenses out of the exploration fund so that nobody may be stopped because he is poor  there will be an enormous throng of competitors in these conditionsand with such a prize merton could not help adding  i reckon the trustees are middling particular  theyll weed them out  is there any restriction on the nationality of the competitors asked merton on whom an idea was dawning  only members of the english speaking races need apply said miss mccabe  pappa took no stock in spaniards or turks  the voters will be prejudiced in favour of their own fellow citizens asked merton  that is only natural  trust the people said miss mccabe  the whole thing is to be kept as dark as a blind coloured person hunting in a dark cellar for a black cat that is not there  a truly miltonic illustration said merton  the advertisement for competitors will be carefully worded so as to attract only young men of science  the young men are not to be told about me the prize is in dollars with other advantages to be later specified  the varieties found are to be conveyed to a port abroad not yet named and shipped for new york in a steamer belonging to the mccabe trust  then am i to understand that the conditions affecting your marriage are still an entire secret  that is so said miss mccabe and i guess from what the marchioness told me your reference that you can keep a secret  to keep secrets is the very essential of my vocation said merton  but this secret as will be seen he did not absolutely keep  the arrangements he added are most judicious  guess pappa was cute said miss mccabe relapsing into her adopted mannerisms  i think i now understand the case in all its bearings merton went on i shall give it my serious consideration  perhaps i had better say no more at present but think over the matter  you remain in town for the season  guess weve staked out a claim in berkeley square said miss mccabe an agreeable location  she mentioned the number of the house  then we are likely to meet now and then said merton and i trust that i may be permitted to wait on you occasionally  miss mccabe graciously assented her chaperon lady rathcoffey was summoned by her from the inner chamber and the society of miss blossom the typewriter the pair drove away and merton was left to his own reflections  i do not know what can be done for her he thought except to see that there is at least one eligible man a gentleman among the crowd of competitors and that he is a likely man to win the beautiful prize  and that man is bude by jove if he wants to win it  the earl of bude whose name at once occurred to merton was a remarkable personage  the world knew him as rich handsome happy and a mighty hunter of big game  they knew not the mysterious grief that for years had gnawed at his heart  why did not bude marry  no woman could say the world moreover knew not but merton did that lord bude was the mysterious mr jones harvey who contributed the most original papers to the proceedings of the geographical and zoological societies and who had conferred many strange beasts on the gardens of the latter learned institution  the erudite papers were read the eccentric animals were conferred in the name of mr jones harvey  they came from outlandish addresses in the ends of the earth but in the flesh jones harvey had been seen by no man and his secret had been confided to merton only to logan and two other school friends  he did good to science by stealth and blushed at the idea of being a frs  there was no show of science about bude and nothing exotic except the singular circumstance that however he happened to be dressed he always wore a ring or pin or sleeve links set with very ugly and muddy looking pearls  from these ornaments lord bude was inseparable to chaff about presents from dusky princesses on undiscovered shores he was impervious  even merton did not know the cause of his attachment to these ungainly jewels or the dark memory of mysterious loss with which they were associated  mertons first care was to visit the divine althaea mrs brownsmith and other ladies of his acquaintance  their cards were deposited at the claim staked out by miss mccabe in berkeley square and that young lady soon went everywhere and publicly confessed that she was having a real lovely time  by a little diplomacy lord bude was brought acquainted with miss mccabe  she consented to overlook his possession of a coronet titles were to this heroine not marvels as to some of her countrywomen and ours but rather matters of indifference scarcely even suggesting hostile prejudice  the observers in society mothers and maids and the chroniclers of fashion soon perceived that there was at least a marked camaraderie between the elegant aristocrat hitherto indifferent to woman untouched as was deemed by love and the lovely child of freedom  miss mccabe sat by him while he drove his coach on the roof of his drag at lords and of his houseboat at henley where she fainted when the crew of johns hopkins university u s was defeated by a length by balliol where lord bude had been the favourite pupil of the great master  merton remarked these tokens of friendship with approval if bude could be induced to enter for the great competition and if he proved successful there seemed no reason to suppose that miss mccabe would be dissatisfied with the peoples choice  towards the end of the season and in budes smokingroom about five in the july morning after a ball at eglintoun house merton opened his approaches  he began cautiously from talk of moors and forests he touched on lochs he mentioned the highland traditions of water bulls which haunt these meres he spoke of the beathach mor loch odha a legendary animal of immeasurable length  the beathach has twelve feet he has often been heard crashing through the ice in the nights of winter these tales the narrator has gleaned from the lips of the celtic peasantry of letter awe  i daresay he does break the ice said bude  in the matter of cryptic survivals of extinct species i can believe a good deal  the sea serpent asked merton  seen him thrice said bude  then why did not jones harvey weigh in with a letter to nature  jones harvey has a scientific reputation to look after and knows he would be laughed at  thats the kind of hairpin he is said bude quoting miss mccabe  by jove merton that girl and he paused  yes she is pretty said merton  pretty  i have seen the women of the round worldbefore i went towell never mind where i used to think the poles the most magnificent but she  whips creation said merton  but i he went on am rather more interested in these other extraordinary animals  do you seriously believe with your experience that some extinct species arenot extinct  to be sure i do  the world is wide  but they are very shy  i once stalked a bunyip in central australia in a lagoon  the natives said he was there i watched for a week squatting in the reeds and in the grey of the seventh dawn i saw him  did you shoot  no i observed him through a field glass first  what is the beggar like  much like some of the highland water cattle as described but it is his ears they take for horns  australia has no indigenous horned animal  he is i should say about nine feet long marsupial he rose breast high and webfooted  i saw that when he dived  other white men have seen himbuckley the convict for one when he lived among the blacks  buckley was not an accurate observer  jones harvey is  any other queer beasts  of course plenty  you have heard of the mylodon the gigantic sloth his bones skin and hair were lately found in a cave in patagonia with a lot of his fodder  you can see them at the british museum in south kensington  primitive patagonian man used the female of the species as a milchcow  he was a genial friendly kind of brute accessible to charm of manner and chopped hay  they fed him on that in a domesticated state  but he is extinct  hesketh pritchard went to look for a live mylodon and did not find him  did not know where to look said bude  but you do asked merton  yes i think so  then why dont you bring one over to the zoo  i may some day  are there any more survivors of extinct species  merton is this an interview  are you doing mr jones harvey at home for a picture paper  no ive dropped the press said merton i ask in a spirit of scientific curiosity  well there is the dinornis the moa of new zealand  a bird as big as the roc in the arabian nights  have you seen him  no but i have seen her the hen bird  she was sitting on eggs  no man knows her nest but myself and old teikipa the chief medicineman or tohunga of the maori king  the moas eyrie is in the kings country it is a difficult country and a dangerous business if the cock moa chances to come home  bude is this worthy of an old friend this blague  do you doubt my word  if you give me your word i must believethat you dreamed it  then a strange thing happened  bude walked to a small case of instruments that stood on a table in the smokingroom  he unlocked it took out a lancet brought a rhodian bowl from a shelf and bared his arm  do you want proof  proof that you saw a hen moa sitting asked merton in amazement  not exactly but proof that teikipa knew a thing or two quite as out of the way as the habitat of the moa  what do you want me to do  bare your arm and hold it over the bowl  the room was full of the yellow dusky light of an early summer morning in london  outside the heavy carts were rolling by in full civilisation the scene was strange  the blood covenant asked merton  bude nodded  merton turned up his cuff bude let a little blood drop into the bowl then performed the same operation on his own arm  this is all rot he said but without this i cannot show you by virtue of my oath to teikipa what i mean to show you  now repeat after me what i am going to say  he spoke a string of words among which merton as he repeated them could only recognise mana and atua  the vowel sounds were as in italian  now these words you must never report to any one without my permission  not likely said merton i only remember two of them and these i knew before  all right said bude  he then veiled his face in a piece of silk that lay on a sofa and rapidly in a low voice chanted a kind of hymn in a tongue unknown to merton  all this he did with a bored air as if he thought the performance a superfluous mummery  now what shall i show you  something simple  look at the bookcase and think of any book you may want to consult  merton thought of the volume in m of the encyclopaedia britannica  the volume slowly slid from the shelf glided through the air to merton and gently subsided on the table near him open at the word moa  merton walked across to the bookcase took all the volumes from the shelf and carefully examined the backs and sides for springs and mechanical advantages  there were none  not half bad he said when he had completed his investigation  you are satisfied that teikipa knew something  if you had seen what i have seen if you had seen the three days dead and bude shivered slightly  i have seen enough  do you know how it is done  no  well a miracle is not what you call logical proof but i believe that you did see the moa and a still more extraordinary bird teikipa  yes they talk of strange beasts but nothing is stranger than man did you ever hear of the berbalangs of cagayan sulu  never in my life said merton  heaven preserve me from them said bude and he gently stroked the strange muddy pearls in the sleevelinks on his loose shirtcuff  angels and ministers of grace defend us he exclaimed crossing himself he was of the old faith and he fell silent  it was a moment of emotion  six silvery strokes were sounded from a little clock on the chimneypiece  the hour of confidences had struck  bude you are serious about miss mccabe asked merton  i mean to put it to the touch at goodwood  no use said merton  bude changed colour  are you  no interrupted merton  but she is not free  there is somebody in america  nobody here i think  it is hardly that said merton  can you listen to rather a long story  ill cut it as much as possible  you must remember that i am practically breaking my word of honour in telling you this  my honour is in your hands  fire away said bude pouring a bottle of apollinaris water into a long tumbler and drinking deep  merton told the tale of miss mccabes extraordinary involvement and of the wild conditions on which her hand was to be won  and as to her heart i think he added if you pull off the prize     if my heart by signs can tell    lordling i have marked her daily    and i think she loves thee well  thank you for that old cock replied the peer shaking mertons hand he had recovered from his emotion  im on he added after a moments silence but i shall enter as jones harvey  his name and his celebrated papers will impress the trustees said merton  now what variety of nature shall you go for  wild men count shall you fetch a berbalang of what do you call it  bude shuddered  not much he said  i think i shall fetch a moa  but no steamer could hold that gigantic denizen of the forests  you leave that to jones harvey  jones is cute some he said reminiscent of the adored one and he fell into a lovers reverie  he was aroused by mertons departure he finished the apollinaris water took a bath and went to bed    ii  the adventure of the muddy pearls   the earl of bude had meant to lay his heart coronet and other possessions real and personal before the tiny feet of the fair american at goodwood  but when he learned from merton the involvements of this heiress and paragon that her hand depended on the choice of the people that the choice of the people was to settle on the adventurer who brought to new york the rarest of natures varieties the earl honourably held his peace  yet he and the object of his love were constantly meeting on the yachts and in the country houses of their friends the aristocracy and finally at shooting lodges in the highlands  their position as the latin delectus says concerning the passion of love in general was a strange thing and full of anxious fears  bude could not declare himself and miss mccabe not knowing that he knew her situation was constantly wondering why he did not speak  between fear of letting her secret show itself in a glance or a blush and hope of listening to the words which she desired to hear even though she could not answer them as her heart prompted she was unhappy  bude could not resist the temptation to be with herindeed he argued to himself that as her suitor and an adventurer about to risk himself in her cause he had a right to be near her  meanwhile merton was the confidant of both of the perplexed lovers at least miss mccabe who of course told him nothing about bude kept him apprised as to the conduct of her trustees  they had acted with honourable caution and circumspection  their advertisements guardedly appealed to men of daring and of scientific distinction under the age of thirtyfive  a professorship might have been in view for all that the world could see if the world read the advertisements  perhaps it was something connected with the manufacture of original explosives for daring is not usually required in the learned  the testimonials and printed works of applicants were jealously scrutinised  at personal interviews with competitors similar caution was observed  during three weeks in august the papers announced that lord bude was visiting the states arrangements about a yachting match in the future were his pretence  he returned he came to scotland and it was in a woodland path beside the lochy that his resolution failed and that he spoke to miss mccabe  they were walking home together from the river in the melancholy and beautiful close of a highland day in september behind them the gillies at a respectful distance were carrying the rods and the fish  the wet woods were fragrant the voice of the stream was deepening strange lights came and went on moor and hills and the distant loch  it was then that bude opened his heart  he first candidly explained that his heart he had supposed was deadburied on a distant and a deadly shore  i reckon theres a lost lenore most times miss mccabe had replied to this confession  but though never to be forgotten the memory of the lost one bude averred was now merged in the light of a living love his heart was no longer tenanted only by a shadow  the heart of miss mccabe stood still for a moment her cheek paled but the gallant girl was true to herself to her fathers wish to her native land to the flag  she understood her adorer  guess im bespoke said miss mccabe abruptly  you are anothers  oh despair exclaimed the impassioned earl  yes i reckon im the bride of seven like the girl in the poem  the bride of seven said bude  one out of that crowd will call me his said miss mccabe handing to her adorer the list which she had received by mail a day or two earlier of the accepted competitors  he glanced over the names  1  dr hiram p dodge of the smithsonian institute  2  alfred jenkins frs all souls college oxford  3  dr james rustler columbia university  4  howard fry ma phd trinity college cambridge  5  professor potter frs university of st andrews  6  professor wilkinson university of harvard  7  jones harvey fgs london england  in heavens name asked the earl what means this mystification  miss mccabe melissa do not trifle with me  is this part of the great american joke  you are playing it pretty low down on me melissa he ended the phrase being one of those with which she had made him familiar  she laughed hysterically its honest injun she said and in the briefest terms she told him what he knew very well the conditions on which her future depended  they are a respectable crowd i dont deny it she went on but oh how dull  that mr jenkins i saw him at your commemoration  he gave us luncheon and showed us dry old bones of beasts and savage notions at the museum  i druther have been on the creek by which name she intended the classical river isis  dr hiram p dodge is one of our rising scientists a boss of the smithsonian institute  well washington is a finer location than oxford dr rustler is a crank he thinks he can find a tall talk mummy that speaks an unknown tongue  a toltec mummy  ah said bude i know where to find one of them  find it then alured exclaimed miss mccabe blushing scarlet and turning aside  but you are not on the list  you are an idler and not scientific not worth a red cent  there ive given myself away  she wept  they were alone beneath the walls of a crumbling fortalice of lochiel the new risen moon saw bude embrace her and dry her tears  a nameless blissful hope awakened in the fair american help there must be she thought with these strong arms around her  she rapidly disposed of the remaining names of howard fry who had a red beard of professor potter of st andrews whose accent was caledonian of wilkinson an ardent but unalluring scientist  as for jones harvey she said ive canvassed everywhere and i cant find anybody that ever saw him  i am more afraid of him than of all the other galoots i dont know why  he is reckoned very learned said bude and has not been thought ill looking  do tell said miss mccabe  oh melissa can you even dream of another in an hour like this  did you ever see jones harvey  yes i have met him  do you know him well  no man knows him better  cant you get him to stand out and alured cant youfetch along that old tall talk mummy  he would hit our people being american himself  it is impossible  jones harvey will never stand out and bude smiled  by the telepathy of the affections miss mccabe was slowly informed especially as budes smile widened almost unbecomingly while he gazed into the deeps of her golden eyes  alured she exclaimed thats why you went to the states youarejones harvey  secret for secret whispered the earl  we have both given ourselves away  unknown to the world i am jones harvey to live for you to love you to dare if need be to die for you  well you surprise me said miss mccabe        the narrator is unwilling to dilate on the delights of a privileged affection  in this love affair neither of the lovers could feel absolutely certain that their affection was privileged  the fair american had her own secret scheme if her hopes were blighted  she could not then obey the paternal will she would retire into the life religious and as sister anna would strive to forget the sorrows of melissa mccabe  bude had his own hours of gloom  it is a sixtoone chance he said to merton when they met  better than that i think said merton  first you know exactly what you are entered for  do the others  when you saw the trustees in the states did they tell you about the prize  not they  they spoke of a pecuniary reward which would be eminently satisfactory and of the opportunity for research and distinction and all expenses found  i said that i preferred to pay my own way which surprised and pleased them a good deal  well then knowing the facts and the lady you have a far stronger motive than the other six  thats true said bude  again though the others are good men not that i like jenkins of all souls none of them has your experience and knowledge  jones harveys testimonials would carry it if it were a question of election to a professorship  you flatter me answered bude  lastly did the trustees ask you if you were a married man  no by jove they didnt  well nothing about the competitors being unmarried men occurs in the clause of mccabes last will and testament  he took it for granted the prize being what it is that only bachelors were eligible  but he forgot to say so in so many words and the trustees did not go beyond the deed now dodge is married fry of trinity is a married don rustler i happen to know is an engaged man who cant afford to marry a charming girl in detroit michigan and professor potter has buried one wife and wedded another  if rustler is loyal to his plighted word you have nobody against you but wilkinson and old jenkins of all soulsa tough customer i admit though what a stinks man like him has to do at all souls i dont know  i say this is hard on the other sportsmen  what ought i to do  should i tell them  you cant you have no official knowledge of their existence  you only know through miss mccabe  you have just to sit tight  it seems beastly unsportsmanlike said bude  wills are often most carelessly drafted answered merton and the usual consequences follow  it is not cricket said bude and really he seemed much more depressed than elated by the reduction of the odds against him from 6 to 1 to 2 to 1  this is the magnificent type of character produced by our british system of athletic sports though it is not to be doubted that the spirit of science in the american gentlemen would have been equally productive of the sense of fair play         a year by the terms of mccabes will was allotted to the quest candidates were to keep the trustees informed as to their whereabouts six weeks before the end of the period the competitors would be instructed as to the port of rendezvous where an ocean liner chartered by the trustees was to await them  bude as jones harvey had obtained leave to sail his own steam yacht of 800 tons  the earls preparations were simple  he carried his usual stock of scientific implements his usual armament including two maxim guns and a package of considerable size and weight which was stored in the hold as to the preparations of the others he knew nothing but miss mccabe became aware that rustler had not left the american continent  concerning jenkins and the probable aim of his enterprise the object of his quest she gleaned information from a junior fellow of all souls who was her slave was indiscreet and did not know how deeply concerned she was in the expeditions  but she never whispered a word of what she knew to her lover not even in the hour of parting  it was in an unnamed creek of the new zealand coast six weeks before the end of the appointed year that bude received a telegram in cipher from the trustees  bearded and in blue spectacles clad rudely as a mariner bude was to all except logan who had accompanied him plain jones harvey  none could have recognised in his rugged aspect the elegant aristocrat of mayfair  bude took the message from the hands of the maori bearer  as he deciphered it his fingers trembled with eagerness  oh heaven  here is the hand of destiny he exclaimed when he had read the message and with pallid face he dropped into a deckchair  no bad news asked logan with anxiety  the port of rendezvous said bude much agitated  come down to my cabin  entering the sumptuous cabin bude opened the locked door of a stateroom and uttered some words in an unknown tongue  a tall and very ancient maori tatooed with the native moka on every inch of his body emerged  the snows of some eighty winters covered his broad breast and majestic head  his eyes were full of the secrets of primitive races  for clothing he wore two navy revolvers stuck in a waistcloth  teikipa said bude in the maori language watch by the door we must have no listeners and your ears are keen as those of the youngest rangatira warrior  the august savage nodded and lying down on the floor applied his ear to the chink at its foot  the port of tryst whispered bude to logan as they seated themselves at the remotest extremity of the cabin is in cagayan sulu  and where may that be asked logan lighting a cigarette  it is a small volcanic island the most southerly of the philippines  american territory now said logan  but what about it  if it was anybody but you bude i should say he was in a funk  i am in a funk answered bude simply  why  i have been there before and lefta bloodfeud  what of it  we have one here with the maori king about you know what have we not the maxims and any quantity of leemetfords  besides you need not go ashore at cagayan sulu  but they can come aboard  bullets wont stop them  stop whom  the natives  the berbalangs you might as well try to stop mosquitoes with maxims  who are the berbalangs then  bude paced the cabin in haggard anxiety  least said soonest mended he muttered  well i dont want your confidence said logan hurt  my dear fellow said bude affectionately you are likely to know soon enough  in the meantime please accept this  he opened a strong box which appeared to contain jewellery and offered logan a ring  between two diamonds of the finest water it contained a bizarre muddy coloured pearl  never let that leave your finger said bude  your life may hang on it  it is a pretty talisman said logan placing the jewel on the little finger of his right hand  a token of some friendly chief i suppose at cagayanwhat do you call it  let us put it at that answered bude i must take other precautions  it seemed to logan that these consisted in making similar presents to the officers and crew all of whom were englishmen  teikipa displaced his nosering and inserted his pearl in the orifice previously occupied by that ornament  a little chain of the pearls was hung on the padlock of the huge packingcase which was the special care of teikipa  luckily i had the yachts painting altered before leaving england said bude  ill sail her under spanish colours and perhaps they wont spot her  any way with the pearlslucky i bought a lotwe ought to be safe enough  but if any one of the competitors has gone for specimens of the berbalangs i fear i sadly fear the consequences  his face clouded he fell into a reverie  logan made no reply but puffed rings of cigarette smoke into the still blue air  there was method in budes apparent madness but logan suspected that there was madness in his method  a certain coolness had not ceased to exist between the friends when after their long voyage they sighted the volcanic craters of the lonely isle of cagayan sulu and beheld the stars and stripes waving from the masthead of the george washington captain noah p funkal  logan landed and noted the harmless but wellarmed halfmahometan natives of the village  he saw the other competitors whose exhibits as miss mccabe called them were securely stored in the george washingtonstrange spoils of faroff mysterious forests and unplumbed waters of the remotest isles  occasionally a barbaric yap or a weird yell or hoot was wafted on the air at feeding time  jenkins of all souls whom he knew a little logan did not meet on the beach he like bude tarried aboard ship  the other adventurers were civil but remote and there was a jealous air of suspicion on every face save that of professor potter  he during the day of waiting on the island played golf with logan over links which he had hastily improvised  beyond admitting as they played that his treasure was in a tank and as well as could be expected poor brute but awful noisy professor potter offered no information  our find is quiet enough said logan  does he give you trouble about food asked mr potter  takes nothing said logan adding as he holed out that makes me dormy two  from the rest of the competitors not even this amount of information could be extracted and as for captain noah funkal he was taciturn authoritative and logan thought not in a very good temper  the george washington and the pendragon so jones harvey had christened the yacht which under budes colours sailed as the sabrina weighed anchor simultaneously  if possible they were not to lose sight of each other and they corresponded by signals and through the megalophone  the hours of daylight on the first day of the return voyage passed peacefully at deckcricket as far as logan bude and such of the officers and men as could be spared were concerned  at last night came at one stride and the vast ocean plain was only illuminated by the pale claritude that falls from the stars  logan and bude they had not dressed for dinner but wore yachting suits were smoking on deck when quite suddenly a loud almost musical roar or hum was heard from the direction of the distant island  whats that asked logan leaping up and looking towards cagayan sulu  the berbalangs said bude coolly  you are wearing the ring i gave you  yes always do said logan looking at his hand  all the men have their pearls i saw to that said bude  why the noise is dwindling said logan  that is odd it seemed to be coming this way  so it is said bude the nearer they approach the less you hear them when they have come on board you wont hear them at all  logan stared but asked no more questions  the musical boom as it approached had died to a whisper and then had fallen into perfect silence  at the very moment when the mysterious sound ceased a swarm of things like red fireflies a host of floating specks of ruby light invaded the deck in a cluster  the red points then scattered approached each man on board and paused when within a yard of his head or breast  then they vanished  a queer kind of chill ran down logans spine then the faint whispered musical moan tingled in each mans ears and the sounds as they departed eastwards gathered volume and force till in a moment there fell perfect stillness  stillness broken only by a sudden and mysterious chorus of animal cries from the george washington  a kind of wail high shrieking strenuous ending in a noise as of air escaping from a pipe a torrent of barks such as no known beast could utter subsiding into moans that chilled the blood a guttural scream broken by heavy sounds as if of water lapping on a rock at uncertain intervals a human cry human words with unfamiliar vowel sounds soon slipping into quietthese were among the horrors that assailed the ears of the voyagers in the pendragon such a discord of laments has not tingled to the indifferent stars since the icewave swept into their last retreats and crushed among the rocks that bear their fossil forms the fauna of the preglacial period the ichthyosaurus the brontosaurus the guyas cutis or ringtailed roarer the mastodon and the mammoth  what a row in the menagerie said logan  he was not answered  bude had fallen into a deckchair his face buried in his hands his arms rocking convulsively  i say old cock pull yourself together said logan and rushing down the companion stairs he reappeared with a bottle of champagne  to extract the cork how familiar how reassuring sounded the cloop and to pour the foaming beverage into two long tumblers was to the active logan the work of a moment  shaking bude he offered him the beaker the earl drained it at a draught  he shuddered but rose to his feet  not a man alive on that doomed vessel he was saying when anew the still air was rent by the raucous notes of a megalophone  is your exhibit all right  fit as a fiddle answered logan through a similar instrument  our exhibits are gone bust answered captain noah funkal  our professors are in fits  our darkeys are all dead  can your skipper come aboard  just launching a boat cried logan  bude gave the necessary orders  his captain stepped up to him and saluted  do you know what these red fireflies were that come aboard sir he asked  fireflies  oh musae volitantes sonorae a common phenomenon in these latitudes answered bude  logan rejoiced to see that the earl was himself again  the other gentlemens scientific beasts dont seem to like them sir  so captain funkal seems to imply said bude and taking the ropes with logan beside him while the pendragon lay to he steered the boat towards the george washington  the captain welcomed them on deck in a scene of unusual character  he himself had a revolver in one hand and a belaying pin in the other he had been quelling by the tranquillising methods of captain kettle a mutiny caused by the terror of the crew  the sailors had attempted to leap overboard in the alarm caused by the invasion of the berbalangs  you will excuse my friend and myself for not being in evening dress during a visit at this hour said bude in the silkiest of tones  glad to see you shipshape gentlemen answered the american mariner my dudes of professors were prancing round in tuxedos and prince alberts when the darned fireflies came aboard  bude bowed  study of miss mccabe had taught him that tuxedos and prince alberts mean evening dress and frockcoats  did your men have fits asked the captain  my captain captain hardy made a scientific inquiry about theinsects said bude  the crew showed no emotion  i guess our firebugs were more on business than yours said captain funkal theyve wrecked the exhibits and killed the darkeys with fright except two and they were exhibits themselves  will you honour me by stepping into my cabin gentlemen  i am glad to see sane white men tonight  bude and logan followed him through a scene of melancholy interest beside the mast within a shattered palisade lay huddled the vast corpse of the mylodon of patagonia couchant amidst his fodder of chopped hay the expression of the huge animal was placid and urbane in death  he was the victim of the ceaseless curiosity of science  two of the fivehorned antelope giraffes of central africa lay in a confused heap of horns and hoofs  beside an immense tank couched a figure in evening dress swearing in a subdued tone  logan recognised professor potter  he gently laid his hand on the professors shoulder  the scottish savant looked up  it is a dommed mismanaged affair he said  i could have brought the poor beast safe enough from the clyde to new york but the americans made me harl him round by yon island of camstairy deevils and he shook his fist in the direction of cagayan sulu  what had you got asked logan  the beathach na loch na bheiste said potter  i drained the loch to get him  fortunately he added it was at the expense of the trust  after a few words of commonplace but heartfelt condolence logan descended the companion and followed bude and captain funkal into the cabin of that officer  the captain placed refreshments on the table  now gentlemen he said you have seen the least riled of my professors and you can guess what the rest are like  professor rustler is weeping in his cabin over a shrivelled old mummy  never will he speak again says he and i am bound to say that i hev heard the critter discourse once  the mummy let some awful yells out of him when the firebugs came aboard  yes we heard a human cry said bude  i had thought the talk was managed with a concealed gramophone said the captain but it wasnt  the bunyip from central australia has gone to his long home  that was professor wilkinsons pet  there is nothing left alive out of the lot but the natives that professor jenkins of england brought in irons from cagayan sulu  i reckon them two niggers are somehow at the bottom of the whole ruction  indeed and why asked bude  why siri am addressing professor jones harvey  bude bowed  harvey captain but not professorsimple amateur seaman and explorer  sir your hand said the captain  your friend is not a professor  not i said logan smiling  the captain solemnly shook hands  gentlemen you have sand he said a supreme tribute of respect  well about these two natives  i never liked taking them aboard  they are in consequence of the triumph of our arms american subjects natives of the conquered philippines  i am no lawyer and they may be citizens they may have votes  they are entitled anyway to the protection of the flag and i would have entered them as steerage passengers  but that professor jenkins and the other professors agreed would have it that they came under the head of scientific exhibits  and they did allow that the critters were highly dangerous  i guess they were right  why what could they do  well gentlemen i heard stories on shore that i took no stock in  i am not a superstitious man but they allowed that these darkeys are not of a common tribe but what the papers call highly developed mediums  and i guess they are at the bottom of the stramash  captain funkal may i be frank with you asked bude  i am hearing you said the captain  then to put it shortly i have been at cagayan sulu before on an exploring cruise  that was in 1897  i never wanted to go back to it logan did i not regret the choice of that port when the news reached us in new zealand  logan nodded  you funked it he said  when i was at cagayan sulu in 1897 i heard from the natives of a singular tribe in the centre of the island  this tribe is the berbalangs  thats what professor jenkins called them said the captain  the berbalangs are subject to neither of the chiefs in the island  no native will approach their village  they are cannibals  the story is that they can throw themselves into a kind of trance  they then project a something or otherspirit astral body influence of some kindwhich flies forth making a loud noise when distant  thats what we heard said the captain  but is silent when they are close at hand  silent they were said the captain  they then appear as points of red flame  thats so interrupted the captain  and cause death to man and beast apparently by terror  i have seen said bude shuddering the face of a dead native of high respectability into whose house before my own eyes these points of flame had entered i had to force the door it was strongly barred within  i never mentioned the fact before knowing that i could not expect belief  well sir i believe you  you are a white man  bude bowed and went on  the circumstances though not generally known have been published captain by a gentleman of reputation mr edward forbes skertchley of hong kong  his paper indeed in the journal of a learned association the asiatic society of bengal 232induced me most unfortunately to visit cagayan sulu when it was still nominally in the possession of the spaniards  my experience was similar to that of mr skertchley but for personal reasons was much more awful and distressing  one of the most beautiful of the island girls a person of most amiable and winning character not alas of my own faithbudes voice brokewas one of the victims of the berbalangs    i loved her  he paused and covered his face with his hands  the others respected and shared his emotion  the captain like all sailors sympathetic dashed away a tear  one thing i ought to add said bude recovering himself i am no more superstitious than you are captain funkal and doubtless science will find a simple satisfactory and normal explanation of the facts the existence of which we are both compelled to admit  i have heard of no well authenticated instance in which the force whatever it is has been fatal to europeans  the superstitious natives much as they dread the berbalangs believe that they will not attack a person who wears a cocoa nut pearl  why this should be so if so it is i cannot guess  but as it is always well to be on the safe side i provided myself five years ago with a collection of these objects and when i heard that we were ordered to cagayan sulu i distributed them among my crew  my friend you may observe wears one of the pearls  i have several about my person he disengaged a pin from his necktie a muddy pearl set with burning rubies  perhaps captain funkal you will honour me by accepting this specimen and wearing it while we are in these latitudes  if it does no good it can do no harm  we at least have not been molested though we witnessed the phenomena  sir said the captain i appreciate your kindness and i value your gift as a memorial of one of the most singular experiences in a seafaring life  i drink your health and your friends  mr logan to you  the captain pledged his guests  and now gentlemen what am i to do  that captain is for your own consideration  ill carpet that lubber jenkins said the captain and leaving the cabin he returned with the fellow of all souls  his shirt front was ruffled his white neckcloth awry his pallid countenance betrayed a sensitive secondrate mind not at unity with itself  he nodded sullenly to logan bude he did not know  professor jenkins mr jones harvey said the captain  sit down sir take a drink you seem to need one  jenkins drained the tumbler and sat with downcast eyes his finger drumming nervously on the table  professor jenkins sir i reckon you are the cause of the unparalleled disaster to this exploring expedition  why did you bring these two natives of our territory on board you well and duly knowing that the end would not justify the proceedings  a furtive glance from jenkins lighted on the diamonds that sparkled in logans ring  he caught logans hand  traitor he cried  what will not scientific jealousy dare that meanest of the passions  what the devil do you mean said logan angrily wrenching his hand away  you leave mr logan alone sir said the captain  i have two minds to put you in irons mr professor jenkins  if you please explain yourself  i denounce this man and his companion said jenkins noticing a pearl ring on budes finger i denounce them of conspiracy mean conspiracy against this expedition and against the american flag  as how inquired the captain lighting a cigar with irritating calmness  they wear these pearls in which i had trusted for absolute security against the berbalangs  well i wear one too said the captain pointing to the pin in his necktie  are you going to tell me that i am a traitor to the flag sir  i warn you professor to be careful  what am i to think asked jenkins  it is rather more important what you say replied the captain  what is this fine conspiracy  i had read in england about the berbalangs  probably in mr skertchleys curious paper in the journal of the asiatic society of bengal asked bude with suavity  jenkins merely stared at him  i deemed that specimens of these american subjects dowered with their strange and baneful gift were well worthy of the study of american savants and i knew that the pearls were a certain prophylactic  whats that asked the captain  a kind of universal painkiller said jenkins  well you surprise me said the captain a man of your education  pain killer and he expectorated dexterously  i mean that the pearls keep off the berbalangs said jenkins  then why didnt you lay in a stock of the pearls asked the captain  because these conspirators had been before me  these men or their agents had bought up just before our arrival every pearl in the island  they had wormed out my secret knew the object of my adventure knew how to ruin us all and i denounce them  a corner in pearls  well it was darned cute said the captain impartially  now mr jones harvey and mr logan sir what have you to say  did mr jenkinsi think you said that this gentlemans name is jenkinssee the agent engaged in making this corner in pearls or learn his name asked bude  he was an irish american one mccarthy answered jenkins sullenly  i am unacquainted with the gentleman said bude and i never employed any one for any such purpose  my visit to cagayan sulu was some years ago just after that of mr skertchley  captain funkal i have already acquainted you with the facts and you were kind enough to say that you accepted my statement  i did sir and i do answered the captain  as for you he went on mr professor jenkins when you found that your game was dangerous indeed likely to be ruinous to this scientific expedition and to the crew of the george washingtondamn you siryou should have dropped it  i dont know that i ever swore at a passenger before and i beg your pardon you two english gentlemen for so far forgetting myself  i dont know and these gentlemen dont know who made the corner but i dont think our citizens want either you or your exhibits  the whole population of the states sir not to mention the live stock cannot afford to go about wearing cocoanut pearls a precaution which would be necessary if i landed these venomous berbalangs of yours on our shores man and wife too likely to have a family of young berbalangs  snakes are not a patch on these darkeys and our coloured population at least would be busted up  the captain paused perhaps attracted by the chance of thus solving the negro problem  so ill tell you what it is gentlemen and professor jenkins ill turn back and land these two native exhibits and ill put you on shore professor jenkins at cagayan sulu  perhaps before a steamer touches therewhich is not once in a blue moonyoull have had time to write an exhaustive monograph on the berbalangs their manners and customs  jenkins who knew what awaited him threw himself on the floor at the feet of captain funkal  horrified by the abject distress of one who after all was their countryman bude and logan induced the captain to seclude jenkins in his cabin  they then by their combined entreaties prevailed on the officer to land the berbalangs on their own island indeed but to drop jenkins later on civilised shores  dawn saw the george washington and the pendragon in the port of cagayan sulu where the fetters of the two natives ill looking people enough were knocked off and they themselves deposited on the quay where not being popular they were received by a hostile demonstration  the two vessels then resumed their eastward course  the taxidermic appliances without which jones harvey never sailed and the services of his staff of taxidermists were placed at the disposal of his brother savants  by this means a stuffed mylodon a stuffed beathach stuffed fivehorned antelopes and a stuffed bunyip with a common gorilla and the toltec mummy now forever silent were passed through the new york custom house and consigned to the mccabe museum of natural varieties  the immense case that contained the discovery of jones harvey was also carefully conveyed to an apartment prepared for it in the same repository  the competitors sought their hotels teikipa marching beside logan and jones harvey  but by special arrangement either jones harvey or his maori ally always slept beside their mysterious case which they watched with passionate attention  two or three days were spent in setting up the stuffed exhibits  then the trustees through the yellow flag the paper founded by the late mr mccabe announced to the startled citizens the nature of the competition  on successive days the vast theatre of the mccabe museum would be open and each competitor in turn would display to the public his contribution and lecture on his adventures and on the variety of nature which he had secured  while the death of the animals was deplored nothing was said for obvious reasons about the causes of the catastrophe  the general excitement was intense  interviewers scoured the city and flocked to little purpose around the officials of the mccabe museum special trains were run from all quarters  the hotels were thronged america it was announced had taken hold of science and was just going to make science hum  on the first day of the exhibition dr hiram dodge displayed the stuffed mylodon  the agitation was unprecedented  america had bred in ancient days and an american citizen had discovered the monstrous yet amiable animal whence prehistoric patagonia drew her milk supplies and cheese stuffs  mr dodges adventures he modestly said could only be adequately narrated by mr rider haggard  unluckily the mylodon had not survived the conditions of the voyage the change of climates  the applause was thunderous  mr dodge gracefully expressed his obligations to his fair and friendly rival mr jones harvey who had loaned his taxidermic appliances  it did not appear to the public that the mylodon could be excelled in interest  the toltec mummy as he could no longer talk was flat on a falling market nor was mr rustlers narrative of its conversational powers accepted by the scepticism of the populace though it was corroborated by captain funkal professor dodge and professor wilkinson who swore affidavits before a notary within the hearing of the multitude  the beathach exhibited by professor potter was reckoned of high anatomical interest by scientific characters but it was not of american habitat and left the people relatively cold  on the other hand all the macleans and macdonnells of canada and nova scotia wept tears of joy at the corroboration of their tribal legends and the popularity of professor potter rivalled even that of mr ian maclaren  he was at once engaged by major pond for a series of lectures  the adventures of howard fry in the taking of his gorilla were reckoned interesting as were those of the captor of the bunyip but both animals were now undeniably dead  the people could not feed them with waffles and hominy cakes in the gardens of the institute  the savants wrangled on the anatomical differences and resemblances of the bunyip and the beathach still the critters were to the general mind only stuffed specimens though unique  the african fivehorned brutes though in quieter times they would have scored a triumph did not now appeal to the heart of the people  at last came the day when in the huge crowded amphitheatre with teiki pa by his side jones harvey addressed the congregation  first he exhibited a skeleton of a dinornis a bird of about twentyfive feet in height  now he went on thanks to the assistance of a maori gentleman my friend the tohunga teikipacheers teiki bows his acknowledgmentsi propose to exhibit to you this  with a touch on the mechanism he unrolled the valves of a gigantic incubator  within recumbent on cotton wool the almost frenzied spectators perceived two monstrous eggs like those of the roc of arabian fable  teikipa now chanted a brief psalm in his own language  one of the eggs rolled gently in its place then the other  a faint crackling noise was heard first from one then from the other egg  from each emerged the featherless head of a fowlthe species hitherto unknown to the american continent  the necks pushed forth then the shoulders then both shells rolled away in fragments and the spectators gazed on two fledgling moas  teikipa on inspection pronounced them to be cock and hen and in healthy condition  the breed he said could doubtless be acclimatised  the professors of the museum by jones harveys request then closely examined the chickens  there could be no doubt of it they unanimously asserted these specimens were living deinornithe which for scientific men is not a bad shot at the dual of deinornis  the american continent was now endowed through the enterprise of mr jones harvey not only with living specimens but with a probable breed of a species hitherto thought extinct  the cheering was led by captain funkal who waved the stars and stripes and the union jack  words cannot do justice to the scene  women fainted strong men wept enemies embraced each other  for details we must refer to the files of the yellow flag  a plebiscite to select the winner of the mccabe prize was organised by that journal  the moas bred and exhibited by mr jones harvey simply romped in by 1732901 votes the mylodon being a bad second thanks to the irish vote  bude telegraphed victory and miss mccabe by cable answered bully for us  the secret of these lovers was well kept  none who watches the fascinating countess of bude as she moves through the gilded saloons of mayfair guesses that her hand was once the prize of success in a scientific exploration  the identity of jones harvey remains a puzzle to the learned  for the rest a letter in which jenkins told the story of the berbalangs was rejected by the editor of nature and has not yet passed even the literary committee of the society for psychical research the classical authority on the berbalangs is still the paper by mr skertchley in the journal of the asiatic society of bengal  242the scientific gentlemen who witnessed the onslaught of the berbalangs have convinced themselves except jenkins that nothing of the sort occurred in their experience  the evidence of captain funkal is rejected as marine  teikipa decided to remain in new york as custodian of the moas  he occasionally obliges by exhibiting a few feats of native conjuring when his performances are attended by the elite of the city  he knows that his countrymen hold him in feud but he is aware that they fear even more than they hate the exmedicine man of his maori majesty  the generosity of bude and his countess heaped rewards on merton who vainly protested that his services had not been professional  the frequent appearance of new american novelists whose works sell 250000 copies in their first month demonstrate that mr mccabes scheme for raising the level of genius has been as satisfactory as it was original  genius is riz  but who cornered the muddy pearls in cagayan sulu  that secret is only known to lady bude her confessor and the irishamerican agent whom she employed  for she as we saw had got at the nature of poor jenkinss project and had acquainted herself with the wonderful properties of the pearls which she cornered  as a patriot she consoles herself for the loss of the other exhibits to her country by the reflection that berbalangs would have been the most mischievous of pauper immigrants  but of all this bude knows nothing     xi  adventure of the miserly marquis   i  the marquis consults gray and graham   few men were and perhaps no marquis was so unpopular as the marquis of restalrig logans maternal scotch cousin widely removed  he was the last of his family in the direct line and on his death almost all his vast wealth would go to nobody knew where  to be sure logan himself would succeed to the title of fastcastle which descends to heirs general but nothing worth having went with the title  logan had only the most distant memory of seeing the marquis when he himself was a little boy and the marquis gave him two sixpences  his relationship to his opulent though remote kinsman had been of no service to him in the struggle for social existence  it carried no expectations and did not afford the most shadowy basis for a post obit  there was no entail the marquis could do as he liked with his own  the jews may have been credulous in the time of horace logan said but now they insist on the most drastic evidence of prospective wealth no they wont lend me a shekel  events were to prove that other financial operators were better informed than the chosen people though to be sure their belief was displayed in a manner at once grotesque and painfully embarrassing  why the marquis was generally disliked we might explain historically if we were acquainted with the tale of his infancy early youth and adolescence  perhaps he had been betrayed in his affections and was taking it out of mankind in general  but this notion implies that the marquis once had some affections a point not hitherto substantiated by any evidence  perhaps heredity was to blame some unhappy blend of parentage  an ancestor at an unknown period may have bequeathed to the marquis the elements of his unalluring character  but the only ancestor of marked temperament was the festive logan of restalrig who conspired over his cups to kidnap a king laid out his plot on the lines of an italian novel and died without being detected  this heroic ancestor admitted that he hated arguments derived from religion and so far the marquis of restalrig was quite with him if the arguments bore on giving to the poor or indeed to any one  in fact the marquis was that unpopular character a miser  your miser may be looked up to in a way as an ideal votary of mammon but he is never loved  on his vast possessions mainly in coalfields he was even more detested than the ordinary run of capitalists  the cottages and farmhouses on his estates were dilapidated and insanitary beyond what is endurable  of his many mansions some were kept in decent repair because he drew many shillings from tourists admitted to view them  but his favourite abode was almost as ruinous as his cottages and an artist in search of a model for the domestic interior of the master of ravenswood might have found what he wanted at kirkburn the usual lair of this avaricious nobleman  it was a keep of the sixteenth century and looked as if it had never been papered or painted since queen marys time  but it was near the collieries and within its blackened walls and among its bleak fields and grimy trees lord restalrig chose to live alone with an old man and an old woman for his attendants  the woman had been his nurse it was whispered in the district that she was also his illegalaunt or perhaps even so to speak his illegal stepmother at all events she endured more than anybody but a scotch woman who had been his nurse in childhood would have tolerated  to keep her in his service saved him the cost of a pension which even the marquis people thought could hardly refuse to allow her  the other old servitor was her husband and entirely under her domination  both might be reckoned staunch in the old fashion to the name which logan only bore by accident his grandmother having wedded a kinless logan who had no demonstrable connection with the house of restalrig  any mortal but the marquis would probably have brought logan up as his heir for the churlish peer had no nearer connection  but the marquis did more than sympathise with the roman emperor who quoted after me the last day  the emperor only meant that after his time he did not care how soon earth and fire were mingled  the marquis on the other hand gave the impression that he once out of the way he ardently desired the destruction of the whole human race  he was not known ever to have consciously benefited man or woman  he screwed out what he might from everybody in his power and made no returns which the law did not exact even these as far as the income tax went he kept at the lowest figure possible  such was the distinguished personage whose card was handed to merton one morning at the office  there had been no previous exchange of letters according to the rules of the society and yet merton could not suppose that the marquis wished to see him on any but business matters  he wants to put a spoke in somebodys wheel thought merton but whose  he hastily scrawled a note for logan who as usual was late put it in an envelope and sealed it  he wrote on no account come in explanation later  then he gave the note to the office boy impressed on him the necessity of placing it in logans hands when he arrived and told the boy to admit the visitor  the marquis entered clad in rusty black not unlike a scotch peasants best raiment as worn at funerals  he held a dripping umbrella his boots were muddy his trousers had their frayed ends turned up  he wore a hard cruel red face with keen grey eyes beneath penthouses where age had touched the original tawny red with snow  merton bowing took the umbrella and placed it in a stand  youll not have any snuff asked the marquis  trevor had placed a few enamelled snuffboxes of the eighteenth century among the other costly bibelots in the rooms and by an unusual chance one of them actually did contain what the marquis wanted  merton opened it and handed it to the peer who after trying a pinch on his nostrils poured a quantity into his hand and thence into a little black mull made of horn which he took from his breast pocket  its good he said  better than i get at kirkburn  youll know who i am  his accent was nearly as broad as that of one of his own hinds and he sometimes used scottish words to mertons perplexity  every one has heard of the marquis of restalrig said merton  ay and little to his good ill be bound  i do not listen to gossip said merton  i presume though you have not addressed me by letter that your visit is not unconnected with business  no no no letters  i never was wasteful in postage stamps  but as i was in london to see the doctor for the edinburgh ones can make nothing of the casea kind of dwawmingi looked in at auld nicky maxwells  she gave me a good character of you and she is one to lippen to  and you make no charge for a first interview  merton vaguely conjectured that to lippen implied some sort of caress however he only said that he was obliged to miss maxwell for her kind estimate of his firm  gray and graham good scots names  youll not be one of the grahams of netherby though  the name of the firm is merely conventional a trading title said merton if you want to know my name there it is and he handed his card to the marquis who stared at it and apparently from motiveless acquisitiveness put it into his pocket  i dont like an alias he said  but it seems you are to lippen to  from the context merton now understood that the marquis probably wished to signify that he was to be trusted  so he bowed and expressed a hope that he was all that could be desired in the lippening way  youre laughing at my doric asked the nobleman  well in the only important way its not at my expense  ha  ha  he shook a lumbering laugh out of himself  merton smiledand was bored  im come about stopping a marriage said the marquis at last arriving at business  my experience is at your service said merton  well went on the marquis ours is an old name  merton remarked that in the course of historical study he had made himself acquainted with the achievements of the house  auld warld tales  but i wish i could tell where the treasure is that wily auld logan quarrelled over with the wizard laird of merchistoun logan would not implement the contracthalf profits  but my wits are wool gathering  he began to wander round the room looking at the mezzotints  he stopped in front of one portrait and said my aunt  merton took this for an exclamation of astonishment but later found that the lady after lawrence really had been the great aunt of the marquis  merton conceived that the wits of his visitor were worse than wool gathering that he had softening of the brain  but circumstances presently indicated that lord restalrig was actually suffering from a much less common disordersoftening of the heart  he returned to his seat and helped himself to snuff out of the enamelled gold box on which merton deemed it politic to keep a watchful eye  man im sweir reluctant to come to the point said lord restalrig  merton erroneously understood him to mean that he was under oath or vow to come to the point and showed a face of attention  im not the man i was  the doctors dont understand my casethey take awful feesbut i see they think ill of it  and that sets a body thinking  have you a taste of brandy in the house  as the visitors weatherbeaten ruddiness had changed to a ghastly ashen hue rather bordering on the azure merton set forth the liqueur case and drew a bottle of soda water  no water said the peer its just ma twal ours an auld scotch fashion and he took without winking an orthodox dram of brandy  then he looked at the silver tops of the flasks  a good coat he said  yours  merton nodded  ye quarter the douglas heart  a good coat  dod ill speak plain  the name mr merton when ye come to the end o the furrow the name is all ye have left  we brought nothing into the world but the name we take out nothing else  a sore dispensation  im not the man i was not this two years  i must dispone i know it well  now the name that i thought that i cared not an empty whistle for is worn to a rag but i cannot leave it in the mire  theres just one that bears it one logan by name and true logan by the mothers blood  the mothers mother my cousin was a bonny lass  he paused his enfeebled memory was wandering no doubt in scenes more vivid to him than those of yesterday  merton was now attentive indeed  the miserly marquis had become to him something other than a curious survival of times past  there was a chance for logan his friend the last of the name but logan was firmly affianced to miss markham of the cloak department at madame claudines and the marquis as he said had come about stopping a marriage and merton was to help him in stopping it in disentangling logan  the old man aroused himself  i have never seen the lad but once when he was a bairn  but ive kept eyes on him  he has nothing and since i came to london i hear that he has gone gyte i meanyell not understand mehe is plighted to a longlegged shoplass the daughter of a neerdowell australian landlouper a doctor  this must not be  now ill speak plain to you plainer than to tod and brock my doersye call them lawyers  they did not make my will  merton prevented himself by an effort from gasping  he kept a countenance of cold attention  but the marquis was coming to the point  i have left all to the name lands and rents and mines and money  but unless the lad marries in his own rank ill change my will  its in the hidie hole at kirkburn that logan built to keep king jamie in when he caught him  but the fool ruthvens marred that job and got their kail through the reek  im wandering  he helped himself to another dram and went on ye see what i want ye must stop that marriage  but said merton as you are so kindly disposed towards your kinsman this mr logan may i ask whether it would not be wise to address him yourself as the head of his house  he may surely he will listen to your objections  ye do not know the logans  merton concealed his smile  camstairy deevils  its in the blood  never once has he asked me for a pound never noticed me by word or letter  faith i wish all the world had been as considerate to auld restalrig  for me to say a word let be to make an offer would just tie him faster to the lass  tyne troth tyne a that is the old byeword  merton recognised his friend in this description but he merely shook a sympathetic head  very unusual he remarked  you really have no hope by this method  none at all or i would not be here on this daft ploy  theres no fool like an auld fool and faith i hardly know the man i was  but they cannot dispute the will  i drew doctors to witness that i was of sound and disponing mind and ive since been thrice to kirk and market  lord how they stared to see auld restalrig in his pew that had not smelt appleringie these forty years  merton noted these words which he thought curious and obscure  your case interests me deeply he said and shall receive my very best attention  you perceive of course that it is a difficult case mr logans character and tenacity being what you describe  i must make careful inquiries and shall inform you of progress  you wish to see this engagement ended  and the lad on with a lass of his rank said the marquis  probably that will follow quickly on the close of his present affection it usually does in our experience said merton adding am i to write to you at your london address  no sir these london hotels would ruin the cunzie the mint  merton wondered whether the cunzie was the title of some wealthy scotch peer  and im off for kirkburn by the night express  heres wishing luck and the old sinner finished the brandy  may i call a cab for youit still rains  no no ill travel by which the economical peer meant that he would walk  he then shook merton by the hand and hobbled downstairs attended by his adviser  did mr logan call merton asked the office boy when the marquis had trotted off  yes sir he said you would find him at the club  call a hansom said merton and put up the notice out  he drove to the club where he found logan ordering luncheon  hullo shall we lunch together logan asked  not yet i want to speak to you  nothing gone wrong  why did you shut me out of the office  where can we talk without being disturbed  try the smokingroom on the top storey said logan nobody will have climbed so high so early  they made the ascent and found the room vacant the windows looked out over swirling smoke and trees tossing in a wind of early spring  quiet enough said logan taking an armchair  now out with it  you make me quite nervous  a client has come with what looks a promising piece of business  we are to disentangle  a royal duke  no  you  a practical joke said logan  somebody pulling your leg as people say a most idiotic way of speaking  what sort of client was he or she well be even with them  the clients card is here said merton and he handed to logan that of the marquis of restalrig  you never saw him before are you sure it was the man asked logan staggered in his scepticism  a very good imitation  dressed like a farmer at a funeral  talked like all the kailyards  snuffed and asked for brandy and went and came walking in this weather  by jove it is my venerated cousin  and he had heard about me and miss   he was quite well informed  logan looked very grave  he rose and stared out of the window into the mist  then he came back and stood beside mertons chair  he spoke in a low voice  this can only mean one thing  only that one thing said merton dropping his own voice  what did you say to him  i told him that his best plan as the head of the house was to approach you himself  and he said  that it was of no use and that i do not know the logans  but you do  i think so  you think right  no not for all his lands and mines i wont  not for the name  not for the kingdoms of the earth said logan  it is a great refusal  i have really no temptation to accept said logan  i am not built that way  so what next  if the old boy could only see her  i doubt if that would do any good though of course if i were you i should think so  he goes north tonight  you cant take the lady to kirkburn  and you cant write to him  of course not said logan of course it would be all up if he knew that i know  there is this to be saidit is not a very pleasant view to takehe cant live long  he came to see some london specialistit is his heart i think  his heart     how fortune aristophanises    and how severe the fun of fate  quoted logan  the odd thing is said merton that i do believe he has a heart  i rather like him  at all events i think from what i saw that a sudden start might set him off at any moment or an unusual exertion  and he may go off before i tell him that i can do nothing with you  oh hang that said logan you make me feel like a beastly assassin  i only want you to understand how the land lies  merton dropped his voice again he has made a will leaving you everything  poor old cock  look here i believe i had better write and say that im awfully touched and obliged but that i cant come into his views or break my word and then you know he can just make another will  it would be a swindle to let him die and come into his property and then go dead against his wishes  but it would be all right to give me away i suppose and let him understand that i had violated professional confidence  only with a member of the firm  that is no violation  but then i should have told him that you were a member of the firm  im afraid you should  logan you have the ideas of a schoolboy  i had to be certain as to how you would take it though of course i had a very good guess  and as to what you say about the chances of his dying and leaving everything where he would not have left it if he had been sure you would act against his wishesi believe you are wrong  what he really cares about is the name  his ghost will put up with your disobedience if the name keeps its old place  do you see  perhaps you are right said logan  anyhow there is no such pressing hurry  one may bring him round with time  a curious old survival  i did not understand all that he said there was something about having been thrice at kirk and market since he made his will and something about not having smelled appleringie for forty years  what is appleringie  logan laughed  it is a sacred presbyterian herb  the people keep it in their bibles and it perfumes the churches  but look here  he was interrupted by the entrance of a page who handed to him a letter logan read it and laughed  i knew it they are sharp he said and handed the letter to merton  it was from a famous or infamous money lender offering princely accommodation on terms which mr logan would find easy and reasonable  they have nosed the appleringie you see he said  but i dont see said merton  why the hounds have heard that the old nobleman has been thrice to kirk lately  and as he had not been there for forty years they have guessed that he has been making his will  scots law has or used to have something in it about going thrice to kirk and market after making a willdisponing they call itas a proof of bodily and mental soundness so they have spotted the marquiss pious motives for kirkgoing and guessed that i am his heir  i say  logan began to laugh wildly  what do you say asked merton but logan went on hooting  i say he repeated it must never be known that the old lord came to consult us and here he was again convulsed  of course not said merton  but where is the joke  why dont you seeoh it is too goodhe has taken every kind of precaution to establish his sanity when he made his will  he told me that he had got expert evidence said merton  and then he comes and consults us said logan with a crow of laughter if any fellow wants to break the will on the score of insanity and knows knows he came to us a jury when they find he consulted us will jolly well upset the cart  merton was hurt  logan he said it is you who ought to be in an asylum an asylum for incurable children  dont you see that he made the will long before he took the very natural and proper step of consulting messrs gray and graham  let us pray that if there is a suit it wont come before a scotch jury said logan  anyhow nobody knows that he came except you and me  and the office boy said merton  oh well square the office boy said logan  lets lunch  they lunched and logan as was natural though merton urged him to abstain hung about the doors of madame claudines emporium at the hour when the young ladies returned to their homes  he walked home with miss markham  he told her about his chances and his views and no doubt she did not think him a person of schoolboy ideas but a bayard  two days passed and in the afternoon of the third a telegram arrived for logan from kirkburn  come at once marquis very ill  dr douglas kirkburn  there was no express train north till 845 in the evening  merton dined with logan at kings cross and saw him off  he would reach his cousins house at about six in the morning if the train kept time  about nine oclock on the morning following logans arrival at kirkburn merton was awakened the servant handed to him a telegram  come instantly  highly important  logan kirkburn  merton dressed himself more rapidly than he had ever done and caught the train leaving kings cross at 10 am    ii  the emus feathers   the landscape through which merton passed on his northward way to kirkburn whither logan had summoned him was blank with snow  the snow was not more than a couple of inches deep where it had not drifted and as frost had set in it was not likely to deepen  there was no fear of being snowed up  merton naturally passed a good deal of his time in wondering what had occurred at kirkburn and why logan needed his presence  the poor old gentleman has passed away suddenly i suppose he reflected and logan may think that i know where he has deposited his will  it is in some place that the marquis called the hidie hole and that from his vagrant remarks appears to be a secret chamber as his ancestor meant to keep james vi there  i wish he had cut the throat of that prince a bad fellow  but of course i dont know where the chamber is probably some of the people about the place know or the lawyer who made the will  however freely mertons consciousness might play round the problem he could get no nearer to its solution  at berwick he had to leave the express and take a local train  in the station not a nice station he was accosted by a stranger who asked if he was mr merton  the stranger a wholesome redfaced blackhaired man on being answered in the affirmative introduced himself as dr douglas of kirkburn  you telegraphed to my friend logan the news of the marquiss illness said merton  i fear you have no better news to give me  dr douglas shook his head  a curious little crowd was watching the pair from a short distance  there was an air of solemnity about the people which was not wholly due to the chill grey late afternoon and the melancholy sea  we have an hour to wait mr merton before the local train starts and afterwards there is a bit of a drive  it is cold we would be as well in the inn as here  the doctor beat his gloved hands together to restore the circulation  merton saw that the doctor wished to be with him in private and the two walked down into the town where they got a comfortable room the doctor ordering boiling water and the other elements of what he called a cheerer  when the cups which cheer had been brought and the men were alone the doctor said  it is as you suppose mr merton but worse  great heaven no accident has happened to logan asked merton  no sir and he would have met you himself at berwick but he is engaged in making inquiries and taking precautions at kirkburn  you do not mean that there is any reason to suspect foul play  the marquis i know was in bad health  you do not suspectmurder  no sir butthe marquis is gone  i know he is gone your telegram and what i observed of his health led me to fear the worst  but his body is gonevanished  you suppose that it has been stolen you know the american and other cases of the same kind for the purpose of extracting money from the heir  that is the obvious view whoever the heir may be  so far no will has been found the doctor added some sugar to his cheerer and some whisky to correct the sugar  the neighbourhood is very much excited  mr logan has telegraphed to london for detectives  merton reflected in silence  the obvious view is not always the correct one he said  the marquis was at least i thought that he was a very eccentric person  no doubt about that said the doctor  very well  he had reasons such reasons as might occur to a mind like his for wanting to test the character and conduct of mr logan his only living kinsman  what i am going to say will seem absurd to you butthe marquis spoke to me of his malady as a kind of dwawming i did not know what he meant at the time but yesterday i consulted the glossary of a scotch novel to dwawm i think is to lose consciousness  the doctor nodded  now you have read said merton the case published by dr cheyne of a gentleman colonel townsend who could voluntarily produce a state of dwawm which was not then to be distinguished from death  i have read it in the notes to aytouns scottish cavaliers said the doctor  now then suppose that the marquis waking out of such a state whether voluntarily induced which is very improbable or not thought fit to withdraw himself for the purpose of secretly watching from some retreat the behaviour of his heir if he has made mr logan his heir  is that hypothesis absolutely out of keeping with his curious character  no  its crazy enough if you will excuse me but for these last few weeks at any rate i would have swithered about signing a fresh certificate to the marquiss sanity  you did perhaps sign one when he made his will as he told me  i and dr gourlay and professor grant the doctor named two celebrated edinburgh specialists  but just of late i would not be so certain  then my theory need not necessarily be wrong  it cant but be wrong  first i saw the man dead  absolute tests of death are hardly to be procured of course you know that better than i do said merton  yes but i am positive or as positive as one can be in the circumstances  however that is not what i stand on  there was a witness who saw the marquis go  gohow did he go  he disappeared  the body disappeared  it did but you had better hear the witnesss own account i dont think a secondhand story will convince you especially as you have a theory  was the witness a man or a woman  a woman said the doctor  oh said merton  i know what you mean said the doctor  you think it suits your theory that the marquis came to himself and  and squared the female watcher interrupted merton she would assist him in his crazy stratagem  mr merton youve read ower many novels said the doctor lapsing into the vernacular  well your notion is not unthinkable nor pheesically impossible  shes a queer one jean bower that waked the corpse sure enough  however youll soon be on the spot and can examine the case for yourself  mr logan has no idea but that the body was stolen for purposes of blackmail  he looked at his watch  we must be going to catch the train if shes anything like punctual  the pair walked in silence to the station were again watched curiously by the public who appeared to treat the station as a club and after threequarters of an hour of slow motion and stoppages arrived at their destination drem  the doctors own man with a dogcart was in waiting  the marquis had neither machine nor horse the doctor explained  through the bleak late twilight they were driven past two or three squalid mining villages along a road where the ruts showed black as coal through the freezing snow  out of one village the lights twinkling in the windows they turned up a steep road which after a couple of hundred yards brought them to the old stone gate posts surmounted by heraldic animals  the late marquis sold the workediron gates to a dealer said the doctor  at the avenue gates so steep was the ascent both men got out and walked  you see the pits come up close to the house said the doctor as they reached the crest  he pointed to some tall chimneys on the eastern slope which sank quite gradually to the neighbouring german ocean but ended in an abrupt rocky cliff  is that a fishing village in the cleft of the cliffs  i think i see a red roof said merton  ay thats strutherwick a fishing village replied the doctor  a very easy place on your theory for an escape with the body by boat said merton  ay that is just it acquiesced the doctor  but asked merton as they reached the level and saw the old keep black in front of them what is that rope stretched about the lawn for it seems to go all round the house and there are watchers  dark figures with lanterns were visible at intervals as merton peered into the gathering gloom  the watchers paced to and fro like sentinels  the door of the house opened and a mans figure stood out against the lamp light within  is that you merton came logans voice from the doorway  merton answered and the doctor remarked mr logan will tell you what the ropes for  the friends shook hands the doctor having deposited mertons baggage pleaded an engagement and said goodbye among the thanks of logan  an old man a kind of silent caleb balderstone carried mertons light luggage up a black turnpike stair  ive put you in the turret it is the least dilapidated room said logan  now come in here  he led the way into a hall on the groundfloor  a great fire in the ancient hearth with its heavy heraldically carved stone chimneypiece lit up the desolation of the chamber  sit down and warm yourself said logan pushing forward a ponderous oaken chair with a high back and short arms  i know a good deal said merton his curiosity hurrying him to the point but first logan what is the rope on the stakes driven in round the house for  that was my first precaution said logan  i heard of theof what has happenedabout four in the morning and i instantly knocked in the stakeshard work with the frozen groundand drew the rope along to isolate the snow about the house  when i had done that i searched the snow for footmarks  when had the snow begun to fall  about midnight  i turned out then to look at the night before going to bed  and there was nothing wrong then  he lay on his bed in the lairds chamber  i had just left it  i left him with the watcher of the dead  there was a plate of salt on his breast  the housekeeper mrs bower keeps up the old ways  candles were burning all round the bed  a fearful waste he would have thought it poor old man  the devils  if i could get on their track said logan clenching his fist  you have found no tracks then  none  when i examined the snow there was not a footmark on the roads to the back door or the frontnot a footmark on the whole area  then the removal of the body from the bedroom was done from within probably the body is still in the house  certainly it has been taken out by no known exit if it has been taken out as i believe  i at once arranged relays of sentinelsmen from the coalpits  but the body is gone i am certain of it  a fishingboat went out from the village strutherwick before the dawn  it came into the little harbour after midnightsome nightwandering lover saw it enterand it must have sailed again before dawn  did you examine the snow near the harbour  i could not be everywhere at once and i was singlehanded but i sent down the old servingman john bower  he is stupid enough but i gave him a note to any fisherman he might meet  of course these people are not detectives  and was there any result  yes an odd one  but it confirms the obvious theory of bodysnatching of course fishers are early risers and they went trampling about confusedly  but they did find curious tracks  we have isolated some of them and even managed to carry off a couple  we dug round them and lifted them  a neighbouring laird mr maitland lent his icehouse for storing these and i had one laid down on the north side of this house to show you if the frost held  no icehouse or refrigerator here of course  let me see it now  logan took a lighted candlethe night was frosty without a windand led merton out under the black ivyclad walls  merton threw his greatcoat on the snow and knelt on it peering at the object  he saw a large flat clod of snow and earth  on its surface was the faint impress of a long oval longer than the human foot feathery marks running in both directions from the centre could be descried  looking closer merton detected here and there a tiny feather and a flock or two of down adhering to the frozen mass  may i remove some of these feathery things merton asked  certainly  but why  we cant carry the clod indoors it would melt and it may melt if the weather changes and by bad luck there may be no feathers or down adhering to the other clodsthose in the lairds icehouse  you think you have a clue  i think said merton that these are emus feathers but whether they are or not they look like a clue  still i think they are emus feathers  why  the emu is not an indigenous bird  as he spoke an ideaseveral ideasflashed on merton  he wished that he had held his peace  he put the little shreds into his pocketbook rose and donned his greatcoat  how cold it is he said  logan would you mind very much if i said no more just now about the feathers  i really have a notionwhich may be a good one or may be a silly oneand absurd as it appears you will seriously oblige me by letting me keep my own counsel  it is damned awkward said logan testily  ah old boy but remember that damned awkward is a damned awkward expression  you are right said logan heartily but i rose very early im very tired im rather savage  lets go in and dine  all right said merton  i dont think said logan as they were entering the house that i need keep these miners on sentry go any longer  the birdthe body i meanhas flown  whoever the fellows were that made these tracks and however they got into and out of the house they have carried the body away  ill pay the watchers and dismiss them  all right said merton  i wont dress  i must return to town by the night train  no time to be lost  no train to be caught said logan unless you drive or walk to berwick from herewhich you cant  you cant walk to dunbar to catch the 1020 and i have nothing that you can drive  can i send a telegram to town  it is four miles to the nearest telegraph station but i dare say one of the sentinels would walk there for a consideration  no use said merton  i should need to wire in a cipher when i come to think of it and cipher i have none  i must go as early as i can to morrow  let us consult bradshaw  they entered the house  merton had a bradshaw in his dressingbag  they found that he could catch a train at 1049 am and be in london about 9 pm  how are you to get to the station asked logan  ill tell you how he went on  ill send a note to the inn at the place and order a trap to be here at ten  that will give you lots of time  it is about four miles  thank you said merton i see no better way  and while logan went to pay and dismiss the sentries and send a messenger a grandson of the old butler with the note to the innkeeper merton toiled up the narrow turnpike stair to the turret chamber  a fire had been burning all day and in firelight almost any room looks tolerable  there was a small four poster bed with slender columns a black old wardrobe and a couple of chairs one of the queer antiquated little dressingtables with many drawers and boxes and a tiny basin and there was a perfectly new tub which logan had probably managed to obtain in the course of the day mertons evening clothes were neatly laid out the shutters were closed curtains there were none in fact he had been in much worse quarters  as he dressed he mused  cursed spite thought he that ever i was born to be an amateur detective  and cursed be my confounded thirst for general information  why did i ever know what kurdaitcha and interlinia mean  if i turn out to be right oh shade of sherlock holmes what a pretty kettle of fish there will be  suppose i drop the whole affair  but ive been ass enough to let logan know that i have an idea  well we shall see how matters shape themselves  sufficient for the day is the evil thereof  merton descended the turnpike stair holding on to the rope provided for that purpose in old scotch houses  he found logan standing by the fire in the hall  they were waited on by the old man bower  by tacit consent they spoke while he was present of anything but the subject that occupied their minds  they had quite an edible dinnercockaleekie brandered haddocks and a pair of roasted fowls with a mysterious sweet which was called a hattit kit  it is an historical dish in this house said logan  a favourite with our ancestor the conspirator  the wine was old and good having been laid down before the time of the late marquis  in the circumstances logan said merton when the old serving man was gone you have done me very well  thanks to mrs bower our butlers wife said logan  she is a truly remarkable woman  she and her husband they are cousins are members of an ancient family our hereditary retainers  one of them laird bower was our old conspirators gobetween in the plot to kidnap the king of which you have heard so much  though he was an aged and ignorant man he kept the secret so well that our ancestor was never even suspected till his letters came to light after his death and after laird bowers death too luckily for both of them  so you see we can depend on it that this pair of domestics and their family were not concerned in this new abomination so far the robbery was not from within  i am glad to hear that said merton  i had invented a theory too stupid to repeat and entirely demolished by the footmarks in the snow a theory which hypothetically implicated your old housekeeper  to be sure it did not throw any doubt on her loyalty to the house quite the reverse  what was your theory  oh too silly for words that the marquis had been only in a trance had come to himself when alone with the old lady who the doctor said was watching in the room and had stolen away to see how you would conduct yourself  childish hypothesis  the obvious one bodysnatching is correct  this is very good port  if things had been as you thought possible jean bower was not the woman to balk the marquis said logan  but you must see her and hear her tell her own story  gladly said merton but first tell me yours  when i arrived i found the poor old gentleman unconscious  dr douglas was in attendance  about noon he pronounced life extinct  mrs bower watched or waked the corpse  i left her with it about midnight as i told you about four in the morning she aroused me with the news that the body had vanished  what i did after that you know  now you had better hear the story from herself  logan rang a handbell there were no other bells in the keep and asked the old servingman when he came to send in mrs bower  she entered a very aged woman dressed in deep mourning  she was tall her hair of an absolutely pure white her aquiline face was drawn her cheeks hollow her mouth almost toothless  she made a deep courtesy repeating it when logan introduced my friend mr merton  mrs bower logan said mr merton is my oldest friend and the marquis saw him in london and consulted him on private business a few days ago  he wishes to hear you tell what you saw the night before last  maybe as the gentleman is english hell hardly understand me my lord i have a landward tongue said mrs bower  i can interpret if mr merton is puzzled mrs bower but i think he will understand better if we go to the lairds chamber  logan took two lighted candles handing two to merton and the old woman led them upstairs to a room which occupied the whole front of the ancient peel or square tower round which the rest of the house was built  the room was nearly bare of furniture except for an old chair or two a bureau and a great old bed of state facing the narrow deep window and standing on a kind of dais or platform of three steps  the heavy old green curtains were drawn all round it  mrs bower opened them at the front and sides  at the back against the wall the curtains embroidered with the arms of restalrig remained closed  i sat here all the night said mrs bower watching the corp that my hands had streikit  the candles were burning a about him the saut lay on his breast only aefold o linen covered him  my back was to the window my face to his feet  i was crooning the auld dirgie if it does nae guid it does nae harm  she recited in a monotone     when thou frae here away art past       every nicht and all    to whinnymuir thou comest at last       and christ receive thy saul     if ever thou gavest hosen and shoon       every nicht and all    sit thee down and put them on       and christ receive thy saul  alas he never gave nane puir man said the woman with a sob  at this moment the door of the chamber slowly opened  the woman turned and gazed at it frowning her lips wide apart  logan went to the door looked into the passage closed the door and locked it the key had to be turned twice in the old fashion and worked with a creaking jar  i had crooned thae last words     and christ receive thy saul  when the door opened as ye saw it did the now  it is weel kenned that a corp canna lie still in a room with the door hafflins open  i rose to lock it the catch is crazy  i was backing to the door with my face to the feet o the corp  i saw them move backwards slow they moved and my heart stood still in my breist  then i sawhere she stepped to the head of the bed and drew apart the curtains which opened in the middlei saw the curtain was open and naething but blackness ahint it ye see my lord ahint the bedheid is the entrance o the auld secret passage  the stanes hae lang syne fallen in and closed it but my lord never would have the hole waed up  theres nae draught jean or nane to mention and i never was wastefu in needless repairs he aye said weel when i looked that way his face down to the chafts was within the blackness and aye draw drawing further ben  then i shame to say it a sair dwawm cam ower me i gae a bit chokit cry and i kenned nae mair till i cam to mysel a the candles were out and the chamber was mirk and lown  i heard the skirl o a passing train and i crap to the bed and the skirl kind o reminded me o living folk and i felt a ower the bed wi my hands  there was nae corp  ye ken that the enemy has power when a corp lies in a room and the door is hafflins closed whiles they sit up and grin and yammer  i hae kenned that  weel how long i had lain in the dwawm i canna say  the train that skirled maun hae been a coal train that rins by about halfpast three in the morning there was a styme o licht that streeled in at the open door frae a candle your lordship set on a table in the lobby the auld lord would hae nae lichts in the house after the ten hours  sae i got to the door and grippit to the candle and flew off to your lordships room and the rest ye ken  thank you very much mrs bower said logan  you quite understand merton dont you  i thoroughly understand your story mrs bower said merton  we need not keep you any longer mrs bower said logan  nobody need sit up for us you must be terribly fatigued  you wunna forget to rake out the ha fire my lord said the old lady i wush your lordship a sound sleep and you sir so she curtsied and went logan unlocking the door  and i was in london this morning said merton drawing a long breath  youre over tweed now old man answered logan with patriotic satisfaction  dont go yet said merton  you examined the carpet of the room no traces there of these odd muffled footcoverings you found in the snow  not a trace of any kind  the salt was spilt some of it lay on the floor  the plate was not broken  if they came in it would be barefoot said merton  of course the police left traces of official boots said logan  where are they nowthe policemen i mean  two are to sleep in the kitchen  they found out nothing  of course not  let me look at the hole in the wall  merton climbed on to the bed and entered the hole  it was about six feet long by four wide  stones had fallen in at the back and had closed the passage in a rough way indeed what extent of the floor of the passage existed was huddled with stones merton examined the sides of the passage which were mere rubble  have you looked at the floor beneath those fallen stones merton asked  no by jove i never thought of that said logan  how could they have been stirred without the old woman hearing the noise  how do you know they were there before the marquiss death asked merton adding this hole was not swept and dusted regularly  either the entrance is beneath me orthe enemy had poweras mrs bower says  you must be right said logan  ill have the stones removed tomorrow  the thing is clear  the passage leads to somewhere outside of the house  theres an abandoned coal mine hard by on the east nothing can be simpler  when once you see it said merton  come and have a whisky and soda said logan    iii  a romance of bradshaw   merton slept very well in the turret room  he was aroused early by noises which he interpreted as caused by the arrival of the london detectives  but he only turned round like the sluggard and slumbered till logan aroused him at eight oclock  he descended about a quarter to nine breakfast was at nine and he found logan looking much disturbed  they dont waste time said logan handing to merton a letter in an opened envelope  logans hand trembled  typewritten address london postmark said merton  to robert logan esq at kirkburn keep drem scotland  merton read the letter aloud there was no date of place but there were the words     march 6 245 pm    sirperhaps i ought to say my lord  what a fool the fellow is said merton  why  shows he is an educated man     you may obtain news as to the mortal remains of your kinsman the    late marquis of restalrig and as to his will by walking in the    burlington arcade on march 11 between the hours of three and half    past three pm  you must be attired in full mourning costume    carrying a glove in your left hand and a black cane with a silver    top in your right  a lady will drop her purse beside you  you will    accost her  here the letter which was typewritten ended  you wont said merton  never meet a blackmailer halfway  i wouldnt said logan  but look here  he gave merton another letter in outward respect exactly similar to the first except that the figure 2 was typewritten in the left corner  the letter ran thus     march 6 425 pm     siri regret to have to trouble you with a second communication    but my former letter was posted before a change occurred in the    circumstances  you will be pleased to hear that i have no longer the    affliction of speaking of your noble kinsman as the late marquis of    restalrig  oh my prophetic soul said merton i guessed at first that he was not dead after all  only catalepsy  he went on reading his lordship recovered consciousness in circumstances which i shall not pain you by describing  he is now doing as well as can be expected and may have several years of useful life before him  i need not point out to you that the conditions of the negotiation are now greatly altered  on the one hand my partners and myself may seem to occupy the position of players who work a double ruff at whist  we are open to the marquiss offers for release and to yours for his eternal absence from the scene of life and enjoyment  but it is by no means impossible that you may have scruples about outbidding your kinsman especially as if you did you would by the very fact become subject to perpetual blackmailing at our hands  i speak plainly as one man of the world to another  it is also a drawback to our position that you could attain your ends without blame or scandal your ends being of course if the law so determines immediate succession to the property of the marquis by merely pushing us with the aid of the police to a fatal extreme  we are therefore reluctantly obliged to conclude that we cannot put the marquiss life up to auction between you and him as my partners in the first flush of triumph had conceived  but any movement on your side against us will be met in such a way that the consequences both to yourself and your kinsman will prove to the last degree prejudicial  for the rest the arrangements specified in my earlier note of this instant dated 245 p m remain in force  merton returned the letter to logan  their faces were almost equally blank  let me think said merton  he turned and walked to the window  logan reread the letters and waited  presently merton came back to the fireside  you see after all this resolves itself into the ordinary dilemma of brigandage  we do not want to pay ransom enormous ransom probably if we can rescue the marquis and destroy the gang  but the marquis himself  oh he would never offer terms that they would accept said logan with conviction  but i would stick at no ransom of course  but suppose that i see a way of defeating the scoundrels would you let me risk it  if you neither imperil yourself nor him too much  never mind me i like it  and as for him they will be very loth to destroy their winning card  youll be cautious  naturally but as this place and the stations are sure to be watched as the trains are slow local and inconvenient and as thanks to the economy of the marquis you have no horses it will be horribly difficult for me to leave the house and get to london and to work without their spotting me  it is absolutely essential to my scheme that i should not be known to be in town and that i should be supposed to be here  ill think it out  in the meantime we must do what we can to throw dust in the eyes of the enemy  wire an identical advertisement to all the london papers ill write it  merton went to a table on which lay some writing materials and wrote     burlington arcade  silvertopped ebony stick  any offer made by the    other party will be doubled on receipt of that consignment uninjured    will meet the lady  traps shall be kept here till after the date you    mention  church brook  now said merton he will see that church brook is kirkburn and that you will be liberal  and he will understand that the detectives are not to return to london  you did not show them the letters  of course not till you saw them and i wont  and if nothing can be done before the eleventh why you must promenade in the burlington arcade  you see one weak point in your offers dont you  which  why suppose they do release the marquis how am i to get the money to pay double his offer  he wont stump up and recoup me  merton laughed  we must risk it he said  and in the changed circumstances the tin might be raised on a postobit  but he wont bid high you may double safely enough  on considering these ideas logan looked relieved  now he asked about your plan is it following the emus feather  merton nodded  but i must do it alone  the detectives must stay here now if i leave dressed as i am by the 1049 ill be tracked all the way  is there anybody in the country whom you can absolutely trust  yes theres bower the gardener the son of these two feudal survivals and there is his son  what is young bower  a miner in the collieries the mine is near the house  is he about my size  have you seen him  i saw him last night he was one of the watchers  is he near my size  a trifle broader otherwise near enough  what luck said merton adding well i cant start by the 1049  im ill  im in bed  order my breakfast in bed send mrs bower and come up with her yourself  merton rushed up the turnpike stair in two minutes he was undressed and between the sheets  there he lay reading bradshaw pages 670 671  presently there was a knock at the door and logan entered followed by mrs bower with the breakfast tray  merton addressed her at once  mrs bower we know that we can trust you absolutely  to the death sirme and mine  well i am not ill but people must think i am ill  is your grandson on the night shift or the day shift  laird is on the day shift sir  when does he leave his work  about six sir  that is good  as soon as he appears  ill wait for him at the pits mouth sir  thank you  you will take him to his house he lives with your son  yes sir with his father  make him change his working clothesbut he need not wash his face muchand bring him here  mr logan i mean lord fastcastle will want him  now mrs boweryou see i trust you absolutelywhat he is wanted for is this  i shall dress in your grandsons clothes i shall blacken my hands and face slightly and i must get to drem  have i time to reach the station by ten minutes past seven  by fast walking sir  mr logan and your grandsonyour grandson in my clotheswill walk later to your sons house as they find a chance unobserved say about eleven at night  they will stay there for some time  then they will be joined by some of the police who will accompany mr logan home again your grandson will go to his work as usual in the morning  that is all you quite understand  you have nothing to do but to bring your grandson here dressed as i said as soon as he leaves his work  oh wait a moment  is your grandson a teetotaller  hes like the other lads sir  all the better  does he smoke  yes sir  then pray bring me a pipe of his and some of his tobacco  and ah yes does he possess such a thing as an old greatcoat  his auld anes sair worn sir  never mind he had better walk up in it  he has a better one  yes sir  i think that is all said merton  you understand mrs bower that i am going away dressed as your grandson while your grandson dressed as myself returns to his house tonight and to work tomorrow  but it is not to be known that i have gone away  i am to be supposed ill in bed here for a day or two  you will bring my meals into the room at the usual hours and loganof course you can trust dr douglas  i do  then he had better be summoned to my sick bed here tomorrow  i may be so ill that he will have to call twice  that will keep up the belief that i am here  good idea said logan as the old woman left the room  what had i better do now  oh send your telegramsthe advertisementsto the london papers  they can go by the trap you ordered for me that i am too ill to go in  then you will have to interview the detectives take them into the lairds chamber and if they start my theory about the secret entrance being under the fallen stones let them work away at removing them  if they dont start it put them up to it anything to keep them employed and prevent them from asking questions in the villages  but merton i understand your leaving in disguise still why go first to edinburgh  the trains from your station to town do not fit  you can look  and merton threw bradshaw to logan who caught it neatly  when he had satisfied himself logan said the shops will be closed in edinburgh it will be after eight when you arrive  how will you manage about getting into decent clothes  i have my idea but as soon as you can get rid of the detectives come back here i want you to coach me in broad scots words and pronunciation i shall concoct imaginary dialogues  i say this is great fun  dod man aw m the lad thatll lairn ye the pronoonciation said logan and he was going  wait said merton sign me a paper giving me leave to treat about the ransom  and promise that if i dont reappear by the eleventh you wont negotiate at all  not likely i will said logan  merton lay in bed inventing imaginary dialogues to be rendered into scots as occasion served  presently logan brought him a little book named mansie waugh  that is our lingo here he said and merton studied the work carefully marking some phrases with a pencil  in about an hour logan reported that the detectives were at work in the secret passage  the lesson in the scots of the lothians began accompanied by sounds of muffled laughter  not for two or three centuries can the turret chamber at kirkburn have heard so much merriment  the afternoon passed in this course of instruction  merton was a fairly good mimic and logan felt at last that he could not readily be detected for an englishman  six oclock had scarcely struck when mrs bowers grandson was ushered into the bedroom  the exchange of clothes took place merton dressing as the young bower undressed  the detectives who had found nothing were being entertained by mrs bower at dinner  i know how the trap in the secret passage is worked said merton but you keep them hunting for it  had the worthy detectives been within earshot the yells of laughter echoing in the turret as the men dressed must have suggested strange theories to their imaginations  larks said merton as he blackened his face with coal dust  dismissing young bower who was told to wait in the hall merton made his final arrangements  you will communicate with me under cover to trevor he said  he took a curious mediaeval ring that he always wore from his ringer and tied it to a piece of string which he hung round his neck tucking all under his shirt  then he arranged his thick comforter so as to hide the back of his head and neck he had bitten his nails and blackened them with coal  logan i only want a bottle of whisky the cork drawn and loose in the bottle and a few dirty scotch one pound notes and oh has mrs bower a pack of cards  having been supplied with these properties and said farewell to logan merton stole downstairs walked round the house entered the kitchen by the back door and said to mrs bower grannie i maun be ganging  my grandson gentlemen said mrs bower to the detectives  then to her grandson she remarked hae theres a jeely piece for you and merton munching a round of bread covered with jam walked down the steep avenue he knew the house he was to enter the gardeners lodge and also that he was to approach it by the back way and go in at the back door  the inmates expected him and understood the scheme presently he went out by the door into the village street still munching at his round of bread  to such lads and lassies as hailed him in the waning light he replied gruffly explaining that he had a sair hoast that is a bad cough from which he had observed that young bower was suffering  he was soon outside of the village and walking at top speed towards the station several times he paused in shadowy corners of the hedges and listened there was no sound of pursuing feet  he was not being followed but of course he might be dogged at the station  the enemy would have their spies there if they had them in the village his disguise had deceived them  he ran whenever no passerby was in sight through the villages he walked whistling wull ye no come back again  he reached the station with three minutes to spare took a thirdclass ticket and went on to the platform  several people were waiting among them four or five roughlooking miners probably spies  he strolled towards the end of the platform and when the train entered leaped into a thirdclass carriage which was nearly full  turning at the door he saw the rough customers making for the same carriage  come on cried merton with a slight touch of intoxication in his voice come on billies a freens here and he cast a glance of affection behind him at the other occupants of the carriage  the roughs pressed in  i wont have it cried a testy old gentleman who was economically travelling by thirdclass there are only three seats vacant  the rest of the train is nearly empty  hi guard stationmaster hi  a freens here repeated merton stolidly taking his whisky bottle from his greatcoat pocket  two of the roughs had entered but the guard persuaded the other two that they must bestow themselves elsewhere  the old gentleman glared at merton who was standing up the cork of the bottle between his teeth as the train began to move  he staggered and fell back into his seat     we are na fou were no that fou  merton chanted directing his speech to the old gentleman     but just a wee drap in oor ee  the curse of scotland muttered the old gentleman whether with reference to alcohol or to robert burns is uncertain  the curse o scotland said merton thats the nine o diamonds  i hae the cairts on me maybe yed take a hand sir at beggar ma neebour or catch the ten  ye needna be feared a can pay gin i lose  he dragged out his cards and a handful of silver  the rough customers between whom merton was sitting began to laugh hoarsely  the old gentleman frowned  i shall change my carriage at the next station he said and i shall report you for gambling  a freens said merton as if horrified by the austere reception of his cordial advances  whas gaumlin  we mauna play billies till hes gane  an unco pernicketty auld carl thon ane he remarked sotto voce  but theres naething in the companys bylaws again refraishments merton added  he uncorked his bottle made a pretence of sucking at it and passed it to his neighbours the rough customers  they imbibed with freedom  the carriage was very dark the lamp moved like a moon in a wane as merton might have quoted in happier circumstances  the rough customers glared at him but his cap had a peak and he wore his comforter high  man yere the kind o lad i like said one of the rough customers  a freens said merton again applying himself to the bottle and passing it  ony ither gentleman tak a sook asked merton including all the passengers in his hospitable glance  nane o ye dry           oh fill yer ain glass          and let the jug pass    hoo dye ken but yer neighbours dry  merton carolled  thons no a scotch lilt remarked one of the roughs  a ken its irish said merton  but billie the whuskys scotch  the train slowed and the old gentleman got out  from the platform he stormed at merton  yere no an awakened character ma freend answered merton  gude nicht to ye  gie ma love to the gude wife and the weans  the train pursued her course  aw m saying billie aw m saying remarked one of the roughs thrusting his dirty beard into mertons face  weel be saying said merton  youre no lairdie bower ye ken ye haena the neb o him  and wha the deil said a was lairdie bower  aw m a lanerick man lairdies at hame wi a sair hoast answered merton  but yere wearing lairdie bowers auld big coat  and what for no  lairdie has anither coat a brawer yin and he lent me the auld yin because the nichts is cauld and i hae a hoast masel  div ye ken lairdie bower  ive been wi his auld faither and the lasses half the day but speakins awfu dry work  here merton repeated the bottle trick and showed symptoms of going to sleep his head rolling on to the shoulder of the rough  haud up man said the rough withdrawing the support  a freens here remarked merton drawing a dirty clay pipe from his pocket  hae ye a spunk  the rough provided him with a match and he killed some time while preston pans was passed in filling and lighting his pipe  yere a lanerick man asked the inquiring rough  ay a hamilton frae moss end  but im taking the play  ma auld tittie has deed and left me some siller merton dragged a handful of dirty notes out of his trousers pocket  ive been to see the auld bowers but lairdie was on the shift  and yere ganging to embro     when we cam into embro toon       we were a seemly sicht to see    ma luve was in the  i dinna mind what ma luve was in     and i masel in cramoisie  sang merton who had the greatest fear of being asked local questions about moss end and motherwell  i dinna ken what cramoisie is masel he added  hae a drink  man yere a bonny singer said the rough who hitherto had taken no hand in the conversation  ma faither was a precentor said merton and so in fact mr merton pere had for a short time beenof salisbury cathedral  they were approaching portobello where merton rushed to the window thrust half of his body out and indulged in the raucous and meaningless yells of the festive artisan  thus he tided over a rather prolonged wait but when the train moved on the inquiring rough returned to the charge  he was suspicious and also was drunk and obstinate with all the brainless obstinacy of intoxication  aw m sayin he remarked to merton youre no lairdie bower  hear till the man  aw m tammy hamilton o moss end in lanerick  aw m ganging to see ma jean           for day or night          ma fancys flight       is ever wi ma jean    ma bonny bonny flatfooted jean  sang merton gliding from the strains of robert burns into those of mr boothby  jeans a lanerick wumman he added shes in service in the pleasance  aw m ganging to my jo  yell a hae jos billies  aw m sayin the intoxicated rough persisted yere no a lanerick man  yere the english gentleman birkie that cam to kirkburn yestreen or else yere ane o the polis police  me ane o the polis  aw m askin the company div a look like a polisman  div a look like an english birkie or ane o the gentry  the other passengers decent people thus appealed to murmured negatives and shook their heads  merton certainly did not resemble a policeman an englishman or a gentleman  ye see naebody lippens to ye merton went on  man if we were na a freens a wad gie ye a jaud atween yer twa een  but yeve been drinking tak anither sook  the rough did not reject the conciliatory offer  the whiskeys low said merton holding up the bottle to the light but theres mair at embro station  they were now drawing up at the station  merton floundered out threw his arms round the necks of each of the roughs yelled to their companions in the next carriage to follow and staggered into the third class refreshment room  here he leaned against the counter and feebly ogled the attendant nymph  ma lonny bassie a mean ma bonny lassie he said gies five gills five o the auld kirk whisky  hoots man he heard one of the roughs remark to another  this fallas no the english birkie  english he canna be  but aiblins hes ane o oor ain polis said the man of suspicions  nane o oor polis has the gumption and him as fou as a fiddler  merton waving his glass swallowed its contents at three gulps  he then fell on the floor scrambled to his feet tumbled out and dashed his own whisky bottle through the window of the refreshment room  me ane o the polis he yelled and was staggering towards the exit when he was collared by two policemen attracted by the noise  he embraced one of them murmuring ma bonny jean and then doubled up his head lolling on his shoulder  his legs and arms jerked convulsively and he had at last to be carried off in the manner known as the frogs march by four members of the force  the roughs followed like chief mourners merton thought at the head of the attendant crowd  theres an end o your clash about the english gentleman merton heard the quieter of his late companions observe to the obstinate inquirer but hes a bonny singer  and noo wull ye tell me hoo were to win back to drem the nicht  dod well make a nicht ot said the other as merton was carried into the policestation  he permitted himself to be lifted into one of the cells and then remarked in the most silvery tones  very many thanks my good men  i need not give you any more trouble except by asking you if possible to get me some hot water and soap and to invite the inspector to favour me with his company  the men nearly dropped merton but finding his feet he stood up and smiled blandly  pray make no apologies he said  it is rather i who ought to apologise  hes no drucken and hes no scotch remarked one of the policemen  but hell pass the nicht here and maybe apologise to the baillie in the morning said another  oh pardon me you mistake me said merton  this is not a stupid practical joke  its no a very gude ane said the policeman  merton took out a handful of gold  i wish to pay for the broken window at once he said  it was a necessary part of the mise en scene of the stage effect you know  to call your attention  yell settle wi the baillie in the morning said the policeman  things were looking untoward  look here said merton i quite understand your point of view it does credit to your intelligence  you take me for an english tourist behaving as i have done by way of a joke or for a bet  thats it sir said the spokesman  well it does look like that  but which of you is the senior officer here  me sir said the last speaker  very well if you can be so kind as to call the officer in charge of the station or even one of senior standingthe higher the betteri can satisfy him as to my identity and as to my reasons for behaving as i have done  i assure you that it is a matter of the very gravest importance  if the inspector when he has seen me permits i have no objections to you or to all of you hearing what i have to say  but you will understand that this is a matter for his own discretion  if i were merely playing the fool you must see that i have nothing to gain by giving additional annoyance and offence  very well sir i will bring the officer in charge said the policeman  just tell him about my arrest and so on said merton  in a few minutes he returned with his superior  well my man whats a this aboot said that officer sternly  if you can give me an interview alone for five minutes i shall enlighten you said merton  the officer was a huge and stalwart man  he threw his eye over merton wait in the yaird he said to his minions who retreated rather reluctantly  weel speak up said the officer  it is the body snatching case at kirkburn said merton  do ye mean that yere an english detective  no merely a friend of mr logans who left kirkburn this evening  i have business to do for him in london in connection with the casebusiness that nobody can do but myselfand the house was watched i escaped in the disguise which you see me wearing and had to throw off a gang of ruffians that accompanied me in the train by pretending to be drunk  i could only shake them off and destroy the suspicions which they expressed by getting arrested  its a queer story said the policeman  it is a queer story but speaking without knowledge i think your best plan is to summon the chief of your detective department i need his assistance  and i can prove my identity to himto you if you like but you know best what is official etiquette  ill telephone for him sir  you are very obliging  all this is confidential you know  expense is no object to mr logan and he will not be ungrateful if strict secrecy is preserved  but of all things i want a wash  all right sir said the policeman and in a few minutes mertons head hands and neck were restored to their pristine propriety  no more kailyard talk for me he thought with satisfaction  the head of the detective department arrived in no long time  he was in evening dress  merton rose and bowed  whats your story sir the chief asked it has brought me from a dinner party at my own house  i deeply regret it said merton though for my purpose it is the merest providence  what do you mean sir  your subordinate has doubtless told you all that i told him  the chief nodded  do youi mean as an officialbelieve me  i would be glad of proof of your personal identity  that is easily given  you may know mr lumley the professor of toxicology in the university here  i have met him often on matters of our business  he is an old college friend of mine and can remove any doubts you may entertain  his wife is a tall woman luckily added merton to himself much to the chiefs bewilderment  mr lumleys word would quite satisfy me said the chief  very well pray lend me your attention  this affair  the body snatching at kirkburn asked the chief  exactly said merton  this affair is very well organised  your house is probably being observed  now what i propose is this  i can go nowhere dressed as i am  you will if you please first send a constable in uniform to your house with orders to wait till you return next i shall dress by your permission in any spare uniform you may have here and in that costume i shall leave this office and accompany you to your house in a closed cab  you will enter it bring out a hat and cloak come into the cab and i shall put them on leaving my policemans helmet in the cab which will wait  then minutes later the constable will come out take the cab and drive to any police office you please once within your house i shall exchange my uniform for any old evening suit you may be able to lend me and when your guests have departed you and i will drive together to professor lumleys where he will identify me  after that my course is perfectly clear and i need give you no further trouble  it is too complicated sir said the chief smiling  i dont know your name  merton said our hero and yours  macnab  i can lend you a plain suit of morning clothes from here and we dont want the stratagem of the constable  you dont even need the extra trouble of putting on evening dress in my house  how very fortunate said merton and in a quarter of an hour he was attired as a simple citizen and was driving to the house of mr macnab here he was merely introduced to the guestsit was a mens partyas a gentleman from england on business  the guests had too much tact to tarry long and by eleven oclock the chief and merton were ringing at the door bell of professor lumley  the servant knew both of them and ushered them into the professors study  he was reading examination papers  mrs lumley had not returned from a party  lumley greeted merton warmly  i am passing through edinburgh and thought i might find you at home merton said  mr macnab said lumley shaking hands with the chief you have not taken my friend into custody  no professor mr merton will tell you that he is released and ill be going home  you wont stop and smoke  no i should be de trop answered the chief good night professor good night mr merton  but the broken window  oh well settle that and let you have the bill  merton gave his club address and the chief shook hands and departed  now what have you been doing merton asked lumley  merton briefly explained the whole set of circumstances and added now lumley you are my sole hope  you can give me a bed tonight  with all the pleasure in the world  and lend me a set of mrs lumleys raiment and a ladys portmanteau  are you quite mad  no but i must get to london undiscovered and for certain reasons with which i need not trouble you that is absolutely the only possible way  you remember at oxford i made up fairly well for female parts  is there absolutely no other way  none i have tried every conceivable plan mentally  mourning is best and a veil  at this moment mrs lumleys cab was heard returning from her party  run down and break it to mrs lumley said merton  luckily we have often acted together  luckily you are a favourite of hers said lumley  in ten minutes the pair entered the study  mrs lumley a tall lady as merton had said came in laughing and blushing  i shall drive with you myself to the train  my maid must be in the secret she said  she is an old acquaintance of mine said merton  but i think you had better not come with me to the station  nobody is likely to see me leaving your house about nine with my veil down  but if any one does see me he must take me for you  oh it is i who am running up to town incognita  for a day or twoyou will lend me a portmanteau to give local colour  with pleasure said mrs lumley  and lumley will telegraph to trevor to meet you at kings cross with his brougham at 615 p m  this also was agreed to and so ended this romance of bradshaw    iv  greek meets greek   at about twentyfive minutes to seven on march 7 the express entered kings cross  a lady of fashionable appearance with her veil down gazed anxiously out of the window of a reserved carriage  she presently detected the person for whom she was looking and waved her parasol trevor lifting his hat approached the lady had withdrawn into the carriage and he entered  mums the word said the lady  why itshang it all its merton  your sister is staying with you asked merton eagerly  yes but what on earth  ill tell you in the brougham  but you take a weight off my bosom  i am going to stay with you for a day or two and now my reputation or mrs lumleys is safe  your servants never saw mrs lumley  never said trevor  all right  my portmanteau has her initials s m l and a crimson ticket send a porter for it  now take me to the brougham  trevor offered his arm and carried the dressingbag the lady was led to his carriage  the portmanteau was recovered and they drove away  give me a cigarette said merton and ill tell you all about it  he told trevor all about itexcept about the emus feathers  but a male disguise would have done as well said trevor  not a bit  it would not have suited what i have to do in town  i cannot tell you why  the affair is complex  i have to settle it if i can so that neither logan nor any one elseexcept the bodysnatcher and polite letterwritershall ever know how i managed it  trevor had to be content with this reply  he took merton when they arrived into the smokingroom rang for tea and squared his sister as he said in the drawingroom  the pair were dining out and after a solitary dinner merton in a teagown occupied himself with literary composition  he put his work in a large envelope sealed it marked it with a st andrews cross and when trevor returned asked him to put it in his safe  two days after tomorrow if i do not appear you must open the envelope and read the contents he said  after luncheon on the following daya wet daymiss trevor and merton who was still arrayed as mrs lumley went out shopping  miss trevor then drove off to pay a visit merton could not let her know his next move and he himself his veil down took a fourwheeled cab and drove to madame claudines  he made one or two purchases and then asked for the head of the establishment an irish lady  to her he confided that he had to break a piece of distressing family news to miss markham of the cloak department that young lady was summoned madame claudine with a face of sympathy ushered them into her private room and went off to see a customer  miss markham was pale and trembling merton himself felt agitated  is it about my father or the girl asked  pray be calm said merton  sit down  both are well  the girl started  your voice she said  exactly said merton you know me  and taking off his glove he showed a curious mediaeval ring familiar to his friends  i could get at you in no other way than this he said and it was absolutely necessary to see you  what is it  i know it is about my father said the girl  he has done us a great service said merton soothingly  he had guessed what the distressing circumstances were in which the marquis had been restored to life  perhaps the reader guesses  a discreet person who has secretly to take charge of a corpse of pecuniary value adopts certain measures discovered by the genius of ancient egypt for its preservation  these measures doubtless had revived the marquis who thus owed his life to his kidnapper  he has i think done us a great service merton repeated and the girls colour returned to her beautiful face that had been of marble  yet there are untoward circumstances merton admitted  i wish to ask you two or three questions  i must give you my word of honour that i have no intention of injuring your father  the reverse i am really acting in his interests  now first he has practised in australia  may i ask if he was interested in the aborigines  yes very much said the girl entirely puzzled  but she added he was never in the labour trade  blackbird catching said merton  no  but he had perhaps a collection of native arms and implements  yes a very fine one  among them were perhaps some curious native shoes made of emus feathersthey are called interlinia or by white men kurdaitcha shoes  i dont remember the name said miss markham but he had quite a number of them  the natives wear them to conceal their tracks when they go on a revenge party  mertons guess was now a certainty  the marquis had spoken of miss markhams father as a landlouping australian doctor  the footmarks of the feathered shoes in the snow at kirkburn proved that an article which only an australian or an anthropologist was likely to know of had been used by the bodysnatchers  merton reflected  should he ask the girl whether she had told her father what on the night of the marquiss appearance at the office logan had told her  he decided that this was superfluous of course she had told her father and the doctor had taken his measures and the body of the marquis accordingly  to ask a question would only be to enlighten the girl  that is very interesting said merton  now i wont pretend that i disguised myself in this way merely to ask you about australian curiosities  the truth is that in your fathers interests i must have an interview with him  you dont mean to do him any harm asked the girl anxiously  i have given you my word of honour  as things stand i do not conceal from you that i am the only person who can save him from a situation which might be disagreeable and that is what i want to do  he will be quite safe if he sees you asked the girl wringing her hands  that is the only way in which he can be safe i am afraid  you would not use a girl against her own father  i would sooner die where i sit said merton earnestly  surely you can trust a friend of mr loganswho by the bye is very well  oh oh cried the girl i read that story of the stolen corpse in the papers  i understand  it was almost inevitable that you should understand said merton  but then said the girl what did you mean by saying that my father has done you a great service  you are deceiving me  i have said too much  this is base miss markham rose her eyes and cheeks burning  what i told you is the absolute and entire truth said merton nearly as red as she was  then exclaimed miss markham this is baser yet  you must mean that by doing what you think he has done my father has somehow enabled robertmr loganto come into the marquiss property  perhaps the marquis left no will or the willis gone  and do you believe that mr logan will thank you for acting in this way  she stood erect her hand resting on the back of a chair indignant and defiant  in the first place i have a written power from mr logan to act as i think best  next i have not even informed myself as to how the law of scotland stands in regard to the estate of a man who dies leaving no will  lastly miss markham i am extremely hampered by the fact that mr logan has not the remotest suspicion of what i suspectedand now knowto be the truth as to the disappearance of his cousins body  i successfully concealed my idea from mr logan so as to avoid giving pain to him and you  i did my best to conceal it from you though i never expected to succeed  and now if you wish to know how your father has conferred a benefit on mr logan i must tell you though i would rather be silent  mr logan is aware of the benefit but will never if you can trust yourself suspect his benefactor  i can never never see him again the girl sobbed  time is flying said merton who was familiar in works of fiction with the situation indicated by the girl  can you trust me or not he asked my single object is secrecy and your fathers safety  i owe that to my friend to you and even as it happens to your father  can you enable me dressed as i am to have an interview with him  you will not hurt him  you will not give him up  you will not bring the police on him  i am acting as i do precisely for the purpose of keeping the police off him  they have discovered nothing  the girl gave a sigh of relief  your fathers only danger would lie in myfailure to return from my interview with him  against that i cannot safeguard him it is fair to tell you so  but my success in persuading him to adopt a certain course would be equally satisfactory to mr logan and to himself  mr logan knows nothing  absolutely nothing  i alone and now you know anything  the girl walked up and down in agony  nobody will ever know if i do not tell you how to find him she said  unhappily that is not the case  i only ask you so that it may not be necessary to take other steps tardy but certain and highly undesirable  you will not go to him armed  i give you my word of honour said merton  i have risked myself unarmed already  the girl paused with fixed eyes that saw nothing  merton watched her then she took her resolve  i do not know where he is living  i know that on wednesdays that is the day after tomorrow he is to be found at dr fogartys a private asylum a house with a garden in water lane hammersmith  it was the lane in which stood the home for destitute and decayed cats whither logan had once abducted rangoon the siamese puss  thank you said merton simply  and i am to ask for  ask first for dr fogarty  you will tell him that you wish to see the ertwa oknurcha  ah australian for the big man said merton  i dont know what it means said miss markham  dr fogarty will then ask have you the churinga  the girl drew out a slim gold chain which hung round her neck and under her dress  at the end of it was a dark piece of wood shaped much like a large cigar and decorated with incised concentric circles stained red  take that and show it to dr fogarty said miss markham detaching the object from the chain  merton returned it to her  i know where to get a similar churinga he said  keep your own  its absence if asked for might lead to awkward questions  thank you i can trust you said miss markham adding you will address my father as dr melville  again thanks and goodbye said merton  he bowed and withdrew  she is a good deal upset poor girl merton remarked to madame claudine who on going to comfort miss markham with tea found her weeping  merton took another cab and drove to trevors house  after dinner at which there were no guests and in the smokingroom trevor asked whether he had made any progress  everything succeeded to a wish said merton  you remember water lane  where logan carried the siamese cat in my cab said trevor grinning at the reminiscence  rather  i reconnoitred the place with logan  well on the day after tomorrow i have business there  not at the cats home  no but perhaps you might reconnoitre again  do you remember a house with high walls and spikes on them  i do said trevor but how do you know  you never were there  you disapproved of logans method in the case of the cat  i never was there i only made a guess because the house i am interested in is a private asylum  well you guessed right  what then  you might reconnoitre the ground tomorrowthe exits there are sure to be some towards waste land or market gardens  jolly said trevor  ill make up as a wanderer from suffolk looking for a friend in the slums semibargee kind of costume  that would do said merton  but you had better go in the early morning  a nuisance  why  because later you will have to get a gang of fellows to be about the house the day after when i pay my visit  fellows of our own sort or the police  neither  i thought of fellows of our own sort  they would talk and guess  better get some of ned mahonys gang asked trevor  mr mahony was an expugilist and a distinguished instructor in the art of selfdefence  he also was captain of a gang of chuckers out  yes said merton that is my idea  they will guess too but when they know the place is a private lunatic asylum their hypothesis is obvious  theyll think that a patient is to be rescued  that will be their idea  and the old trick is a good trick  cart of coals blocked in the gateway or with another cartthe bigger the betterin the lane  the men will dress accordingly  others will have stolen to the back and sides of the house you will in short stop the earths after i enter  your brougham after setting me down will wait in hammersmith road or whatever the road outside is  i may come asked trevor  in command as a coal carter  hooray said trevor and ill tell you what i wont reconnoitre as a bargee but as a servant out of livery sent to look for a cat at the home  and ill mistake the asylum for the home for cats and try to scout a little inside the gates  capital said merton  then later i want you to go to a curiosity shop near the museum he mentioned the street and look into the window  youll see a little brown piece of wood like this  merton sketched rapidly the piece of wood which miss markham wore under her dress  the man has several  buy one about the size of a big cigar for me and buy one or two other trifles first  the man knows me said trevor i have bought things from him  very good but dont buy it when any other customer is in the shop  and by the way take mrs lumleys portmanteauthe lock needs mendingto joness in sloane street to be repaired  one thing more i should like to add a few lines to that manuscript i gave you to keep in your safe  trevor brought the sealed envelope  merton added a paragraph and resealed it  trevor locked it up again  on the following day trevor started early did his scouting in water lane and settled with mr mahony about his gang of muscular young prize fighters  he also brought the native australian curiosity and sent mrs lumleys portmanteau to have the lock repaired  merton determined to call at dr fogartys asylum at four in the afternoon  the gang under trevor was to arrive half an hour later and to surround and enter the premises if merton did not emerge within half an hour  at four oclock exactly trevors brougham was at the gates of the asylum the footman rang the bell a porter opened a wicket and admitted a lady of fashionable aspect who asked for dr fogarty  she was ushered into his study her card louise 13  street was taken by the servant and dr fogarty appeared  he was a fair undecided looking man with blue wandering eyes and long untidy reddish whiskers  he bowed and looked uncomfortable as well he might  i have called to see the ertwa oknurcha dr fogarty said merton  oh lord said dr fogarty and murmured another of his lady friends adding i must ask miss have you the churinga  merton produced out of his muff the australian specimen which trevor had bought  the doctor inspected it  i shall take it to the ertwa oknurcha he said and shambled out  presently he returned  he will see you miss  merton found the redoubtable dr markham an elderly man clean shaven promptlooking with very keen dark eyes sitting at a writing table with a few instruments of his profession lying about  the table stood on an oblong space of uncarpeted and polished flooring of some extent  dr fogarty withdrew the other doctor motioned merton to a chair on the opposite side of the table  this chair was also on the uncarpeted space and merton observed four small brass plates in the parquet  arranging his draperies and laying aside his muff merton sat down slightly shifting the position of the chair  perhaps dr melville he said it will be more reassuring to you if i at once hold my hands up and he sat there and smiled holding up his neatly gloved hands  the doctor stared and his hand stole towards an instrument like an unusually long stethoscope which lay on his table  merton sat there hands up still smiling  ah the blowtube he said  very good and quiet  do you use urali  infinitely better at close quarters than the noisy old revolver  i see i have to do with a cool hand sir said the doctor  ah said merton  then let us talk as between man and man  he tilted his chair backwards and crossed his legs  by the way as i have no aaron and hur to help me to hold up my hands may i drop them  the attitude though reassuring is fatiguing  if you wont mind first allowing me to remove your muff said the doctor  it lay on the table in front of merton  by all means no gun in my muff said merton  in fact i think the whole pistol business is overdone and second rate  i presume that i have the honour to speak to mr merton asked the doctor  you slipped through the cordon  yes i was the intoxicated miner said merton  no doubt you have received a report from your agents  stupid fellows said the doctor  you are not flattering to me but let us come to business  how much  i need hardly ask said the doctor it would be an insult to your intelligence whether you have taken the usual precautions  merton whose chair was tilted threw himself violently backwards upsetting his chair and then scrambled nimbly to his feet  between him and the table yawned a square black hole of unknown depth  hardly fair dr melville said he picking up the chair and placing it on the carpet besides i have taken the ordinary precautions  the house is surroundedned mahonys lambsthe usual statement is in the safe of a friend  we must really come to the point  time is flying and he looked at his watch  i can give you twenty minutes  have you anything in the way of terms to propose asked the doctor filling his pipe  well first absolute secrecy  i alone know the state of the case  has mr logan no guess  not the faintest suspicion  the detectives when i left kirkburn had not even found the trap door you understand  you hit on its discovery through knowing the priests hole at oxburgh hall i suppose  the doctor nodded  you can guarantee absolute secrecy he asked  naturally the knowledge is confined to me you and your partners  i want the secrecy in mr logans interests and you know why  well said the doctor that is point one  so far i am with you  then to enter on odious details said merton had you thought of any terms  the old man was stiff said the doctor and your side only offered to double him in your advertisement you know  that was merely a way of speaking said merton  what did the marquis propose  well as his offer is not a basis of negotiation  certainly not said merton  five hundred he offered out of which we were to pay his fare back to scotland  both men laughed  but you have your own ideas said merton  i had thought of 15000l and leaving england  he is a multimillionaire the marquis  it is rather a pull said merton  now speaking as a professional man and on honour how is his lordship merton asked  speaking as a professional man he may live a year he cannot live eighteen months i stake my reputation on that  merton mused  ill tell you what we can do he said  we can guarantee the interest at a fancy rate say five per cent during the marquiss life which you reckon as good for a year and a half at most  the lump sum we can pay on his decease  the doctor mused in his turn  i dont like it  he may alter his will and thenwhere do i come in  of course that is an objection said merton  but where do you come in if you refuse  logan i can assure you i have read up the scots law since i came to town is the heir if the marquis dies intestate  suppose that i do not leave this house in a few minutes logan wont bargain with you we settled that and really you will have taken a great deal of trouble to your own considerable risk  you see the usual document my statement is lodged with a friend  there is certainly a good deal in what you say remarked the doctor  then to take a more cheerful view said merton i have medical authority for stating that any will made now or later by the marquis would probably be upset on the ground of mental unsoundness you know so logan would succeed in spite of a later will  the doctor smiled  that point i grant  well one must chance something  i accept your proposals  you will give me a written agreement signed by mr logan for the arrangement  yes i have power to act  then mr merton why in the world did you not let your friend walk in burlington arcade and see the lady  he would have been met with the same terms and could have proposed the same modifications  well dr melville first i was afraid that he might accidentally discover the real state of the case as i surmised that it existedthat might have led to family inconveniences you know  yes the doctor admitted i have felt that  my poor daughter a good girl sir  it wrung my heartstrings i assure you  i have the warmest sympathy with you said merton going on  well in the second place i was not sure that i could trust mr logan who has rather a warm temper to conduct the negotiations  thirdly i fear i must confess that i did what i have donewell for human pleasure  ah you are young said the doctor sighing  now said merton shall i sign a promise  we can call dr fogarty up to witness it  by the bye what about value received  shall we say that we purchase your ethnological collection  the doctor grinned and assented the deed was written signed and witnessed by dr fogarty who hastily retreated  now about restoring the marquis said merton  hes here of course it was easy enough to get him into an asylum  might i suggest a gag if by chance you have such a thing about you  to be removed of course when once i get him into the house of a friend  and the usual bandage over his eyes he must never know where he has been  you think of everything mr merton said the doctor  but how are you to account for the marquiss reappearance alive he asked  oh thateasily  my first theory which i fortunately mentioned to his medical attendant dr douglas in the train before i reached kirkburn was that he had recovered from catalepsy and had secretly absconded for the purpose of watching mr logans conduct  we shall make him believe that this is the fact and the old woman who watched him  plucky old woman said the doctor  will swear to anything that he chooses to say  well that is your affair said the doctor  now said merton give me a receipt for 750l we shall tell the marquis that we had to spring 250l on his original offer  the doctor wrote out stamped and signed the receipt  perhaps i had better walk in front of you down stairs he asked merton  perhaps it really would be more hospitable merton acquiesced  merton was ushered again into dr fogartys room on the ground floor presently the other doctor reappeared leading a bent and much muffled up figure who preserved total silencefor excellent reasons  the doctor handed to merton a sealed envelope obviously the marquiss will  merton looked closely into the face of the old marquis whose eyes dropping senile tears showed no sign of recognition  dr fogarty next adjusted a silken bandage over a wad of cotton wool which he placed on the eyes of the prisoner  merton then took farewell of dr melville alias markham he and dr fogarty supported the tottering steps of lord restalrig and they led him to the gate  tell the porter to call my brougham said merton to dr fogarty  the brougham was called and came to the gate evading a coalcart which was about to enter the lane  merton aided the marquis to enter and said home  a few rough fellows who were loitering in the lane looked curiously on  in half an hour the marquis his gag and the bandage round his eyes removed was sitting in trevors smokingroom attended to by miss trevor  it is probably needless to describe the simple and obvious process rather like that of the man the goose and the fox by which mrs lumley with her portmanteau left trevors house that evening to pay another visit while merton himself arrived in evening dress to dinner at a quarter past eight  he had telegraphed to logan entirely successful  come up by the 1130 tonight and bring mrs bower  the marquis did not appear at dinner  he was in bed and thanks to a sleeping potion slumbered soundly  he awoke about nine in the morning to find mrs bower by his bedside  eh marquis finely we have jinked them said mrs bower and she went on to recount the ingenious measures by which the marquis recovering from his dwawm had secretly withdrawn himself  i mind nothing of it jeanie my woman said the marquis  i thought i wakened with some deevil running a knife into me he might have gone further and i might have fared worse  he asked for money but faith we niffered long and came to no bargain  and a woman brought me away who was the woman  oh dreams said mrs bower  ye had another sair fit o the dwawming and we brought you here to see the london doctors  hoo could ony mortal speerit ye away let be it was the fairies and me watching you a the time  a fine gliff ye gied me when ye sat up and askit for sma yill small beer  i mind nothing of it replied the marquis  however mrs bower stuck to her guns and the marquis was or appeared to be resigned to accept her explanation  he dozed throughout the day but next day he asked for merton  their interview was satisfactory merton begged leave to introduce logan and the marquis quite broken down received his kinsman with tears and said nothing about his marriage  im a dying man he remarked finally but ill live long enough to chouse the taxes  his sole idea was to hand over in the old scottish fashion the main part of his property to logan inter vivos and then to live long enough to evade the deathduties  merton and logan knew well enough the unsoundness of any such proceedings especially considering the mental debility of the old gentleman  however the papers were made out  the marquis retired to one of his english seats after which event his reappearance was made known to the world  in his english home logan sedulously nursed him  a more generous diet than he had ever known before did wonders for the marquis though he peevishly remonstrated against every bottle of wine that was uncorked  he did live for the span which he deemed necessary for his patriotic purpose and peacefully expired his last words being nae grand funeral  public curiosity of course was keenly excited about the mysterious reappearance of the marquis in life  but the interviewers could extract nothing from mrs bower and logan declined to be interviewed  to paragraphists the mystery of the marquis was a two months feast like the case of elizabeth canning long ago  logan inherited under the marquiss original will and of course the exchequer benefitted in the way which lord restalrig had tried to frustrate  miss markham whose father is now the distinguished head of the ethnological department in an american museum did not persist in her determination never to see logan again  the beautiful lady fastcastle never allows her photograph to appear in the illustrated weekly papers logan or rather fastcastle does not unto this day know the secret of the emus feathers though later he sorely tried the secretiveness of merton as shall be shown in the following narrative     xii  adventure of the canadian heiress   i  at castle skrae   how vain a thing is wealth said merton  how little it can give of what we really desire while of all that is lost and longed for it can restore nothingexcept churchesand to do that ought to be made a capital offence  why do you contemplate life as a whole mr merton  why are you so moral  if you think it is amusing you are very much mistaken  isnt the scenery isnt the weather beautiful enough for you  i could gaze for ever at the unquiet bright atlantic plain the rocky isles those cliffs of basalt on either hand while i listened to the crystal stream that slips into the sea and waves the yellow fringes of the seaweed dont be melancholy or i go back to the castle  try another line  ah i doubt that i shall never wet one here said merton  as to the crystal stream what business has it to be crystal  that is just what i complain of  salmon and seatrout are waiting out there in the bay and they cant come up  not a drop of rain to call rain for the last three weeks  that is what i meant by moralising about wealth  you can buy half a county if you have the money you can take half a dozen rivers but all the millions of our host cannot purchase us a spate and without a spate you might as well break the law by fishing in the round pond as in the river  luckily for me alured does not much care for fishing said lady bude who was mertons companion  the countess had abandoned much to her lords regret the coloured and figurative language of her maiden days the american slang  now as may have been observed her style was of that polished character which can only be heard to perfection in circles socially elevated and intellectually culturedin that garden of the soulsto quote tennyson  the spot where merton and lady bude were seated was beautiful indeed they reclined on the short sea grass above a shore where long tresses of saffronhued seaweed clothed the boulders and the bright sea pinks blossomed  on their right the skrae now clearer than amber mingled its waters with the sea loch  on their left was a steep bank clad with bracken climbing up to perpendicular cliffs of basalt  these ended abruptly above the valley and the cove and permitted a view of the atlantic in which far away the isle of the lewis lay like a golden shield in the faint haze of the early sunset  on the other side of the sea loch whose restless waters ever rushed in or out like a rapid river with the change of tides was a small village of white thatched cottages the homes of fishermen and crofters  the neat crofts lay behind in oblong strips on the side of the hill  such was the scene of a character common on the remote west coast of sutherland  alured is no maniac for fishing luckily lady bude was saying  today he is cathunting  i regret it said merton i profess myself the friend of cats  he is only trying to photograph a wild cat at home in the hills they are very scarce  in fact he is jones harvey the naturalist again for the nonce not the sportsman said merton  it was as jones harvey that he said lady bude and blushing stopped  that he grasped the skirts of happy chance said merton  why dont you grasp the skirts mr merton asked lady bude  chance or rather lady fortune who wears the skirts would i think be happy to have them grasped  whose skirts do you allude to  the skirts short enough in the highlands of miss macrae said lady bude she is a nice girl and a pretty girl and a clever girl and after all there are worse things than millions  miss emmeline macrae was the daughter of the host with whom the budes and merton were staying at skrae castle on loch skrae only an easy mile and a half from the sea and the cove beside which merton and lady bude were sitting  there is a seal crawling out on to the shore of the little island said merton  what a brute a man must be who shoots a seal  i could watch them all dayon a day like this  that is not answering my question said lady bude  what do you think of miss macrae  i know what you think  can a humble person like myself aspire to the daughter of the greatest living millionaire  our host can do almost anything but bring a spate and even that he could do by putting a dam with a sluice at the foot of loch skrae a matter of a few thousands only  as for the lady her heart it is anothers it never can be mine  whose it is asked lady bude  is it not or do my trained instincts deceive me that of young blake the new poet  is she not the girl who gives to song what gold could never buy  he is as handsome as a man has no business to be  he uses belladonna for his eyes said lady bude  i am sure of it  well she does not know or does not mind and they are pretty inseparable the last day or two  that is your own fault said lady bude you banter the poet so cruelly  she pities him  i wonder that our host lets the fellow keep staying here said merton if mr macrae has a foible except that of the pedigree of the macraes who were here before the macdonalds or mackenzies and have come back in his person it is scientific inventions electric lighting and his new toy the wireless telegraph box in the observatory  you can see the tower from here and the pole with box on top  i dont care for that kind of thing myself but macrae thinks it paradise to get messages from the central news and the stock exchange up here fifty miles from a telegraph post  well yesterday blake was sneering at the whole affair  what is this wireless machine  explain it to me said lady bude  how can you be so cruel asked merton  why cruel  oh you know very well how your sex receives explanations  you have three ways of doing it  explain them  well the first way is if a man tries to explain what per cent means or the difference of odds on or odds against that is if they dont gamble they cast their hands desperately abroad and cry oh dont i never can understand  the second way is to sit and smile and look intelligent and think of their dressmaker or their children or their young man and then to say thank you you have made it all so clear  and the third way  the third way is for you to make it plain to the explainer that he does not understand what he is explaining  well try me how does the wireless machine work  then to begin with a simple example in ordinary life you know what telepathy is  of course but tell me  suppose jones is thinking of smith or rather of smiths sister  jones is dying or in a row in india  miss smith is in bayswater  she sees jones in her drawingroom  the thought of jones has struck a receiver of some sort in the brain say of miss smith  but miss smith may not see him somebody else may say her aunt or the footman  that is because the aunt or the footman has the properly tuned receiver in her or his brain and miss smith has not  i see so farbut the machine  that is an electric apparatus charged with a message  the message is not conducted by wires but is merely carried along on a new sort of waves hertz waves i think but that does not matter  they roam through space these waves and wherever they meet another machine of the same kind a receiver they communicate it  then everybody who has such a machine as mr macraes gets all mr macraes messages for nothing asked lady bude  they would get them said merton  but that is where the artfulness comes in  two italian magicians or electricians messrs gianesi and giambresi have invented an improvement suggested by a dodge of the indians on the amazon river  they make machines which are only in tune with each other  their machine fires off a message which no other machine can receive or tap except that of their customer say mr macrae the other receivers all over the world dont get it they are not in tune  it is as if jones could only appear as a wraith to miss smith and vice versa  how is it done  oh dont ask me  besides i fancy it is a trade secret the tuning theres one good thing about it you know how highland landscape is spoiled by telegraph posts  yes everywhere there is always a telegraph post in the foreground  well mr macrae had them when he was here first but he has had them all cut down bless him since he got the new dodge  he was explaining it all to blake and me and blake only scoffed would not understand showed he was bored  i think it delightful  what did mr blake say  oh his usual stuff  science is an expensive and inadequate substitute for poetry and the poetic gifts of the natural man who is still extant in ireland  he can flash his thoughts and any trifles of news he may pick up across oceans and continents with no machinery at all  what is done in khartoum is known the same day in cairo  what did mr macrae say  he asked why the cairo people did not make fortunes on the stock exchange  and mr blake  he looked a great deal but he said nothing  then as i said he showed that he was bored when macrae exhibited to us the machine and tried to teach us how it worked and the philosophy of it  blake did not understand it nor do i really but of course i displayed an intelligent interest  he didnt display any  he said that the telegraph thing only brought us nearer to all that a child of nature  he a child of nature with his belladonna  to all that a child of nature wanted to forget  the machine emitted a serpent of tape news of surrey v yorkshire and something about kaffirs and macrae was enormously pleased for such are the simple joys of the millionaire really a child of nature  some of them keep automatic hydraulic organs and beastly machines that sing  now macrae is not a man of that sort and he has only one motor up here and only uses that for practical purposes to bring luggage and supplies but the wireless thing is the apple of his eye  and blake sneered  he is usually very civil indeed almost grovelling to the father said lady bude  but i tell you for your benefit mr merton that he has no chance with the daughter  i know it for certain  he only amuses her now here you are clever  merton bowed  clever or you would not have diverted me from my question with all that science  you are not ill looking  spare my blushes said merton adding lady bude if you must be answered you are clever enough to have found me out  that needed less acuteness than you suppose said the lady  i am very sorry to hear it said merton  you know how utterly hopeless it is  there i dont agree with you said lady bude  merton blushed  if you are right he said then i have no business to be here  what am i in the eyes of a man like mr macrae  an adventurer that is what he would think me  i did think that i had done nothing said nothing looked nothing but having the chancewell i could not keep away from her  it is not honourable  i must go     i love her  merton turned away and gazed at the sunset without seeing it  lady bude put forth her hand and laid it on his  has this gone on long she asked  rather an old story said merton  i am a fool  that is the chief reason why i was praying for rain  she fishes very keen on it  i would have been on the loch or the river with her  blake does not fish and hates getting wet  you might have more of her company if you would not torment the poet so  the greeneyed monster jealousy is on your back  merton groaned  i bar the fellow anyhow he said  but in any case now that i know you have found me out i must be going  if only she were as poor as i am  you cant go tomorrow tomorrow is sunday said lady bude  oh i am sorry for you  cant we think of something  cannot you find an opening do something great  get her upset on the loch and save her from drowning  mr macrae dotes on her he would be grateful  yes i might take the pin out of the bottom of the boat said merton it is an idea  but she swims at least as well as i do  besideshardly sportsmanlike  lady bude tried to comfort him it is the mission of young matrons  he must not be in such a hurry to go away  as to mr blake she could entirely reassure him  it was a beautiful evening the lady was fair and friendly nature fragrant of heather and of the sea was hushed in a golden repose  the two talked long and the glow of sunset was fading the eyes of lady bude were a little moist and merton was feeling rather consoled when they rose and walked back towards skrae castle  it had been an ancient seat of the macraes a clan in relatively modern times say 1745 rather wild impoverished and dirty but mr macrae the great canadian millionaire had bought the old place with many thousands of acres where victual never grew  though a landlord in the highlands he was beloved for he was the friend of crofters as rent was no object to him and he did not particularly care for sport  he accepted the argument dear to the celt that salmon are ground game and free to all while the natives were allowed to use ancient flintlocked fusils on his black cocks  mr macrae was a thoroughly generous man and a tall cleanshaved graceful personage his public gifts were large  he had just given 500000l to oxford to endow chairs and students of psychical research while the rest of the million was bestowed on cambridge to supply teaching in elementary logic  his way of life was comfortable but simple except where the comforts of science and modern improvements were concerned  there were lifts or elevators now in the castle of skrae though blake always went by the old black corkscrew staircases holding on by the guiding rope after the poetical manner of our ancestors  on a knowe which commanded the castle in a manner that would have pained sir dugald dalgetty mr macrae had erected not a sconce but an observatory with a telescope that licked the lick thing as he said indeed it was his foible to see the americans and go one better and he spoke without tolerance of the late boss american millionaire the celebrated j p van huytens recently deceased     duke humphrey greater wealth computes    and sticks they say at nothing  sings the poet  mr macrae computed greater wealth than mr van huytens though avoiding ostentation he did not     wear a pair of golden boots    and silver underclothing  the late j p van huytens he regarded with moral scorn  this rival millionaire had made his wealth by the process apparently peaceful and horticultural of watering stocks and by the seemingly misplaced generosity of overcapitalising enterprises and grabbing side shows the nature of these and other financial misdemeanours merton did not understand  but he learned from mr macrae that thereby j p van huytens had scooped in the widow the orphan the clergyman and the colonel  the two men had met in the most exclusive circles of american society with the young van huytenses the daughter of the millionaire had even been on friendly terms but mr macrae retired to europe and put a stop to all that  to do so indeed was one of his motives for returning to the home of his ancestors the remote and inaccessible castle skrae the sportsmans guide to scotland says as to loch skrae railway to lairg then walk or hire fortyfive miles  the young van huytenses were not invited to walk or hire  van huytens had been ostentatious mr macrae was the reverse  his costume was of the simplest his favourite drink of which he took little was what humorists call the light wine of the country drowned in apollinaris water  his establishment was refined but not gaudy or luxurious and the chief sign of wealth at skrae was the great observatory with the laboratory and the surmounting pole with box on top as merton described the apparatus for the new kind of telegraphy in the basement of the observatory was lodged the hugest balloon known to history and a skilled expert was busied with novel experiments in aerial navigation  happily he could swim and his repeated descents into loch skrae did not daunt his soaring genius  above the basement of the observatory were rooms for bachelors a smoking room a billiardroom and a scientific library  the wireless telegraphy machine looking like two boxes one on the top of the other to the eye of ignorance was installed in the smokingroom and a wire to mr macraes own rooms informed him by ringing a bell it also rang in the smokingroom when the machine began to spread itself out in tape conveying the latest news  the machine communicated with another in the establishment of its vendors messrs gianesi giambresi  co in oxford street  thus the millionaire though residing nearly fifty miles from the nearest station at lairg was as well and promptly informed as if he dwelt in fleet street and he could issue without a moments procrastination his commands to sell and buy and to do such other things as pertain to the nature of millionaires  when we add that a steam yacht of great size and comfort doing an incredible number of knots an hour on the turbine system lay at anchor in the sea loch we have indicated the main peculiarities of mr macraes rural establishment  wealth though merton thought so poorly of it had supplied these potentialities of enjoyment but alas disease had decimated the grouse on the moors of course to decimate now means almost to extirpate and the crofters had increased the pleasures of stalking by making the stags excessively shy thus adding to the arduous enjoyment of the true sportsman  to castle skrae being such as we have described lady bude and merton returned from their sentimental prowl  they found miss macrae in a very short skirt of the macrae tartan trying to teach mr blake to play ping pong in the great hall  we must describe the young lady though her charms outdo the powers of the vehicle of prose  she was tall slim and graceful light of foot as a deer on the corrie  her hair was black save when the sun shone on it and revealed strands of golden brown it was simply arrayed and knotted on the whitest and shapeliest neck in christendom  her eyebrows were dark her eyes large and lucid     the greyest of things blue    the bluest of things grey  her complexion was of a clear pallor like the white rose beloved by her ancestors her features were all but classic with the charm of romance but what made her unique was her mouth  it was faintly upturned at the corners as in archaic greek art she had in the slightest and most gracious degree what logan describing her once called the aeginetan grin  this gave her an air peculiarly gay and winsome brilliant joyous and alert  in brief to use chaucers phrase     she was as wincy as a wanton colt    sweet as a flower and upright as a bolt  she was the girl who was teaching the poet the elements of pingpong  the poet usually missed the ball for he was averse to and unapt for anything requiring quickness of eye and dexterity of hand  on a seat lay open a volume of the poetry of the celtic renascence which blake had been reading to miss macrae till she used the vulgar phrase footle and invited him to be educated in pingpong  of these circumstances she cheerfully informed the newcomers adding that lord bude had returned happy having photographed a wild cat in its lair  did he shoot it asked blake  no  hes a sportsman said miss macrae  that is why i supposed he must have shot the cat answered blake  what is gaelic for a wild cat blake asked merton unkindly  like other modern celtic poets mr blake was entirely ignorant of the melodious language of his ancestors though it had often been stated in the literary papers that he was going to begin to take lessons  sans purr answered blake the celtic wild cat has not the servile accomplishment of purring  the words a little altered are the motto of the argyle and sutherland highlanders  this is the country of the wild cat  i thought the wild cat was a peculiarly american financial animal said merton  miss macrae laughed and the gong sounding by electricity the wire being connected with the greenwich observatory she ran lightly up the central staircase  lady bude had hurried to rejoin her lord merton and blake sauntered out to their rooms in the observatory blake with an air of fatigue and languor  learning pingpong easily asked merton  i have more hopes of teaching miss macrae the essential and intimate elements of celtic poetry said blake  one box of books i brought with me another arrived today  i am about to begin on my celtic drama of con of the hundred battles  have you the works of the ancient sennachie macfootle asked merton he was jealous and his usual urbanity was sorely tried by the irish bard  in short he was rude stupid too  however blake had his revenge after dinner on the roof of the observatory where the ladies gathered round him in the faint silver light looking over the sleeping sea  far away to the west he said lies the celtic paradise the isle of apples  american apples are excellent said merton but the beauty of the scene and natural courtesy caused miss macrae to whisper hush  the poet went on may i speak to you the words of the emissary from the lovely land  the mysterious female said merton brutally  dr hyde calls her a mysterious female  it is in his literary history of ireland  pray let us hear the poem mr merton said miss macrae attuned to the charm of the hour and the scene  she came to brans court said blake from the isle of apples and no man knew whence she came and she chanted to them  twentyeight quatrains no less a hundred and twelve lines said the insufferable merton  could you give us them in gaelic  the bard went on not noticing the interruption i shall translate     there is a distant isle    around which sea horses glisten    a fair course against the white swelling surge    four feet uphold it     feet of white bronze under it  white bronze whats that eh asked the practical mr macrae     glittering through beautiful ages    lovely land through the worlds age    on which the white blossoms drop  beautiful said miss macrae  there are twentysix more quatrains said merton  the bard went on     a beautiful game most delightful    they play  pingpong murmured merton  hush said lady bude  miss macrae turned to the poet     they play sitting at the luxurious wine    men and gentle women under a bush    without sin without crime  they are playing still blake added  unbeheld undisturbed  i verily believe there is no gael even now who would not in his heart of hearts let drift by him the elysiums of virgil dante and milton to grasp at the moy mell the apple isle of the unknown irish pagan  and then to play sitting at the luxurious wine     men and gentle women under a bush  it really cannot have been pingpong that they played at sitting bridge more likely said merton  and good wine needs no bush  the bard moved away accompanied by his young hostess who resented mertons cynicism  tell me more of that lovely poem mr blake she said  i am jangled and out of tune said blake wildly  the sassenach is my torture  let me take your hand it is cool as the hands of the foamfooted maidens ofofwhats the name of the place  was it clonmell asked miss macrae letting him take her hand  he pressed it against his burning brow  though you laugh at me said blake sometimes you are kind  i am upseti hardly know myself  what is yonder shape skirting the lawn  is it the daoine sidh  why do you call her the downy she  she is no more artful than other people  she is my maid elspeth mackay answered miss macrae puzzled they were alone separated from the others by the breadth of the roof  i said the daoine sidh replied the poet spelling the words  it means the people of peace  quakers  no the fairies groaned the misunderstood bard  do you know nothing of your ancestral tongue  do you call yourself a gael  of course i call myself a girl answered miss macrae  do you want me to call myself a young lady  the poet sighed  i thought you understood me he said  ah how to escape how to reach the undiscovered west  but columbus discovered it said miss macrae  the undiscovered west of the celtic hearts desire explained the bard the west below the waters  thither could we twain sail in the magic boat of bran  ah see the sky opens like a flower  indeed there was a sudden glow of summer lightning  that looks more like rain said merton who was standing with the budes at an opposite corner of the roof  i say merton asked bude how can you be so uncivil to that man  he took it very well  a rotter said merton  he has just got that stuff by heart the verse and a lot of the prose out of a book that i brought down myself and left in the smokingroom  i can show you the place if you like  do mr merton  but how foolish you are do be civil to the man whispered lady bude who shared his disbelief in blake and at that moment the tinkle of an electric bell in the smokingroom below reached the expectant ears of mr macrae  come down all of you he said  the wireless telegraphy is at work  he waited till they were all in the smokingroom and feverishly examined the tape  escape of de wet he read  disasters to the imperial yeomanry  strike of cigarette makers  great fire at hackney  there he exclaimed triumphantly  we might have gone to bed in london and not known all that till we got the morning papers tomorrow and here we are fifty miles from a railway station or a telegraph officeno were nearer inchnadampf  would that i were in the isle of apples mell moy far far from civilisation said blake  there shall be no grief there or sorrow so sings the minstrel of the wooing of etain  fresh flesh of swine banquets of new milk and ale shalt thou have with me then fair lady merton read out from the book he had been speaking of to the budes  jolly place the celtic paradise  fresh flesh of swine banquets of ale and new milk  quel luxe  is that the kind of entertainment you were offering me mr blake asked miss macrae gaily  mr blake she went on has been inviting me to fly to the undiscovered west beneath the waters in the magic boat of bran  did bran invent the submarine asked mr macrae and then the company saw what they had never seen before the bard blushing  he seemed so discomposed that miss macrae took compassion on him  never mind my father mr blake she said he is a very good highlander and believes in eachain of the hairy arm as much as the crofters do  have you heard of eachain mr blake  he is a spectre in full highland costume attached to our clan  when we came here first to look round we had only horses hired from edinburgh and a lowlandermark you a lowlanderto drive  he was in the stable one afternoonthe old stable we have pulled it downwhen suddenly the horses began to kick and rear  he looked round to the open door and there stood a huge highlander in our tartans with musket pistols claymore dirk skian and all and soft brogues of untanned leather on his feet  the coachman in a panic made a blind rush at the figure but behold there was nobody and a boy outside had seen no man  the horses were trembling and foaming  now it was a lowlander from teviotdale that saw the man and the crofters were delighted  they said the figure was the chief that fell at culloden come to welcome us back  so you must not despair of us mr blake and you that have the sight may see eachain yourself who knows  this happy turn of the conversation exactly suited blake  he began to be very amusing about magic and brownies and the downy she as miss macrae called the people of peace  the ladies presently declared that they were afraid to go to bed so they went miss macrae indicating her displeasure to merton by the coldness of her demeanour  the men who were rather dashed by the pleasant intelligence which the telegraph had communicated sat up smoking for a while and then retired in a subdued state of mind  next morning which was sunday merton appeared rather late at breakfast late and pallid  after a snatch of disturbed slumber he had wakened or seemed to waken fretting a good deal over the rusticity of his bearing towards blake and over his hopeless affair of the heart  he had vexed his lady  if he is good enough for his hosts he ought to be good enough for their guests thought merton  what a brute what a fool i am i ought to go  i will go  i ought not to take coffee after dinner i know i ought not and i smoke too much he added and finally he went to breathe the air on the roof  the night was deadly soft and still a slight mist hid the furthest verges of the seas horizon  behind it the summer lightning seemed like portals that opened and shut in the heavens revealing a glory without form and closing again  i dont wonder that these irish poets dreamed of isles of paradise out there     lands undiscoverable in the unheardof west    round which the strong stream of a sacred sea    runs without wind for ever  thought merton  chicago is the realisation of their dream  hullo there are the lights of a big steamer and a very low one behind it queer craft  merton watched the lights that crossed the sea when either the haze deepened or the fainter light on the smaller vessel vanished and the larger ship steamed on in a southerly direction  magic boat of bran thought merton  he turned and entered the staircase to go back to his room  there was a lift of course but equally of course there was nobody to manage it  merton who had a lighted bedroomcandle in his hand descended the spiral staircase at a turning he thought he saw with the tail of his eye a plaid draping a tall figure of a highlander disappear round the corner  nobody in the castle wore the kilt except the piper and he had not rooms in the observatory  merton ran down as fast as he could but he did not catch another view of the plaid and its wearer or hear any footsteps  he went to the bottom of the staircase opened the outer door and looked forth  nobody  the electric light from the open door of his own room blazed across the landing on his return  all was perfectly still and merton remembered that he had not heard the footsteps of the appearance  was it eachain he asked himself  do i sleep do i dream  he went back to bed and slumbered uneasily  he seemed to be awake in his room in broad light and to hear a slow drip drip on the floor  he looked up the roof was stained with a great dark splash of a crimson hue  he got out of bed and touched the wet spot on the floor under the blotch on the ceiling  his fingers were reddened with blood  he woke at the horror of it found himself in bed in the dark pressed an electric knob and looked at the ceiling  it was dry and white  i certainly have been smoking too much lately thought merton and switching off the light he slumbered again so soundly that he did not hear the piper playing round the house or the man who brought his clothes and hot water or the gong for breakfast  when he did wake he was surprised at the lateness of the hour and dressed as rapidly as possible  i wonder if i was dreaming when i thought that i went out on the roof and saw mountains and marvels said merton to himself  a queer thing the human mind he reflected sagely it occurred to him to enter the smokingroom on his way downstairs  he routed two maids who perhaps had slept too late and were hurriedly making the room tidy  the sun was beating in at the window and merton noticed some tiny glittering points of white metallic light on the carpet near the new telegraphic apparatus  i dont believe these lazy highland maries have swept the room properly since the electric machine was put up merton thought  he hastily seized and took to his chamber his book on old irish literature which was too clearly part of blakes celtic inspiration  merton wanted no more quatrains but he did mean to try to be civil  he then joined the party at breakfast he admitted that he had slept ill but when asked by blake disclaimed having seen eachain of the hairy arm and did not bore or bewilder the company with his dreams  miss macrae in sabbatical raiment was fresher than a rose and gay as a lark  merton tried not to look at her he failed in this endeavour    ii  lost   the day was sunday and merton who had a holy horror of news rejoiced to think that the telegraphic machine would probably not tinkle its bell for twentyfour hours  this was not the ideal of the millionaire  things happen intelligence arrives from the limits of our vast and desirable empire even on the day of rest  but the electric bell was silent  mr macrae from patriotic motives employed a highland engineer and mechanician so there was nothing to be got out of him in the way of work on the sabbath day  the millionaire himself did not quite understand how to work the thing  he went to the smokingroom where it dwelt and looked wistfully at it but was afraid to try to call up his correspondents in london  as for the usual manipulator donald mcdonald he had started early for the distant free kirk  an unionist minister intended to try to preach himself in and the majority of the congregation being of the old free kirk rock and averse to union with the united presbyterians intended to try to keep him out  they had a lad with the gift who would do the preaching fine and as there was no policestation within forty miles it seemed fairly long odds on the free kirk recalcitrants  however there was a resolute minority of crofters on the side of the minister and every chance of an ecclesiastical battle royal  accompanied by the stalker two keepers and all the gardeners armed with staves the engineer had early set out for the scene of brotherly amity and mr macrae had reluctantly to admit that he was cut off from his communications  merton who was with him in the smokingroom mentally absolved the highland housemaids  if they had not swept up the tiny glittering metallic points on the carpet before they had done so now  only two or three caught his eye  mr macrae avid of news accommodated himself in an armchair with newspapers of two or three days old from which he had already sucked the heart by aid of his infernal machine  the budes and blake with miss macrae an anglican had set off to walk to the catholic chapel some four miles away for crofting opinion was resolute against driving on the lords day  merton selfdenying and resolved did not accompany his lady he read a novel wrote letters and felt desolate  all was peace all breathed of the sabbath calm  very odd theres no call from the machine said mr macrae anxiously  it is sunday said merton  still they might send us something  they scarcely favoured us last sunday said merton  no and now i think of it not at all on the sunday before said mr macrae  i dare say it is all right  would a thunderstorm further south derange it asked merton adding there was a lot of summer lightning last night  that might be it these things have their tempers  but they are a great comfort  i cant think how we ever did without them said mr macrae as if these things were common in every cottage  wonderful thing science he added in an original way and merton who privately detested science admitted that it was so  shall we go to see the horses suggested mr macrae and they did go and stare as is usual on sunday in the country at the hindquarters of these noble animals  merton strove to be as much interested as possible in mr macraes stories of his fleet american trotters  but his heart was otherwhere  they will soon be an extinct species said mr macrae the motor has come to stay  merton was not feeling very well he was afraid of a cigarette mr macraes conversation was not brilliant and merton still felt as if he were under the wrath so well deserved of his hostess  she did not usually go to the catholic chapel to be sure in the conditions prevailing at the free kirk place of worship she had no alternative if she would not abstain wholly from religious privileges  but merton felt sure that she had really gone to comfort and console the injured feelings of blake  probably she would have had a little court of lordlings merton reflected not that mr macrae had any taste for them but everybody knew that what with the weather and the crofters and the grouse disease the sport at castle skrae was remarkably bad  so the party was tiny though a number of people were expected later and merton and the heiress had been on what as he ruefully reflected were very kind termsrather more than kind he had hoped or feared now and then merton saw that he had annoyed her and thrown her metaphorically speaking into the arms of the irish minstrel  all the better perhaps he thought ruefully  the poet was handsome enough to be one that limners loved to paint and ladies to look upon  he generally took chaff well and could give it as well as take it and there were hours when his sentiment and witchery had a chance with most women  but lady bude says there is nothing in it and women usually know he reflected well he must leave the girl and save his selfrespect  when nothing more in the way of pottering could be done at the stables when its proprietor had exhausted the pleasure of staring at the balloon in its hall and had fed the fowls he walked with merton down the avenue above the shrunken burn that whispered among its ferns and alders to meet the returning churchgoers  the budes came first together they were still they were always honeymooning  mr macrae turned back with lady bude merton walked with bude blake and miss macrae were not yet in sight  he thought of walking on to meet thembut no it must not be  blake owes you a rare candle merton said bude adding a great deal may be done or said in a long walk by a young man with his advantages and if you had not had your knife in him last night i do not think she would have accompanied us this morning to attend the ministrations of father mccoll  he preached in gaelic  that must have been edifying said merton wincing  the effect when one does not know the language and is within six feet of an energetic celt in the pulpit is rather odd said bude  but you have put your foot in it not a doubt of that  this appeared only too probable  the laggards arrived late for luncheon and after luncheon miss macrae allowed blake to read his manuscript poems to her in the hall and to discuss the prospects of the celtic drama afterwards fearing to hurt the religious sentiments of the highland servants by playing pingpong on sunday in the hall she instructed him elsewhere and clandestinely in that pastime till the hour of tea arrived  merton did not appear at the teatable  tired of this castle of indolence loathing blake afraid of more talk with lady bude eating his own heart he had started alone after luncheon for a long walk round the loch  the day had darkened and was deadly still the water was like a mirror of leaden hue the air heavy and sulphurous  these atmospheric phenomena did not gladden the heart of merton  he knew that rain was coming but he would not be with her by the foaming stream or on the black waves of the loch  climbing to the top of the hill he felt sure that a storm was at hand  on the east far away clibrig and suilvean of the double peak and the round top of ben more stood shadowy above the plain against the lurid light  over the sea hung the ragged rims of thunder far away veiling in thin shadow the outermost isles whose mountain crests looked dark as indigo  a few hot heavy drops of rain were falling as merton began to descend  he was soaked to the skin when he reached the door of the observatory and rushed up stairs to dress for dinner  a covered way led from the observatory to the castle so that he did not get drenched again on his return which he accomplished punctually as the gong for dinner sounded  in the drawingroom were the budes and mr macrae was nervously pacing the length and breadth of the room  they must have taken refuge from the rain somewhere lady bude was saying and they were obviously blake and the daughter of the house where were they  mertons heart sank with a foolish foreboding  i know the lady went on that they were only going down to the covewhere you and i were yesterday evening mr merton  it is no distance  a mile and a half is a good deal in this weather said merton and there is no cottage on this side of the sea loch  but they must have taken shelter he added he must not seem anxious  at this moment came a flash of lightning followed by a crack like that of a cosmic whiplash and a long reverberating roar of thunder  it is most foolish to have stayed out so late said mr macrae  any one could see that a storm was coming  i told them so i am really annoyed  every one was silent the rain fell straight and steady the gravel in front of the window was a series of little lakes pale and chill in the wan twilight  i really think i must send a couple of men down with cloaks and umbrellas said the nervous father pressing an electric knob  the butler appeared  are donald and sandy and murdoch about asked mr macrae  not returned from church sir said the butler  there was likely to be a row at the free kirk said mr macrae absently  you must go yourself benson with archibald and james  take cloaks and umbrellas and hurry down towards the cove  mr blake and miss macrae have probably found shelter on the way somewhere  the butler answered yes sir but he cannot have been very well pleased with his errand  merton wanted to offer to go anything to be occupied but bude said nothing and so merton did not speak  the four in the drawingroom sat chatting nervously there was nothing of course to be anxious about they told each other  the bolt of heaven never strikes the daughters of millionaires miss macrae was indifferent to a wetting and nobody cared tremulously about blake  indeed the words confound the fellow were in the minds of the three men  the evening darkened rapidly the minutes lagged by the clock chimed the halfhour threequarters nine oclock  mr macrae was manifestly growing more and more nervous merton forgot to grow more and more hungry  his tongue felt dry and hard he was afraid of he knew not what but he bravely tried to make talk with lady bude  the door opened letting the blaze of electric light from the hall into the darkling room  they all turned eagerly towards the door  it was only one of the servants  mertons heart felt like lead  mr benson has returned sir he would be glad if he might speak to you for a moment  where is he asked mr macrae  at the outer door sir in the porch  he is very wet  mr macrae went out the others found little to say to each other  very awkward muttered bude  they cannot have been climbing the cliffs surely  the bridge is far above the highest watermark of the burn in case they crossed the water said merton  lady bude was silent  mr macrae returned  benson has come back he said to say that he can find no trace of them  the other men are still searching  can they have had themselves ferried across the sea loch to the village opposite asked merton  emmiline had not the key of our boat said mr macrae i have made sure of that and not a man in the village would launch a boat on sunday  we must go and help to search for them said merton he only wished to be doing something anything  i shall not be a minute in changing my dress  bude also volunteered and in a few minutes having drunk a glass of wine and eaten a crust of bread they and mr macrae were hurrying towards the cove  the storm was passing by the time when they reached the seaside there were rifts of clear light in the sky above them  they had walked rapidly and silently the swollen stream roaring beneath them  it had rained torrents in the hills  there was nothing to be said but the mind of each man was busy with the gloomiest conjectures  these had to be far fetched for in a country so thinly peopled and so honest and friendly within a couple of miles at most from home on a sunday evening what conceivable harm could befall a man and a maid  can we trust the man was in mertons mind  if they have been ferried across to the village they would have set out to return before now he said aloud but there was no boat on the faint silver of the sea loch the cliffs are the likeliest place for an accident if there was an accident he considered with a pang  the cliffs might have tempted the lightfooted girl  in fancy he saw her huddled a ghastly heap the faint wind fluttering the folds of her dress at the bottom of the rocks she had been wearing a long skirt not her wont in the highlands it would be dangerous to climb in that she might have forgotten climbed and caught her foot and fallen  blake may have snatched at her and been dragged down with her merton thought  all the horrid fancies of keen anxiety flitted across his minds eye  he paused and made an effort over himself  there must be some other harmless explanation an adventure to laugh atfor blake and the girl  poor comfort that  the men who had been searching were scattered about the sides of the cove and distinguishing the newcomers gathered towards them  no they said they had found nothing except a little book that seemed to belong to mr blake  it had been discovered near the place where merton and lady bude were sitting on the previous evening  when found it was lying open face downwards  in the faint light merton could see that the book was full of manuscript poems the lines all blotted and run together by the tropical rain  he thrust it into the pocket of his ulster  merton took the most intelligent of the gillies aside  show me where you have searched he said  the man pointed to the shores of the cove they had also examined the banks of the burn and under all the trees clearly fearing that the lost pair might have been lightningstruck like the nymph and swain in popes poem  you have not searched the cliffs asked merton  no sir said the man  merton then went to mr macrae and suggested that the boat should be sent across the sea ferry to try if anything could be learned in the village  mr macrae agreed and himself went in the boat which was presently unmoored and pulled by two gillies across the loch that ran like a river with the outgoing tide  merton and bude began to search the cliffs merton could hear the hoarse pumping of his own heart  the cliffs base was deep in flags and bracken then the rocks began climbing to the foot of the perpendicular basaltic crag  the sky fortunately was now clear in the west and lent a wan light to the seekers  merton had almost reached the base of the cliff when in the deep bracken he stumbled over something soft  he stooped and held back the tall fronds of bracken  it was the body of a man the body did not stir  merton glanced to see the face but the face was bent round leaning half on the earth  it was blake  mertons guess seemed true  they had fallen from the cliffs  but where was that other body  merton yelled to bude  blake seemed dead or insensible  merton he was ashamed of it presently left the body of blake alone he plunged wildly in and out of the bracken still shouting to bude and looking for that which he feared to find  she could not be far off  he stumbled over rocks into rabbit holes he dived among the soaked bracken  below and around he hunted feverishly panting then he set his face to the sheer cliff to climb she might be lying on some higher ledge the shadow on the rocks was dark  at this moment bude hailed him  come down he cried she cannot be there  why not he gasped arriving at the side of bude who was stooping with a lantern in his hand over the body of blake which faintly stirred  look said bude lowering the lantern  then merton saw that blakes hands were bound down beside his body and that the cords were fastened by pegs to the ground  his feet were fastened in the same way and his mouth was stuffed full of wet seaweed bude pulled out the improvised gag cut the ropes turned the face upwards and carefully dropped a little whisky from his flask into the mouth  blake opened his eyes  where are my poems he asked  where is miss macrae shrieked merton in agony  damn the midges said blake his face was hardly recognisable from their bites  oh damn them all  he had fainted again  she has been carried off groaned merton  bude and he did all that they knew for poor blake  they rubbed his ankles and wrists they administered more whisky and finally got him to sit up  he scratched his hands over his face and moaned but at last he recovered full consciousness  no sense could be extracted from him and as the boat was now visible on its homeward track bude and merton carried him down to the cove anxiously waiting mr macrae  he leaped ashore  have you heard anything asked bude  they saw a boat on the loch about seven oclock said mr macrae coming from the head of it touching here and then pulling west round the cliff  they thought the crew sabbathbreakers from the lodge at alt garbh  whats that he cried at last seeing blake who lay supported against a rock his eyes shut  merton rapidly explained  it is as i thought said mr macrae resolutely  i knew it from the first  they have kidnapped her for a ransom  let us go home  merton and bude were silent they too had guessed as soon as they discovered blake  the girl was her fathers very life and they admired his resolution his silence  a gate was taken from its hinges cloaks were strewn on it and blake was laid on this ambulance  merton ventured to speak  may i take your boat sir across to the ferry and send the fishermen from the village to search each end of the loch on their side  it is after midnight he added grimly  they will not refuse to go it is monday  i will accompany them said bude with your leave mr macrae merton can search our side of the loch he can borrow another boat at the village in addition to yours  you at the castle can organise the measures for tomorrow  thank you both said mr macrae  i should have thought of that  thank you mr merton for the idea  i am a little dazed  there is the key of the boat  merton snatched it and ran followed by bude and four gillies to the little pier where the boat was moored  he must be doing something for her or go mad  the six men crowded into the boat and pulled swiftly away merton taking the stroke oar  meanwhile blake was carried by four gillies towards the castle the men talking low to each other in gaelic mr macrae walked silently in front  such was the mournful procession that lady bude ran out to meet  she passed mr macrae whose face was set with an expression of deadly rage and looked for bude  he was not there a gillie told her what they knew and with a convulsive sob she followed mr macrae into the castle  mr blake must be taken to his room said mr macrae  benson bring something to eat and drink  lady bude i deeply regret that this thing should have troubled your stay with me  she has been carried off mr blake has been rendered unconscious your husband and mr merton are trying nobly to find the track of the miscreants  you will excuse me i must see to mr blake  mr macrae rose bowed and went out  he saw blake carried to a bathroom in the observatory they undressed him and put him in the hot water  then they put him to bed and brought him wine and food  he drank the wine eagerly  we were set on suddenly from behind by fellows from a boat he said we saw them land and go up from the cove they took us in the rear they felled me and pegged me out  have you my poems  mr merton has the poems said mr macrae  what became of my daughter  i dont know i was unconscious  what kind of boat was it  an ordinary coble a country boat  what kind of looking men were they  rough fellows with beards  i only saw them when they first passed us at some distance  oh my head  oh damn how these bites do sting  get me some ammonia youll find it in a bottle on the dressingtable  mr macrae brought him the bottle and a handkerchief  that is all you know he asked  but blake was babbling some confusion of verse and prose his wits were wandering  mr macrae turned from him and bade one of the men watch him  he himself passed downstairs and into the hall where lady bude was standing at the window gazing to the north  indeed you must not watch lady bude said the millionaire  let me persuade you to take something and go to bed  i forget myself i do not believe that you have dined  he himself sat down at the table he ate and drank and induced lady bude to join him  now do let me persuade you to go back and to try to sleep said mr macrae gently  your husband is well accompanied  it is not for him that i am afraid said the lady who was in tears  i must arrange for the days work said the millionaire and lady bude sighed and left him  first he said aloud we must get the doctor from lairg to see blake over forty miles  he rang  benson he said to the butler order the tandem for seven  the yacht to have steam up at the same hour  breakfast at halfpast six  the millionaire then went to his own study where he sat lost in thought morning had come before the sound of voices below informed him that bude and merton had returned  he hurried down their faces told him all nothing he asked calmly  nothing  they had rowed along the loch sides touching at every cottage and landingplace  they had learned nothing  he explained his ideas for the day  if you will allow me to go in the yacht i can telegraph from lochinver in all directions to the police said bude  we can use the wireless thing said mr macrae  but if you would be so good you could at least see the local police and if anything occurred to you telegraph in the ordinary way  right said bude i shall now take a bath  you will stay with me mr merton said mr macrae  it is a dreadful country for men in our position said merton for the sake of saying something  police and everything so remote  it gave them their chance they have waited for it long enough i dare say  have you any ideas  they must have a steamer somewhere  that is why i have ordered the balloon to reconnoitre the sea from said mr macrae  but they have had all the night to escape in  i think they will take her to america to some rascally southern republic probably  i have thought of the outer islands said merton out behind the lewis and the long island  we shall have them searched said mr macrae  i can think of no more at present and you are tired  merton had slept ill and strangely on the night of saturday on sunday night of course he had never lain down  unshaven dirty with haggard eyes he looked as wretched as he felt  i shall have a bath and then please employ me it does not matter on what as long as i am at work foryou said merton  he had nearly said for her  mr macrae looked at him rather curiously  you are dying of fatigue he said  all your ideas have been excellent but i cannot let you kill yourself  ideas are what i want  you must stay with me today i shall be communicating with london and other centres by the giambresi machine i shall need your advice your suggestions  now do go to bed you shall be called if you are needed  he wrung mertons hand and merton crept up to his bedroom  he took a bath turned in and was wrapped in all the blessedness of sleep  before five oclock the house was astir  bude in the yacht steamed down the coast touching at lochinver and wherever there seemed a faint hope of finding intelligence  but he learned nothing  yachts and other vessels came and went on sundays of course more seldom and if the heiress had been taken straight to sea northwards or west round the butt of lewis by night there could be no chance of news of her returning bude learned that the local search parties had found nothing but the black ashes of a burned boat in a creek on the south side of the cliffs  there the captors of miss macrae must have touched burned their coble and taken to some larger and fleeter vessel  but no such vessel had been seen by shepherd fisher keeper or gillie  the grooms arrived from lairg in the tandem with the doctor and a rural policeman  bude had telegraphed to scotland yard from lochinver for detectives and to glasgow oban tobermory salen in fact to every place he thought likely with minute particulars of miss macraes appearance and dress all this merton learned from bude when long after luncheon time our hero awoke suddenly refreshed in body but with the ghastly blank of misery and doubt before the eyes of his mind  i wired said bude on the off chance that yesterdays storm might have deranged the wireless machine and by jove it is lucky i did  the wireless machine wont work not a word of message has come through it is jammed or something  i met donald macdonald who told me  have you seen our host yet  no said bude i was just going to him  they found the millionaire seated at a table his head in his hands  on their approach he roused himself  any news he asked bude who shook his head  he explained how he had himself sent various telegrams and mr macrae thanked him  you did well he said  some electric disturbance has cut us off from our london correspondent  we sent messages in the usual way but there has been no reply  you sent to scotland yard for detectives i think you said  i did  but unluckily what can london detectives do in a country like this said mr macrae  i told them to send one who had the gaelic said bude  it was well thought of said mr macrae but this was no local job every man for miles round has been examined and accounted for  i hope you have slept well mr merton he asked  excellently  can you not put me on some work if it is only to copy telegraphic despatches  but by the way how is blake  the doctor is still with him said mr macrae a case of concussion of the brain he says it is  but you go out and take the air you must be careful of yourself  bude remained with the millionaire merton sauntered out to look at the river running water drew him like a magnet  by the side of the stream on a woodland path he met lady bude  she took his hand silently in her right and patted it with her left  merton turned his head away  what can i say to you she asked  oh this is too horrible too cruel  if i had listened to you and not irritated her i might have been with her not blake said merton with keen selfrespect  i dont quite see that you would be any the better for concussion of the brain said lady bude smiling  oh mr merton you must find her i know how you have worked already  you must rescue her  consider this is your chance this is your opportunity to do something great  take courage  merton answered with a rather watery smile if i had logan with me  with or without lord fastcastle you must do it said lady bude  they saw mr macrae approaching them deep in thought and advanced to meet him  mr macrae asked lady bude suddenly have you had donald with you long  ever since he was a lad in canada answered the millionaire  i have every confidence in donalds ability and he was for half a year with gianesi and giambresi learning to work their system  donalds honesty it was clear he never dreamed of suspecting  merton blushed as he remembered that a doubt as to whether the engineer had been got at had occurred to his own mind  for a heavy bribe merton had fancied donald might have been induced perhaps by some stock exchange operator to tamper with the wireless centre of communication but from mr macraes perfect confidence he felt obliged to drop this attractive hypothesis  they dined at the usual hour and not long after dinner lady bude said goodnight while her lord who was very tired soon followed her example  merton and the millionaire paid a visit to blake whom they found asleep and the doctor having taken supper and accepted an invitation to stay all night joined the two other men in the smoking room  in answer to inquiries about the patient dr mactavish said its jist concussion slight concussion and nervous shoke  no that muckle the maiter wi him but a clour on the hairnspan and midge bites forbye the disagreeableness o being clamped doon for a wheen hours in a wat tussock o bracken  this diagnosis though not perfectly intelligible to merton seemed to reassure mr macrae  hes a bit concetty the chiel added the worthy physician and it may be a day or twa or he judges he can leave his bed  jist nervous collapse  but bless my soul whats thon  thon had brought mr macrae to his feet with a bound  it was the thrill of the electric bell which preluded to communications from the wireless communicator  the instrument began to tick and to emit its inscribed tape  thank heaven cried the millionaire now we shall have light on this mystery  he read the message stamped his foot with an awful execration and then recovering himself handed the document to merton the message is a disgusting practical joke he said  some one at the central agency is playing tricks with the instrument  am i to read the message aloud asked merton  it was rather a difficult question for the doctor was a perfect stranger to all present and the matters involved were of an intimate delicacy affecting the most sacred domestic relations  dr mactavish said mr macrae speaking as highlander to highlander these are circumstances are they not under the seal of professional confidence  the big doctor rose to his feet  they are sir but mr macrae i am a married man  this sad business of yours i say it with sorrow will be the talk of the world tomorrow as it is of the country side today  if you will excuse me i would rather know nothing and be able to tell nothing so ill take my pipe outside with me  not alone dont go alone dr mactavish said merton mr macrae will need his telegraphic operator probably  let me play you a hundred up at billiards  the doctor liked nothing better soon the balls were rattling while the millionaire was closeted alone with donald macdonald and the wireless thing  after one game of which he was the winner the doctor with much delicacy asked leave to go to bed  merton conducted him to his room and returning was hailed by mr macrae  here is the pleasant result of our communications he said reading aloud the message which he had first received     the seven hunters  august 9 747 pm     do not be anxious about miss macrae  she is in perfect health and    accompanied by three chaperons accustomed to move in the first    circles  the one question is how much  sorry to be abrupt but the    sooner the affair is satisfactorily concluded the better  a reply    through your gianesi machine will reach us and will meet with prompt    attention  a practical joke said merton  the melancholy news has reached town through budes telegrams and somebody at the depot is playing tricks with the instrument  i have used the instrument to communicate that opinion to the manufacturers said mr macrae but i have had no reply  what does the jester mean by heading his communication the seven hunters asked merton  the name of a real or imaginary publichouse i suppose said mr macrae  at this moment the electric bell gave its signal and the tape began to exude  mr macrae read the message aloud it ran thus  no good wiring to gianesi and giambresi at headquarters  you are hitched on to us and to nobody else  better climb down  what are your terms  this is infuriating said mr macrae  it must be a practical joke but how to reach the operators  let me wire tomorrow by the oldfashioned way said merton i hear that one need not go to lairg to wire  one can do that from inchnadampf much nearer  that is quicker than steaming to loch inver  thank you very much mr merton i must be here myself  you had better take the motortrouble dazes a mani forgot the motor when i ordered the tandem this morning  very good said merton  at what hour shall i start  we all need rest let us say at ten oclock  all right replied merton  now do pray try to get a good night of sleep  mr macrae smiled wanly i mean to force myself to read emma by miss austen till the desired effect is produced  merton went to bed marvelling at the selfcommand of the millionaire  he himself slept ill absorbed in regret and darkling conjecture  after writing out several telegrams for merton to carry the smitten victim of enormous opulence sought repose  but how vainly  between him and the pages which report the prosings of miss bates and mr woodhouse intruded visions of his daughter a captive perhaps crossing the atlantic perhaps hidden who knew in a shieling or a cavern in the untrodden wastes of assynt or of lord reays country  at last these appearances were merged in sleep    iii  logan to the rescue   as merton sped on the motor next day to the nearest telegraph station with mr macraes sheaf of despatches dr mactavish found him a very dull companion  he named the lochs and hills quinag suilvean ben mor he dwelt on the merits of the trout in the lochs he showed the melancholy improvements of the old duke he spoke of duchesses and of crofters of anglers and tourists he pointed to the ruined castle of the man who sold the great montroseor did not sell him  merton was irresponsive trying to think  what was this mystery  why did the wireless machine bring no response from its headquarters or how could practical jokers have intruded into the secret chambers of messrs gianesi and giambresi  these dreams or visions of his own on the night before miss macrae was takenwere they wholly due to tobacco and the liver  i thought i was awake said merton to himself when i was only dreaming about the crimson blot on the ceiling  was i asleep when i saw the tartans go down the stairs  i used to walk in my sleep as a boy  it is very queer  frae the top o ben mor the doctor was saying on a fine day they tell me with a glass you can pick up the seven hunters  eh what  i beg your pardon i am so confused by this wretched affair what did you say you can pick up  just the seven hunters said the doctor rather sulkily  and what are the seven hunters  just seven wee sma islandies ahint the butt of lewis  the maps ca them the flanan islands  mertons heart gave a thump  the first message from the gianesi invention was dated the seven hunters  here was a clue  are the islands inhabited asked merton  just wi wild goats and maybe fishers drying their fish  and three men in a lighthouse on one of them said the doctor  they now rushed up to the hotel and telegraph office of inchnadampf  the doctor after visiting the bar went on in the motor to lairg it was to return for merton who had business enough on hand in sending the despatches  he was thinking over the seven hunters  it might be probably was a blind or the kidnappers having touched there might have departed in any directionto iceland for what he knew  but the name the seven hunters was not likely to have been invented by a practical joker in london  if not the conspirators had really captured and kept to themselves mr macraes line of wireless communications  how could that have been done  merton bitterly regretted that his general information did not include electrical science  however he had first to send the despatches  in one mr macrae informed gianesi and giambresi of the condition of their instrument and bade them send another at once with a skilled operator and to look out for probable tamperers in their own establishment  this despatch was in a cypher which before he got the new invention and while he used the old wires mr macrae had arranged with the electricians  the words of the despatch were therefore peculiar and the highland lass who operated a girl of great beauty and modesty at first declined to transmit the message  its maybe no proper for a that i ken she urged and only by invoking a local person of authority and using the name of mr macrae very freely could merton obtain the transmission of the despatch  in another document mr macrae ordered more motors and a dozen bicycles as the nabob of old ordered more curricles  he also telegraphed to the home office the admiralty the hereditary lord high admiral of the west coast to messrs mcbrain of the steamers and to every one who might have any access to the control of marine police or information  he wired to the police at new york bidding them warn all american stations and to the leading new york newspapers knowing the energy and inquiring if imaginative character of their reporters  bude ought to have done all this on the previous day but budes ideas were limited  nothing however was lost as america is not reached in forty eight hours  the millionaire instructed scotland yard to warn all foreign ports and left them carteblanche as to the offer of a reward for the discovery of his missing daughter  he also put off all the guests whom he had been expecting at castle skrae  merton was amazed at the energy and intelligence of a paternal mind smitten by sudden grief  mr macrae had even telegraphed to every london newspaper and to the leading scottish and provincial journals no interviewers need apply  several hours were spent as may be imagined in getting off these despatches from a highland rural office and merton tried to reward the fair operator  but she declined to accept a present for doing her duty and expressed lively sympathy for the poor young lady who was lost  in a few days a diamondstudded watch and chain arrived for miss macturk  merton himself wired to logan imploring him in the name of friendship to abandon all engagements and come to inchnadampf  where kidnapping was concerned he knew that logan must be interested and might be useful but of course he could not invite him to castle skrae  meanwhile he secured rooms for logan at the excellent inn  lady fastcastle he knew was in england brooding over her firstborn the master of fastcastle  before these duties were performed the motor returned from lairg bearing the two london detectives one disguised as a gillie he was the detective who had the gaelic the other as a clergyman of the church of england  to merton he whispered that he was to be an early friend of mr macrae come to comfort him on the first news of his disaster  as to the other the gillie mr macrae was known to have been in want of an assistant to the stalker and duncan mackay of scotland yard had accepted the situation  merton approved of these arrangements they were such as he would himself have suggested  but i dont see what we can do sir said the clerical detective the rev mr williams except perhaps find out if it was a put up thing from within  merton gave him a succinct sketch of the events and he could see that mr williams already suspected donald macdonald the engineer  merton mr williams and the driver now got into the motor and were followed by the gilliedetective and a man to drive in a dogcart hired from the inn merton ordered all answers to telegrams to be sent by boys on bicycles  it was late ere he returned to castle skrae  there nothing of importance had occurred except the arrival of more messages from the wireless machine  they insisted that miss macrae was in perfect health but implored the millionaire to settle instantly lest anxiety for a fathers grief should undermine her constitution  mr williams had a long interview with mr macrae  it was arranged that he should read family prayers in the morning and evening  he left the church quarterly review and numbers of the expositor the guardian and the pilot in the hall with his great coat and on the whole his entry was very well staged  duncan mackay occupied a room at the keepers who had only eight children  mr williams asked if he might see mr blake he could impart religious consolation  merton carried this message in answer to which blake who was in bed very sulky and sleepy merely replied kick out the hellhound  merton was obliged to soften this rude message saying that unfortunately mr blake was of the older faith though he had expressed no wish for the ministrations of father mccoll  on hearing this mr williams merely sighed as the budes were present  he had been informed as to their tenets and had even expressed a desire to labour for their enlightenment by way of giving local colour  he had he said some stirring protestant tracts among his clerical properties mr macrae however had gently curbed this zeal so on hearing of blakes religious beliefs the sigh of mr williams was delicately subdued  dinnertime arrived  blake did not appear the butler said that he supported existence solely on dried toast and milk and sodawater  he was one of the people who keep a private clinical thermometer and he sent the bulletin that his temperature was 103  he hoped to come downstairs tomorrow  mr williams gave the party some news of the outer world  he had brought the scotsman and mr macrae had the gloomy satisfaction of reading a wildly inaccurate report of his misfortune correct news had not reached the press but deep sympathy was expressed the melancholy party soon broke up mr williams conducting family prayers with much unction after the budes had withdrawn  in a private interview with the millionaire merton told him how he had discovered the real meaning of the seven hunters whence the first telegram of the kidnappers was dated  neither man thought the circumstance very important  they would hardly have ventured to name the islands if they had any idea of staying there the millionaire said besides any heartless jester could find the name on a map  this was obvious but as lady bude was much to be pitied alone in the circumstances mr macrae determined to send her and bude on the yacht the flora macdonald to cruise round the butt of lewis and examine the islets  both bude and his wife were devoted to yachting and the isles might yield something in the way of natural history  next day wednesday the budes steamed away and there came many answers to the telegrams of mr macrae and one from logan to merton  logan was hard by cruising with his cousin admiral chirnside at the naval manoeuvres on the northeast coast  he would come to inchnadampf at once mr macrae heard from gianesi and giambresi  gianesi himself was coming with a fresh machine  mr macrae wished it had been giambresi whom he knew gianesi he had never met  condolences of course poured in from all quarters even the most exalted  the emperor of germany was most sympathetic  but there was no news of importance  several yachting parties had been suspected and examined three young ladies at oban applecross and tobermory had established their identity and proved that they were not miss macrae  all day the wireless machine was silent  mr williams was shown all the rooms in the castle and met blake who appeared at luncheon  blake was most civil  he asked for a private interview with mr macrae who inquired whether his school friend mr williams might share it  blake was pleased to give them both all the information he had though his head he admitted still rang with the cowardly blow that had stunned him  he was told of the discovery of the burned boat and was asked whether it had approached from east or west from the side of the atlantic or from the head of the sea loch  from kinlocharty he said from the head of the loch the landward side  this agreed with the evidence of the villagers on the other side of the sea loch  would he recognise the crew  he had only seen them at a certain distance when they landed but in spite of the blow on his head he remembered the black beard of one man and the red beard of another  to be sure they might shave off their beards yet these two he thought he could identify  speaking to miss macrae as the men passed them he had called one donald dubh or black and the other donald ban or fair they carried heavy shepherds crooks in their hands  their dress was lowland but they wore unusually broad bonnets of the old sort drooping over the eyes  blake knew no more except his anguish from the midges  he expressed his hope to be well enough to go away on friday he would retire to the inn at scourie and try to persevere with his literary work  mr macrae would not hear of this as if the miscreants were captured blake alone could have a chance of identifying them  to this blake replied that as long as mr macrae thought that he might be useful he was at his service  to merton blake displayed himself in a new light  he said that he remembered little of what occurred after he was found at the foot of the cliff  probably he was snappish and selfish he was suffering very much his head indeed was still bound up and his face showed how he had suffered  merton shook hands with him and said that he hoped blake would forget his own behaviour for which he was sincerely sorry  oh the chaff said blake  never mind i dare say i played the fool i have been thinking when my brain would give me leave as i lay in bed merton you are a trifle my senior and you know the world much better  i have lived in a writing and painting set where we talked nonsense till it went to our heads and we half believed it  and to tell you the truth the presence of women always sets me off  i am a humbug i do not know gaelic but i mean to work away at my drama for all that  this kind of shock against the realities of life sobers a fellow  blake spoke simply in an unaffected manly way  semel in saninivimus omnes said merton  nec lusisse pudet said blake and the rest of it  i know theres a parallel in the greek anthology somewhere  ill go and get my copy  he went into the observatory they had been sitting on a garden seat outside and merton thought to himself  he is not such a bad fellow  not many of your young poets know anything but french  blake seemed to have some difficulty in finding his anthology  at last he came out with rather a carried look as the scots say rather excited  here it is he said and handed merton the little volume of a tauchnitz edition open at the right page  merton read the epigram very neat and good he said  now merton said blake it is not usual is it for ministers of the anglican sect to play the spy  what in the world do you mean asked merton  oh i guess the rev mr williams  were you not told that his cure of souls is in scotland yard  i ought to have told you i thought our host would have done so what was the holy man doing  i was not told said blake i suppose mr macrae was too busy  so i was rather surprised when i went into my room for my book to find the clergyman examining my things and taking books out of one of my book boxes  good heavens exclaimed merton  what did you do  i locked the door of the room and handed mr williams the key of my despatch box  i have a few private trifles there i said the key may save you trouble  then i sat down and wrote a note to mr macrae and rang the bell and asked the servant to carry the note to his master  mr macrae came and i explained the situation and asked him to be kind enough to order the motor if he could spare it or anything to carry me to the nearest inn  i shall order it mr blake said mr macrae but it will be to remove this person whom i especially forbade to molest any of my guests  i dont know how i forgot to tell you who he is a detective the others were told  he confounded himself in excuses it was horribly awkward  horribly said merton  he rated the man for visiting his guests rooms without his knowledge  i dare say the parson has turned over all your things  merton blenched  he had some of the correspondence of the disentanglers with him rather private matter naturally  he had not the key of my despatch box said merton  he could open it with a quill i believe said blake  they doin novels  merton felt very uneasy  what was the end of it he asked  oh i said that if the man was within his duty the accident was only one of those which so singular a misfortune brings with it  i would stay while mr macrae wanted me  i handed over my keys and insisted that all my luggage and drawers and things should be examined  but mr macrae would not listen to me and forbade the fellow to enter any ofthe bedrooms  begad ill go and look at my own despatch box said merton  i shall sit in the shade said blake  merton did examine his box but could not see that any of the papers had been disarranged  still as the receptacle was full of family secrets he did not feel precisely comfortable  going out on the lawn he met mr macrae who took him into a retired place and told him what had occurred  i had given the man the strictest orders not to invade the rooms of any of my guests he said it is too odious  the rev mr williams being indisposed dined alone in his room that night so did blake who was still far from well  the only other incident was that donald macdonald and the new gillie duncan mackay were reported to be lying around in a frightfully dissolute state  donald was a sober man but mackay he explained next morning proved to be his long lost cousin hence the revel  mackay separately stated that he had made donald intoxicated for the purpose of eliciting any guilty secret which he might possess  but whisky had elicited nothing  on the whole the london detectives had not been entirely a success  mr macrae therefore arranged to send both of them back to lairg where they would strike the line and return to the metropolis  merton had casually talked of logan lord fastcastle to mr macrae on the previous evening and mentioned that he was now likely to be at inchnadampf  mr macrae knew something of logan and before he sped the parting detectives asked merton whether he thought that he might send a note to inchnadampf inviting his friend to come and bear him company merton gravely said that in such a crisis as theirs he thought that logan would be extremely helpful and that he was a friend of the budes perhaps he himself had better go and pick up logan and inform him fully as to the mysterious events  as mr gianesi was also expected from london on that day thursday to examine the wireless machine which had been silent mr macrae sent off several vehicles as well as the motor that carried the detectives  merton drove the tandem himself  merton found logan with his spanish bulldog bouncer loafing outside the hotel door at inchnadampf  he greeted merton in a state of suppressed glee the whole adventure was much to the taste of the scion of rostalrig  merton handed him mr macraes letter of invitation  come wont i come rather said logan  of course we must wait to rest the horses said merton  the motor has gone on to lairg carrying two detectives who have made a pretty foozle of it and it will bring back an electrician  what for asked logan  i must tell you the whole story said merton  let us walk a little waytoo many gillies and people loafing about here  they walked up the road and sat down by little loch awe the lochan on the way to altnagealgach  merton told all the tale beginning with his curious experiences on the night before the disappearance of miss macrae and ending with the dismissal of the detectives  he also confided to logan the importance of the matter to himself and entreated him to be serious  logan listened very attentively  when merton had ended logan said old boy you were the making of me you may trust me  serious it is  a great deal of capital must have been put into this business  a sprat to catch a whale said merton  you mean about nobbling the electric machine  how could that be done  thatand other things  i dont know how the machine was nobbled but it could not be done cheap  would you mind telling me your dreams again  merton repeated the story  logan was silent  do you see your way asked merton  i must have time to think it out said logan  it is rather mixed when was bude to return from his cruise to the seven hunters  perhaps tonight said merton  we cannot be sure  she is a very swift yacht the flora macdonald  ill think it all over bude may give us a tip  no more would logan say beyond asking questions which merton could not answer about the transatlantic past of the vanished heiress  they loitered back towards the hotel and lunched  the room was almost empty all the guests of the place were out fishing  presently the motor returned from lairg bringing mr gianesi and a large box of his electrical appliances  merton rapidly told him all that he did not already know through mr macraes telegrams  he was a reserved man rather young and beyond thanking merton said little but pushed on towards castle skrae in the motor  some other motors he said had arrived and were being detained at lairg  they came later  merton and logan followed in the tandem logan driving they had handed to gianesi a sheaf of telegrams for the millionaire  as to the objects of interest on the now familiar road merton enlightened logan who seemed as absentminded as merton had been when instructed by dr mactavish  as they approached the castle merton observed from a height the flora macdonald steaming into the sea loch  let us drive straight down to the cove and meet them he said  they arrived at the cove just as the boat from the yacht touched the shore  the budes were astonished and delighted to see their old friend logan and his dog bouncer a tawny black muzzled bowlegged hero was admired by lady bude  merton rapidly explained  now what tidings he asked  the party walked aside on the shore and bude swiftly narrated what he had discovered  they have been there he said  we drew six of the islets blank including the islet of the lighthouse  the men there had seen a large yacht two ladies and a gentleman from it had visited them  they knew no more  desert places the other isles are full of birds  on the seventh isle we found some highland fishermen from the lewis in a great state of excitement  they had only landed an hour before to pick up some fish they had left to dry on the rocks  they had no english but one of our crew had the gaelic and interpreted in scots  regular gaels they did not want to speak but i offered money gold let them see it  then they took us to a cave  do you know mackinnons cave in mull opposite iona  yes drive on said merton much interested  well inside it was pitched an empty corrugated iron house quite new and another on the further side outside the cave  i picked up this in the interior of the cave said lady bude  this was a golden hairpin of peculiar make  thats the kind of hairpin she wears said lady bude  by jove said merton and logan in one voice  but that was all said bude  there was no other trace except that plainly people had been coming and going and living there  they had left some empty bottles and two intact champagne bottles  we tasted it it was excellent  the lewis men who had not heard of the affair could tell nothing more except what is absurd that they had lately seen a dragon flying far off over the sea  a dragon volant did you ever hear such nonsense  the interpreter pronounced it draigon  he had not too much english himself  the highlanders are so delightfully superstitious said lady bude  logan opened his lips to speak but said nothing  i dont think we should keep mr macrae waiting said lady bude  if bude will take the reins said merton you and he can be at the castle in no time  we shall walk  excuse me a moment said logan  a word with you bude  he took bude aside uttered a few rapid sentences and then helped lady bude into the tandem  bude followed and drove away  is your secret to be kept from me asked merton  well old boy you never told me the mystery of the emus feathers secret for secret out with it how did the feathers help you if they did help you to find out my uncle the marquis  gifgaff as we say in berwickshire  out with your feathers and ill produce my dragon volant tail and all  merton was horrified  the secret of the emus feathers involved the father of lady fastcastle of his old friends wife in a very distasteful way  logan since his marriage had never shown any curiosity in the matter  his was a joyous nature no one was less of a selftormentor  well old fellow said merton keep your dragon and ill keep my emu  i wont keep him long i assure you said logan  only for a day or two i dare say then youll know sooner perhaps  but for excellent reasons i asked bude and lady bude to say nothing about the hallucination of these secondsighted highland fishers  i have a plan  i think we shall run in the kidnappers keep your pecker up  you shall be in it  with this promise and with logans jovial confidence he kept breaking into laughter as he went merton had to be satisfied though in no humour for laughing  im working up to my denouement  logan said  tremendously dramatic  you shall be on all through i am keeping the fat for you merton  it is no bad thing for a young man to render the highest possible services to a generous millionaire especially in the circumstances  youre rather patronising said merton a little hurt  no no said logan  i have played second fiddle to you often do let me take command this timeor at all events wait till you see my plot unfolded  then you can take your part or leave it alone or modify to taste  nothing can be fairer  merton admitted that these proposals were loyal and worthy of their old and tried friendship  un dragon volant flying over the empty sea said logan  the highlanders beat the world for fantastic visions and the islanders beat the highlanders  but look here am i too inquisitive  the night when we first thought of the disentanglers you said there wassomebody  but i understood that she and you were of one mind and that only parents and poverty were in the way  and now from what you told me this morning at inchnadampf it seems that there is no understanding between you and this lady miss macrae  there is none said merton  i tried to keep my feelings to myselfim ashamed to say that i doubt if i succeeded  any chance asked logan putting his arm in mertons in the old schoolboy way  i would rather not speak about it said merton  i had meant to go myself on the monday  then came the affair of sunday night and he sighed  then the somebody before was another somebody  yes said merton turning rather red  men have died and the worms have eaten them but not for love muttered logan    iv  the adventure of eachain of the hairy arm   on arriving at the castle logan and merton found poor mr macrae comparatively cheerful  bude and lady bude had told what they had gleaned and the millionaire recognising his daughters hairpin had all but broken down  lady bude herself had wept as he thanked her for this first trace this endearing relic of the missing girl and he warmly welcomed merton who had detected the probable meaning of the enigmatic seven hunters  it is to you he said mr merton that i owe the intelligence of my daughters life and probable comfort  lady bude caught mertons eye one of hers was slightly veiled by her long lashes  the telegrams of the day had only brought the usual stories of the fruitless examination of yachts and of hopes unfulfilled and clues that led to nothing  the outermost islets were being searched and a steamer had been sent to st kilda  at home mr gianesi had explained to mr macrae that he and his partner were forced reluctantly by the nature of the case to suspect treason within their own establishment in london a thing hitherto unprecedented  they had therefore installed a new machine in a carefully locked chamber at their place and mr gianesi was ready at once to set up a corresponding recipient engine at castle skrae  mr macrae wished first to remove the machine in the smokingroom but blake ventured to suggest that it had better be left where it was  the conspirators he said have made one blunder already by mentioning the seven hunters unless indeed that was intentional they may have meant to lighten our anxiety without leaving any useful clue  they may make another mistake in any case it is as well to be in touch with them  at this moment the smokingroom machine began to tick and emitted a message  it ran glad you visited the hunters  you see we do ourselves very well  hope you drank our health we left some bottles of champagne on purpose  no nasty feeling only a matter of business  do hurry up and come to terms  impudent dogs said mr macrae  but i think you are right mr blake we had better leave these communications open  mr gianesi agreed that blake had spoken words of wisdom  merton felt surprised at his practical common sense  it was necessary to get another pole to erect on the roof of the observatory with another box at top for the new machine but a flagstaff from the castle leads was found to serve the purpose and the rest of the day was passed in arranging the installation the new machine being placed in mr mertons own study before dinner was over mr gianesi who worked like a horse was able to announce that all was complete and that a brief message yours received all right had passed through from his firm in london  soon after dinner blake retired to his room his head was still suffering and he could not bear smoke  gianesi and mr macrae were in the castle mr macrae feverishly reading the newspaper speculations on the melancholy affair leading articles on science and crime the potentialities of both the perils of wealth and such other thoughts as occurred to active minds in fleet street  gianesis room was in the observatory but he remained with mr macrae in case he might be needed merton and logan were alone in the smokingroom where bude left them early  now merton said logan you are going to come on in the next scene have you a revolver  heaven forbid said merton  well i have  now this is what you are to do  we shall both turn in about twelve and make a good deal of clatter and talk as we do so  you will come with me into my room  ill hand you the revolver loaded silently while we talk fishing shop with the door open  then you will go rather noisily to your room bang the door take off your shoes and slip out againabsolutely noiselesslyback into the smokingroom  you see that window in the embrasure here next the door looking out towards the loch  the curtain is drawn already you will go on the windowseat and sit tight  dont fall asleep  i shall give you my portable electric lamp for reading in the train  you may find it useful  only dont fall asleep  when the row begins i shall come on  i see said merton  but look here  suppose you slip out of your own room locking the door quietly and into mine where you can snore you knowi snore myselfin case anybody takes a fancy to see whether i am asleep  leave your dog in your own room he snores all spanish bull dogs do  yes that will serve said logan  merton your mind is not wholly inactive  they had some whisky and sodawater and carried out the manoeuvres on which they had decided  merton unshod silently reentered the smokingroom his shoes in his hand logan as tactfully occupied mertons room and then they waited presently the smokingroom door being slightly ajar merton heard logan snoring very naturally the spanish bulldog was yet more sonorous gianesi came in walked upstairs to his bedroom and shut his door in half an hour he also was snoring it was a nasal trio  merton drove the night along like dr johnson by repeating latin and other verses  he dared not turn on the light of his portable electric lamp and read he was afraid to smoke he heard the owls towhitting and towhooing from the woods and the clock on the castle tower striking the quarters and the hours  one oclock passed two oclock passed a quarter after two then the bell of the wireless machine rang the machine began to tick merton sat tight listening  all the curtains of the windows were drawn the room was almost perfectly dark the snorings had sometimes lulled sometimes revived  merton lay behind the curtains on the windowseat facing the door  he knew almost without the help of his ears that the door was slowly slowly opening  something entered something paused something stole silently towards the wireless machine and paused again  then a glow suffused the further end of the room a disc of electric light clearly from a portable lamp  a draped form in deep shadow was exposed to mertons view  he stole forward on tiptoe with noiseless feet he leaped on the back of the figure threw his left arm round its neck caught its right wrist in a grip of steel and yelled  mr eachain of the hairy arm if i am not mistaken  at the same moment there came a click the electric light was switched on logan bounced on to the figure tore away a revolver from the right hand of which merton held the wrist and the two fell on the floor above a struggling highland warrior in the tartans of the macraes  the figure was thrown on its face  got you now mr blake said logan turning the head to the light  d n he added it is gianesi  i thought we had the irish minstrel  the figure only snarled and swore in italian  first thing anyhow to tie him up said logan producing a serviceable cord  both logan and merton were muscular men and presently had the intruder tightly swathed in inextricable knots and gagged in a homely but sufficient fashion  now merton said logan this is a bitter disappointment  from your dream or vision of eachain of the hairy arm it was clear to me that somebody the poet for choice had heard the yarn of the highland ghost and was masquerading in the kilt for the purpose of tampering with the electric dodge and communicating with the kidnappers  apparently i owe the bard an apology  youll sit on this fellows chest while i go and bring mr macrae  a message has come in on the machine said merton  well he can read it it is not our affair  logan went off merton poured out a glass of apollinaris water added a little whisky and lit a cigarette  the figure on the floor wriggled merton put the revolver which the man had dropped and logans pistol into a drawer of the writingtable which he locked  i do detest all that cheap revolver business said merton  the row had awakened logans dog which was howling dolefully in the neighbouring room  queer situation eh said merton to the prostrate figure  hurrying footsteps climbed the stairs mr macrae with a shotgun and logan entered  mr macrae all but embraced merton  had i a son i could have wished him to be like you he said but my poor boy his voice broke  merton had not known before that the millionaire had lost a son  he did understand however that the judicious logan had given him the whole credit of the exploit for reasons too obvious to merton  dont thank me he was saying when logan interrupted  dont you think mr macrae you had better examine the message that has just come in  mr macrae read glad they found the hairpin it will console the old boy  do not quite see how to communicate if gianesi who you say has arrived removes the machine  look here cried merton excuse my offering advice but we ought i think to send for donald macdonald at once  we must flash back a message to those brutes so they may think they are still in communication with the traitor in our camp  that beast on the floor could work it of course but he would only warn them we cant check him  we must use donald and keep them thinking that they are sending news to the traitor  but by jove said logan they have heard from him whoever he is since bude came back for they know about the finding of the hairpin you he said to the wretched captive have you been at this machine  the man being gagged only gasped  theres this too said merton the senders of the last message clearly think that gianesi is against them  if gianesi removes the machine they say  merton did not finish his sentence he rushed out of the room  presently he hurried back  mr macrae he said blakes door is locked  i cant waken him and if he were in his room the noise we have made must have wakened him already  logan ungag that creature  logan removed the gag  who are you he asked  the captive was silent  mr macrae said merton may i run and bring donald and the other servants here  donald must work the machine at once and we must break in blakes door and if he is off we must rouse the country after him  mr macrae seemed almost dazed the rapid sequence of unusual circumstances being remote from his experience  in spite of the blaze of electric light the morning was beginning to steal into the room the refreshments on the table looked oddly dissipated there was a heavy stale smell of tobacco and of whisky from a bottle that had been upset in the struggle  mr macrae opened a window and inhaled the fresh air from the atlantic  this revived him  ill ring the alarm bell he said and putting a small key to an unnoticed keyhole in a panel he opened a tiny door thrust in his hand and pressed a knob  instantly from the castle tower came the thunderous knell of the alarm  i had it put in in case of fire or burglars explained the millionaire adding automatically every modern improvement  in a few minutes the servants and gillies had gathered hastily clad they were met by logan who briefly bade some bring hammers and the caber or pinetree trunk that is tossed in highland sports  it would make a good batteringram  donald macdonald he sent at once to mr macrae  he met bude and lady bude and rapidly explained that there was no danger of fire  the countess went back to her rooms bude returned with logan into the observatory  here they found donald telegraphing to the conspirators by the wireless engine a message dictated by merton  dont be alarmed about communications  i have got them to leave our machine in its place on the chance that you might say something that would give you away  gianesi suspects nothing  wire as usual at about halfpast two in the morning when you mean it for me  that ought to be good enough said logan approvingly while the hammers and the caber under mr macraes directions were thundering on the door of blakes room  the door which was very strong gave way at last with a crash in they burst  the room was empty a rope fastened to the ironwork of the bedstead showed the poets means of escape for a long ropeladder swung from the window  on the table lay a letter directed to     thomas merton esq    care of ronald macrae esq    castle skrae  mr macrae took the letter bidding benson the butler search the room and conveyed the epistle to merton who opened it  it ran thus     dear mertonas a man of the world and slightly my senior you must    have expected to meet me in the smokingroom tonight or at least    lord fastcastle probably entertained that hope  i saw that things    were getting a little too warm and made other arrangements  it is a    little hard on the poor fellow whom you have probably mauled if you    have not shot each other  as he has probably informed you he is not    mr gianesi but a dismissed employe whom we enlisted and whom i    found it desirable to leave behind me  these discomforts will occur    i myself did not look for so severe an assault as i suffered down at    the cove on sunday evening  the others carried out their parts only    too conscientiously in my case  you will not easily find an    opportunity of renewing our acquaintance as i slit and cut the tyres    of all the motors except that on which i am now retiring from    hospitable castle skrae having also slit largely the tyres of the    bicycles  mr macraes new wireless machine has been rendered useless    by my unfortunate associate and as i have rather spiked all the    wheeled conveyances i could not manage to scuttle the yacht you    will be put to some inconvenience to reestablish communications  by    that time my trail will be lost  i enclose a banknote for 10l    which pray if you would oblige me distribute among the servants at    the castle  please thank mr macrae for all his hospitality  among    my books you may find something to interest you  you may keep my    manuscript poems     very faithfully yours    gerald blake     p sthe genuine gianesi will probably arrive at lairg tomorrow    my unfortunate associate whom i cannot sufficiently pity relieved    him of his ingenious machine en route and left him heavily    drugged in a train bound for fort william  or perhaps gianesi may    come by sea to loch inver  gb  when merton had read this elegant epistle aloud benson entered bearing electrical apparatus which had been found in the book boxes abandoned by blake  what he had done was obvious enough  he had merely smuggled in in his book boxes a machine which corresponded with that of the kidnappers and had substituted its mechanism for that supplied to mr macrae by gianesi and giambresi  this he must have arranged on the saturday night when merton saw the kilted appearance of eachain of the hairy arm  a few metallic atoms from the coherer on the floor of the smokingroom had caught mertons eye before breakfast on sunday morning now it was friday morning  and still no means of detecting and capturing the kidnappers had been discovered  out of the captive nothing could be extracted  the room had been cleared save for mr macrae logan and bude and the man had been interrogated  he refused to answer any questions and demanded to be taken before a magistrate  now where was there a magistrate  logan lighted the smokingroom fire thrust the poker into it and began tying hard knots in a length of cord all this silently  his brows were knit his lips were set in his eye shone the wild light of the blood of restalrig  bude and mr macrae looked on aghast  what are you about asked merton  there are methods of extracting information from reluctant witnesses snarled logan  oh bosh said merton  mr macrae cannot permit you to revive your ancestral proceedings  logan threw down his knotted cord  i beg your pardon mr macrae he said but if i had that dog in my house of kirkburn he then went out  lord fastcastle is a little moved said merton  he comes of a wild stock but i never saw him like this  mr macrae allowed that the circumstances were unusual  a horrible thought occurred to merton  mr macrae he exclaimed may i speak to you privately  bude i dare say will be kind enough to remain with that person  mr macrae followed merton into the billiardroom  my dear sir said the pallid merton logan and i have made a terrible blunder  we never doubted that if we caught any one our captive would be blake  i do not deny that this man is his accomplice but we have literally no proof  he may persist if taken before a magistrate that he is gianesi  he may say that being in your employment as an electrician he naturally entered the smokingroom when the electric bell rang  he can easily account for his possession of a revolver in a place where a mysterious crime has just been committed  as to the highland costume he may urge that like many southrons he had bought it to wear on a highland tour and was trying it on  how can you keep him  you have no longer the right of pit and gallows  before what magistrate can you take him and where  the sheriffsubstitute may be at golspie or tongue or dingwall or i dont know where  what can we do  what have we against the man  loitering with intent  and here logan and i have knocked him down and tied him up and logan wanted to torture him  dear mr merton replied mr macrae with paternal tenderness you are overwrought  you have not slept all night  i must insist that you go to bed and do not rise till you are called  the man is certainly guilty of conspiracy that will be proved when the real gianesi comes to hand  if not i do not doubt that i can secure his silence  you forget the power of money  make yourself easy go to sleep meanwhile i must reestablish communications  goodnight golden slumbers  he wrung mertons hand and left him admiring the calm resolution of one whose conversation in the mad pride of intellectuality he had recently despised  the millionaire merton felt was worthy to be his daughters father  the power of money mused mr macrae what is it in circumstances like mine  surrounded by all the resources of science i am baffled by a clever rogue and in a civilised country the aid of the law and the police is as remote and inaccessible as in the great sahara  but to business  he sent for benson bade him with some gillies carry the prisoner into the dungeon of the old castle loose his bonds place food before him and leave him in charge of the stalker  he informed bude that breakfast would be ready at eight and then retired to his study where he matured his plans  the yacht he would send to lochinver to await the real gianesi there and to send telegrams descriptive of blake in all directions  giambresi must be telegraphed to again and entreated to come in person with yet another electric machine for that brought by the false gianesi had been by the same envoy rendered useless  a mounted man must be despatched to lairg to collect vehicles and transport there and to meet the real gianesi if he came that way  thus mr macrae with cool patience and forethought endeavoured to recover his position happy in the reflection that treachery had at last been eliminated  he did not forget to write telegrams to remote sheriffsubstitutes and procurators fiscal  as to the kidnappers he determined to amuse them with protracted negotiations on the subject of his daughters ransom  these would be despatched of course by the wireless engine which was in tune and touch with their own  during the parleyings the wretches might make some blunder and mr macrae could perhaps think out some plan for their detection and capture without risk to his daughter  if not he must pay ransom  having written out his orders and telegrams mr macrae went downstairs to visit the stables  he gave his commands to his servants and as he returned he met logan who had been on the watch for him  i am myself again mr macrae said logan smiling  after all we are living in the twentieth century not the sixteenth worse luck  and now can you give me your attention for a few minutes  willingly said mr macrae and they walked together to a point in the garden where they were secure from being overheard  i must ask you to lend me a horse to ride to lairg and the railway at once said logan  must you leave us  you cannot i fear catch the 1250 train south  i shall take a special train if i cannot catch the one i want said logan adding i have a scheme for baffling these miscreants and rescuing miss macrae while disappointing them of the monstrous ransom which they are certain to claim  if you can trust me you will enter into protracted negotiations with them on the matter through the wireless machine  that i had already determined to do said the millionaire  but may i inquire what is your scheme  would it be asking too much to request you to let me keep it concealed even from you  everything depends on the most absolute secrecy  it must not appear that you are concernedmust not be suspected  my plan has been suggested to me by trifling indications which no one else has remarked  it is a plan which i confess appears wild but what is not wild in this unhappy affair  science as a rule beneficent has given birth to potentialities of crime which exceed the dreams of oriental romance  but science like the spear of achilles can cure the wounds which herself inflicts  logan spoke calmly but eloquently as every reader must observe  he was no longer the fierce border baron of an hour agone but the polished modern gentleman  the millionaire marked the change  any further mystery cannot but be distasteful lord fastcastle said mr macrae  the truth is said logan that if my plan takes shape important persons and interests will be involved  i myself will be involved and for reasons both public and private it seems to me to the last degree essential that you should in no way appear that you should be able honestly to profess entire ignorance  if i fail i give you my word of honour that your position will be in no respect modified by my action  if i succeed  then you will indeed be my preserver said the millionaire  not i but my friend mr merton said logan who by the way ought to accompany me  in mr mertons genius for success in adventures entailing a mystery more dark and personal dangers far greater than those involved by my scheme which is really quite safe i have confidence based on large experience  to merton alone i owe it that i am a married a happy and speaking to any one but yourself i might say an affluent man  this adventure must be achieved if at all auspice merton  i also have much confidence in him and i sincerely love him said mr macrae to the delight of logan  he then paced silently up and down in deep thought  you say that your scheme involves you in no personal danger he asked  in none or only in such as men encounter daily in several professions merton and i like it  and you will not suffer in character if you fail  certainly not in character no gentleman of my coat ever entered on enterprise so free from moral blame said logan since my ancestor and namesake sir robert fell at the side of the good lord james of douglas above the heart of bruce  he thrilled and changed colour as he spoke  yet it would not do for me to be known to be connected with the enterprise asked mr macrae  indeed it would not  your notorious opulence would arouse ideas in the public mind ideas false indeed but fatally compromising  i may not even subsidise the affairput a million to mr mertons account  in no sort  afterwards after he succeeds then i dont say if merton will consent but that is highly improbable  i know my friend  mr macrae sighed deeply and remained pensive  well he answered at last i accept your very gallant and generous proposal  i am overjoyed said logan  he had never been in such a big thing before  i shall order my two best horses to be saddled after breakfast said mr macrae  you will bait at inchnadampf  here is my address this will always find me said logan writing rapidly on a leaf of his notebook  you will wire all news of your negotiations with the pirates to me by the new wireless machine when giambresi brings it and his firm in town will telegraph it on to me at the address i gave you in cypher  to save time we must use a book cypher we can settle it in the house in ten minutes said logan now entirely in his element  they chose the bonnie brier bush by mr ian maclarena work too popular to excite suspicion and arranged the method of secret correspondence with great rapidity  logan then rushed up to mertons room hastily communicated the scheme to him and overcame his objections nay awoke in him by his report of mr macraes words the hopes of a lover  they came down to breakfast and arranged that their baggage should be sent after them as soon as communications were restored  merton contrived to have a brief interview with lady bude  her joyous spirit shone in her eyes  i do not know what lord fastcastles plan is she said but i wish you good fortune  you have won the fathers heart and now i am about to be false to my sexshe whisperedthe daughters is all but your own i can help you a little she added and after warmly clasping both her hands in his merton hurried to the front of the house where the horses stood and sprang into the saddle  no motors no bicycles no scientific vehicles today the clean wind piped to him from the mountains a good steed was between his thighs  logan mounted after entrusting bouncer to lady bude and they galloped eastwards    v  the adventure of the flora macdonald   this is the point indicated latitude so and so longitude so and so said mr macrae  but i do not see a sail or a funnel on the western horizon  nothing since we left the fleet behind us far to the east  yet it is the hour  it is strange  mr macrae was addressing bude  they stood together on the deck of the flora macdonald the vast yacht of the millionaire  she was lying to on a sea as glassy and radiant under a blazing august sun as the atlantic can show in her mildest moods  on the quarterdeck of the yacht were piled great iron boxes containing the millions in gold with which the millionaire had at last consented to ransom his daughter  he had been negotiating with her captors through the wireless machine and as logan could not promise any certain release mr macrae had finally surrendered while informing logan of the circumstances and details of his rendezvous with the kidnappers  the amassing of the gold had shaken the exchanges of two worlds  banks trembled rates were enormous but the precious metal had been accumulated  the pirates would not take mr macraes cheque bank notes they laughed at the millions must be paid in gold  now at last the gold was on the spot of ocean indicated by the kidnappers but there was no sign of sail or ship no promise of their coming  men with telescopes in the rigging of the flora were on the outlook in vain  they could pick up one of the floating giants of our fleet far off to the east but north west and south were empty wastes of water  three oclock has come and gone  i hope there has been no accident said mr macrae nervously  but where are those thieves  he absently pressed his repeater it tingled out the halfhour  it is odd said bude  hullo look there whats that  that was a slim spar which suddenly shot from the plain of ocean at a distance of a hundred yards  on its apex a small black hood twisted itself this way and that like a living thing so tranquil was the hour that the spar with its dull hood was distinctly reflected in the mirror like waters of the ocean  by gad it is the periscope of a submarine said bude  there could not be a doubt of it  the invention of napier of merchistoun and of m jules verne now at last an actual engine of human warfare had been employed by the kidnappers of the daughter of the millionaire  a light flashed on the mind steady and serviceable but not brilliantly ingenious of mr macrae  this he exclaimed rather superfluously accounts for the fiendish skill with which these miscreants took cover when pursued by the marine police  this explains the subtle art with which they dodged observation  doubtless they had always somewhere a wellfound normal yacht containing their supplies  do you not agree with me my lord  in my opinion said bude you have satisfactorily explained what has so long puzzled us  but look  the periscope having reconnoitred us is sinking again  it was true  the slim spar gracefully descended to the abyss  again ocean smiled with innumerable laughters as the athenian sings smiled empty azure effulgent  the flora macdonald was once more alone on a wide wide sea  two slight jars were now just felt by the owner skipper and crew of the flora macdonald  whats that asked mr macrae sharply  a reef  in my opinion said the captain the beggars in the submarine have torpedoed us  attached torpedoes to our keel sir he explained respectfully touching his cap and shifting the quid in his cheek  he was a bluff tar of the good old school  merciful heavens exclaimed mr macrae his face paling  what can this new outrage mean  here on our deck is the gold if they explode their torpedoes the bullion sinks to join the exhaustless treasures of the main  a bit of bluff and blackmail on their part i fancy said bude lighting a cigarette  no doubt  no doubt said mr macrae rather unsteadily  they would never be such fools as to blow up the millions  still an accident might have awful results  look there sir if you please said the captain of the flora macdonald theres that spar of theirs up again  it was so  the spar the periscope shot up on the larboard side of the yacht  after it had reconnoitred the mirror of ocean was stirred into dazzling circling waves and the deck of a submarine slowly emerged  the deck was long and flat and of a much larger area than submarines in general have  it would seem to indicate the presence below the water of a body or hull of noble proportions  a voice hailed the yacht from the submarine though no speaker was visible  you have no consort the voice yelled  for ten years i have been a widower replied mr macrae his voice trembling with emotion  most sorry to have unintentionally awakened unavailing regrets came the voice  but i mean honour bright you have no attendant armed vessel  none i promised you so said mr macrae i am a man of my word  come on deck if you doubt me and look for yourself  not me and get shot by a rifleman said the voice  it is very distressing to be distrusted in this manner replied mr macrae  captain mcclosky he said to the skipper pray request all hands to oblige me by going below  the captain issued this order which the yachts crew rather reluctantly obeyed  their interest and curiosity were strongly excited by a scene without precedent in the experience of the oldest mariner  when they had disappeared mr macrae again addressed the invisible owner of the voice  all my crew are below  nobody is on deck but captain mcclosky the earl of bude and myself  we are entirely unarmed  you can see for yourself 406  the owner of the voice replied you have no torpedoes  we have only the armament agreed upon by you to protect this immense mass of bullion from the attacks of the unscrupulous said mr macrae i take heaven to witness that i am honourably observing every article of our agreement as per yours of august 21  all right answered the voice  i dare say you are honest  but i may as well tell you this that while passing under your yacht we attached two slabs of guncotton to her keel  the knob connected with them is under my hand  we placed them where they are not necessarily for publicationexplosion i meanbut merely as a guarantee of good faith you understand  perfectly said mr macrae though i regard your proceeding as a fresh and unmerited insult  merely a precaution usual in business said the voice  and now it went on for the main transaction  you will lower your gold into boats row it across and land it here on my deck  when it is all there and has been inspected by me you will send one boat rowed by two men only into which miss macrae shall be placed and sent back to you  when that has been done we shall part i hope on friendly terms and with mutual respect  captain mcclosky said mr macrae will you kindly pipe all hands on board to discharge cargo  the captain obeyed  mr macrae turned to bude  this is a moment he said which tries a fathers heart  presently i must see emmeline hear her voice clasp her to my breast  bude mutely wrung the hand of the millionaire and turned away to conceal his emotion  seldom perhaps never has a father purchased back an only and beloved child at such a cost as mr macrae was now paying without a murmur  the boats of the flora macdonald were lowered and manned the winches slowly swung each huge box of the precious metal aboard the boats  mr macrae entrusted the keys of the goldchests to his officers  remember cried the voice from the submarine we must have the gold on board inspected and weighed before we return miss macrae  mean to the last whispered the millionaire to the earl but aloud he only said very well i regret for your own sake your suspicious character but in the circumstances i have no choice  to bude he added this is terrible  when he has secured the bullion he may submerge his submarine and go off without returning my daughter  this was so manifestly true that bude could only shake his head and mutter something about honour among thieves  the crew got the gold on board the boats and after several journeys had the boxes piled on the deck of the submarine  when they had placed the boxes on board they again retired and one of the men of the submarine who seemed to be in command and wore a mask coolly weighed the glittering metal on the deck returning each package after weighing and inspection to its coffer  the process was long and tedious at length it was completed  then at last the form of miss macrae in an elegant and tasteful yachting costume appeared on the deck of the submarine  the boats crew of the flora macdonald to whom she was endeared lifted their oars and cheered  the masked pirate in command handed her into a boat of the floras with stately courtesy placing in her hand a bouquet of the rarest orchids  he then placed his hand on his heart and bowed with a grace remarkable in one of his trade  this man was no common desperado  the crew pulled off and at that moment to the horror of all who were on the floras deck two slight jars again thrilled through her from stem to stern  mr macrae and bude gazed on each other with ashen faces  what had occurred  but still the boats crew pulled gallantly towards the flora and in a few moments miss macrae stepped on deck and was in her fathers arms  it was a scene over which art cannot linger  self restraint was thrown to the winds the father and child acted as if no eyes were regarding them  miss macrae sobbed convulsively her sire was shaken by longpent emotion  bude had averted his gaze he looked towards the submarine on the deck of which the crew were busy beginning to lower the bullion into the interior  to budes extreme and speechless amazement another periscope arose from ocean at about fifty yards from the further side of the submarine  bude spoke no word the father and daughter were absorbed in each other the crew had no eyes but for them  presently unmarked by the busy seamen of the hostile submarine the platform and lookout hood of another submarine appeared  the new boat seemed to be pointing directly for the middle of the hostile submarine and at right angles to it  hands up pealed a voice from the second submarine  it was the voice of merton  at the wellknown sound miss macrae tore herself from her fathers embrace and hurried below  she deemed that a fond illusion of the senses had beguiled her  mr macrae looked wildly towards the two submarines  the masked captain of the hostile vessel leaping up shook his fist at the flora macdonald and yelled damn your foolish treachery you money grubbing hunks  you have a consort  i assure you that nobody is more surprised than myself cried mr macrae  one minute more and you your ship and your crew will be sent to your own place yelled the masked captain  he vanished below doubtless to explode the mines under the flora  bude crossed himself mr macrae folding his arms stood calm and defiant on his deck  one sailor the cook leaped overboard in terror the others hastily drew themselves up in a double line to die like britons  a minute passed a minute charged with terror  mr macrae took out his watch to mark the time  another minute passed and no explosion  the captain of the pirate vessel reappeared on her deck  he cast his hands desperately abroad his curses happily were unheard by miss macrae who was below  hands up again rang out the voice of merton adding if you begin to submerge your craft if she stirs an inch i send you skyward at least as a preliminary measure  my diver has detached your mines from the keel of the flora macdonald and has cut the wires leading to them my bowtube is pointing directly for you if i press the switch the torpedo must go home and then heaven have mercy on your souls  a crow of laughter arose from the yachtsmen of the flora macdonald who freely launched terms of maritime contempt at the crew of the pirate submarine with comments on the probable future of the souls to which merton had alluded  on his desk the masked captain stood silent  we have women on board he answered merton at last  you may lower them in a collapsible boat if you have one answered merton  but on the faintest suspicion of treacherythe faintest surmise mark you i switch on my torpedo  what are your terms asked the pirate captain  the return of the bullion that is all replied the voice of merton  i give you two minutes to decide  before a minute and a half had passed the masked captain had capitulated i climb down he said  the boats of the flora will come for it said merton your men will help load it in the boats  look sharp and be civil or i blow you out of the water  the pirates had no choice rapidly if sullenly they effected the transfer  when all was done when the coffers had been hoisted aboard the flora macdonald merton for the first time hailed the yacht  will you kindly send a boat round here for me mr macrae if you do not object to my joining you on the return voyage  mr macrae shouted a welcome the yachts crew cheered as only britons can  mr macraes piper struck up the march of the clan a the wild mccraws are coming  if any of you scoundrels shoot cried merton to his enemies up you will all go  you shall stay here after we depart in front of that torpedo just as long as the skipper of my vessel pleases  meanwhile the boat of the flora approached the friendly submarine merton stepped aboard and soon was on the deck of the flora macdonald  mr macrae welcomed him with all the joy of a father reunited to his daughter of a capitalist restored to his millions  bude shook mertons hand warmly exclaiming well played old boy  mertons eyes eagerly searched the deck for one beloved form  mr macrae drew him aside  emmeline is below he whispered you will find her in the saloon  merton looked steadfastly at the millionaire who smiled with unmistakable meaning  the lover hurried down the companion while the flora which had rapidly got up steam sped eastward  merton entered the saloon his heart beating as hard as when he had sought his beloved among the bracken beneath the cliffs at castle skrae she rose at his entrance their eyes met mertons dim with a supreme doubt emmelines frank and clear  a blush rose divinely over the white rose of her face her lips curved in the resistless aeginetan smile and without a word spoken the twain were in each others arms         half an hour later mr macrae heralding his arrival with a sonorous hem entered the saloon  smiling he embraced his daughter who hid her head on his ample shoulder while with his right hand the father grasped that of merton  my daughter is restored to meand my son said the millionaire softly  there was silence  mr macrae was the first to recover his selfpossession  sit down dear he said gently disengaging emmeline and tell me all about it  who were the wretches  i can forgive them now  miss macraes eyes were bent on the carpet she seemed reluctant to speak  at last in timid and faltering accents she whispered it was the van huytens boy  rudolph van huytens  i might have guessed it cried the millionaire his motive is too plain  his wealth did not equal mine by several millions  the ransom which he demanded and but for tom here he indicated merton would now possess exactly reversed our relative positions  carrying on his fathers ambition he would but for tom have held the worlds record for opulence  the villain  you do not flatter me father said miss macrae and you are unjust to mr van huytens  he had another he said a stronger motive  me she murmured blushing like a red rose and adding he really was rather nice  the submarine was comfy the yacht delightful  his sisters and his aunt were very kind  but and the beautiful girl looked up archly and shyly at merton  in fact if it had not been for tom mr macrae was exclaiming when emmeline laid her lily hand on his lips and again hid her burning blushes on his shoulder  so rudolph had no chance asked mr macrae gaily  i used rather to like him long agobefore murmured emmeline  a thrill of happy pride passed through merton  he also he remembered of old had thought that he loved  but now he privately registered an oath that he would never make any confessions as to the buried past a course which the chronicler earnestly recommends to young readers  now tell us all about your adventures emmie said mr macrae sitting down and taking his daughters hand in his own  the narrative may have been anticipated  after blake was felled miss macrae screaming and struggling had been carried to the boat  the crew had rapidly pulled round the cliff the submarine had risen to the captives horrified amazement from the deep she had been taken on board and yet more to her surprise had been welcomed by the misses van huytens and their aunt  the brother had always behaved with respect till finding that his suit was hopeless he had avoided her presence as much as possible and  had gone for the dollars said macrae  they had wandered from rocky desert isle to desert isle in the archipelago of the hebrides meeting at night with a swift attendant yacht  usually they had slept on shore under canvas the corrugated iron houses had been left behind at the seven hunters with the champagne to alleviate the anxiety of mr macrae  ample supplies of costume and other necessaries for miss macrae had always been at hand  they really did me very well she said smiling but i was miserable about you and she embraced her father  only about me asked mr macrae  i did not know i was not sure said emmeline crying a little and laughing rather hysterically  you go and lie down my dear said mr macrae  your maid is in your cabin and thither he conducted the overwrought girl merton anxiously following her with his eyes  we are neglecting lord bude said mr macrae  come on deck tom and tell us how you managed that delightful surprise  oh pardon me sir said merton i am under oath i am solemnly bound to logan and others never to reveal the circumstances  it was necessary to keep you uninformed that you might honourably make your arrangement to meet mr van huytens without being aware that you had a submarine consort  logan takes any dishonour on himself and he wished to offer mr van huytensas that is his nameevery satisfaction but i dissuaded him  his connection with the affair cannot be kept too secret  though logan put me forward you really owe all to him  but without you i should never have had his aid said mr macrae where is lord fastcastle he asked  in the friendly submarine said merton  oh i think i can guess said mr macrae smiling  i shall ask no more questions  let us join lord bude  if the reader is curious as to how the rescue was managed it is enough to say that logan was the cousin and intimate friend of admiral chirnside that the admiral was commanding a fleet engaged in naval manoeuvres around the north coast that he had a flotilla of submarines and that the point of ocean where the pirates met the flora macdonald was not far west of the orkneys  on deck bude asked merton how logan for he knew that logan was the guiding spirit had guessed the secret of the submarine  do you remember said merton that when you came back from the seven hunters you reported that the fishermen had a silly story of seeing a dragon flying above the empty sea  i remember un dragon volant said bude  and logan asked you not to tell mr macrae  yes but i dont understand  a dragon is the scotch word for a kitenot the birda boys kite  you did not know i did not know but mr macrae would have known being a scot and logan wanted to keep his plan dark and the kite had let him into the secret of the submarine  i still dont see how  why the submarine must have been flying a kite with a pendent wire to catch messages from blake and the wireless machine at castle skrae  how else could a kitea dragon the sailor saidhave been flying above the empty sea  logan is rather sharp said bude  but mr macrae asked merton how about the false gianesi  oh when gianesi came of course we settled his business  we had him tight as a conspirator  he had been met when expelled for misdeeds from gianesis and giambresis by a beautiful young man to whom he sold himself  he believed the beautiful young man to be the devil but of course it was our friend blake  he in turn must have been purchased by van huytens while he was lecturing in america as a poetfenian  in fact he really had a singular genius for electric engineering he had done very well at some german university  but he was a fellow of no principle  we are well quit of a rogue  i turned his unlucky victim the false gianesi loose with money enough for life to keep him honest if he chooses  his pension stops if ever a word of the method of rescue comes out  the same with my crew  they shall all be rich men for their station till the tale is whispered and reaches my ears  in that caseall pensions stop  i think we can trust the crew of the friendly submarine to keep their own counsel  certainly said merton  wealth has its uses after all he thought in his heart         merton and logan gave a farewell dinner in autumn to the disentanglersto such of them as were still unmarried  in her napkin each lady of the society found a cheque on coutts for 25000l signed with the magic name ronald macrae  the millionaire had insisted on being allowed to perform this act of munificence the salvage for the recovered millions he said  miss martin after dinner carried mr macraes health in a toast  in a humorous speech she announced her own approaching nuptials and intimated that she had the permission of the other ladies present to make the same general confession for all of them  like every novel of my own said miss martin smiling this enterprise of the disentanglers has a happy
