tale of ginger  pickles  by beatrix potter  author of the tale of peter rabbit c  illustration  frederick warne      1909 by frederick warne  co  printed and bound in great britain by william clowes limited beccles and london     illustration  once upon a time there was a village shop the name over the window was ginger and pickles  it was a little small shop just the right size for dollslucinda and jane dollcook always bought their groceries at ginger and pickles  the counter inside was a convenient height for rabbits ginger and pickles sold red spotty pockethandkerchiefs at a penny three farthings  they also sold sugar and snuff and galoshes  in fact although it was such a small shop it sold nearly everythingexcept a few things that you want in a hurrylike bootlaces hairpins and mutton chops  ginger and pickles were the people who kept the shop ginger was a yellow tomcat and pickles was a terrier  the rabbits were always a little bit afraid of pickles  illustration  illustration  the shop was also patronized by miceonly the mice were rather afraid of ginger  ginger usually requested pickles to serve them because he said it made his mouth water  i cannot bear said he to see them going out at the door carrying their little parcels  i have the same feeling about rats replied pickles but it would never do to eat our own customers they would leave us and go to tabitha twitchits  on the contrary they would go nowhere replied ginger gloomily  tabitha twitchit kept the only other shop in the village she did not give credit  illustration  illustration  ginger and pickles gave unlimited credit  now the meaning of credit is thiswhen a customer buys a bar of soap instead of the customer pulling out a purse and paying for itshe says she will pay another time  and pickles makes a low bow and says with pleasure madam and it is written down in a book  the customers come again and again and buy quantities in spite of being afraid of ginger and pickles  but there is no money in what is called the till  illustration  illustration  the customers came in crowds every day and bought quantities especially the toffee customers but there was always no money they never paid for as much as a pennyworth of peppermints  but the sales were enormous ten times as large as tabitha twitchits  illustration  as there was always no money ginger and pickles were obliged to eat their own goods  pickles ate biscuits and ginger ate a dried haddock  they ate them by candlelight after the shop was closed  illustration  when it came to jan 1st there was still no money and pickles was unable to buy a dog licence  it is very unpleasant i am afraid of the police said pickles  it is your own fault for being a terrier i do not require a licence and neither does kep the collie dog  it is very uncomfortable i am afraid i shall be summoned i have tried in vain to get a licence upon credit at the post office said pickles the place is full of policemen i met one as i was coming home  let us send in the bill again to samuel whiskers ginger he owes 229 for bacon  i do not believe that he intends to pay at all replied ginger  illustration  and i feel sure that anna maria pockets thingswhere are all the cream crackers  you have eaten them yourself replied ginger  illustration  ginger and pickles retired into the back parlour  they did accounts they added up sums and sums and sums  samuel whiskers has run up a bill as long as his tail he has had an ounce and threequarters of snuff since october  what is seven pounds of butter at 13 and a stick of sealing wax and four matches  send in all the bills again to everybody with compts replied ginger  illustration  illustration  after a time they heard a noise in the shop as if something had been pushed in at the door they came out of the back parlour there was an envelope lying on the counter and a policeman writing in a notebook  pickles nearly had a fit he barked and he barked and made little rushes  bite him pickles bite him spluttered ginger behind a sugarbarrel hes only a german doll  the policeman went on writing in his notebook twice he put his pencil in his mouth and once he dipped it in the treacle  pickles barked till he was hoarse but still the policeman took no notice he had bead eyes and his helmet was sewed on with stitches  illustration  at length on his last little rushpickles found that the shop was empty the policeman had disappeared  but the envelope remained  illustration  illustration  do you think that he has gone to fetch a real live policeman i am afraid it is a summons said pickles  no replied ginger who had opened the envelope it is the rates and taxes Â£3 19 1134  this is the last straw said pickles let us close the shop  they put up the shutters and left but they have not removed from the neighbourhood in fact some people wish they had gone further  illustration  ginger is living in the warren i do not know what occupation he pursues he looks stout and comfortable  illustration  illustration  pickles is at present a gamekeeper  illustration  the closing of the shop caused great inconvenience tabitha twitchit immediately raised the price of everything a halfpenny and she continued to refuse to give credit  of course there are the tradesmens cartsthe butcher the fishman and timothy baker  but a person cannot live on seed wigs and spongecake and butterbunsnot even when the spongecake is as good as timothys  illustration  after a time mr john dormouse and his daughter began to sell peppermints and candles  but they did not keep selffitting sixes and it takes five mice to carry one seven inch candle  illustration  illustration  besidesthe candles which they sell behave very strangely in warm weather  illustration  and miss dormouse refused to take back the ends when they were brought back to her with complaints  and when mr john dormouse was complained to he stayed in bed and would say nothing but very snug which is not the way to carry on a retail business  illustration  illustration  so everybody was pleased when sally henny penny sent out a printed poster to say that she was going to reopen the shophennys opening sale grand cooperative jumble pennys penny prices come buy come try come buy  the poster really was most ticing  illustration  there was a rush upon the opening day the shop was crammed with customers and there were crowds of mice upon the biscuit canisters  sally henny penny gets rather flustered when she tries to count out change and she insists on being paid cash but she is quite harmless  illustration  and she has laid in a remarkable assortment of bargains  there is something to please everybody
