                         270     facing death  or how stokebridge was civilized   chapter i  evil tidings   a row of brickbuilt houses with slate roofs at the edge of a large mining village in staffordshire the houses are dingy and colourless and without relief of any kind so are those in the next row so in the street beyond and throughout the whole village there is a dreary monotony about the place and if some giant could come and pick up all the rows of houses and change their places one with another it is a question whether the men now away at work would notice any difference whatever until they entered the houses standing in the place of those which they had left in the morning there is a church and a vicarage half hidden away in the trees in its pretty oldfashioned garden there are two or three small redbricked dissenting chapels and the doctors house with a bright brass knocker and plate on the door there are no other buildings above the common average of mining villages and it needs not the high chimneys and enginehouses with winding gear dotting the surrounding country to notify the fact that stokebridge is a mining village  it is a little past noon and many of the women come to their doors and look curiously after a miner who in his working clothes and black with coaldust walks rapidly towards his house with his head bent down and his thick felt hat slouched over his eyes  its bill haden he works at the vaughan  what brings he up at this hour  summat wrong ill be bound  bill haden stopped at the door of his house in the row first spoken of lifted the latch and went in he walked along a narrow passage into the backroom his wife who was standing at the washingtub turned round with a surprised exclamation and a bulldog with halfadozen round tumbling puppies scrambled out of a basket by the fire and rushed to greet him  what is it bill whats brought thee home before time  for a moment bill haden did not answer but stooped and as it were mechanically lifted the dog and stroked its head  theres blood on thy hands bill what be wrong with ee  it baint none of mine lass the man said in an unsteady voice it be jacks he be gone  not jack simpson  ay jack simpson the mate i ha worked with ever since we were butties together a fall just came as we worked side by side in the stall and it broke his neck and hes dead  the woman dropped into a chair threw her apron over her head and cried aloud partly at the loss of her husbands mate partly at the thought of the narrow escape he had himself had  now lass her husband said there be no time to lose it be for thee to go and break it to his wife i ha come straight on a purpose i thawt to do it but i feel like a gal myself and it had best be told her by another woman  jane haden took her apron from her face  oh bill how can i do it and she ill and with a twomonth baby i misdoubt me it will kill her  thoust got to do it bill said doggedly and thoud best be quick about it it wont be many minutes afore they bring him in  when bill spoke in that way his wife knew as he said that shed got to do it and without a word she rose and went out while her husband stood staring into the fire and still patting the bulldog in his arms a tear falling on his hand startled him he dropped the dog and gave it a kick passed his sleeve across his eyes and said angrily  blest if i baint a crying like a gal whod a thawt it well well poor old jack he was a good mate tooand bill haden proceeded to light his pipe  slowly and reluctantly mrs haden passed along the row the sad errand on which she was going was one that has often to be discharged in a large colliery village the women who had seen bill go in were still at their doors and had been joined by others the news that he had come in at this unusual hour had passed about quickly and there was a general feeling of uneasiness among the women all of whom had husbands or relatives below ground when therefore jane haden came out with signs of tears on her cheeks her neighbours on either side at once assailed her with questions  jack simpsons killed by a fall she said and i ha got to break it to his wife  rapidly the news spread along the row from door to door and from group to group the first feeling was everywhere one of relief that it was not their turn this time then there was a chorus of pity for the widow it will go hard with her was the general verdict then the little groups broke up and went back to their work of getting ready for the return of their husbands from the pit at two oclock one or two only of those most intimate with the simpsons followed jane haden slowly down the street to the door of their house and took up a position a short distance off talking quietly together in case they might be wanted and with the intention of going in after the news was broken to help comfort the widow and to make what preparations were needed for the last incoming of the late master of the house it was but a minute or two that they had to pause for the door opened again and jane haden beckoned them to come in  it had as the gossips had predicted gone hard with the young widow she was sitting before the fire when jane entered working and rocking the cradle beside with her foot at the sight of her visitors pale face and tearstained cheeks and quivering lips she had dropped her work and stood up with a terrible presentiment of evilwith that dread which is never altogether absent from the mind of a colliers wife she did not speak but stood with wideopen eyes staring at her visitor  mary my poor girl mrs haden began  that was enough the whole truth burst upon her  he is killed she gasped  mrs haden gave no answer in words but her face was sufficient as she made a step forward towards the slight figure which swayed unsteadily before her mary simpson made no sound save a gasping sob her hand went to her heart and then she fell in a heap on the ground before mrs haden prepared as she was had time to clasp her  thank god jane haden said as she went to the front door and beckoned the others in she has fainted  ay i thawt as much one of the women said and a good job too its always best so till he is brought home and things are straightened up  between them mary simpson was tenderly lifted and carried upstairs and laid on the bed of a lodgers room there the cradle was brought up and put beside it and then jane haden took her seat by the bed one woman went for the doctor while the others prepared the room below in a short time all that remained of jack simpson was borne home on a stretcher on the shoulders of six of his fellowworkmen and laid in the darkened room the doctor came and went for the next two days and then his visits ceased  it had gone hard with mary simpson she had passed from one long fainting fit into another until at last she lay as quiet as did jack below and the doctor murmuring a weak heart poor little woman the shock was too much for her took his departure for the last time from the house then jane haden who had not left her friends side ever since she was carried upstairs wrapped the baby in a shawl and went home a neighbour carrying the cradle  when bill haden returned from work he found the room done up the table laid for tea and the kettle on the fire his wife was sitting by it with the baby on her lap  well lass he said as he entered the room so the poor gals gone i heard it as i came along thousts had a hard two days ont hulloa whats that  its the baby bill his wife said  what hast brought un here for he asked roughly  jane haden did not answer directly but standing in front of her husband removed the handkerchief which covered the babys face as he lay on her arm  look at him bill hes something like jack dont thou see it  not a bit of it he said gruffly kids dont take after their father as pups do  i can see the likeness quite plain bill now she went on laying her hand on his shoulder i want to keep him we aint got none of our own bill and i cant abear the thought of his going to the house  bill haden stood irresolute  i shouldnt like to think of jacks kid in the house still hell be a heap of troubleworse nor a dozen pups and no chance of winning a prize with him nohow or of selling him or swopping him if his points dont turn out right still lass the trouble will be thine and by the time hes ten hell begin to earn his grub in the pit so if thy mind be set ont theres n end o the matter now lets have tea i aint had a meal fit for a dog for the last two days and juno aint got her milk regular  so little jack simpson became a member of the haden family and his father and mother were laid to rest in the buryingground on the hillside above the village     chapter ii  bulldog   a curious group as they sit staring into the fire juno and junos daughter bess brindles both with their underhanging lower jaws and their black noses and wrinkled faces and jack simpson now six years old sitting between them as grave and as immovable as his supporters one dog is on either side of him and his arms are thrown round their broad backs mrs haden is laying the table for her husbands return she glances occasionally at the quiet group in front of the fire and mutters to herself i never did see such a child in all my born days  presently a sudden and simultaneous pricking of the closelycropped ears of juno and bess proclaim that among the many footsteps outside they have detected the tread of their master  jack accepts the intimation and struggles up to his feet just as bill haden lifts the latch and enters  its a fine day bill his wife said  be it the collier replied in return i took no note ot however it doant rain and thats all i cares for and hows the dogs did you give juno that physic ball i got for her  its no manner of use bill leaving they messes wi me i ha tould you so scores o times she woant take it from me she sets her jaws that fast that horses could na pull em apart and all the while im trying she keeps oop a growl like t organ at the church shes a right wiout the physic and well nigh pinned mrs brice when she came in today to borrow a flatiron she was that frighted she skirled out and well nigh fainted off i had to send jack round to the chequers for two o gin before she came round  mrs brice is a fool and youre another bill said now ooman just take off my boots for oim main tired what be you staring at jack were you nearly pinning mother brice too  i doant pin folk i doant jack said sturdily i kicks em i do but i caught hold o junos tail and held on and look ee here dad ive been a thinking doant ee lift i oop by my ears no more not yet they are boath main sore i doant believe neither juno nor bess would stand bein lifted oop by their ears not if they were sore i be game enough i be but till my ears be well you must try some other part i expect the cheek would hurt just as bad so you can try that  i do wish bill you would not try these tricks on the boy hes game enough and if youd ha seen him fighting today with mrs jacksons bill nigh twice as big as himself youd ha said so too but it aint christianlike to try children the same way as pups and really his ears are sore awful sore i chanced t notice em when i washed his face afore he went to school and they be main bad i tell ee  coom here the miner said to jack aye they be sore surely why didnt ee speak afore jack i doant want to hurt ee lad  i want going to speak jack said mother found it out and said shed tell ee ot but the last two nights i were well nigh yelping when ee took me up  youre a good plucked un jack bill haden said and i owt not t ha done it but i didnt think it hurt ee leastways not more nor a boy owt to be hurt to try if ee be game  and whats you and t dogs been doing today jack the miner asked as he began at his dinner  we went for a walk dad after school out in the lanes we saw a big black cat and t dogs chased her into a tree then we got t a pond and dye know dad bess went in and swam about she did  she did the miner said sharply coom here bess and leaving his meal he began anxiously to examine the bulldogs eyes and listened attentively to her breathing that were a rum start for a bull too jack she doant seem to ha taken no harm but maybe it aint showed itself mother you give her some hot grub t night doant you let her go in t water again jack what on airth made her tak it into her head to go into t water noo i wonder  i cant help it if she wants to jack said she doant mind i not when she doant want to mind i welted her tother day when she wanted to go at parsons coo but she got hold o t stick and pulled it out o my hand  and quite raight too bill haden said dont ee try to welt they dogs or ill welt thee  i doant care the child said sturdily if i goes out in charge o they dogs theys got to mind me and how can i make em mind me if i doant welt em what would ee say to i if bess got had up afore the court for pinning t parsons coo  as no ready reply occurred to bill haden to this question he returned to his meal juno and bess watched him gravely till he had finished and then having each received a lump of meat put carefully aside for them returned to the fire jack curling himself up beside them lay with his head on junos body and slept till mrs haden having cleared the table and washed up the things sent him out to play her husband having at the conclusion of his meal lighted his pipe and strolled over to the chequers  bill haden had according to his lights been a good father to the child of his old mate simpson he treated him just as if he had been his own he spent twopence a day less in beer than before and gave his wife fourteen pence in addition to her weekly money for household expenses for milk for the kid just as he allowed twopence a day each for bones for juno and bess he also when requested by his wife handed over what sum was required for clothing and shoes not without grumbling however and comparisons as to the wants of dorgs and boys eminently unfavourable to the latter the weekly twopence for schooling mrs haden had during the year that jack had been at school paid out of her housekeeping money knowing that the expenses of the dogs afforded no precedent whatever for such a charge  bill haden was however liberal to the boy in many ways and when in a good temper would often bestow such halfpence as he might have in his pocket upon him and now and then taking him with him into town returned with such clothes and shoes that mother held up her hands at the extravagance  among his young companions jack was liked but feared when he had money he would purchase bullseyes and collecting all his acquaintances distribute them among them but he was somewhat sedate and oldfashioned in his ways from his close friendships with such thoughtful and meditative animals as juno and bess and when his wrath was excited he was terrible never uttering a cry however much hurt he would fight with an obstinacy and determination which generally ended by giving him the victory for if he once got hold of an antagonists hairpinning coming to him naturallyno amount of blows or illtreatment could force him to leave go until his agonized opponent confessed himself vanquished  it was not often however that jack came in contact with the children of his own age his duties as guardian of the dorgs absorbed the greater part of his time and as one or both of these animals generally accompanied him when he went beyond the door few cared about having anything to say to him when so attended for the guardianship was by no means entirely on his side and however excellent their qualities and pure their breed neither juno nor bess were animals with whom strangers would have ventured upon familiarity  jacks reports to his dad of besss inclination to attack t parsons coo was not without effect although bill haden had made no remark at the time that night however he observed to his wife ive been a thinking it over jane and i be come to the opinion that its better t boy should not go out any more wi t dorgs let em bide at home ill take em oot when they need it if bess takes it into her head to pin a coo there might be trouble an i doant want trouble her last litter o pups brought me a ten pun note and if they had her oop at a court and swore her life away as a savage brute which she aint no way it would pretty nigh break my heart  the execution of this as of many other good intentions however was postponed until an event happened which led to jacks being definitely relieved of the care of his canine friends  two years had passed when one morning jack was calmly strolling along the road accompanied by juno and bess a gig came rapidly along containing two young bagmen as commercial travellers were still called in stokebridge the driver seeing a child with two dogs conceived that this was a favourable opportunity for a display of that sense of playful humour whose point lies in the infliction of pain on others without any danger of personal consequences to the inflictor  with a sharp sweep he brought down his whip across jacks back managing to include bess in the stroke  jack set up a shout of mingled pain and indignation and stooping for a stone hurled it after the man who had struck him besss response to the assault upon her was silent but as prompt and far more effectual with two springs she was beside the horse and leaping up caught it by the nostrils and dragged it to the ground  juno at once joined in the fray and made desperate attempts to climb into the gig and seize its inmates who had nearly been thrown out as the horse fell  recovering himself the driver pale with terror clubbed his whip and struck at juno with the buttend  dont ee hit her jack cried as he arrived on the spot if thou dost shell tear ee limb from limb  call the brute off you little rascal cried the other its killing the horse  thoud best keep a civil tongue in thy head the child said coolly or it will be bad for ee what did ee hit i and bess for it would serve ee roight if she had pinned ee instead o t horse  call them off the fellow shouted as junos teeth met in close proximity to his leg  it be all very well to say call em orf jack said but they doant moind i much have ee got a strap  the man hastily threw down a strap and this jack passed through junos collar she being too absorbed in her efforts to climb into the gig to heed what the child was doing then he buckled it to the wheel  noo he said ye can light down t other side she caant reach ee there  the young men leapt down and ran to the head of the horse the poor brute was making frantic efforts to rise but the bulldog held him down with her whole might  jack shouted and pulled but in vain bess paid no attention to his voice  can you bite his tail one of the frightened men said ive heard that is good  boite her tail jack said in contempt doant yer see shes a fullbred un ye moight boite her tail off and she would care nowt about t ive got summat here that may do  he drew out a twisted paper from his pocket  this is snuff he said if owt will make her loose this will now one o yer take holt by her collar on each side and hoult tight yer know or shell pin ye when she leaves go o the horse then when she sneezes you pull her orf and hoult fast  the fear of the men that the horse would be killed overpowered their dread of the dog and each took a firm grip upon its collar then jack placed a large pinch of snuff to its nostrils a minute later it took effect the iron jaws unclosed with a snap and in an instant bess was snatched away from the horse which delivered from its terrible foe sank back groaning on the road bess made the most furious attempts to free herself from her captors but in vain and juno strained desperately at the strap to come to the assistance of her offspring  ha ye got another strap jack asked  theres a chain in the box under the seat  jack with some difficulty and an amount of deliberation for which the men could gladly have slain him climbed up into the gig and presently came back with the chain  noo tak her round to t other side o gig he said well fasten her just as juno is  when bess was securely chained to the wheel the men ran to raise the horse who lay with its head in a pool of blood  theres a pond in yon field jack said if ee wants water  after bess was secured jack had slipped round to juno and kept his hand upon the buckle in readiness to loose her should any attempt be made upon his personal safety the men however were for the moment too scared to think of him it was some time before the horse was got on to its legs with a wet cloth wrapped round its bleeding wound fortunately besss grip had included the bitstrap as well as the nostrils and this had somewhat lessened the serious nature of the hurt  jack had by this time pacified the dogs and when the men looked round after getting the horse on to its legs they were alarmed to see him standing by quietly holding the dogs by a strap passing through their collar  doant ee try to get into that ere cart he said youve got to go wi me back to stokebridge to t lockoop for hitting i and bess now do you walk quietly back and lead t horse and oill walk beside ee and if thou movst or tries to get away oill slip t dogs you see if i doant  you little villain began one of the men furiously but a deep growl from bess in reply to the angry tone at once silenced him and burning with rage they turned the horses head back towards the village and walked on accompanied by jack and his dogs on guard  the arrival of this procession created much excitement and a crowd of women and children soon gathered jack however serenely indifferent to questions and shouts proceeded coolly on his way until he arrived at the residence of the local constable who hearing the din appeared at his door  maister johnson the child says i give them chaps in charge for saulting i and bess  and we give this little ruffian in charge shouted the men secure that in face of the constable and crowd jack could not loose his terrible bulldogs for setting his dogs at us to the risk of our lives and the injury of our horse which is so much hurt that we believe it will have to be killed  just at this moment bill hadenwho had returned from work at the moment that a boy running in reported that there was a row that a horse was covered wi blood and two chaps all bluidy over t hands and clothes were agoing along wi jack and t dorgs oop street to lockooparrived upon the spot  whats oop lad he asked as he came up  they chaps hit i and bess dad and bess pinned t horse and juno would ha pinned em boath hadnt i strapped she oop and then we got bess orf and i brought em back to t lockoop  how dar ee hit my lad bill haden said angrily stepping forward threateningly  look oot dad or t dogs will be at em again jack shouted  bill seized the strap from the childs hand and with a stern word silenced the dogs  well the constable said i cant do nowt but bring both parties afore mr brook i the morning i suppose i neednt lock ee all oop bill will you bind yourself to produce jack simpson tmorrow  ay said bill oill produce him and hell produce hisself im thinking seems to me as jack be able to take s own part  this sally was received with laughter and applause for local feeling was very strong in stokebridge and a storm of jeers and rough chaff were poured upon the bagmen for having been brought in prisoners by a child  theed best get away to th inn the constable said else theyll be a stoaning thee next there be only two on us here and if they takes to t we shant be able to do much  so the men leading their horse went off to the inn groaned and hooted at by the crowd on the way on their arrival a messenger was at once sent off for a veterinary surgeon who resided some four miles away  on the following morning the parties to the quarrel the two bagmen and the injured horse on the one hand and jack simpson with the two bulldogs under charge of bill haden on the other appeared before mr brook owner of the vaughan pit and a county magistrate  jack first gave his account of the transaction clearly and with much decision  i war a walking along quiet wi t dogs he said when i hears a cart a coming from stokebridge i looks round and seed they two chaps but didnt mind no further about it till as they came oop that sandyhaired chap as was a driving lets me and bess ha one which made me joomp i can tell ee bess she pinned the horse and juno she tried to get into t cart at em they were joost frighted they hollers and yawps and looks as white as may be i fastens juno oop wi a strap and they houlds bess while i poot some snoof t her nose  put what mr brook asked  joost a pinch of snoof sir i heard feyther say as snoof would make dogs loose and so i bought a haporth and carried it in my pocket for th dogs dont moind oi when they are put oot and then they gets horse oop and i makes em come back to t lockoop but maister johnson he said looking reproachfully at the constable wouldnt lock em oop as i wanted him  there was some laughter among the audience and even the magistrate smiled the young men then gave their story they denied point blank that either of them had struck jack and described him as having set his dog purposely on the horse jack had loudly contradicted them shouting thats a lee but had been ordered to silence then drawing back he slipped off his jacket and shirt and when the evidence was closed he marched forward up to the magistrate bare to the waist  look at moi back he said that ull speak for itself  it did there was a red weal across the shoulder and an angry hiss ran through the court at the prisoners which was with difficulty suppressed  after what i have seen mr brook said there is no doubt whatever in my mind that the version given by this child is the correct one and that you committed a cowardly and unprovoked assault upon him for this you he said to the man who had driven the horse are fined £5 or a months imprisonment it is a good thing that cowardly fellows like you should be punished occasionally and had it not been that your horse had been severely injured i should have committed you to prison without option of a fine against you he said to the other there is no evidence of assault the charge against the child is dismissed but it is for the father to consider whether he will prosecute you for perjury at the same time i think that dogs of this powerful and ferocious kind ought not to be allowed to go out under the charge of a child like this  the man paid the fine but so great was the indignation of the crowd that the constable had to escort them to the railwaystation in spite of this they were so pelted and hustled on the way that they were miserable figures indeed when they arrived there  and so jack was released from all charge of the dorgs and benefited by the change new friendships for children of his own age took the place of that for the dogs and he soon took part in their games and from the energy and violence with which when once excited he threw himself into them became quite a popular leader mrs haden rejoiced over the change for he was now far more lively and more like other children than he had been although still generally silent except when addressed by her and drawn into talk he was as fond as ever of the dogs but that fondness was now a part only instead of the dominating passion of his existence and so months after months went on and no event of importance occurred to alter the current of jack simpsons life     chapter iii  the resolution   an artist sitting in the shade under a tree painting a bit of rustic gate and a lane bright with many honeysuckles presently he is conscious of a movement behind him and looking round sees a sturdily built boy of some ten years of age with an old bulldog lying at his feet and another standing by his side watching him  well lad what are you doing  nowt said the boy promptly  i mean the artist said with a smile have you anything to do if not i will give you sixpence to sit still on that gate for a quarter of an hour i want a figure  the boy nodded took his seat without a word and remained perfectly quiet while the artist sketched him in  that will do for the present the artist said you can come and sit down here and look at me at work if you like but if you have nothing to do for an hour dont go away as i shall want you again presently here is the sixpence you will have another if youll wait whats your name he went on as the boy threw himself down on the grass with his head propped up on his elbows  bulldog the lad said promptly and then colouring up added at least they call me bulldog but my right name be jack simpson  and why do they call you bulldog jack  the artist had a sympathetic voice and spoke in tones of interest and the lad answered frankly  motherthat is my real mothershe died when i were a little kid and juno here she had pups at the timenot that one shes flora three years old she beand they used to pretend she suckled me it baint likely be it he asked as if after all he was not quite sure about it himself schoolmaster says as how its writ that there was once two little rumuns suckled by a wolf but he cant say for sure that its true mother says its all a lie she fed me from a bottle but they called me bulldog from that and because juno and me always went about together and now they call me so because and he laughed i take a good lot of licking before i gives in  youve been to school i suppose jack  yes ive had five years schooling the boy said carelessly  and do you like it  i liked it well enough i learnt pretty easy and so scaped many hidings dad says it was cos my mother were a schoolmasters daughter afore she married my father and so learnings in the blood and comes natural but im done with school now and am going down the pit next week  what are you going to do there you are too young for work  oh i shant have no work to do int pit not hard workjust to open and shut a door when the tubs go through  you mean the coalwaggons  ay the tubs the boy said then in a year or two i shall get to be a butty that ull be better pay then i shall help dad in his stall and at last i shall be on full wages  and after that the artist asked  the lad looked puzzled  what will you look forward to after that  i dont know that theres nowt else the boy said except perhaps some day i might perhapsbut it aint likelybut i might get to be a viewer  but why dont you make up your mind to be something better still jacka manager  what exclaimed the boy incredulously a manager like fenton who lives in that big house on the hill why hes a gentleman  jack the artist said stopping in his work now and speaking very earnestly there is not a lad of your age in the land brought up as a miner or a mechanic or an artisan who may not if he sets it before him and gives his whole mind to it end by being a rich man and a gentleman if a lad from the first makes up his mind to three thingsto work to save and to learnhe can rise in the world you wont be able to save out of what you get at first but you can learn when your work is done you can read and study of an evening then when you get better wages save something when at twentyone or so you get mans wages live on less than half and lay by the rest dont marry till youre thirty keep away from the publichouse work study steadily and intelligently and by the time you are thirty you will have a thousand pounds laid by and be fit to take a managers place  dost mean that sir the boy asked quickly  i do jack my case is something like it my father was a village schoolmaster i went when about twelve years old to a pottery at burslem my father told me pretty well what i have told you i determined to try hard at any rate i worked in every spare hour to improve myself generally and i went three evenings a week to the art school i liked it and the master told me if i stuck to it i might be a painter some day i did stick to it and at twenty could paint well enough to go into that branch of pottery i stuck to it and at fiveandtwenty was getting as high pay as any one in burslem except one or two foreign artists i am thirty now i still paint at times on china but i am now getting well known as an artist and am i hope a gentleman  ill do it the boy said rising slowly to his feet and coming close to the artist ill do it sir they call me bulldog and ill stick to it  very well the artist said holding out his hand thats a bargain jack now give me your name and address here are mine its the 1st of june today now perhaps it will help you a little if i write to you on the 1st of june every year and you shall answer me telling me how you are getting on and whether i can in any way give you help or advice if i dont get an answer from you i shall suppose that you have got tired of it and have given it up  dont you never go to suppose that sir the boy said earnestly if thou doesnt get an answer thoullt know that ive been killed as father was in a fall or an explosion thank you sir and the boy walked quietly off with the old bulldog lazily waddling behind him  there are the makings of a man in that boy the artist said to himself i wish though i had finished his figure before we began to talk about his plans for the future i shall be very proud of that boy if he ever makes a name for himself  that evening jack sat on a low stool and gazed into the fire so steadily and silently that bill haden albeit not given to observe his moods asked  what ailst lad what best thinkin o  jacks thoughts were so deep that it took him some time to shake them off and to turn upon his stool  oim thinking o getting larning  thinking o getting larning the miner repeated in astonishment why ee be just a dun o getting larning ee ha been at it for the last foive year lad and noo thoust going to be done wi it and to work in the pit  oim a going to work in the pit dad and oim a gwine to get larning too oive made oop my mind and oim gwine to do it  but baint ee got larning the miner said thou canst read and write foine which is more nor i can do and what dost want more  oim a going to get larning jack said again steadily repeating the formula and oim gwine soom day to be a manager  bill haden stared at the boy and then burst into a fit of laughter well this bangs a  mrs haden was as surprised but more sympathetic  bless the boy what hast got in your head now  jack showed not the slightest sign of discomfiture at his fathers laughter  i met a chap today he said in answer to mrs haden as told i that if i made up my moind to work and joost stuck to t i could surely make a man o myself and might even roise soom day to be a manager and im a going to do it  doant ee say a word to check the boy bill mrs haden said to her husband as he was about to burst out into jeering remarks i tell ee what jack says he sticks to and you oughter know that by this time what the man whosever he might be said was right jack she went on turning to the boy larning is a great thing so far you aint showed any turn for larning jack as i ever seed but if you get it you may raise yourself to be an overman or a viewer though i doant say a manager that seems too far away altogether if you stick to what you say you may do it jack i cant help you in larning for i aint got none myself but if i can help you in any other way i ull and so ull feyther though he does laugh a bit  he be roight enough to laugh jack said for i haint had any turn that way i doant know as i ha now but im a going to try and if trying can do it he said in his steady tones oill do it i think i ha got some o the bulldog strain in me and ill hoult on to it as bess would hoult on to a mans throat if she pinned him  i know you will my lad mrs haden said while her husband lighting his pipe and turning to go out said  it matters nowt to me one way or tother but moind lad larning or no larning thoust got to go into the pit next week and arn your living  jack mrs haden said presently dost know i wouldnt do nowt wi this new fancy o thine not till arter thoust a been to work i the pit for a while a week or two will make no differ to ee and thou doant know yet how tired yell be when ye coom oop nor how thoult long for the air and play wi lads o thy own age i believe jack quite believe that thou best in arnest on it and i know well that when thou dost begin thoult stick to t but it were better to wait till thou knowst what tis thou art undertaking  jack felt that there was a good deal in what his mother said very well mother twant make no differ to me but oill do as th asks me     chapter iv  the vaughan pit   among the group of men and boys assembled round the mouth of the vaughan pit on the 7th of june were two little lads jack simpson and harry shepherd who were to make the descent for the first time the boys were fast friends harry was the taller but was slighter than jack and far less sturdy and strong both were glad that they were to go into the pit for although the life of a gateboy is dull and monotonous yet in the pit villages the boys look forward to it as marking the first step in a mans life as putting school and lessons behind and as raising them to a position far in advance of their former associates  nowadays the law has stepped in and the employment of such mere children in the mines is forbidden but at that time it had not been changed and if a boy was big enough to shut a door he was big enough to go into a mine  dost feel skeary jack harry asked  noa jack said what be there to be skeary aboot i beant afeard of the dark and they say in time ee get used to it and can see pretty nigh loike a cat there be dad a calling goodbye harry ill see thee tonight  the yard of the vaughan resembled that of other large collieries it was a large space black and grimy on which lines of rails were laid down in all directions on these stood trains of waggons while here and there were great piles of coal in the centre rose up a lofty scaffolding of massive beams at the top of this was the wheel over which a strong wire rope or band ran to the winding engine close by while from the other end hung the cage a wooden box some six feet square at the corner of this box were clips or runners which fitted on to the guides in the shaft and so prevented any motion of swinging or swaying so smoothly do these cages work that standing in one as it is lowered or drawn up only a very slight vibration or tremor tells that you are in motion near the square house in which stood the winding engine was another precisely similar occupied by the pumping engine  the vaughan was worked by a single shaft divided by a strong wooden partition into two one of these known as the downcast shaft that is the shaft through which the air descends into the mine the other the upcast through which the current having made its way through all the windings and turnings of the roadways below again ascends to the surface this system of working by a single shaft however is very dangerous as in the event of an explosion both shafts may become involved in the disaster and there will be no means of getting at the imprisoned miners nowadays all wellregulated mines have two shafts one at a distance from the other but this was less common thirty years back and the vaughan like most of its neighbours was worked with a single shaft  each miner before descending went to the lamproom and received a lighted davy as almost every one is aware the principle of this lamp and indeed of all that have since been invented is that flame will not pass through a close wiregauze the lamp is surrounded with this gauze and although should the air be filled with gas to an explosive point it will ignite if it comes in contact with flame the gauze prevents the light of the lamp from exploding the gascharged air outside when the air is of a very explosive character even the davylamps have to be extinguished as the heat caused by the frequent ignitions within the lamp raises the gauze to a red heat and the gas beyond will take fire  jack took his place in the cage with bill haden and as many others as it could contain he gave a little start as he felt a sudden sinking the sides of the shaft seemed to shoot up all round him wet shining and black a few seconds and the light of day had vanished and they were in darkness save that overhead was a square blue patch of sky every moment diminishing in size  best afeard jack bill haden asked raising his lamp so as to get a sight of the boys face  noa why should i jack said i heard ee say that the ropes were new last month so there aint nothin to be afeard on  that is the young un they call bulldog aint it bill  ay bill haden answered hes game he is you cant make him yelp ive licked him till i was tired but he never whimpered now then out you go and as the cage stopped the men all stepped out and started for the places in which they were working  coom along jack the viewer told me to put you at no 10 gate  it was ten minutes fastand as jack thought very unpleasantwalking the sleepers on which the rails for the corves or little waggons were laid were very slippery pools of water stood between them and often covered them and blocks of coal of all sizes which had shaken from the corves lay in the road when it was not water it was black mud sometimes a line of waggons full or empty stood on the rails and to pass these they had to squeeze against the damp walls before he reached his post the gloss of jacks new mining clothes had departed for ever the white jumper was covered with black smears and two or three falls on the slippery wooden sleepers had effectively blackened his canvas trousers  there lad bill haden said at length holding his lamp high to afford a general view of the situation thats your place  the place was a hollow like a cupboard some five feet high two deep and a little wider there was a wooden seat in it a peg or two had been driven into the rock to hang things from and a handful or so of hay upon the ground showed that jacks predecessor had an idea of comfort  there you are and not a bad place either jack you see this cord now when thou hearst a team of corves coming along pull yon end and open the door when they have passed let go the cord and the door shuts o tself for its got a weight and pulley its thy business to see that it has shut for if a chunk of coal has happened to fall and stops the door from shutting the ventilation goes wrong and we all goes to kingdom come in no time thats all thoust got to do cept to keep awake of course you woant do that no boy does so that you larn to wake up when the corves come along that ull do foine  but if i doant jack asked  well if thou doant thoult get waked with a cuff o th ear by the driver and it depends on what sort o chap he be how hard the cuff thoult get i doant think thoult feel lonely here for along that side road they bring down other corves and the horse comes and takes em on on this main road the horses go through to the upper end of the mine half a mile farther  how do it make a differ whether this door be open or shut father  well lad the air comes up the road we ha come by now its wanted to go round about by the workings on that side road this door be put to stop it from going by the straight road so theres nothing for it but for to go round by the workings maybe for a mile maybe three miles till it gets back into the main road again so when the door is open the ventilation is checked right round the workings so mind doant ee open the door till the horse is close to it and shut it directly its past  when the door closed behind his fosterfather and jack simpson remained alone in the dense darkness a feeling of utter loneliness and desertion stole over him the blackness was intense and absolute a low confused murmur the reverberation of faroff noises in the pit sounded in his ears he spoke and his voice sounded muffled and dull  this be worse nor i looked for the boy said to himself i suppose ill get used to it but i doant wonder that some young uns who aint strong as i be are badly frighted at first  presently the confused noise seemed to get louder then a distinct rumble was heard and jack felt with delight that a train of waggons was approaching then he saw far along the gallery a light swinging as the man who bore it walked ahead of the horse the water in the little pools between the sleepers reflected it in a score of little lines of light now he could hear the hollow splashing sound of the horses hoofs and prepared to answer to the shout of door by pulling at the string beside him when the light came within twenty yards it changed its direction he heard the grating of the wheels against the points and saw that the waggons were going up the other road there upon a siding they came to a stop and a minute or two later a number of full waggons were brought down by another horse a few words were exchanged by the drivers but jacks ear unaccustomed to the echoes of a mine could not catch what they said then the first man hitched his horse on to the full waggons and started for the shaft while the other with the empties went up the road to the workings  the incident slight as it had been had altogether dissipated the feeling of uneasiness of which jack had been conscious before he had seemed shut out from the world as if within a living tomb but the sight of men engaged at their ordinary work close by him completely restored the balance of his mind and henceforth he never felt the slightest discomfort at being alone in the dark  a few minutes after the rumbling of the departing train of tubs had died in his ear he again heard it again he watched the slowly approaching light and when it came within a few yards of him he heard the expected shout of gate he replied by a shout of all right and as the driver came level with him pulled the cord and the door opened  glong smiler the driver said and the horse went forward the man leaned forward and raised his lamp to jacks face  i thawt twasnt jim browns voice who best thou  jack simpson i live along wi bill haden  ay ay i knowst i knew thy father a good sort he was too best thy first day doon the pit  ay jack said  foind it dark and lonesome eh thoult get used to it soon  how often do the corves come along jack asked as the man prepared to run on after the waggons the last of which had just passed  there be a set goes out every ten minutes maybe on this road and every twenty minutes on the other two o ours to one o theirs and he moved forward  jack let the door slam after him went out and felt that it had shut firmly and then resumed his seat in his niche he whistled for a bit and then his thoughts turned to the learning which he had determined firmly to acquire  i wish id ha took to it afore he said to himself what a sight o time i ha lost ill go over in my head all the lessons i can remember and them as i doant know and thats the best part i reckon ill look up when i get hoame every day what i learns fresh ill go over down here i shall get it perfect then and it will pass the time away finely ill begin at oncet twice two is four and so jack passed the hours of his first day in the pit recalling his lessons reproaching himself continually and bitterly with the time he had wasted breaking off every ten minutes from his rehearsals to open the door for the train of corves going in empty and going out full exchanging a few words each time with the drivers all of whom were goodnaturedly anxious to cheer up the new boy who must as they supposed be feeling the loneliness of his first day in the pit keenly such was by no means the case with jack and he was quite taken by surprise when a driver said to him this be the last train this shift  why it beant nigh two oclock surely he said  it be the driver said wants ten minutes thats all  soon the miners began to come along  hullo jack bill hadens voice said best still here come along of me why didst stop lad thou canst always quit thy post when the first man comes through on his way out hast felt it lonely lad  not a bit dad  thats strange too bill said most young boys finds it awful lonely o first i know i thowt that first day were never coming to an end werent frighted at t dark  i thought it was onnatural dark and still the first ten minutes jack admitted honestly but arter the first set o corves came along i never thawt no more about the dark  here we are at the shaft joomp in theres just room for you and me     chapter v  setting to work   a week after jack simpson had gone to work in the vaughan there was a knock one evening at the door of the schoolmaster of the stokebridge national school  please mr merton can i speak to ee  what is that you jack simpson the schoolmaster said holding the candle so that its light fell upon the boy before him yes come in my boy the lad followed him into the parlour sit down jack now what is it nothing the matter at home i hope  noa sir i wanted to ask ee what books i orter read so that i may grow up a clever man  bless me jack mr merton said why i never expected this from you  noa sir but i ha made up my mind to get on and i means to work hard i ha been told sir that if i studies at books in all my spare time and saves my money and works well i may get up high some day and the boy looked wistfully up in the masters face for a confirmation of what had been told him  thats quite right jack whoever told you hard work study thrift and intelligence will take any lad from the bottom of the tree to the top and you are quite in earnest jack  quite sir  the schoolmaster sat in silence for a little time  well my boy for a bit you must work at ordinary schoolbooks and get a fair general knowledge and be careful to observe the way things are expressedthe grammar i mean read aloud when you are alone and try in speaking to get rid of thees and thous and other mistakes of speech i can lend you ordinary schoolbooks fit for you for the next four or five years and will always explain any difficulties you may meet with the books you will want afterwards you can buy secondhand at wolverhampton or birmingham but there will be time to talk about that hereafter what time have you to study you have gone into the vaughan pit have you not  yes sir i ha time enough all day for i ha nowt to do but just to open and shut a door when the tubs come along but i ha no light  the time must seem very long in the dark all day  it do seem long sir and it will be wuss when i want to read and know i am just wasting time but i can read at home after work when dad goes out its light now and i could read out o doors till nine oclock mother would give me a candle now and again and i should get on first rate in the pit but the vaughan is a fiery vein and they ha nowt but daveys  well my boy here are a few books which will suit you for a time let me know how you are getting on and when you have mastered the books let me know remember you want to learn them thoroughly and not just well enough to rub through without getting the strap but dont overdo it you are a very small boy yet and it is of as much importance for your future life that you should grow strong in body as well as in brain so you must not give up play if you were to do nothing but sit in the dark and to study at all other times you would soon become a fool so you must give time to play as well as to work remember do not be cast down with difficulties they will pass by if you face them there is an old saying god helps those who help themselves and look here jack i can tell you the best way to make the time pass quickly while you are in the dark set yourself sums to do in your head you will find it difficult at first but it will come easier with practice and as you get on i will give you a book on mental arithmetic and you will find that there is nothing more useful than being able to make complicated calculations in your head  the next six months passed quickly with jack simpson he started early with his father for the pit and the hours there which at first had seemed so long slipped by rapidly as he multiplied and added and subtracted finding that he could daily master longer lines of figures of an afternoon he played with the other pit boys and after that worked steadily at his books till eleven oclock two hours after bill haden and his wife had gone to bed once a week he went in the evening to mr merton who was astonished at the progress that the boy was making and willingly devoted an hour to explaining difficulties and helping him on with his work  satisfied now that the boy was in earnest mr merton a few days afterwards took occasion when mr brook the owner of the vaughan mine called in on school business to tell him how one of the pit boys was striving to educate himself  he is really in earnest merton it is not a mere freak  no mr brook the lad will stick to it im sure he goes by the nickname of bulldog and i dont think he is badly named he has both the pluck and the tenacity of one  very well merton i am glad you spoke to me about it i wish a few more boys would try and educate themselves for viewers and underground managers it is difficult indeed to get men who are anything but working miners ill make a note of his name  a few days afterwards mr brook after going through the books went over the mine with the underground manager  do the waggons often get off the metals along this road evans he asked stopping at one of the doors which regulate the ventilation  pretty often sir the rails are not very true and the sleepers want renewing  it would be as well if there were an extra light somewhere here it would be handy this is number ten door is it not  yes sir  who is this a new hand is he not raising his lamp so as to have a full look at the lad who was standing respectfully in the niche in the rock cut for him  yes sir he is the son of a hand who was killed in the pit some ten years agosimpson  ah i remember mr brooks said well serve the boy a lamp out when he goes down of a day youll be careful with it lad and not let it fall  oh yes sir jack said in a tone of delight and please sir may i read when i am not wanted  certainly you may his master said only you must not neglect your work and then mr brook went on leaving jack so overjoyed that for that afternoon at least his attempts at mental arithmetic were egregious failures     chapter vi  the old shaft   in the corner of a rough piece of ground near the vaughan was situated what was known as the old shaft it had been made many years before with a view to working coal there the owners of the vaughan which at the time was just commencing work had however bought up the ground and as it adjoined their own and could be worked in connection with it they stopped the sinking here this was so long ago that the rubbish which had formed a mound round the mouth of the shaft had been long covered with vegetation and a fence placed round the pit had fallen into decay  the shaft had been sunk some fifty fathoms but was now full of water to within forty feet of the surface some boards covered the top and the adventurous spirits among the boys would drop stones through the openings between them and listen to the splash as they struck the water below or would light pieces of paper and watch them falling into the darkness until they disappeared suddenly as they touched the water  the winch used in the process of excavation remained and round it was a portion of the chain so old and rusty as to be worthless for any purpose whatever lengths had from time to time been broken off by boys who would unwind a portion and then three or four pull together until the rusteaten links gave way and the boys came to the ground with a crash it was a dirty game however dirty even for pit boys for the yellow rust would stick to hands and clothes and be very difficult to remove  one saturday afternoon a group of boys and girls of from ten to fourteen were playing in the field presently it was proposed to play king of the castle or a game akin thereto half a dozen holding the circular mound round the old pit while the rest attacked them and endeavoured to storm the position for some time the game went on with much shouting on the part of the boys and shrill shrieks from the girls as they were pulled or pushed down the steep bank  let us make a charge a together said jack simpson who although not thirteen was the leader of the attacking party  then heading the rush he went at full speed at the castle harry shepherd who was one of the defenders was at the top but jack had so much impetus that he gained his footing and thrust harry violently backwards  the top of the bank was but three feet wide and within sloped down to the mouth of the old pit shaft fifteen feet below harry tottered and to avoid falling backwards turned and with great strides ran down the bank he was unable to arrest his course but went through the rotten fence and on to the boarding of the shaft there was a crash a wild cry and harry disappeared from the sight of his horrorstricken companions the rotten woodwork had given way and the boy had fallen into the old shaft  a panic seized the players some rushed away at the top of their speed shouting harry shepherd has fallen down the old shaft others stood paralysed on the top of the mound girls screamed and cried two only appeared to have possession of their wits the one was jack simpson the other was a girl of about twelve nelly hardy jack did not hesitate an instant but quickly ran down to the shaft nelly more quietly but with an earnest set face followed him jack threw himself down by the edge and peered down the shaft  harry harry he shouted beest killed a sort of low cry came up  he be alive he be drowning jack exclaimed quick get off them boords  nelly at once attempted to aid jack to lift the boards aside  coom jack shouted to the boys on the top what beest feared of thou art shamed by this lass here coom along and help us  several of the boys hurried down stung by jacks taunt and half the boards were soon pulled off  what beest goin to do jack  go down to be sure jack said catch hold o th windlass  the chain woant hold you jack  it maun hold me jack said  it woant hold two jack  lower away and hold thee jaw jack said i am going to send him up first if he be alive lower away i say  jack caught hold of the end of the rusty chain and the boys lowered away as rapidly as they could  jack held on stoutly and continued to shout hold on harry i be acoming another minute and ill be with ee  the chain held firmly and jack swung downward safely  the shaft was of considerable size and the openings in the planks had enabled the air to circulate freely consequently there was no bad air as jack reached the water he looked eagerly round and then gave a cry of joy above the water he saw a hand grasping a projecting piece of rock  harry could not swim but he had grasped the edge of a projecting stone near which he had fallen and when his strength had failed and he had sunk below the surface his hand still retained its grasp  lower away jack shouted and the chain was slackened  jack could swim a little just enough to cross the stokebridge canal where the water was only out of his depth for some fifteen feet in the middle first he took off his handkerchief from his neck a strong cotton birdseye and keeping hold of the chain before him swam to the spot where the hand was above water he had a terrible fear of its slipping and disappearing below the dark pool and was careful to make a firm grasp at it he was surprised to find the body was of no weight without a moments delay he managed to bind the wrist fast to the chain with his handkerchief  above there he shouted  ay came down  wind up very steadily dont jerk it now slowly the winch revolved and the body began to rise from the water  jack clung to the stone which harry had grasped and looked upwards he wondered vaguely whether it would ever reach the top he wondered whether the arm would pull out of the socket and the body plump down into the water he wondered how long he could hold on and why his clothes seemed so heavy he wondered whether if his strength went before the chain came down again his hand would hold on as harrys had done or whether he should go down to the bottom of the shaft how far was it fifty fathoms three hundred feet he was fifty below the mouth two hundred and fifty to sink how long would his body be getting to the bottom what would his mother and bill haden say would they ever try to get his body up  illustration in the old shaftwill he be saved  he was growing very weak as from another world he had heard the shout from above when the body of harry shepherd reached the brink and afterwards some vague murmurs presently his fingers slipped and he went down in the black pool the chill of the water to his face the sudden choking sensation brought his senses back for a moment and he struck to the surface  there touching the water he saw the chain and as he grasped it heard the shouts of his comrades above calling to him he was himself again now the chain being some feet below the surface he managed to pass it round him and to twist it in front he was too exhausted to shout  he saw a great piece of paper on fire fluttering down and heard a shout as its light showed him on the end of the chain then he felt a jar and felt himself rising from the water after that he knew nothing more until he opened his eyes and found himself lying on the bank  nelly hardy was kneeling by him and his head was in her lap he felt various hands rubbing him and slapping the palms of his hands his animation was quickly restored he had swallowed but little water and it was the close air of the shaft which had overpowered him  hallo he said shaking himself let me up i be all right hows harry  harry had not yet come round though some of them trying to restore him to consciousness said that they had heard him breathe once jack as usual took the command ordered all but two or three to stand back told nelly hardy to lift harrys head and undo his shirt stripped him to the waist and then set the boys to work to rub vigorously on his chest whether the efforts would have been successful is doubtful but at this moment there was a sound of hurrying feet and of rapid wheels  those who had started at the first alarm had reached the village and told the news and most fortunately had met the doctor as he drove in from his rounds a man with a rope had leaped into the gig and the doctor as he drove off had shouted that hot blankets were to be prepared  when he reached the spot and heard that harry had been brought to bank he leapt out climbed the mound wrapped him in his coat carried him down to his gig and then drove back at full speed to stokebridge where with the aid of hot blankets and stimulants the lad was brought back to consciousness  jack simpson was the hero of the hour and the pitmen accustomed to face death as they were yet marvelled at a boy trusting himself to a chain which looked unfit to bear its own weight only and into the depth of a well where the air might have been unfit to breathe  jack strenuously and indeed angrily disclaimed all credit whatever  i didnt think nowt about the chain nor the air nor the water neither i thought only o harry it was me as had pushed him down and id got to bring him oop if i hadnt a gone down nelly hardy would ha gone though she be a lass and doant know how to swim or to hold on by a chain or nowt but shed ha gone i tell ee if i hadnt i saw it in her face she didnt say nowt but she was ready to go if she hadnt gone down to th shaft none of them would ha gone shes a rare plucked un she is i tell ee  but in spite of jacks indignant repudiation of any credit the brave action was the talk of stokebridge and of the neighbouring pit villages for some time there are no men appreciate bravery more keenly than pitmen for they themselves are ever ready to risk their lives to save those of others consequently a subscription the limit of which was sixpence and the minimum a penny was set on foot and a fortnight later jack was presented with a gold watch with an inscription  this was presented in the schoolroom and mr brook who presided at the meeting added on his own account a chain to match it needed almost force on the part of bill haden to compel jack to be present on this occasion when he was led up flushed with confusion to mr brook amid the cheers of the crowd of those in the room he listened with head hung down to the remarks of his employer  when that gentleman finished and held out the watch and chain jack drew back and held up his head  i doant loike it sir i pushed harry in and in course i went down to pick him out besides harrys my chum he be was it loikely i should stand by and he drowning i tell ee sir that you aint said a word about the lass nelly hardy she had pluck she had the boys ran away or stood and stared but she came down as quiet as may be i tell ee sir her face was pale but she was as steady and as still as a man could ha been and did as i told her wiout stopping for a moment and wiout as much as saying a word shed ha gone down if id told her to where be ye nelly hardy coom oot and let me show ye to mr brook  but nelly who was indeed in the building had shrunk away when jack began to speak and having gained the door was on the point of flying when she was seized and brought forward looking shamefaced and sullen  that be her sir jack said triumphantly and i say this watch and chain ought to be hers for she did much more for a lass than i did for a boy and had no call to dot as i had  i cannot give them to her jack mr brook said for the watch has been subscribed for you but as a token of my appreciation of the bravery and presence of mind she has shown i will myself present her with a silver watch and chain with an inscription saying why it was given to her and this she will i am sure value all her life  perhaps she would but at present her only thought was to get away her hair was all rough she had on a tattered dress and had only slipped in when those in charge of the door were intent upon hearing mr brooks address without a word of thanks the instant the hands restraining her were loosed she dived into the crowd and escaped like a bird from a snare satisfied that justice had been done jack now said a few words of thanks to his employer and the subscribers to his present and the meeting then broke up jack returning with bill haden and his mother both beaming with delight  i be roight down glad lad i doant know as ive been so glad since junos dam won the first prize for purebred bulldogs at the birmingham show it seems joost the same sort o thing doant it jane     chapter vii  friendship   nelly hardy had been unfortunate in her parents for both drank and she had grown up without care or supervision she had neither brother nor sister at school she was always either at the top or bottom of her class according as a fit of diligence or idleness seized her she was a wild passionate child feeling bitterly the neglect with which she was treated her ragged clothes her unkempt appearance she was feared and yet liked by the girls of her own age for she was generous always ready to do a service and goodtempered except when excited to passion she was fonder of joining with the boys when they would let her in their games and when angered was ready to hold her own against them with tooth and nail  so wild were her bursts of passion that they were sources of amusement to some of the boys until jack upon one occasion took her part and fought and conquered the boy who had excited her this was on the saturday before the accident had taken place  for some days after the presentation no one saw her she kept herself shut up in the house or wandered far away  then she appeared suddenly before jack simpson and harry shepherd as they were out together  i hate you jack simpson she said i hate you i hate you and then dashed through the gap in the hedge by which she had come  well harry exclaimed in astonishment only to think  it be natral enough jack said and i baint surprised one bit i orter ha known better i had only to ha joodged her by myself and i should ha seen it i hated being dragged forward and talked at it was bad enough though i had been made decent and clean scrubbed all over and got my soonday clothes on but of course it would be worse for a lass anyway and she was all anyhow not expecting it i ought to ha known better i thawt only o my own feelings and not o hers and id beg her pardon a hundred times but taint likely shed forgive me what is she a doing now  the lads peered through the hedge far across the field on the bank the other side lay what looked like a bundle of clothes  she be a crying i expect jack said remorsefully i do wish some big chap would a come along and give i a hiding i wouldnt fight or kick or do nowt i would just take it it would serve me roight i wonder whether it would do her any good to let her thrash me if it would shed be welcome look here harry she baint angry wi you do thou go across to her and tell her how main sorry i be and that i know i am a selfish brute and thought o myself and not o her and say that if she likes i will cut her a stick any size she likes and let her welt me just as long as she likes wiout saying a word  harry was rather loath to go on such an errand but being imperatively ordered by jack he as usual did as his comrade wished when he approached nelly hardy he saw that the girl was crying bitterly her sobs shaking her whole body  i be coom wi a message he began in a tone of apprehension for he regarded nelly as resembling a wild cat in her dangerous and unexpected attacks  the girl leapt to her feet and turned her flushed tearstained cheeks and eyes flashing with anger through the tears upon him  what dost want harry shepherd get thee gone or ill tear the eyes from thy head  i doant coom o my own accord harry said steadily though he recoiled a little before her fierce outburst i came on the part o jack simpson and ive got to gi you his message even if you do fly at me ive got to tell you that he be main sorry and that he feels he were a selfish brute in a thinking o his own feelings instead o thine he says he be so sorry that if ee like hell cut a stick o any size you choose and ull let you welt him as long as you like wiout saying a word and when jack says a thing he means it so if you wants to wop him come on  to harrys intense surprise the girls mood changed she dropped on the ground again and again began to cry  after standing still for some time and seeing no abatement in her sobs or any sign of her carrying out the invitation of which he had been the bearer jacks emissary returned to him  i guv her your message jack and she said nowt but there she be a crying still  perhaps she didnt believe you jack said id best go myself  first with great deliberation jack chose a hazel stick from the hedge and tried it critically when fully assured that it was at once lissom and tough and admirably adapted for his purpose he told harry to go on home  maybe jack said she maynt loike to use it and you a looking on doant ee say a word to no un if she likes to boast as she ha welted me she ha a roight to do so but doant you say nowt  jack walked slowly across the field till he was close to the figure on the ground then he quietly removed his jacket and waistcoat and laid them down then he said  now nelly i be ready for a welting i ha deserved it if ever a chap did and ill take it heres the stick and hes a good un and will sting rare i warrant  the girl sat up and looked at him through her tears  oh jack and didst really think i wanted to welt thee  i didnt know whether thou didst or no nelly but thou said thou hatest me and wi good reason so if thou likest to welt me heres the stick  the girl laughed through her tears ah jack thou must think that i am a wild cat as john dobson called me tother day throw away that stick jack i would rather a thousand times that thou laidst it on my shoulders than i on thine  jack threw away the stick put on his coat and waistcoat and sat down on the bank  what is it then lass i know i were cruel to have thee called forward but i didnt think ot but i had rather that thou beat me as i orter be beaten than that thou should go on hating me  i doant hate thee jack though i said so i hate myself but i like thee better nor all thou art so brave and good  no braver than thou nelly jack said earnestly i doant understand why thou should first say thou hates me and then that thou doant but if thou are in earnest that thou likest me well be friends i dont mean that we go for walks together and such like as some boys and girls do for i ha no time for such things and i shouldnt like it even if i had but ill take thy part if anyone says owt to thee and thou shalt tell me when thou art very bad at hoamfor the failings of nellys parents were public property thou shalt be a friend to me not as a lass would be but as harry is and thou woant mind if i blow thee up and tells ee of things thou stook to me by the side o the shaft and ill stick to thee  ill do that the girl said laying her hand in his ill be thy friend if thoult let me not as lasses are but as lads  and so the friendship was ratified and they walked back together to the village when he came to think it over jack was inclined to repent his bargain for he feared that she would attach herself to him and that he would have much laughter to endure and many battles to fight to his surprise nelly did nothing of the sort she would be at her door every morning as he went by to the pit and give him a nod and again as he returned whenever other girls and boys were playing or sitting together nelly would make one of the group if he said as he often did say you nell hardy come and sit by me she came gladly but she never claimed the place she was ready to come or to go to run messages and to do him good in any way  jack had promised she should be his friend as harry was and as he got to like her more he would ask her or tell her to accompany them in their walks or to sit on a low wall in some quiet corner and talk harry stirred by his friends example had begun to spend half an hour a day over his old schoolbooks  why dost like larning so much jack nelly asked as jack was severely reproaching his friend with not having looked at a book for some days what good do it do  it raises folk in the world nell helps em make their way up  and dost thou mean to get oop i the world  ay lass jack said if hard work can do it i will but it does more nor that if a man knows things and loves reading it makes him different like hes got summat to think about and talk about and care for beside publichouses and dorgs canst read nell  no jack she said colouring it baint my fault mother never had the pence to spare for schooling and i was kept at hoam to help  jack sat thoughtful for some time  wouldst like to learn  ay  well ill teach thee  oh jack and she leapt up with flashing eyes how good thou beest  doant jack said crossly what be there good in teaching a lass to spell theres twopence run down to the corner shop and buy a spellingbook well begin at once  and so nelly had her first lesson  illustration nellys first lesson  after that every afternoon as jack came home from work the girl would meet him in a quiet corner off the general line and for five minutes he would teach her not hearing her say what she had learned but telling her fresh sounds and combinations of letters five or six times he would go over them and expectedfor jack was tyrannical in his waysthat she would carry them away with her and learn them by heart and go through them again and again so that when he questioned her during their longer talks she would be perfect  then the five minutes over jack would run on to make up for lost time and be in as soon as bill haden  but however accurately jack expected his pupil to learn his expectations were surpassed the girl beyond clearing up the room had nothing to do and she devoted herself with enthusiasm to this work once she had mastered simple words and felt her own progress her shyness as to her ignorance left her she always carried her book in her pocket and took to asking girls the pronunciation of larger words and begging them to read a few lines to her and sitting on the doorstep poring over her book she would salute any passerby with please tell us what is that word when she could read easily which she learned to do in two or three months she borrowed leftoff schoolbooks from the girls and worked slowly on and two years later had made up for all her early deficiencies and knew as much as any of those who had passed through the school  from the day of her compact of friendship with jack her appearance and demeanour had been gradually changing from the first her wild unkempt hair had been smoothly combed and braided though none but herself knew what hours of pain and trouble it took her with a bit of a comb with three teeth alone remaining to reduce the tangled mass of hair to order  her companions stared indeed with wonder on the first afternoon when thus transformed and with clean face she came among them with a new feeling of shyness  why it be nelly hardy why nell what ha done to tyself i shouldnt ha known ye well ye be cleaned up surely  the girl was half inclined to flame out at their greetings but she knew that the surprise was natural and laughed goodhumouredly she was rewarded for her pains when jack and some other boys passing on their way to play jack stopped a moment and said to her quietly well done lass thou lookst rarely whod ha thought thou wert so comely  as time went on nelly hardy grew altogether out of her old self sometimes indeed bursts of temper such as those which had gained her the name of the wild cat would flare out but these were very rare now she was still very poorly dressed for her house was as wretched as of old but there was an attempt at tidiness her manner too was softer and it became more and more quiet as things went on and her playmates wondered again and again what had come over nell hardy she had got to be as quiet as a mouse  the boys at first were disposed to joke jack upon this strange friendship but jack soon let it be understood that upon that subject joking was unacceptable  she stood by me he said and im agoing to stand by her she aint got no friends and im going to be her friend shes quiet enough and doant bother no more nor if she were a dorg she doant get in no ones way she doant want to play and sits quiet and looks on so if any of you doant like her near ye you can go away to t other side o field i wish shed been a boy twould ha been fitter all ways but she cant help that shes got the sense o one and the pluck and i like her there     chapter viii  progress   bless me lad another poond o candles i never did hear o sich waste mrs haden exclaimed as jack entered the cottage on a winters afternoon two years and a half after he had gone into the pit another poond o candles and it was only last monday as you bought the lastnigh two candles a night thou wilt kill thyself sitting up reading o nights and thy eyes will sink i thy head and thoult be as blind as a bat afore thourt forty  i only read up to eleven mother that gives me six hours abed and as thou know six for a man seven for a woman is all that is needful and as to the expense as dad lets me keep all my earnings save five bob a weekand very good o him it is i doant know no man in the pit as does as muchwhy i ha plenty o money for my candles and books and to lay by summat for a rainy day  aye aye lad i know thou best not wasteful save in candles its thy health i thinks o  health jack laughed why there aint a lad in the pit as strong as i am of my age and i ha never ailed a day yet and doant mean to  what ha ye been doing all the arternoon jack  i ha been sliding in the big pond wi harry shepherd and a lot o others then dick somers he knocked down harrys little sister fan as she came running across th ice and larfed out when she crieda great bruteso i licked he till he couldnt see out o his eyes  hes bigger nor thee too mrs haden said admiringly  aye hes bigger jack said carelessly but he aint game dick aint loses his temper he does and a chap as does that when hes fighting aint o no account but i must not stand a clappeting here its past six and six is my time  have your tea first jack its a ready but i do believe thoudst go wiout eating wiout noticing it when thoust got thy books in thy head  jack sat down and drank the tea his mother poured out for him and devoured bread and butter with a zest that showed that his appetite was unimpaired by study as soon as he had finished he caught up his candle and with a nod to mrs haden ran upstairs to his room  jack simpsons craze for learning as it was regarded by the other lads of stokebridge was the subject of much joking and chaff among them had he been a shy and retiring boy holding himself aloof from the sports of his mates ridicule would have taken the place of joking and persecution of chaff but jack was so much one of themselves a leader in their games a good fellow all round equally ready to play or to fight that the fact that after six oclock he shut himself up in his room and studied was regarded as something in the nature of a humorous joke  when he had first begun his comrades all predicted that the fit would not last and that a few weeks would see the end of it but weeks and months and years had gone by and jack kept on steadily at the work he had set himself to do amusement had long died away and there grew up an unspoken respect for their comrade  he be a rum un be jack they would say he looves games and can lick any chap his age anywhere round and yet he shoots himself oop and reads and reads hours and hours every day and he knows a heap bulldog does not that jack was in the habit of parading his acquirements indeed he took the greatest pains to conceal them and to show that in no respect did he differ from his playfellows  the two hours which he now spent twice a week with mr merton and his extensive reading had modified his rough staffordshire dialect and when with his master he spoke correct english almost free of provincialisms although with his comrades of the pit he spoke as they spoke and never introduced any allusion to his studies all questions as to his object in spending his evenings with his books were turned aside with joking answers but his comrades had accidentally discovered that he possessed extraordinary powers of calculation one of the lads had vaguely said that he wondered how many buckets of water there were in the canal between stokebridge and birmingham a distance of eighteen miles and jack without seeming to think of what he was doing almost instantaneously gave the answer to the question for a moment all were silent with surprise  i suppose that be a guess jack eh fred orme asked  noa jack said thats aboot roight though i be sorry i said it i joost reckoned it in my head  but how didst do that jack his questioner asked astonished while the boys standing round stared in silent wonder  oh in my head jack said carelessly it be easy enough to reckon in your head if you practise a little  and canst do any sum in thy head jack as quick as that  not any sum but anything easy say up to the multiplication or division by eight figures  lets try him one boy said  all right try away jack said do it first on a bit of paper and then ask me  the boys drew off in a body and a sum was fixed upon and worked out with a great deal of discussion  at last after a quarter of an hours work when all had gone through it and agreed that it was correct they returned and said to him multiply 324683 by 459852 jack thought for a few seconds and then taking the pencil and paper wrote down the answer 149306126916  why jack thou beest a conjurer one exclaimed while the others broke out into a shout of astonishment  from that time it became an acknowledged fact that jack simpson was a wonder and that there was some use in studying after all and after their games were over they would sit round and ask him questions which they had laboriously prepared and the speed and accuracy of his answers were a neverfailing source of wonder to them  as to his other studies they never inquired it was enough for them that he could do this and the fact that he could do it made them proud of him in a way and when put upon by the pitmen it became a common retort among them dont thou talk theres jack simpson he knows as much as thee and thy mates put together why he can do a soom as long as a slaate as quick as thoud ask it  jack himself laughed at his calculating powers and told the boys that they could do the same if they would practise believing what he said but in point of fact this was not so for the lad had an extraordinary natural faculty for calculation and his schoolmaster was often astonished by the rapidity with which he could prepare in his brain long and complex calculations and that in a space of time little beyond that which it would take to write the question upon paper  so abnormal altogether was his power in this respect that mr merton begged him to discontinue the practice of difficult calculation when at work  it is a bad thing jack to give undue prominence to one description of mental labour and i fear that you will injure your brain if you are always exercising it in one direction therefore when in the pit think over other subjects history geography what you will but leave calculations alone except when you have your books before you     chapter ix  the great strike   it was saturday afternoon a time at which stokebridge was generally lively the men dinner over and the great weekly wash done usually crowded the publichouses or played bowls and quoits on a piece of waste land known as the common or set off upon a spree to birmingham or wolverhampton or sat on low walls or other handy seats and smoked and talked but upon this special saturday afternoon no one settled down to his ordinary pursuits for the men stood talking in groups in the street until as the hour of four approached there was a general move towards the common hither too came numbers of men from the colliery villages round until some four or five thousand were gathered in front of an old waste tip at one corner of the common presently a group of some five or six men came up together made their way through the throng and took their stand on the edge of the tip some twenty feet above the crowd these were the delegates the men sent by the union to persuade the colliers of stokebridge and its neighbourhood to join in a general strike for a rise of wages  the women of the village stand at their doors and watch the men go off to the meeting and then comment to each other concerning it  i aint no patience wi em mrs haden said one of a group of neighbours who had gathered in front of her house i dont hold by strikes i have gone through three of em bad uns besides a score of small uns and i never knowed good come on em i lost my little peg in the lastlow fever the doctor called it but it was starvation and nothing more  if i had my way said mrs haden id just wring the heads off they delegates they come here and suades our men to go out and clem rather than take a shilling a week less just a glass o beer a day and they gets their pay and lives in comfort and dunna care nowt if us and th childer all dies off together  talk o womans rights as one hears about and womans having a vote we ought to have a vote as to strikes its us as bears the worse ot and we ought to have a say ont if we did there wouldnt be another strike in the country  its a burning shame another chimed in here us and the childer will have to starve for weeks months may be and all the homes will be broke up and the furniture which has took so long to get together put away just because the men wont do with one glass of beer less a day  the unions the curse of us a mrs haden said i know what itll befifteen bob a week for the first fortnight and then twelve for a week and then ten and then eight and then six and then after weve clemmed on that for a month or two the unionll say as the funds is dry and the men had best go to work on the reduction i knows their ways and theyre a cuss to us women  here best thy jack he grows a proper lad that  ay jane haden agreed hes a good lad none better and as for learning the books that boy knows is awesome theres shelves upon shelves on em upstairs and i do believe hes read em all a dozen times well jack have ee cum from meeting  ay mother i heard them talk nonsense till i was nigh sick and then i comed away  and will they go for the strike jack  ay theyll go like sheep through a gate theres half a dozen or so would go tother way but the rest wont listen to them so for the sake of a shilling a week were going to lose thirty shillings a week for perhaps twenty weeks so if we win we shant get the money weve throwd away for twenty times thirty weeks mother and that makes eleven years and twentyeight weeks  jack simpson was now sixteen years old not very tall for his age but square and set his face was a pleasant one in spite of his closely cropped hair he had a bright fearless eye and a pleasant smile but the square chin and the firm determined lines of the mouth when in rest showed that his old appellation of bulldog still suited him well after working for four years as a gateboy and two years with the waggons he had just gone in to work with his adopted father in the stall filling the coal in the waggon as it was got down helping to drive the wedges and at times to use the pick as the gettersas the colliers working at bringing down the coal are calledare paid by the ton many of the men have a strong lad working with them as assistant  is t dad like to be at home soon jack mrs haden asked as she followed him into the house  not he mother they pretty well all will be getting themselves in order for earning nothing by getting drunk tonight and dads not slack at that have you got tea ready mother  ay lad  ive made up my mind mother the boy said as he ate his slice of bacon and bread that i shall go over to birmingham tomorrow and try to get work there john ratcliffe the engineman is going to write a letter for me to some mates of his there the last two years when ive been on the nightshift i have gone in and helped him a bit pretty often in the day so as to get to know something about an engine and to be able to do a job of smiths work anyhow he thinks i can get a berth as a striker or something of that sort id rather go at once for there will be plenty of hands looking out for a job before long when the pinch begins and i dont want to be idle here at home  theyve promised to give some sort o allowance to nonunionists jack  yes mother but id rather earn it honestly im too young to join the union yet but i have made up my mind long ago never to do it i mean to be my own master and i aint going to be told by a pack of fellows at stafford or birmingham whether i am to work or not and how much i am to do and how many tubs i am to fill no mother i wasnt born a slave that i know of and certainly dont mean to become one voluntarily  lor how thou dost talk jack whod take ee to be a pitman  i dont want to be taken for anything that i am not mother what with reading and with going two hours twice a week of an evening for six years to talk and work with mr merton i hope i can express myself properly when i choose as you know when im away from you i talk as others do for i hate any one to make remarks if the time ever comes when i am to take a step up it will be time enough for them to talk at present all that the other lads think of me is that i am fond of reading and that i can lick any fellow of my own age in the mine and he laughed lightly and now mother i shall go in and tell mr merton what i have made up my mind to do  mr merton listened to jacks report of his plans in silence and then after a long pause said  i have been for some time intending to talk seriously to you jack about your future and the present is a good time for broaching the subject you see my boy you have worked very hard and have thrown your whole strength into it for six years you have given no time to the classics or modern languages but have put your whole heart into mathematics you have a natural talent for it and you have had the advantage of a good teacher i may say so he said for i was third wrangler at cambridge  you sir jack exclaimed in astonishment  yes lad you may well be surprised at seeing a third wrangler a village schoolmaster but you might find if you searched many men who took as high a degree in even more humble positions i took a fellowship and lived for many years quietly upon it then i married and forfeited my fellowship i thought like many other men that because i had taken a good degree i could earn my living there is no greater mistake i had absolutely no knowledge that was useful that way i tried to write i tried to get pupils i failed all round thirteen years ago after two years of marriage my wife died and in despair of otherwise earning my bread and sick of the struggle i had gone through i applied for this little mastership obtained it and came down with alice then a baby of a year old i chafed at first but i am contented now and no one knows that mr merton is an exfellow of st johns i had still a little property remaining just enough to have kept alice always at a good school i do not think i shall stay here much longer i shall try to get a larger school in some town where i may find a few young men to teach of an evening i am content for myself but alice is growing up and i should wish for her sake to get a step up in the world again i need not say my lad that i dont want this mentioned alice and you alone know my story so you see he went on more lightly i may say you have had a good teacher now jack you are very high up in mathematics far higher than i was at your age and i have not the slightest doubt that you will in a couple of years be able to take the best open scholarship of the year at cambridge if you try for it that would keep you at college and you might hope confidently to come out at least as high as i did and to secure a fellowship which means three or four hundred a year till you marry but to go through the university you must have a certain amount of latin and greek you have a good two years before you have to go up and if you devote yourself as steadily to classics as you have to mathematics you could get up enough to scrape through with dont give me any answer now jack the idea is of course new to you think it very quietly over and we can talk about it next time you come over from birmingham  yes sir thank you very much jack said quietly only please tell me do you yourself recommend it  the schoolmaster was silent for a while  i do not recommend one way or the other jack i would rather leave it entirely to you you would be certain to do well in one way there you are i believe equally certain to do well here but your advance may be very much slower and now jack let us lay it aside for tonight i am just going to have tea i hope you will take a cup with us  jack coloured with pleasure it was the first time that such an invitation had been given to him and he felt it as the first recognition yet made that he was something more than an ordinary pitboy but for all that he felt when he followed his master into the next room that he would have rather been anywhere else  it was a tiny room but daintily furnisheda room such as jack had never seen before and by the fire sat a girl reading she put down her book as her father entered with a bright smile but her eyes opened a little wider in surprise as jack followed him in  my dear alice this is my pupil jack simpson who is going to do me great credit and make a figure in the world some day jack this is my daughter miss merton  alice held out her hand  i have heard papa speak of you so often she said and of course i have seen you come in and out sometimes when i have been home for the holidays  i have seen you in church jack said making a tremendous effort to shake off his awkwardness  jack simpson will to the end of his life look back upon that hour as the most uncomfortable he ever spent then for the first time he discovered that his boots were very heavy and thick then for the first time did his hands and feet seem to get in his way and to require thought as to what was to be done with them and at the time he concluded that white lace curtains and a pretty carpet and tea poured out by a chatty and decidedly pretty young lady were by no means such comfortable institutions as might have been expected  it was two months from the commencement of the strike before jack simpson returned from birmingham coming home to stay from saturday till monday nothing can be more discouraging than the appearance of a colliery village where the hands are on strike for the first week or two there is much bravado and anticipation of early victory and as money is still plentiful the publichouses do a great trade but as the stern reality of the struggle becomes felt a gloom falls over the place the men hang about listlessly and from time to time straggle down to the committeeroom to hear the last news from the other places to which the strike extends and to try to gather a little confidence therefrom at first things always look well meetings are held in other centres and promises of support flow in for a time money arrives freely and the union committee make an allowance to each member which far below his regular pay as it is is still amply sufficient for his absolute wants but by the end of two months the enthusiasm which the strike excited elsewhere dies out the levies fall off and the weekly money scarce enables life to be kept together  it is distinctive of almost all strikes that the women beforehand averse to the movement when it has once begun throw themselves heartily into the struggle from the time it is fairly entered upon until its termination it is rare indeed to hear a colliers wife speak a word against it when the hardest pinch comes and the childrens faces grow thin and white and the rooms are stripped of furniture much as the women may long for an end of it they never grumble never pray their husbands to give in this patient submission to their husbands willsthis silent bearing of the greatest of suffering namely to see children suffer and to be unable to relieve themis one of the most marked features of all great strikes in the coal districts  well mother and how goes it jack asked cheerfully after the first greetings  we be all right jack if we aint we ought to be when weve got no children to keep and get nigh as much as them as has  eight shillings a week now aint it  mrs haden nodded jack looked round  holloa he said the clocks gone and the new carpet  well you see my boy mrs haden said hesitatingly bill is downhearted sometimes and he wants a drop of comfort  i understand jack said significantly  jackand she again spoke hesitatinglyi wish eed carry off all they books out o thy little room theres scores of em and the smallest would fetch a glass o beer ive kept the door locked but it might tempt him my boynot when hes in his right senses you know hed scorn to do such a thing but when he gets half on and has no more money and credit stopped the cravings too much for him and hed sell the bed from under himanything hes got i do believe except his pups and she pointed to some of junos great grandchildren which were as usual lying before the fire a mere handful of coal now in comparison with past times  ill pick out a parcel of them that will be useful to me jack said and take them away the rest may go and now look here mother after paying you for my board i have had for a long time now some eight shillings a week over i have spent some in books but secondhand books are very cheapas dad will find when he tries to sell them so ive got some money put by it dont matter how much but plenty to keep the wolf away while the strike lasts but i dont mean mother to have my savings drunk away im getting sixteen bob a week and i can live on ten or eleven so ill send you five shillings a week but dad mustnt know it ill be home in a month again and ill leave you a pound so that you can get food in if he thinks about it at all which aint likely you can make out you get it on tick well dad how are you he asked as bill haden entered the cottage  ah jack lad how be

call the enginemen and the hands theyve got to keep the ways clear out of the pits thatll bring em to their senses quick enough ive been for it all along  call off the enginehands jack said in tones of alarm you aint going to do such a mad thing as that why if the water gains and the mines get flooded itll be weeks and maybe months before the mines can be cleared and put in working order and what will you all be doing while thats being done  itll bring em to their senses lad bill haden said bringing his hand down on the table with a thump they mean to starve us well ruin them there lets have the price of a quart jack im dry  jack saw that argument against this mad scheme would be of no use for his fosterfather was already halfdrunk so he handed him a shilling and with a shrug of his shoulders walked off to mr mertons  he had long since written to his master saying that he preferred working his way up slowly in mining to entering upon a new life in which however successful he might be at college the after course was not clear to him and his teacher had answered in a tone of approval of his choice  on his way he stopped at the houses of many of his boy friends and was shocked at the misery which already prevailed in some of them harry shepherds home was no better than the others  why harry i should scarce have known you he said as the lad came to the door when he opened it and called him you look bad surely  were a big family jack and the extra childrens allowance was dropped last week theres eight of us and foods scarce little annies going fast i think the doctor came this morning and said she wanted strengthening food he might as well ha ordered her a coachandfour baby died last week and mothers ailing you were right jack what fools we were to strike ive been miles round looking for a job but its no use theres fifty asking for every place open  the tears came into jacks eyes as he looked at the pinched face of his friend  why did you not write to me he asked almost angrily i told you where a letter would find me and here are you all clemming and me know nought of it its too bad now look here harry i must lend you some moneyyou know ive got some put by and you and your father can pay me when good times come again your dad gets his eight shillings from the union i suppose  yes the lad answered  well with fifteen shillings a week you could make a shift to get on so ill send you ten shillings a week for a bit thatll be seven shillings to add to the eight and the other three will get meat to make broth for annie the strike cant last much over another month and that wont hurt me one way or the other heres the first ten shillings put it in your pocket and then come round with me to the butcher and ill get a few pounds of meat just to start you all there dont cry and dont say anything else ill lick you  but when jack himself entered the schoolmasters house and was alone with mr merton he threw himself in a chair and burst into tears  it is awful sir awful to see those little children who were so noisy and bright when i went away so pale and thin and quiet now poor little things poor little things as to the men they are starving because they dont choose to work and if they like it let them even the women i dont pity so much for if they did right they would take broomsticks and drive the men to work but the children its dreadful  it is dreadful jack and it makes me feel sick and ill when i go into the infantschool the clergymans wife has opened a sort of soupkitchen and a hundred children get a bowl of soup and a piece of bread at dinnertime every day and they sell soup under cost price to the women mr brook has given fifty pounds towards it  look here sir jack said you know ive over fifty pounds laid byand money cant be better spent than for the children the strike cant last over a month or six weeks at the outside and maybe not that ill give you three pounds a week if you will kindly hand it over to mrs street and say its been sent you but its to go to feeding children let me see the soup dont cost above a penny a bowl and say a halfpenny for a hunch of bread so that will give a good many of em a dinner every day will you do that for me sir  i will my boy mr merton said heartily you may save many a young life  well sir and what do you think of things  i fear we shall have trouble jack last night there was rioting over at crawfurd a managers house was burnt down and some policemen badly hurt there is angry talk all over the district and i fear we shall have it here  when jack started on sunday evening for birmingham his last words to his mother were  mind mother the very first word you hear about violence or assault you post this envelope i have directed to me i will come straight back ill keep father out of it somehow and ill do all i can to save mr brooks property hes a good master and hes been specially kind to me and i wont have him or his property injured  why lauk a mercy jack you aint going to fight the whole place all by yourself are you  i dont know what i am going to do yet jack said but you may be quite sure i shall do something  and as his mother looked at the set bulldog expression of his mouth and jaw she felt that jack was thoroughly in earnest     chapter x  hard times   it was when the pinch came the subscriptions fell off and the weekly payments by the union dwindled to a few shillings for the support of a whole family that the rough virtues of the people of the mining districts came strongly into prominence starvation was doing its work and told first upon the women and children little faces awhile since so rosy and bright grew thin and pinched chubby arms shrank until the bone could almost be seen through the skin and low fever a sure accompaniment of want made its appearance  no more tender and devoted nurses could be found than the rough women who hushed their voices and stole with quiet feet around the little beds letting fall many a silent tear when the sufferer asked for little things for tea or lemonade which there were no means to purchase or when the doctor shook his head and said that good food and not medicine was needed  the pitmen themselves would saunter aimlessly in and out of the houses so changed from the cottages well stocked with furniture with gaycoloured pictures on the wall an eightday clock and many another little valuable and all gone one after another very many of them lived upon the scantiest allowance of dry bread which would keep life together in order that the allowance might all go for the children retaining as their sole luxury a penny or two a week for the purchase of a pipe or two of tobacco daily had it not been for the soupkitchen scores of children would have died but the pint of soup and the slice of bread enabled them to live  there was no talk of surrender yet although compromises which would at first have been indignantly rejected were now discussed and a deputation had waited upon mr brook but the owner refused to enter into any compromise  no never he said you have chosen to join the hands of the other pits in an endeavour to force your employers into giving you a higher rate of wages than they can afford to pay i therefore have joined the other employers we know what you cannot know what are our expenses and what we can afford to pay and we will accept no dictation whatever from the men as to their rate of wages if i prefer as i do prefer that the colliery should stand idle to raising your rate of wages it is a clear proof that i should lose money if i agreed to your demand if needs be i would rather that the pit was closed for a year or for ten years we have bound ourselves together to make no advance just as you have bound yourselves not to go to work at the old rate when you choose to go in at that rate there are your places ready for you but i will give way in no single point i will not pay a halfpenny a ton more than before you best know how long you can hold out dont let it be too long lads for the sake of your wives and children remember that the time may come when thinking over some empty chair recalling some little face you will never see again you will curse your folly and obstinacy in ruining your homes and destroying those dependent upon you in a struggle in which it was from the first certain that you could not win and in which even if you won the amount at stake is not worth one day of the suffering which you are inflicting upon those you love  left to themselves the men would have much sooner given in would indeed never have embarked on the strike but the influence of the union being over them they feared to be called black sheep and to be taunted with deserting the general cause and so the strike went on  the tale of the suffering over the wide district affected by the strike was told through the land and the subscriptions of the benevolent flowed in public opinion was however strongly opposed to the strike and for the most part the money was subscribed wholly for soupkitchen for children and for relief of the sick but the area was wide there were scores of villages as badly off as stokebridge and the share of each of the general fund was very small a local committee was formed of which the vicar was at the head for the management of the funds and for organizing a body of nurses all the women who had no children of their own were enrolled upon its lists and many of the girls of the sewingclass volunteered their services  no one during this sad time devoted herself more untiringly and devotedly than nelly hardy the quiet manner the steady and resolute face rendered her an excellent nurse and as her father and mother were perforce sober she could devote her whole time to the work a portion of the funds was devoted to the preparation of the articles of food and drink necessary for the sick and the kitchen of the schoolroom was freely employed in making milkpuddings barleywater and other things which brought pleasure and alleviation to the parched little lips for which they were intended  the distress grew daily more intense the small traders could no longer give credit the pawnbrokers were so overburdened with household goods that they were obliged absolutely to decline to receive more the doctors were worn out with work the guardians of the poor were nearly beside themselves in their efforts to face the frightful distress prevailing and the charitable committee aided as they were by subscriptions from without could still do but little in comparison to the great need jane haden and the other women without families did their best to help nurse in the houses where sickness was rife the children were mere shadows and the men and women although far less reduced were yet worn and wasted by want of food and still the strike went on still the men held out against the reduction some of the masters had brought men from other parts and these had to be guarded to and from their work by strong bodies of police and several serious encounters had taken place some of the hands were wavering now but the party of resistance grew more and more violent and the waverers dared not raise their voices the delegates of the union went about holding meetings and assuring their hearers that the masters were on the point of being beaten and must give way but they were listened to in sullen and gloomy silence by the men then came muttered threats and secret gatherings and then jane haden obedient to her promise but very doubtful as to its wisdom posted the letter jack had left with her  it was three oclock next day before he arrived for he had not received the letter until he went out for his breakfast and he had to go back to his work and ask to be allowed to go away for the afternoon on particular business for which he was wanted at home  well mother what is it was his first question on entering  i oughtnt to tell ee jack and i do believe bill would kill me if he knew  he wont know mother and you must tell me jack said quietly  well my boy yesterday afternoon bill came in here with eight or ten others i were upstairs but i suppose they thought i were out and as i did not want to disturb em and was pretty nigh worn outi had been up three nights with betsy mullins girli sat down and nigh dozed off the door was open and i could hear what they said downstairs when they spoke loud at first they talked low and i didnt heed what they were saying then i heard a word or two which frighted me and then i got up and went quiet to my door and listened jack they are going to wreck the engines so as to stop the pumping and drown the mines they are going to do for the vaughan and the hill side and thorns and the little shaft and vale its to be done tonight and they begin with the vaughan at ten oclock cause its closest i suppose  they are mad jack said sternly how are they to earn bread if they flood the mines and it will end by a lot of them being sent to jail for years but ill stop it if it costs me my life  oh jack dont ee do anything rash mrs haden said piteously what can one lad do against two or three hundred men  now mother jack said promptly not heeding her appeal what police are there within reach  the police were all sent away yesterday to bampton there were riots there i heard say thats why they chose tonight  now the first thing mother is to prevent dad from going out tonight he must be kept out of it whatever others do ive brought a bottle of gin from birmingham tell him ive come over for an hour or two to see schoolmaster and im going back again afterwards but ive brought him this as a present get the cork out hes sure to drink a glass or two anyhow perhaps more but it will send him off to sleep sure enough its the strongest i could get and hes out of the way of drink now i dont suppose theyll miss him when they start but if any one comes round for him you tell em i brought him some old tom over and that hes so dead sleepy he cant move later on if you can get some woman or child to come in and let them see him so that therell be a witness he was at home when the thing came off thatll make him safe ive thought it all over  but what beest thou going to do jack  dont mind me mother im going to save the vaughan colliery dont you fret about me all youve got to do is to make dad drink which aint a difficult job and to stick to the story that i have been over for an hour to see schoolmaster goodbye mother dont fret it will all come out right  as jack went down the street he tapped at the door of his friends house  is harry in  harry was in and came out at once  hows annie was jacks first question  better much better jack the doctor thinks shell do now the broth put fresh life into her were all better jack thanks to you  thats all right harry put on your cap and walk with me to the schoolroom now he went on as his friend rejoined him and they turned up the street will you do a job for me  anything in the world jackleastways anything i can  you may risk your life harry  all right jack ill risk it willing for you you risked yours for me at the old shaft  dost know whats going to be done tonight harry  ive heard summat about it  it must be stopped harry if it costs you and me our lives whats that when the whole district depends upon it if they wreck the engines and flood the mines there will be no work for months and whats to become of the women and children then im going to mr merton to tell him and to get him to write a letter to sir john butlerbrooks place would be watchedhes the nearest magistrate and the most active about here and wont let the grass grow under his feet by all accounts the letter must tell him of the attack that is to be made tonight and ask him to send for the soldiers if no police can be had i want you to take the letter harry go out the other side of the village and make a long sweep round dont get into the road till you get a full mile out of the place then go as hard as you can till you get to butlers insist on seeing him yourself say its a question of life and death if hes out you must go on to hooperhes the next magistrate when you have delivered the letter slip off home and go to bed and never let out all your life that you took that letter  all right jack but what beest thou going to do  im going another way lad ive got my work too youd best stop here harry i will bring the letter to you it may get out some day that merton wrote it and its as well you shouldnt be seen near his place     chapter xi  the attack on the enginehouse   no sooner did mr merton hear of the resolution of the miners to destroy the engines than he sat down and wrote an urgent letter to sir john butler  is there anything else jack  i dont know sir if the masters could be warned of the attack they might get a few viewers and firemen and make a sort of defence but if the mens bloods up it might go hard with them and it would go hard with you if you were known to have taken the news of it  i will take the risk of that mr merton said directly it is dark i will set out what are you going to do jack  ive got my work marked out jack said id rather not tell you till its all over goodbye sir harry is waiting for the letter  mr merton did not carry out his plans as soon as it was dark he left the village but a hundred yards out he came upon a party of men evidently posted as sentries these roughly told him that if he didnt want to be chucked into the canal hed best go home to bed and this after trying another road with the same result he did  jack walked with harry as far as the railwaystation mentioning to several friends he met that he was off again the lads crossed the line went out of the opposite bookingoffice and set offfor it was now past five and already darkat the top of their speed in different directions jack did not stop till he reached the enginehouse of the vaughan mine the pumps were still clanking inside and the water streaming down the shoot peeping carefully in to see that his friend john ratcliffe was alone jack entered  well john he said the engines still going  ay jack but if whats more nor one has told me today be true it be for the last time  look here john mr brook has been a good master will you do him a good turn  ay lad if i can ive held on here though theyve threatened to chuck me down the shaft but im a married man and cant throw away my life  i dont ask you to john i want you to work hard here with me till six oclock strikes and then go home as usual  what dost want done lad  what steam is there in the boiler  only about fifteen pounds im just knocking off and have banked the fire up  all right john i want you to help me fix the fire hose the short length to that blowoff cock at the bottom of the boiler we can unscrew the pipe down to the drain and can fasten the hose to it with a union i expect youve got some unions havent you  yes lad and what then  thats my business john im going to hold this place till the soldiers come and i think that with twenty pounds of steam in the boiler and the hose i can keep all the miners of stokebridge out at any rate ill try now john set to work i want thee to go straight home and then no one will suspect thee of having a hand in the matter ill go out when thou dost and thou canst swear if thou art asked that there was not a soul in the house when thou camest away  thou wilt lose thy life jack  that be my business jack said i think not now set to work john give me a spanner and lets get the pipe off the cock at once  john ratcliffe set to work with a will and in twenty minutes the unions were screwed on and the hose attached a length of thirty feet which was quite sufficient to reach to the window some eight feet above the ground along by this window ran a platform there was another and a smaller window on the other side  while they were working john ratcliffe tried to dissuade jack from carrying out his plan  its no use john i mean to save the engines and so the pit theyll never get in and no one knows i am here and no one will suspect me none of em will know my voice for they wont bring boys with them and dad wont be here there its striking six let me just drop a rope out of the window to climb in again with now well go out together do thou lock the door take the key and go off home like enough theyll ask thee for the key or they may bring their sledges to break it in anyhow it will make no difference for there are a couple of bolts inside and i shall make it fast with bars there thats right goodnight john remember whatever comes of it thou knowest nought of it thou camest away and left the place empty as usual and no one there  goodbye lad id stop with ee and share thy risk but theyd know i was here and my life wouldnt be worth the price of a pot o beer dont forget lad if thou lowerst the water to damp down the fire and open the valves  jack left to himself clambered up to the window and entered the enginehouse again threw some fresh coal on the fire heaped a quantity of coal against the door and jammed several long iron bars against it then he lighted his pipe and sat listening occasionally getting up to hold a lantern to the steamgauge as it crept gradually up  twentyfive pounds he said that will be enough to throw the water fifty or sixty yards on a level and the door of the windingengines not more than thirty so i can hold them both if they try to break in there  he again banked up the fires and sat thinking harry would be at the magistrates by a quarter to six by six oclock sir john could be on his way to birmingham for troops fifteen miles to drivesay an hour and a half another hour for the soldiers to start and three hours to do the nineteen miles to the vaughan halfpast elevenperhaps half an hour earlier perhaps half an hour later there was no fear but there was plenty of water the boiler was a large one and was built partly into partly out of the enginehouse that is to say while the furnacedoor the gauges and the safetyvalve were inside the main portion of the boiler was outside the walls the blowoff cock was two inches in diameter and the nozzle of the hose an inch and a half it would take some minutes then even with the steam at a pressure of twentyfive pounds to the inch to blow the water out and a minute would he was certain do all that was needed  not even when upon the first day of his life in the pit jack sat hour after hour alone in the darkness did the time seem to go so slowly as it did that evening once or twice he thought he heard footsteps and crept cautiously up to the window to listen but each time convinced of his error he returned to his place on a bench near the furnace he heard the hours strike one after another on the stokebridge church clockeight nine tenand then he took his post by the window and listened a quarter of an hour passed and then there was a faint confused sound nearer it came and nearer until it swelled into the trampling of a crowd of many hundreds of men they came along with laughter and rough jests for they had no thought of oppositionno thought that anyone was near them the crowd moved forward until they were within a few yards of the enginehouse and then one who seemed to be in command said smash the door in with your sledges lads  jack had as they approached gone down to the boiler and had turned the blowoff cock and the boiling water swelled the strong leathern hose almost to bursting then he went back to the window threw it open and stood with the nozzle in his hand  hold he shouted out in loud clear tones let no man move a step nearer for his life  the mob stood silent paralyzed with surprise jack had spoken without a tinge of the local accent and as none of the boys were there his voice was quite unrecognized who be he its a stranger and other sentences were muttered through the throng  who be you the leader asked recovering from his surprise  never mind who i am jack said standing well back from the window lest the light from the lanterns which some of the men carried might fall on his face i am here in the name of the law i warn you to desist from your evil design go to your homes the soldiers are on their way and may be here any minute moreover i have means here of destroying any man who attempts to enter  there was a movement in the crowd the soldiers be coming ran from mouth to mouth and the more timid began to move towards the outside of the crowd  stand firm lads it be a lie shouted the leader thee baint to be frighted by one man beest ee what five hundred staffordshire miners afeard o one why yell be the laughingstock of the country now lads break in the door well soon see who be yon chap that talks so big  there was a rush to the door and a thundering clatter as the heavy blows of the sledgehammers fell on the wood while another party began an assault upon the door of the windingengine house  then jack with closely pressed lips and set face turned the cock of the nozzle  with a hiss the scalding water leaped out in a stream jack stood well forward now and with the hose swept the crowd as a fireman might sweep a burning building driven by the tremendous force of the internal steam the boiling water knocked the men in front headlong over then as he raised the nozzle and scattered the water broadcast over the crowd wild yells screams and curses broke on the night air another move and the column of boiling fluid fell on those engaged on the other enginehouse door and smote them down  then jack turned the cock again and the stream of water ceased  it was but a minute since he had turned it on but it had done its terrible work a score of men lay on the ground rolling in agony others danced screamed and yelled in pain others less severely scalded filled the air with curses while all able to move made a wild rush back from the terrible building  when the wild cries had a little subsided jack called out  now lads you can come back safely i have plenty more hot water and i could have scalded the whole of you as badly as those in front had i wanted to now i promise on my oath not to turn it on again if you will come and carry off your mates who are here take them off home as quick as you can before the soldiers come i dont want to do you harm youd all best be in bed as soon as you can  the men hesitated but it was clear to them all that it had been in the power of their unknown foe to have inflicted a far heavier punishment upon them than he had done and there was a ring of truth and honesty in his voice which they could not doubt so after a little hesitation a number of them came forward and lifting the men who had fallen near the enginehouse carried them off and in a few minutes there was a deep silence where just before a very pandemonium had seemed let loose  then jack the strain over sat down and cried like a child  half an hour later listening intently he heard a deep sound in the distance here come the soldiers he muttered it is time for me to be off he glanced at the steamgauge and saw that the steam was falling while the watergauge showed that there was still sufficient water for safety and he then opened the window at the back of the building and dropped to the ground in an instant he was seized in a powerful grasp  i thought yed be coming out here and now ive got ye growled a deep voice which jack recognized as that of roger hawking the terror of stokebridge  for an instant his heart seemed to stand still at the extent of his peril then with a sudden wrench he swung round and faced his captor twisted his hands in his handkerchief and drove his knuckles into his throat then came a crashing blow in his faceanother and another with head bent down jack held on his grip with the gameness and tenacity of a bulldog while the blows rained on his head and his assailant in his desperate effort to free himself swung his body hither and thither in the air as a bull might swing a dog which had pinned him jack felt his senses goinga dull dazed feeling came over him then he felt a crash as his adversary reeled and felland then all was dark  illustration a life or death struggle  it could have been but a few minutes that he lay thus for he awoke with the sound of a thunder of horses hoofs and a clatter of swords in the yard on the other side of the enginehouse rousing himself he found that he still grasped the throat of the man beneath him with a vague sense of wonder whether his foe was dead he rose to his feet and staggered off the desire to avoid the troops dispersing all other ideas in his brain for a few hundred yards he staggered along swaying like a drunken man and knowing nothing of where he was going then he stumbled and fell again and lay for hours insensible  it was just the faint break of day when he came to the cold air of the morning having brought him to himself it took him a few minutes to recall what had happened and his whereabouts then he made his way to the canal which was close by washed the blood from his face and set out to walk to birmingham he was too shaken and bruised to make much progress and after walking for a while crept into the shelter of a haystack and went off to sleep for many hours after it was dusk in the evening he started again and made his way to his lodgings at ten oclock that night it was a fortnight before he could leave his room so bruised and cut was his face and a month before the last sign of the struggle was obliterated and he felt that he could return to stokebridge without his appearance being noticed  there great changes had taken place the military had found the splintered door the hose and the still steaming water in the yard and the particulars of the occurrence which had taken place had been pretty accurately judged they were indeed soon made public by the stories of the scalded men a great number of whom were forced to place themselves in the hands of the doctor many of them having had very narrow escapes of their lives but none of them had actually succumbed in searching round the enginehouse the soldiers had found a man apparently dead his tongue projecting from his mouth a surgeon had accompanied them and a vein having been opened and water dashed in his face he gave signs of recovery he had been taken off to jail as being concerned in the attack on the enginehouse but no evidence could be obtained against him and he would have been released had he not been recognized as a man who had five years before effected a daring escape from portland where he was undergoing a life sentence for a brutal manslaughter  the defeat of the attempt to destroy the vaughan engines was the deathblow of the strike among the foremost in the attack and therefore so terribly scalded that they were disabled for weeks were most of the leaders of the strike in the pits of the district and their voices silenced and their counsel discredited the men two days after the attack had a great meeting at which it was resolved almost unanimously to go to work on the masters terms  great excitement was caused throughout the district by the publication of the details of the defence of the enginehouse and the most strenuous efforts were made by mr brook to discover the person to whom he was so indebted the miners were unanimous in describing him as a stranger and as speaking like a gentleman and there was great wonder why any one who had done so great a service to the mineowners should conceal his identity jacks secret was however well kept by the three or four who alone knew it and who knew too that his life would not be safe for a day did the colliers groaning and smarting over their terrible injuries discover to whom they were indebted for them     chapter xii  after the strike   well jack so youre back again nelly hardy said as she met jack simpson on his way home from work on the first day after his return  ay nelly and glad to see you how have things gone on and he nodded towards her home  better than i ever knew them the girl said when father could not afford to buy drink we had better times than i have ever known it was a thousand times better to starve than as twas before hes laid up still you nigh scalded him to death jack and i doubt hell never be fit for work again  i jack exclaimed astounded for he believed that the secret was known only to his mother harry john ratcliffe mr merton and perhaps the schoolmasters daughter  has harry  no harry has not said a word oh jack i didnt think it of you you call me a friend and keep this a secret you let harry know it and say nowt to me i did not think it of you and the dark eyes filled with tears  but if harry did not tell you how  as if i wanted telling she said indignantly who would have dared do it but you didnt i know you were here an hour or two before and you think i needed telling who it was as faced all the pitmen and to think you hid it from me didnt you think i could be trusted couldnt i have gone to fetch the redcoats for you couldnt i have sat by you in the enginehouse and waited and held your hand when you stood against them all oh jack and for the first time since their friendship had been pledged nearly four years before jack saw nelly burst into tears  i didnt mean unkind nell i didnt indeed and if i had wanted another messenger i would have come to you dont i know you are as true as steel come lass dont take on i would have sent thee instead o harry only i thought he could run fastest girls wind aint as good as lads  and you didnt doubt id do it jack  not for a moment jack said i would have trusted thee as much as harry  well then i forgive you jack but if ever you get in danger again and doant let me know ill never speak a word to you again  in the years which had passed since this friendship began nelly hardy had greatly changed the companionship of two quiet lads like jack and harry had tamed her down and her love of reading and her study of all the books on history and travel on jacks bookshelves had softened her speech when alone the three spoke with but little of the dialect of the place jack having insisted on improvement in this respect with nelly his task had been easy for she was an apt pupil but harry still retained some of his roughness of speech  nelly was fifteen now and was nearly as tall as jack who was square and somewhat stout for his age with these two friends jack would talk sometimes of his hopes of rising and making a way for himself harry who believed devoutly in his friend entered most warmly into his hopes but nelly on this subject alone was not sympathetic  you dont say anything jack remarked one day do you think my castles in the air will never come true  i know they will come true jack she said earnestly but dont ask me to be glad i cant i try to but i cant its selfish but but and her voice quivered every step thou takest will carry you farther up from me and i cant be glad on it jack  nonsense nelly jack said angrily dost think so little of me as to think that i shall not be as true to my two friends harry and you as i am now  the girl shook her head  you will try jack you will try dont think i doubt you but and turning round she fled away at full speed  i believe she ran away because she was going to cry harry said lasses are strange things and though in some things nells half a lad yet shes soft you see on some points curious isnt it jack  very curious jack said i thought i understood nell as well as i did you or myself but i begin to think i doant understand her as much as i thought it comes of her being a lass of course but its queer too and jack shook his head over the mysterious nature of lasses you cant understand em he went on again thoughtfully now if you wanted some clothes harry and you were out of work i should just buy you a set as a matter of course and youd take em the same it would be only natural like friends wouldnt it  harry assented  now ive been wanting to give nelly a gown and a jacket and hat for the last two years i want her to look nice and hold her own with the other lasses of the placeshes as good looking as anybut i darent do it no i darent downright i know as well as if i see it how shed flash up and how angry shed be  why should she harry asked  thats what i doant know lad but i know she would be i suppose it comes of her being a lass but it beats me altogether why shouldnt she take it other lasses take presents from their lads why shouldnt nell take one from her friend but she wouldnt id bet my life she wouldnt and she wouldnt say no and thank you but shed treat it as if id insulted her no it cant be done lad but its a pity for i should ha liked to see her look nice for once  not satisfied with his inability to solve the question jack took his mother into his confidence  jane haden smiled  noa jack i dont think as how thou canst give nell hardy a dress she is a good quiet girl and keeps herself respectable which taking into account them she comes from is a credit to her but i dont think thou couldst gi her a gown  but why not mother jack persisted i might gi her a pair o earrings or a brooch i suppose which would cost as much as the gown  yes thou mightst do that jack  then if she could take the thing which would be no manner o use to her why couldnt she take the thing that would  i doant know as i can rightly tell you jack but theres a difference  but cant you tell me what is the difference jack insisted  noa jack i cant but there be a difference  jack seized his candle with a cry of despair and ran upstairs he had solved many a tough problem but this was beyond him altogether he was not however accustomed to be baffled and the next day he renewed the subject this time to nelly herself  look here nell he said i want to ask you a question it is a supposition you know only a supposition but it bothers me  what is it jack she said looking up from the ground upon which as was her custom she was sitting with a book while jack sat on a gate  if i was to offer you a pair of gold earrings  i wouldnt take em the girl said rising you know i wouldnt jack you know i never take presents from you  i know lass i know well suppose you wouldnt take it but you wouldnt be angered would you  i should be angered that you had spent money foolishly the girl said after a pause when you knew i shouldnt take it but i couldnt be angered any other way  well but if i were to buy you a hat and a jacket and a gown  you dare not the girl said passionately her face flushed scarlet you dare not jack  no jack said consciously i know i dare not though i should like to but why dont i dare  because it would be an insult a gross insult jack and you dare not insult me  no lass i darena but why should it be an insult thats what i canna make out why wouldnt it be an insult to offer you a gold brooch worth three or four pounds and yet be an insult to offer you the other things whats the difference  nelly had calmed down now when she saw that the question was a hypothetical one and that jack had not as she at first supposed bought clothes for her  she thought for some time i suppose jack the difference is this its the duty of a girls father and mother to buy fit clothes for her and if they dont its either their fault or its because they are too poor so to give clothes is an interference and a sort of reproach a brooch is not necessary its a pretty ornament and so a lad may give it to his lass wiout shame  yes i suppose it must be that jack said thoughtfully im glad ive got some sort of answer     chapter xiii  a heavy loss   i thought sir that you promised to say nothing about that soupkitchen money jack said rather indignantly one evening a fortnight after he had gone to work again  here all the women of the place seem to know about it and as i was coming home from work today there was mrs thompson run out and shook me by the hand and would ha kissed me if id let her and said id saved her childrens lives i ha been thinking of going away i cant stand this and i thought you promised to say nowt about it  nothing jack corrected mr merton it is a long time since i heard you say nowt no jack i did not promise you told me to say nothing about it but i was careful not to promise sit down lad youre a little hot now and i am not surprised but i am sure that you will credit me for having acted for the best  jack sat down with a little grunt and with the expression of dissatisfaction on his face in no way mollified  in the first place jack you will i know be sorry to hear that i am going away  going away jack exclaimed leaping to his feet all thought of his grievance gone at once oh mr merton  i told you you will remember jack when the strike first began that for the sake of my daughter i should make an effort to obtain a superior position and i am glad to say that i have done so i have obtained the post of mathematical master at the foundation school at birmingham with a salary of three hundred a year and this jack i partly owe to you  to me jack exclaimed in astonishment how could that be sir  well jack you got me to write that letter to sir john butler that was the means of bringing the troops over from birmingham as we know they arrived too late for in point of fact the hot water from the vaughan boiler put an end to the riot and the strike together however sir john butler mentioned to mr brook and the other owners whose mines were threatened that it was i who at some risk to myself sent the message which brought down the troops i can assure you that i disclaimed any merit in the affair however they chose to consider themselves under an obligation and when i applied for the vacant mastership sending in of course my college testimonials they were good enough to exert all their influence with the governors in my favour and i was elected unanimously the salary is an increasing one and i am to be allowed to coach private pupils for the university so jack you may congratulate me  i do sir most heartily most heartily jack said as he grasped the hand which mr merton held out but his voice quivered a little and tears stood in his eyes i am glad indeed although i shall miss you so terribly you have been so good to me and jack fairly broke down now and cried silently  mr merton put his hand on his shoulder jack my work is nearly done so far as you are concerned you have worked nearly as far as can be of any use to you in pure mathematics for the next few months you may go on but then you had better turn your attention to the useful application of what you have learned you want to fit yourself to be an engineer especially of course a mining engineer still the more general your knowledge the better you will have therefore to devote yourself to the various strains and stresses in iron bridges and the calculation of the strength of the various forms of these structures then all calculations as to the expenditure of heat and force in steam engines will be quite material for you to master in fact there is work before you for another four or five years but for much of this you will not require a master you will find the practical part easy to you when you have a thorough knowledge of mathematics at the same time if you will once a week send me your papers noting all difficulties that you may meet with i will go through them and answer you and will also give you papers to work out  you are very very kind sir jack said but it will not be the same thing as you being here  no not quite the same jack still we can hardly help that  oh no sir jack said eagerly and please do not think that i am not glad to hear that you have got a place more worthy of you it was a blow to me just at first and i was selfish to think of myself even for a moment  well jack and now about this question of the soup dinner  oh it does not matter sir i had forgot all about it  it matters a little jack because although i did not promise to keep silence i should certainly have respected your wish had it not been that it seemed to be a far more important matter that the truth should be known  more important sir jack repeated in a puzzled tone  more important jack my successor has been chosen he is just the man for this placeearnest well trained a good disciplinarian he will be no help to you jack he is simply taught and trained as the master of a national school but he is thoroughly in earnest i have told him that his most efficient assistant here will be yourself  i jack exclaimed in extreme astonishment  you jack not as a teacher but as an example you have immense power of doing good jack if you do but choose to exert it  jack was altogether too surprised to speak for some time  a power of good he said at last the only good i can do sir and that is not much is to thrash chaps i see bullying smaller boys but thats nothing  well thats something jack and indeed i fear you are fond of fighting  i am not fond of it jack said i dont care about it one way or the other it doesnt hurt me i am as hard as nails you see so i dont think more about fighting than i do about eating my dinner  i dont like fighting jack when it can be avoided and i dont think that you are quarrelsome though you do get into so many fights  indeed i am not quarrelsome mr merton i never quarrel with anyone if any of the big chaps interfere with us and want to fight of course i am ready or if chaps from the other pits think that they can knock our chaps about of course i show them that the vaughans can fight or if i see any fellow pitching in to a young one  or in fact jack on any pretext whatever well if it were anyone else but yourself i should speak very strongly against it but in your case i avow that i am glad that you have fought and fought until as i know no one anywhere near your age will fight with you because it now makes you more useful for my purpose  jack looked astonished again you dont want me to thrash anyone mr merton he said because if you do  no no jack nothing is further from my thoughts i want you to get the lads of your own age to join a nightschool and to become a more decent christian set of young fellows than they are now it is just because you can fight well and are looked up to by the lads as their natural leader that you can do this were anyone else to try it he would fail he would be regarded as a milksop and be called a girl and a molly and all sorts of names and no one would join him now with you they cant say this and boys joining would say to those who made fun of them theres jack simpson hes one of us you go and call him molly and see what youll get now you can talk to your comrades and point out to them the advantages of learning and decent manners show that not only will they become happier men but that in a worldly point of view they will benefit for that the mineowners have difficulty in getting men with sufficient education to act as overmen and viewers get them to agree to keep from drink and from the foul language which makes the streets horrible to a decent person you can work a revolution in the place you wont get them to do all this at present but the first step is to get them to attend a nightschool i have for the last year been thinking over the matter and was intending to speak to you about it when the strike began and everything else was put aside now i have spoken to my successor and he is willing and indeed anxious to open such a school if the young fellows can be induced to come  jack sat for some time in silence he was always slow at coming to a conclusion and liked to think over every side of a question  how often would it be held sir he asked presently  two or three nights a week jack those who are anxious to get on can do as you did and work between times  two nights would be enough at first jack said but i think yes i think i could get some of them to give that harry shepherd would im sure and bill cummings and fred wood and i think five or six others yes sir i think we could start it and all i can do i will it would do a sighti mean a great deal of good ill come myself at first sir and then if any of them make a noise or play games with the schoolmaster ill lick em next day  no jack i dont think that would do but your presence would no doubt aid the master at first and youll think of the other things jack the drinking and the bad language and so on  ill do what i can mr merton jack said simply but it must be bit by bit  thats right jack i knew that i could rely upon you and now come in to tea and there was one thing i wanted to say i want you once a month to come over to me at birmingham on saturday afternoon and stay till sunday evening it will be a great pleasure to me i shall see how you are getting on and shall hear all the news of stokebridge  i am very very much obliged to you sir jack said colouring with pleasure but i am afraid i am not not fit  you are fit to associate with anyone jack and it is good for you that you should occasionally have other association than that of your comrades of the pit you will associate with people of higher rank than mine if you live and it is well that you should become accustomed to it and now jack i know you will not take it amiss but clothes do go for something and i should advise you to go to a good tailors at birmingham the first time you come overi will obtain the address of such a oneand order yourself a suit of well made clothes as you get on in life you will learn that first impressions go a long way and that the cut of the clothes have not a little to do with first impressions i shall introduce you to my friends there simply as a friend not that either you or i are ashamed of your working in a pitindeed that is your highest creditbut it would spare you the comments and silly questions which would be put to you now let us go into the next room alice will be expecting us  jack had taken tea with mr merton more than once since that first evening before the strike and was now much more at his ease with miss merton who having heard from her father that it was he who saved the vaughan pit viewed him with a constant feeling of astonishment it seemed so strange to her that this quiet lad who certainly stood in awe of her although he was a year her senior should have done such a daring action equally wonderful to think that in spite of his well chosen words and the attainments her father thought so highly of he was yet a pit boy like the rough noisy lads of the village  a week later mr merton and his daughter left stokebridge and upon the following day his successor arrived and jack at mr mertons request called upon him the same evening he was a tall man of some forty years old with a face expressive of quiet power jack felt at once that he should like him  he received the lad very kindly i have heard so much of you from mr merton he said and i am sure that you will be a great help to me harriet he said to his wife a brightlooking woman of about thirtyfive years old who came into the room this is mr simpson of whom mr merton spoke so highly to me my wife is going to have the girls school have you heard  no indeed jack said mr merton did not mention it  it was only settled yesterday the managers heard that my wife was a trained mistress and as they were going to pension off the present mistress they offered it to her  i am very glad jack said for mrs white has long been past her work and the girls did pretty well as they liked  i expect to have some trouble with them at first mrs dodgson said cheerfully i often tell my husband girls are ever so much more troublesome than boys but i daresay i shall manage and now mr simpson we are just going to have supper will you join us it will be our first regular meal in the house  thank you very much jack said colouring and hesitating but i think perhaps you dont know that i am only a lad in the pit  stuff and nonsense mrs dodgson said what has that to do with it why mr merton says that you will be johns right hand besides you will be able to tell us all about the people we shall have to do with  in another moment jack was seated at table and really enjoyed the meal lightened as it was by the pleasant talk of his hostess and the grave but not less kindly conversation of her husband     chapter xiv  the nightschool   jack found that as he expected his friends harry shepherd bill cummings and fred wood would be glad to attend a nightschool and to work in earnest for the example of what jack had done for himself even so far as they knew had excited a strong desire for improvement among them they however were doubtful as to others and agreed that it would not do to propose it in a straightforward manner but that a good deal of careful management would be necessary  jack it was arranged should open the subject after leading up to it carefully harry should be the first to consent bill cummings was to give in his adhesion when he saw signs of wavering among the others and fred wood to delay his until a moment when his coming forward would be useful  the following saturday when many of them were always together should be the occasion and fred wood was to lead up to the matter by asking jack some questions as to the relative bigness of the earth and the sun  saturday came the lads gathered in a field which belonged to the vaughan and upon which a great tip of rubbish and shale was gradually encroaching here choosing sides they played at rounders for a couple of hours and then flung themselves down on the grass some of them lighted pipes and all enjoyed the quiet of the fine autumn evening  presently fred wood artfully fired off the questions he had prepared which jack answered  what a sight o things thou knowst jack bill cummings said  i dont know much yet bill but i hopes to know a goodish deal some day  and thou really likst reading jack i hate it john jordan said  i didnt like it ower much at first jack answered but as i got on i liked it more and more i wish you chaps had the chances i had it isnt every one who would take the pains wi a fellow as merton took wi me  what ud be t good ot john jordan asked i doant see no good in knowing that t sun be a hundred thousand times as big as t world  theres use in a great deal o what one gets to know though jack said not so much now as some day maybe a chap as has some sort o edication has chances over another o being chosen as a viewer or an oversman  oh thats what thou beest looking forward to jack eh well theres summat in that and i shouldna wonder if we see thee that some day but we cant all be oversmen  not in the vaughan jack said but theres plenty o other pits and a chap as has got his head screwed on straight and can write well and figure a bit and have read up his work may always look forward to getting a step up wherever he goes besides look at the difference it makes to the pleasures o life what has a man got to do who aint learnt to be fond o reading nowt but to go to t public to spend his evenings and drink away his earnings so ee goes on and his woife doant care about taking pains about a house when t maister aint never at home but to his meals and his children get to look for him coming home drunk and smashing the things and when he gets old hes just a brokendown drunkard wiout a penny saved and nowt but the poorhouse before him now thats the sort o life o a man who cant read or cant read well enough to take pleasure in it has before him that is so beant it  there was a long silence all the lads knew that the picture was a true one  now look at tother side jack went on look at merton he didnt get moore pay a week than a pitman does look how he lived how comfortable everything was what a home that ud be for a man to go back to after his work was done noice furniture a wife looking forward neat and tidy to your coming hoam for the evening your food all comfortable the kids clean and neat and delighted to see feyther home  there was again a long silence  where be the girls to make the tidy wife a cooming from i wonder john jordan said not in stokebridge i reckon  the lasses take mostly after the lads jack said if we became better theyd be ashamed to lag behind mrs dodgson the new schoolmaisters wife told me tother day she thought o opening a sort o night class for big girls to teach em sewing and making their own clothes and summat about cooking and such like  that would be summat like said harry shepherd who saw that his opportunity had come i wonder whether t maister would open a nightschool for us id go for one quick enough i doant know as ive rightly thought it over before but now ye puts it in that way jack there be no doubt i my moind that i should it would be a heap better to get some larning and to live like a decent kind o chap  i doant know john jordan said it moight be better but look what a lot o work one ud have to do  well john i always finds plenty o time for play jack said you could give an hour a day to it and now the winters coming on youd be main glad sometimes as youd got summat to do i should ha to talk to the schoolmaister a bit i doant know as hed be willing to give up his time of an evening two or three evenings a week say two when hes been at work all day it be a good deal to ask a man that is  it be surely harry said but what a sight o good it would do and if his woife be willing to give oop her time to the girls maybe he would do as much for us there was a pause again several of the lads looked irresolute  well bill cummings said i be ready for another if some more of ee will joint the example was contagious four others agreed to join  come harry shepherd said it beant no use if jack cant tell schoolmaister that a dozen o us will come in ef he will open a school two nights a week youll join woant you fred wood  oi allers hated my books fred said and used to be bottom o class it aint as i doant believe what jack simpson says there be no doubt as it would be a sight better lookout if one got to be fond o books and such loike i doant believe as ever i shall be but i doant mind giving it a trial for six months and if at the end o that time i doant like it why i jacks it oop  the adhesion of this seemingly reluctant recruit settled the matter even john jordan yielded upon the same terms and the whole party fifteen in number put down their names and jack simpson undertook to speak to mr dodgson  see how we shall get laughed at john jordan said why we shall get made fun o by the whole place  let em laugh jack said they wont laugh long i never was laughed at and why should you be they canna call us jennies for we sixteen will play any sixteen wiin five miles round at any game they like or fight em if it comes to that we has only got to stick together i shant be one of the nightschool but i am one wi you and well just stick together dont let us mind if they do laugh if they go on at it and i doubt they will just offer to fight anyone your own size and if he be bigger than you like ill take him in hand  thats it harry shepherd said enthusiastically well stick together and you see how well get on and look here i vote we each pay threepence a week that will get us a room at two bob and candles then we can work a night wiout being disturbed  this be a good idea o thine harry ill give my threepence a week as well as the rest and ill come in on the nights when you dont go to school and help any that wants it  yes bill cummings said and well send round challenges to the other pits to play football and rounders i vote we call ourselves the bulldogs and jack shall be our captain  the proposition was carried with unanimity and the bulldogs became a body from that time harry was appointed treasurer and the first weeks subscriptions were paid forthwith and an hour later a room was hired  hullo fred wood said as they poured in and took possession we forgot furniture we must have a table and some benches  it is the captains duty to provide furniture jack said i will get a big table and some benches on monday and then well draw up rules and get em framed and hung over the fireplace then we shall be all in order  nothing could have been more happy than this plan of starting a club it gave all the members a lively interest in the matter and united them by a bond which would keep the lazy and careless from hanging back and it was quite with a sense of excitement that they met on the monday evening  jack had got a large table and some benches inkstands slates paper and pencils were on the table and four candles were burning he took the place of honour at the head of the table and the others much pleased with the appearance of the room took their seats round the table  in the first place jack said striking the table with his fist to call for order i have to report to you that i ha seen the schoolmaister and he says that he will willingly give two hours two nights a week to teaching the bulldogs  this announcement was received with great applause for the lads had all become deeply interested in the matter  he says tuesdays and fridays will suit him from seven till nine and i have in your name accepted with very many thanks his offer for lads it be no light thing that a man who has been all day teaching should give up two evenings a week to help us on and that wiout charge or payment  thats so jack fred wood said i voate we pass a vote o thanks to mr dodgson  there was a chorus of approval  someone ha got to second that proposal jack said we must do things in the proper form  i second it john jordan said  very well jack said are you all agreed all very well then ill write that out neatly in this book i ha bought to keep the records o the club and ill send a copy to mr dodgson im sure he will be pleased i had best act as secretary as well as captain at present till one o you gets on wi his writing and can take it off my hands now we must draw out our rules first we must put down that the following are the original members of the bulldog club then that the objects of the club are to improve ourselves and to make decent men o ourselves next to stick together in a body and to play all sorts o games against any other set all thats been agreed aint it  there were cries of ay ay and jack wrote down the items on the sheet o paper before him  now about new members do we mean to keep it to ourselves or to let in other chaps  keep it to ourselves shouted several  well i dunno harry shepherd said if this is going to do us as much good as we hopes and think it is would it be right to keep the chaps o the place out o course we wouldnt go beyond stokebridge but we might keep it to that  the point was hotly debated the majority being in favour of confining the club to its present members some saying that if it were opened the original members would be swamped by numbers and that their bond of union would be broken  when all had spoken jack simpson said  i think we might go between both opinions if we were to limit the club to twentyfour members this room would just about hold em we would only elect one each week so as to have time to make a good choice any member who broke the rules or made himself unpleasant would be expelled and so we should see in a while all the young chaps o t village wanting to join and it would get to be looked upon as a feather in a chaps cap to belong to it  this proposal was agreed to unanimously  now the next rule i propose jack said is that this room is to be used from seven to nine for work no talking to be allowed arter nine books to be put away and pipes to be lit by them as smoke and to talk till ten i ha been talking to the woman o the house and she will supply cups o coffee or tea at a penny a piece between nine and ten  this rule was agreed to without a dissentient voice  now jack said i doant know as youll all like the next rule i ha to propose but i do think it is a needful one that is that no swearing or bad language be used in this room a fine of a penny being inflicted for each time the rule be broken  there was a dead silence  you see jack said you will all be fined a few times at first but this money will go to the club fund and will help up to get fires i winter youll soon break yourselves of it it be only a trick i did mr merton told me that it was a bad habit and horrible to decent people i said i could never break myself ot he said if i fined myself a penny every time i did it and put it in the poor box o sunday i should soon get out o tway well the first day cost me thirteen pence the next fourpence and afterwards it was only a penny now and then first and last it didnt cost me half a crown and you never hear me swear or use bad language now come bulldogs this will be the first step toward improving yourselves and when you find how easy it be to do wiout it here you will soon do wiout it outside  the rule was finally agreed to but during the first week it carried a good deal of heartburning in the club one of the members left altogether but the rest soon found that the fines which had been so alarming for the first day or two dwindled down  it cost the bulldogs collectively over three pounds to cure themselves of using bad language and the fines kept them in firing paper pens and ink all the winter  on the evening after the opening of the clubroom the whole party accompanied by jack went to the nightschool they looked rather shamefaced as they tramped in but jack introduced them one by one to the master who with a few cordial words put them at their ease for the first night he contented himself by finding out how much each knew how much he remembered of what he had formerly heard for the last half hour he gave them a short lecture on geography drawing a map on the blackboard taking a traveller from place to place and telling them what he saw there then he set them each a task to be learned and a few sums to be done by the following friday and they returned to the clubroom greatly pleased with the first nights lessons  it was not always so light but the lads were in earnest and really worked hard jack visited the room on the off nights explained questions they did not understand and after nine oclock generally read aloud for half an hour while they smoked that is to say he read short sentences and then one or other read them after him jack correcting mistakes in dialect and pronunciation  mr merton had indeed been a friend to jack simpson but there was another friend to whom according to his promise jack reported his doings not telling everything perhaps for jack was not very apt to talk or write about himself but once a year he sent a letter in reply to a long and wise one which he received from his friend the artist according to their agreement for jack had not given up  before the end of a month mr dodgson wrote to mr merton saying that thanks to jack the nightschool was a great success that the lads all behaved extremely well and were making really surprising efforts to improve themselves he augured great things for the village from the movement     chapter xv  the sewing class   stokebridge contained altogether a population of some three thousand souls of whom more than half consisted of the men and boys of the vaughan mine and the families dependent upon them it was a place where except as to accidents at one or other of the pits news was scarce and a small thing therefore created much interest thus the news that the new schoolmaster had opened a night school and that some sixteen or eighteen of the lads belonging to the vaughan had joined it created quite an excitement at first the statement was received with positive disbelief there was no precedent for such a thing and in its ways at least stokebridge was strictly conservative  when the tale was confirmed wonder took the place of unbelief the women were unanimous in the opinion that if the school only kept the lads from drink it would be a blessing to the place drink was indeed the grand test by which they viewed all things to anything which led lads to avoid this curse of their homes their approval was certain and complete whether the acquisition of learning was likely to improve their prospects in life or to make them better men was not considered the great point about the new organization was that it would keep them from the publichouses the curses of the working men and still more of the working mens wives and families of this country  among the men who were however disposed to view the matter as a boys fancy which would soon die away the movement met with slight approval newfangled notions were held in but low estimation among the miners of stokebridge they had got on wiout larning and saw no reason why t lads could not do as they had done theyll be a cocking they noses oop aboove their feythers joost acause they know moore reading and writing but what good ul it do they i wonder an elderly pitman asked a circle of workmen at the chequers and a general affirmatory grunt betokened assent with the spirit of his words  among the young men those of from eighteen to three or four and twenty the opposition was still stronger for here a strong feeling of jealousy was aroused at the thought that their juniors were as they considered stealing a march upon them gibes and jeers were showered upon the bulldogs and two of them were ducked in the canal by a party of five or six of their elders on scrambling out however they ran back to the village and the rest of the party headed by jack at once started on the warpath coming up to the band who had assaulted their comrades they fell upon them with fury and in spite of the latters superior individual strength thrashed them soundly and then gave them a ducking in the canal similar to that which they had inflicted after that it came to be understood in stokebridge that it was best to leave the bulldogs alone or at least to be content with verbal assaults at which indeed the lads were able to hold their own  but it was among the girls of stokebridge those of from fourteen to seventeen years old that this movement upon the part of the boys excited the greatest discussion and the widest divergence of opinion up to the time of the strike jack simpson had been by no means popular among their class it was an anomaly in stokebridge that a lad should have no avowed favourite of his own age among the lasses these adhesions were not often of a permanent character although later on sometimes marriages came of them but for a time and until the almost inevitable quarrel came they were regarded as binding the lad would sometimes buy a ribbon or neckerchief for the lass and she and two or three others would accompany him as with some of his comrades he strolled in the lanes on sunday or would sit by him on a wall or a balk of timber as he smoked and talked with his friends  jacks rigid seclusion after his hour of play was over his apparent indifference to the lasses of the place was felt as a general slight and resented accordingly although the girls were not insensible to his prowess in battle and in sports to his quiet steadiness of character or to the frankness and good temper of his face the general opinion therefore among the young girls of stokebridge was that he was stuck up although in fact few boys in the place had less of conceit and selfglorification than he had  did ee ever hear of such a tale asked one of a group of girls sitting together on a bank while the little ones of whom they were supposed to be in charge played and rolled on the grass as for a lot o boys to go to school again o their own freewill  i dont see no good in it another said not for the schooling theyll get but if it teaches them to keep out o the publics it will be good for their wives some day  it will that put in another earnestly my how feyther did beat mother last night he were as drunk as could be and he went on awful  i think sometimes men are worse nor beasts another said  do ee know ive heard sarah shepherd said that the new schoolmistress be agoing to open a nightschool for girls to teach sewing and cutting out and summat o cooking there was a general exclamation of astonishment and so strange was the news that it was some time before any one ventured a comment on it  what dost think ot sarah questioned at last  only sewing and cutting out and cooking and such like and not lessons bess thompson asked doubtfully  not reglar lessons i mean shell read out while the girls work and perhaps they will read out by turns not lessons you know but stories and tales and travels and that kind o book what dost think ot  twould be a good thing to know how to make dresses fanny jones who was fond of finery remarked  and other things too put in peggy martin and to cook too mother aint a good hand at cooking and it puts feyther in such tempers and sometimes i hardly wonder i shall go if some others go but beest sure it be true sally  harry told me she said and i think jack simpson told him as the schoolmaster said so  the news was too important to be kept to themselves and there was soon a general move homewards  there sally shepherds story received confirmation the schoolmistress had been going from house to house asking all the women who had daughters between the ages of fifteen and eighteen to let them attend a working class in the schoolroom two evenings a week and the answer she almost always received was well i ha no objection to my lass going if she be willing and i think it would be very good for her to know how to make her clothes i can hardly do a stitch myself  mrs dodgson had also informed the women that any of them who liked to supply the material for undergarments or for childrens dresses could have them for the present made up without charge by the class  but suppose they spiles em  they wont spoil them the work may not be very neat at first but the things will be well cut out and strongly put together i will see to that  in a short time the class was opened and forty girls at once attended so pleased were these with their teacher and with the pleasant books that mr dodgson read to themfor his wife was far too much occupied to read and too wise to give the girls a distaste for the class by asking them to do sothat the number of applicants for admission soon far exceeded the number who could be received  mr brook heard shortly afterwards from mr dodgson of the success of the scheme and the great benefit which was likely to accrue from it and at once offered to contribute twenty pounds a year to secure the services of a young woman capable of assisting in the girls school by day and of teaching needlework  thenceforth the number of class evenings was raised to three a week and sixty girls in all were admitted the books chosen for reading were not always tales but for a portion of each evening books treating on domestic matters the care of a house the management of illness cottage gardening c were read and these were found greatly to interest the hearers the book on gardening was a special favourite and soon the pitmen were astonished to see changes in the tiny plots of ground behind their houses the men in charge of the pit horses were coaxed for baskets of manure pennies were saved and devoted to the purchase of seed and the boys found that the most acceptable present was no longer a gay handkerchief or ribbon but a pot of flowers  revolutions are not made in a day but as month passed after month the change in stokebridge became marked the place assumed a smarter and brighter aspect it was rare to hear bad language from lads or girls in the streets for the young ones naturally followed the fashion set by their elder brothers and sisters and as a foul expression not unfrequently cost its utterer a cuff on the head they soon became rare  the girls became more quiet in demeanour neater in dress the boys less noisy and aggressive  the boys nightschool had increased greatly in number the bulldogs after much deliberation had declined to increase their numbers but at jack simpsons suggestion it had been agreed that any of them might join other similar associations in order that these might be conducted on the same lines as their own and the benefits of which they were conscious be thus distributed more widely four other clubs were in consequence established all looking upon the bulldogs as their central association  the vicar of the parish aided the efforts of the school master and mistress for the improvement of the rising generation of stokebridge hitherto all efforts that way had failed but he now got over a magic lantern from birmingham hiring sets of slides of scenery in foreign countries astronomical subjects c and gave lectures once a fortnight these were well attended and the quiet attention with which he was listened to by the younger portion of his audience contrasted so strongly with the indifference or uproar with which a similar attempt had been met some two years before that he told mr brook something like a miracle was being wrought in the parish  mr brook warmly congratulated mr and mrs dodgson on the change but these frankly said that although they had done their best the change was in no slight degree due to the influence of one of the pit lads with whom mr merton had taken great pains and who was certainly a remarkable lad  ah indeed mr brook said i have a faint recollection of his speaking to me some years ago of one of the boys and now i think of it he is the same boy who behaved so bravely in going down that old shaft to save another boys life the men gave him a gold watch of course i remember all about it now i am glad to hear that he is turning out so well in a few years i must see what i can do for him  mr dodgson would have said much more but mr merton had impressed upon him that jack would object above all things to be brought forward and that it was better to let him work his way steadily and bide his time  it was not for some months after the sewing classes had been instituted that those for cooking were established the difficulty was not as to the necessary outlay for stoves and utensils for these mr brook at once offered to provide but as to the food to be cooked  the experiments began on a small scale at first mrs dodgson sent round to say that in all cases of illness she would have broths puddings and cooling drinks prepared at the schools free of charge upon the necessary materials being sent to her this was followed by the plan of buying the materials for food for invalids which was to be supplied at a price that just paid the cost then little steak puddings and pies were made and these commanded a ready sale excellent soups from cheap materials were also provided and for this in winter the demand was greater than they could supply and so the work was extended until the two stoves were fully occupied for three days a week  eight girls at a time were instructed in cookery doing the whole work under the supervision of the mistress two fresh hands came as two left each week thus each received a months teaching on the first week the newcomers simply cleaned and washed the utensils stoves c during the remaining three weeks they learned to make simple soups puddings and pies to cook meat and vegetables the time was short for the purpose but the girls were delighted with their lessons and took the greatest pride in keeping up the reputation of the school kitchens and learned at any rate sufficient to enable them to assist their mothers at home with such effect that the pitmen of stokebridge were astonished at the variety and improvement of their fare     chapter xvi  a new life   jack simpson did not forget the advice mr merton had given him about clothes and a fortnight after his master had gone to birmingham jack went over on saturday afternoon and his kind friend accompanied him to one of the leading tailors there and he was measured for two suits of clothes he went to other shops and bought such articles as mr merton recommendedhats gloves boots c mr merton smiled to himself at the grave attention which jack paid to all he said upon the subject but jack was always earnest in all he undertook and he had quite appreciated what his friend had told him as to the advantage of being dressed so as to excite no attention upon the part of those whom he would meet at mr mertons  the following saturday he went over again and went again to the tailors to try his things on  do you want a dress suit sir the foreman asked with suppressed merriment  what is a dress suit jack said simply i am ignorant about these matters  a dress suit the foreman said struck with the young fellows freedom from all sort of pretence or assumption is the dress gentlemen wear of an evening at dinner parties or other gatherings this is it and he showed jack an engraving  jack looked at ithe had never seen anyone so attired  he looks very affected he said  oh that is the fault of the artist the foreman answered gentlemen look just as natural in these clothes as in any other they are quite simple you seeall black with open vest white shirt white tie and gloves and patent leather boots  a quiet smile stole over jacks face humour was by no means a strong point in his character but he was not altogether deficient in it  i had better have them he said it would look strange i suppose not to be dressed so when others are  it would be a little marked in the event of a dinner or evening party the foreman answered and so jack gave the order  it was two weeks later before he paid his first visit to mr merton for the pretty little house which the latter had taken a mile out of the town had been in the hands of the workmen and furnishers mr merton having drawn on his little capital to decorate and fit up the house so as to be a pretty home for his daughter  it was indeed a larger house than from the mere salary attached to his post he could be able to afford but he reckoned upon considerably increasing this by preparing young men for the university and he was wise enough to know that a good establishment and a liberal table go very far in establishing and widening a connection and in rendering people sensible to a mans merits either in business or otherwise  as mr merton ma late of st johns cambridge and third wrangler of his year he had already been received with great cordiality by his colleagues and at their houses had made the acquaintance of many of the best if not the wealthiest men in birmingham for at birmingham the terms were by no means more synonymous than they are elsewhere  jack had ordered his clothes to be sent to a small hotel near the railway station and had arranged with the landlord that his portmanteau should be kept there and a room be placed at his service on saturday afternoon and monday morning once a month for him to change his things he had walked with mr merton and seen the house and had determined that he would always change before going there on a saturday in order to avoid comments by servants and others who might be visiting them  in thus acting jack had no personal thoughts in the matter much as he always shrank from being put forward as being in any way different from others he had otherwise no selfconsciousness whatever no lad on the pits thought less of his personal appearance or attire and his friend nelly had many times taken him to task for his indifference in this respect mr merton perceived advantages in jacks position in life not being generally known and jack at once fell into the arrangement and carried it out as described to the best of his ability but even he could not help seeing when he had attired himself for his first visit to mr mertons house how complete had been the change in his appearance  who would have thought that just a little difference in the make of a coat would have made such an alteration in ones look he said to himself i feel different altogether but that is nonsense except that these boots are so much lighter than mine that it seems as if i were in my stockings well i suppose i shall soon be accustomed to it  packing a black coat and a few other articles in a handbag and locking up the clothes he had taken off in his portmanteau jack started for mr mertons he was dressed in a wellfitting suit of dark tweed with a claretcoloured neckerchief with plain gold scarfring jacks life of exercise had given him the free use of his limbshe walked erect and his head was well set back on his shoulders altogether with his crisp short waving hair his goodhumoured but resolute face and his steadfast look he was although not handsome yet a very pleasantlooking young fellow  he soon forgot the fact of his new clothes except that he was conscious of walking with a lightness and elasticity strange to him and in half an hour rang at the visitors bell of mr mertons villa  a visitor papa said alice who was sitting near the window of the drawingroom how tiresome just as we were expecting jack simpson it is a gentleman why papa and she clapped her hands it is jack himself i did not know him at first he looks like a gentleman  he is a gentleman mr merton said a true gentleman in thought feeling and speech and will soon adapt himself to the society he will meet here do not remark upon his dress unless he says something about it himself  oh papa i should not think of such a thing i am not so thoughtless as that  the door was opened and jack was shown in  how are you jack i am glad to see you  thank you sir i am always well jack said then turning to miss merton he asked her how she liked birmingham he had seen her often since the time when he first met her at the commencement of the strike as he had helped them in their preparations for removing from stokebridge and had entirely got over the embarrassment which he had felt on the first evening spent there  after talking for a few minutes jack said gravely to mr merton i hope that these clothes will do mr merton  excellently well jack he answered smiling they have made just the difference i expected my daughter hardly knew you when you rang at the bell  i hardly knew myself when i saw myself in a glass jack said now on what principle do you explain the fact that a slight alteration in the cutting and sewing together of pieces of cloth should make such a difference  i do not know that i ever gave the philosophy of the question a moments thought jack said mr merton smiling i can only explain it by the remark that the better cut clothes set off the natural curve of the neck shoulders and figure generally and in the second place being associated in our minds with the peculiar garb worn by gentlemen they give what for want of a better word i may call style a high black hat is the ugliest most shapeless and most unnatural article ever invented but still a high hat good and of the shape in vogue certainly has a more gentlemanly effect to use a word i hate than any other and now my boy you i know dined early so did we we shall have tea at seven so we have three hours for work and there are nearly six weeks arrears so do not let us waste any more time  after this first visit jack went out regularly once every four weeks he fell very naturally into the ways of the house and although his manner often amused alice merton greatly and caused even her father to smile he was never awkward or boorish  as alice came to know him more thoroughly and their conversations ceased to be of a formal character she surprised and sometimes quite puzzled him the girl was full of fun and had a keen sense of humour and her playful attacks upon his earnestness her light way of parrying the problems which jack ever on the alert for information was constantly putting and the cheerful tone which her talk imparted to the general conversation when she was present were all wholly new to the lad often he did not know whether she was in earnest or not and was sometimes so overwhelmed by her light attacks as to be unable to answer  mr merton looked on amused at their wordy conflicts he knew that nothing does a boy so much good and so softens his manner as friendly intercourse with a wellread girl of about his own age and undoubtedly alice did almost as much towards preparing jacks manner for his future career as her father had done towards preparing his mind  as time went on jack often met mr mertons colleagues and other gentlemen who came in in the evening he was always introduced as my young friend simpson with the aside a remarkably clever young fellow and most of those who met him supposed him to be a pupil of the professors  mr merton had within a few months of his arrival at birmingham five or six young men to prepare for cambridge none of them resided in the house but after jack had become thoroughly accustomed to the position mr merton invited them as well as a party of ladies and gentlemen to the house on one of jacks saturday evenings  jack upon hearing that a number of friends were coming in the evening made an excuse to go into the town and took his black bag with him  alice had already wondered over the matter  they will all be in dress papa jack will feel awkward among them  he is only eighteen my dear and it will not matter his not being in evening dress jack will not feel awkward  alice was however very pleased as well as surprised when upon coming down dressed into the drawingroom she found him in full evening dress chatting quietly with her father and two newly arrived guests jack would not have been awkward but he would certainly have been uncomfortable had he not been dressed as were the others for of all things he hated being different to other people  he looked at alice in a pretty pink muslin dress of fashionable make with a surprise as great as that with which she had glanced at him for he had never before seen a lady in full evening dress  presently he said to her quietly i know i never say the right thing miss merton and i daresay it is quite wrong for me to express any personal opinions but you do look  no jack that is quite the wrong thing to say you may say miss merton your dress is a most becoming one although even that you could not be allowed to say except to some one with whom you are very intimate there are as many various shades of compliment as there are of intimacy a brother may say to a sister you look stunning tonightthat is a very slang word jackand she will like it a stranger or a new acquaintance may not say a word which would show that he observes a lady is not attired in a black walking dress  and what is the exact degree of intimacy in which one may say as you denoted miss merton your dress is a most becoming one  i should say the girl said gravely it might be used by a cousin or by an old gentleman a friend of the family  then with a laugh she went off to receive the guests now beginning to arrive in earnest  after this mr merton made a point of having an at home every fourth saturday and these soon became known as among the most pleasant and sociable gatherings in the literary and scientific world of birmingham  so young jack simpson led a dual life spending twentysix days of each month as a pit lad speaking a dialect nearly as broad as that of his fellows and two as a quiet and unobtrusive young student in the pleasant home of mr merton  before a year had passed the one life seemed as natural to him as the other even with his friends he kept them separate seldom speaking of stokebridge when at birmingham save to answer mr mertons questions as to old pupils and giving accounts which to nelly hardy appeared ridiculously meagre of his birmingham experience to his friends at home  this was not from any desire to be reticent but simply because the details appeared to him to be altogether uninteresting to his friends  you need not trouble to tell me any more jack nelly hardy said indignantly i know it all by heart you worked three hours with mr merton dinner at six some people came at eight no one in particular they talked and there was some playing on the piano they went away at twelve next morning after breakfast you went to church had dinner at two took a walk afterwards had tea at halfpast six supper at nine then to bed i wont ask you any more questions jack if anything out of the way takes place you will tell me no doubt     chapter xvii  the dog fight   saturday afternoon walks when there were no special games on hand became an institution among what may be called jack simpsons set at stokebridge the young fellows had followed his lead with all seriousness and a stranger passing would have been astonished at the talk so grave and serious was it in colliery villages as at school the lad who is alike the head of the school and the champion at all games is looked up to and admired and imitated and his power for good or for evil is almost unlimited among his fellows thus the saturday afternoon walks became supplements to the evening classes and questions of all kinds were propounded to jack whose attainments they regarded as prodigious  on such an afternoon as jack was giving his friends a brief sketch of the sun and its satellites and of the wonders of the telescope they heard bursts of applause by many voices and a low deep growling of dogs  it is a dog fight one of the lads exclaimed  it is a brutal sport jack said let us go another way  one of the young fellows had however climbed a gate to see what was going on beyond the hedge  jack he exclaimed there is bill haden fighting his old bitch flora against tom walkers jess and i think the pup is akilling the old dorg  with a bound jack simpson sprang into the field where some twenty or thirty men were standing looking at a dog fight one dog had got the other down and was evidently killing it  throw up the sponge bill the miners shouted the old dorgs no good agin the purp  jack dashed into the ring with a kick he sent the young dog flying across the ring and picked up flora who game to the last struggled to get at her foe  a burst of indignation and anger broke from the men  let un be put her down dang thee how darest meddle here ill knock thee head off and other shouts sounded loudly and threateningly  for shame jack said indignantly be ye men for shame bill haden to match thy old dog twelve year old wi a young un shes been a good dorg and hast brought thee many a tenpun note if beest tired of her gi her poison but i woant stand by and see her mangled  how dare ee kick my dorg a miner said coming angrily forward how dare ee come here and hinder sport  sport jack said indignantly there be no sport in it it is brutal cruelty  the match be got to be fought out another said unless bill haden throws up the sponge for his dog  come tom walker said putting his hand on jacks shoulder get out o this if it warnt for bill haden id knock thee head off we be coom to see spoort and we mean to see it  spoort jack said passionately if its spoort thee wantst ill give it thee flora shant go into the ring agin but oi ull ill fight the best man among ye be he which he will  a chorus of wonder broke from the colliers  then thoust get to fight me tom walker said i bliev he went on looking round there beant no man here ull question that thoust wanted a leathering for soom time jack simpson wi thy larning and thy ways and im not sorry to be the man to gi it thee  no no bill haden said and the men round for the most part echoed his words taint fair for thee to take t lad at his word he be roight i hadnt ought to ha matched flora no more she ha been a good bitch in her time but she be past it and ill own up that thy pup ha beaten her and pay thee the two pounds i lay on her if eell let this matter be  noa tom walker said the young un ha challenged the best man here and i be agoaing to lick him if he doant draw back  i shall not draw back jack said divesting himself of his coat waistcoat and shirt flora got licked acause she was too old maybe ill be licked acause i be too young but she made a good foight and soll oi no dad i wont ha you to back me harry here shall do that  the ring was formed again the lads stood on one side the men on the other it was understood now that there was to be a fight and no one had another word to say  ill lay a fipound note to a shilling on the old un a miner said  ill take ee bill haden answered it haint a great risk to run and jack is as game as flora  several other bets were made at similar odds the lads although they deemed the conflict hopeless yet supporting their champion  tom walker stood but little taller than jack who was about five feet six and would probably grow two inches more but he was three stone heavier jack being a pound or two only over ten while the pitman reached thirteen the latter was the acknowledged champion of the vaughan pits as jack was incontestably the leader among the lads the disproportion in weight and muscle was enormous but jack had not a spare ounce of flesh on his bones while the pitman was fleshy and out of condition  it is not necessary to give the details of the fight which lasted over an hour in the earlier portion jack was knocked down again and again and was several times barely able to come up to the call of time but his bulldog strain as he called it gradually told while intemperate habits and want of condition did so as surely upon his opponent  the derisive shouts with which the men had hailed every knockdown blow early in the fight soon subsided and exclamations of admiration at the pluck with which jack reeling and confused came up time after time took their place  it be a foight arter all one of them said at the end of the first ten minutes i wouldnt lay more nor ten to one now  ill take as many tens to one as any o ye like to lay bill haden said but no one cared to lay even these odds  at the end of half an hour the betting was only two to one jack who had always given his head that is had always ducked so as to receive the blows on the top of his head where they were supposed to do less harm was as strong as he was after the first five minutes tom walker was panting with fatigue wild and furious at his want of success over an adversary he had despised  the cheers of the lads silent at first rose louder with each round and culminated in a yell of triumph when at the end of fiftyfive minutes tom walker having for the third time in succession been knocked down was absolutely unable to rise at the call of time to renew the fight  illustration jack is victorious  never had an event created such a sensation in stokebridge at first the news was received with absolute incredulity but when it became thoroughly understood that bill hadens boy jack simpson had licked tom walker the wonder knew no bounds so struck were some of the men with jacks courage and endurance that the offer was made to him that if he liked to go to birmingham and put himself under that noted pugilist the chicken his expenses would be paid and £50 be forthcoming for his first match jack knowing that this offer was made in good faith and with good intentions and was in accordance with the custom of mining villages declined it courteously and thankfully but firmly to the surprise and disappointment of his wouldbe backers who had flattered themselves that stokebridge was going to produce a champion middleweight  he had not come unscathed from the fight for it proved that one of his ribs had been broken by a heavy body hit and he was for some weeks in the hands of the doctor and was longer still before he could again take his place in the pit  bill hadens pride in him was unbounded and during his illness poor old flora who seemed to recognize in him her champion lay on his bed with her black muzzle in the hand not occupied with a book  the victory which jack had won gave the finishing stroke to his popularity and influence among his companions and silenced definitely and for ever the sneers of the minority who had held out against the change which he had brought about he himself felt no elation at his victory and objected to the subject even being alluded to  it was just a question of wind and last he said i was nigh being done for at the end o the first three rounds i just managed to hold on and then it was a certainty if tom walker had been in condition he would have finished me in ten minutes if he had come on working as a getter i should ha been nowhere hes a weigher now and makes fat and his muscles are flabby the best dorg cant fight when hes out o condition  but in spite of that the lads knew that it was only bulldog courage that had enabled jack to hold out over these bad ten minutes  as for jane haden her reproaches to her husband for in the first place matching flora against a young dog and in the second for allowing jack to fight so noted a man as tom walker were so fierce and vehement that until jack was able to leave his bed and take his place by the fire bill was but little at home spending all his time even at meals in that place of refuge from his wifes tonguethe chequers     chapter xviii  stokebridge feast   even among the mining villages of the black country stokebridge had a reputation for roughness and hardened topers of the place would boast that in no village in the county was there so much beer drunk per head stokebridge feast was frequented by the dwellers of the mining villages for miles round and the place was for the day a scene of disgraceful drunkenness and riot crowds of young men and women came in the publichouses were crowded there was a shouting of songs and a scraping of fiddles from each taproom and dancing went on in temporary booths  one of these feasts had taken place just after the establishment of the night classes and had been marked by even greater drunkenness and more riotous scenes than usual for years the vicar in the church and the dissenting ministers in their meetinghouses had preached in vain against the evil their congregations were small and in this respect their words fell upon ears closed to exhortation during the year which had elapsed however there was a perceptible change in stokebridge a change from which those interested in it hoped for great results  the bulldogs and their kindred societies had set the fashion and the demeanour and bearing of the young men and boys was quiet and orderly in every match which they had played at rounders football and quoits with the surrounding villages stokebridge had won easily and never were the games entered into with more zest than now  the absence of bad language in the streets was surprising the habit of restraint upon the tongue acquired in the clubrooms had spread and two months after jacks first proposal had been so coldly received the proposition to extend the fines to swearing outside the walls as well as in was unanimously agreed to the change in the demeanour of the girls was even greater besides the influence of mrs dodgson and her assistant aided perhaps by the desire to stand well in the eyes of lads of the place their boisterous habits had been toned down dark neatly made dresses took the place of brightcoloured and flimsy ones hair faces and hands showed more care and selfrespect  the example of the young people had not been without its influence upon the elders not indeed upon the regular drinking set but upon those who only occasionally gave way the tidier and more comfortable homes the better cooked meals all had their effect and all but brutalized men shrank from becoming objects of shame to their children as to the women of stokebridge they were for the most part delighted with the change some indeed grumbled at the newfangled ways and complained that their daughters were getting above them but as the lesson taught in the nightclasses was that the first duty of a girl or woman was to make her home bright and happy to bear patiently the tempers of others to be a peacemaker and a help to bear with children and to respect elders even the grumblers gave way at last  the very appearance of the village was changing pots of bright flowers stood in the windows creepers and roses climbed over the walls patches full of straggling weeds were now wellkept gardens in fact as mr brook said one day to the vicar one would hardly know the place  there has indeed been a strange movement for good the clergyman said and i cannot take any share of it to myself it has been going on for some time invisibly and the night schools and classes for girls have given it an extraordinary impulse it is a changed place altogether i am sorry that the feast is at hand it always does an immense deal of mischief and is a time of quarrel drunkenness and license i wish that something could be done to counteract its influence  so do i mr brook said can you advise anything  i cannot the vicar said but i will put on my hat and walk with you down to the schoolhouse to dodgson and his wife is due the real credit of the change they are indefatigable and their influence is very great let us put the question to them  the schoolmaster had his evening class in mrs dodgson had ten girls working and reading in her parlour as she invited that number of the neatest and most quiet of her pupils to tea on each evening that her husband was engaged with his nightschool these evenings were greatly enjoyed by the girls and the hope of being included among the list of invited had done much towards producing a change of manners  it was a fine evening and the schoolmaster and his wife joined mr brook out of doors and apologizing for the room being full asked them to sit down in the rosecovered arbour at the end of the garden the vicar explained the object of the visit  my wife and i have been talking the matter over mr brook the schoolmaster said and we deplore these feasts which are the bane of the place they demoralize the village all sorts of good resolutions give way under temptation and then those who have given way are ashamed to rejoin their better companions it cannot be put down i suppose  no mr brook said it is held in a field belonging to the chequers and even did i succeed in getting it closedwhich of course would be out of the questionthey would find some other site for the booths  would you be prepared to go to some expense to neutralize the bad effects of this feast mr brook  certainly any expense in reason  what i was thinking sir is that if upon the afternoon of the feast you could give a fête in your grounds beginning with say a cricketmatch followed by a tea with conjuring or some such amusement afterwardsfor i do not think that they would care for dancingwinding up with sandwiches and cakes and would invite the girls of my wifes sewingclasses with any other girls they may choose to bring with them and the lads of my evening class with similar permission to bring friends we should keep all those who are really the moving spirits of the improvement which has taken place here out of reach of temptation  your idea is excellent mr brook said i will get the band of the regiment at birmingham over and we will wind up with a display of fireworks and any other attraction which after thinking the matter over you can suggest shall be adopted i have greatly at heart the interests of my pitmen and the fact that last year they were led away to play me a scurvy trick is all forgotten now a good work has been set on foot here and if we can foster it and keep it going stokebridge will in future years be a very different place to what it has been  mr dodgson consulted jack simpson the next day as to the amusements likely to be most popular but jack suggested that fred wood and bill cummings should be called into consultation for as he said he knew nothing of girls ways and his opinions were worth nothing his two friends were sent for and soon arrived they agreed that a cricketmatch would be the greatest attraction and that the band of the soldiers would delight the girls it was arranged that a challenge should be sent to batterbury which lay thirteen miles off and would therefore know nothing of the feast the stokebridge team had visited them the summer before and beaten them therefore they would no doubt come to stokebridge they thought that a good conjuror would be an immense attraction as such a thing had never been seen in stokebridge and that the fireworks would be a splendid wind up mr brook had proposed that a dinner for the contending cricket teams should be served in a marquee but to this the lads objected as not only would the girls be left out but also the lads not engaged in the match it would be better they thought for there to be a table with sandwiches buns lemonade and tea from which all could help themselves  the arrangements were all made privately as it was possible that the publicans might were they aware of the intended counter attraction change the day of the feast although this was unlikely seeing that it had from time immemorial taken place on the 3rd of september except only when that day fell on a sunday still it was better to run no risk a meeting of the bulldogs was called for the 27th of august and at this jack announced the invitation which had been received from mr brook a few were inclined to demur at giving up the jollity of the feast but by this time the majority of the lads had gone heart and soul into the movement for improvement the progress made had already been so great the difficulties at first met had been so easily overcome that they were eager to carry on the work one or two of those most doubtful as to their own resolution were the most ready to accept the invitation of their employer for it was morally certain that everyone would be drunk on the night of the feast and it was an inexorable law of the bulldogs that any of the members getting drunk were expelled from that body the invitation was at last accepted without a dissenting voice the challenge to batterbury written and then the members went off to the associated clubs of which they were members to obtain the adhesion of these also to the fête at mr brooks mrs dodgson had harder work with the sewingclass the attraction of the dancing and display of finery at the feast was greater to many of the girls than to the boys many eagerly accepted the invitation but it was not until mr dodgson came in late in the evening and announced in an audible tone to his wife that he was glad to say that the whole of the young fellows of the nightschool had accepted the invitation that the girls all gave way and agreed to go to the fête  accordingly on the 3rd of september just as the people from the pit villages round were flocking in to stokebridge a hundred and fifty of the young people of that place with a score or two of young married couples and steady men and women set out in their sunday suits for mr brooks  it was a glorious day the cricketmatch was a great success the military band was delightful and mr brook had placed it on the lawn so that those of the young people who chose could dance to the inspiring strains piles of sandwiches disappeared during the afternoon and the tea coffee and lemonade were pronounced excellent there was too a plentiful supply of beer for such of the lads as preferred it as mr brook thought that it would look like a want of confidence in his visitors did he not provide them with beer  batterbury was beaten soundly and when it was dark the party assembled in a large marquee there a conjuror first performed and after giving all the usual wonders produced from an inexhaustible box such pretty presents in the way of wellfurnished workbags and other useful articles for the girls that these were delighted but the surprise of the evening was yet to come it was not nine oclock when the conjuror finished and mr dodgson was thinking anxiously that the party would be back in stokebridge long before the feast was over suddenly a great pair of curtains across the end of the tent drew aside and a regular stage was seen mr brook had obtained the services of five or six actors and actresses from the birmingham theatre together with scenery and all accessories and for two hours and a half the audience was kept in a roar of laughter by some wellacted farces  when the curtain fell at last mr brook himself came in front of it so long and hearty was the cheering that it was a long time before he could obtain a hearing at last silence was restored  i am very glad my friends he said that you have had a happy afternoon and evening and i hope that another year i shall see you all here again i should like to say a few words before we separate you young men lads and lasses will in a few years have a paramount influence in stokebridge upon you it depends whether that place is to be as it used to be like other colliery villages in staffordshire or to be a place inhabited by decent and civilized people i am delighted to observe that a great change has lately come over it due in a great measure to your good and kind friends mr and mrs dodgson who have devoted their whole time and efforts to your welfare the cheering at this point was as great as that which had greeted mr brook himself but was even surpassed by that which burst out when a young fellow shouted out and jack simpson during this jack simpson savagely made his way out of the tent and remained outside muttering threats about punching heads till the proceedings were over and jack simpson mr brook went on smiling after the cheering had subsided i feel sure that the improvement will be maintained when you see the comfort of homes in which the wives are cleanly tidy and intelligent able to make the dresses of themselves and their children and to serve their husbands with decently cooked food and in which the husbands spend their evenings and their wages at home treating their wives as rational beings reading aloud or engaged in cheerful conversation and compare their homes with those of the drunkard and the slattern it would seem impossible for any reasonable human being to hesitate in his or her choice between them it is in your power my friends each and all which of these homes shall be yours i have thought that some active amusement is necessary and have arranged after consultation with your vicar and with mr and mrs dodgson that a choirmaster from birmingham shall come over twice a week to train such of you as may wish and may have voices in choirsinging as the lads of stokebridge can beat those of any of the surrounding villages at cricket so i hope in time the choir of the lads and lasses of this place will be able to hold its own against any other again the speaker had to pause for the cheering was enthusiastic and now goodnight and may i say that i hope and trust that when the fireworks which will now be displayed are over you will all go home and straight to bed without being tempted to join in the doings at the feast if so it will be a satisfaction to me to think that for the first time since the feast was first inaugurated neither lad nor lass of stokebridge will have cause to look back upon the feastday with regret or shame     chapter xix  the great riot   stokebridge feast had not gone off with its usual spirit the number of young pitmen and lads from the surrounding villages were as large as ever and there was no lack of lasses in gay bonnets and bright dresses the fact however that almost the whole of the lads and girls of stokebridge between the ages of fifteen and eighteen had left the village and gone to a rival fête elsewhere cast a damper on the proceedings there were plenty of young women and young men in stokebridge who were as ready as ever to dance and to drink and who were perhaps even gaudier in attire and more boisterous in manner than usual as a protest against the recession of their juniors for stokebridge was divided into two very hostile camps and as was perhaps not unnatural those over the age of the girls and lads at the nightschools resented the changes which had been made and rebelled against the as they asserted airs of superiority of younger sisters and brothers  in some cases no doubt there was ground for the feeling the girls and lads eager to introduce the new lessons of order and neatness which they had learned may have gone too fast and acted with too much zeal although their teacher had specially warned them against so doing hence the feeling of hostility to the movement was strong among a small section of stokebridge and the feeling was heightened by the secession in a body of the young people from the feast  as the day went on the publichouses were as full as ever indeed it was said that never before had so much liquor been consumed the fiddles played and the dancing and boisterous romping went on as usual but there was less real fun and enjoyment as evening came on the young fellows talked together in angry groups whether the proposal emanated from some of the stokebridge men or from the visitors from other villages was afterwards a matter of much dispute but it gradually became whispered about among the dancing booths and publichouses that there was an intention to give the party from brooks a warm reception when they arrived volleys of mud and earth were prepared and some of the overdressed young women tossed their heads and said that a spattering with mud would do the stuckup girls no harm  the older pitmen who would have certainly opposed any such design being carried out were kept in ignorance of what was intended the greater portion were indeed drunk long before the time came when the party would be returning from the fête  at a quarter before twelve jane haden who had been sitting quietly at home went up to the chequers to look after her husband and to see about his being brought home should he be incapable of walking the music was still playing in the dancing booths but the dancing was kept up without spirit for a number of young men and lads were gathered outside as she passed she caught a few words which were sufficient to inform her of what was going on get some sticks oot o hedges fill your pockets oop wi stones well larn em to spoil the feast  jane saw that an attack was going to be made upon the party and hesitated for a moment what to do the rockets were going up in mr brooks grounds and she knew she had a few minutes yet first she ran to the house of james shepherd the pitman who was a sturdy man had been asleep for the last three hours she knocked at the door unlocked it and went in  jim she called in a loud voice  aye what bet said a sleepy voice upstairs bet thou harry and sally  no it be i jane haden get up quickly jim quick man there be bad doings and thy lad and lass are like to have their heads broke if no worse  alarmed by the words and the urgent manner of his neighbour jim and his wife slipped on a few clothes and came down jane at once told them what she had heard  there be between two and three hundred of em she said as far as i could see the wust lot out o stokebridge and a lot o roughs from t other villages quick jim do you and ann go round quick to the houses o all the old hands who ha kept away from the feast or who went home drunk early they may ha slept t off by this and get un together let em take pickhelves and if theres only twenty of ye and ye fall upon this crowd yell drive em if ye doant it will go bad wi all our lads and lasses ill go an warn em and tell em to stop a few minutes on t road to give ee time to coom up my jack and the lads will foight no fear o that but they cant make head agin so many armed wi sticks and stones too but if ye come up behind and fall on em when it begins yell do even though they be stronger  fully awake now to the danger which threatened the young people for the pitman and his wife knew that when blows were exchanged and blood heated things would go much further than was at first intended they hurried off to get a few men together while jane haden started for the hall  already the riotous crowd had gone on and she had to make a detour but she regained the road and burst breathless and panting into the midst of the throng of young people coming along the lane chatting gaily of the scenes of the evening  stop stop she cried dont go a foot furtherwhere be my jack  its mrs haden nelly hardy said jack its your mother  what is it jack said in astonishment anything wrong wi dad  stop mrs haden gasped again theres three hundred and more young chaps and boys wi sticks and stones joost awaiting on this side tvillage awaiting to pay you all oot  ejaculations of alarm were heard all round and several of the girls began to whimper  hush mr dodgson said coming forward let all keep silence there may be no occasion for alarm let us hear all about it mrs haden  mrs haden repeated her story and said that harrys father and mother were getting a body of pitmen to help them  i think mr dodgson said jack the girls had best go back to mr brooks as quickly as possible we will come and fetch them when its all over  i think so too said mr dodgson they might be injured by stones my dear do you lead the girls back to mr brooks the house will hardly be shut up yet and even if it is mr brook will gladly receive you there is no chance of any of the ruffians pursuing them do you think jack when they find they have only us to deal with  i dont know sir if three or four of us were to put on their cloaks something light to show in the dark they will think the girls are among us  quick here they come mr dodgson said go back silently girls not a word  two or three cloaks and shawls were hastily borrowed and the lads then turned up the road where the sound of suppressed laughter and coarse oaths could be heard while the young women went off at a rapid pace towards the hall  there are four of the clubs nigh twenty in each jack said let each club keep together and go right at em stick together whatever ye do  ill take my place by you jack mr dodgson said you are our captain now  talking in a careless voice the party went forward the road here was only divided from the fields on either side by a newly planted hedge of a foot or so in height jack had arranged that he with the few married pitmen mr dodgson and the eight bulldogs who did not belong to the other associations should hold the road that two of the other clubs should go on each side fight their way as far as they could and then close in on the road to take the assailants there on both flanks  the spirit of association did wonders many of the lads were but fourteen or fifteen yet all gathered under their respective leaders and prepared for what they felt would be a desperate struggle presently they saw a dark mass gathered in the road  as soon as the light shawls were seen there was a cry of here they be give it em well lads and a volley of what were in the majority of cases clods of earth but among which were many stones was poured in without an instants pause the party attacked separated two bands leapt into the field on either side and then the whole rushed at the assailants no such charge as this had been anticipated the cowardly ruffians had expected to give a complete surprise to hear the shrieks of the girls and perhaps some slight resistance from a few of the older lads the suddenness of this attack astonished them  in an instant jack and his supporters were in their midst and the fury which animated them at this cowardly attack and the unity of their action bore all before them and in spite of their sticks the leaders of the assailants were beaten to the ground then the sheer weight of the mass behind stopped the advance and the conflict became a general one in the crowd and confusion it was difficult to distinguish friend from foe and this prevented the assailants from making full use of their stakes rails and other implements with which they were armed they were however getting the best of it mr dodgson had been knocked down with a heavy stake and several others were badly hurt when the strong bands in the field who had driven back the scattered assailants there fell upon the flanks of the main body in the road  for five minutes the fight was a desperate one and then just as numbers and weapons were telling there was a shout in the rear and fifteen pitmen headed by jim shepherd and armed with pick handles as formidable weapons as could be desired in the hands of strong men fell upon the rear of the assailants yells shouts and heavy crashing blows told the tale to those engaged in front and at once the assailants broke and scattered in flight  catch em and bring em down jack shouted they shall pay for this nights work  such of the lads as were not disabled started off and being fleet of foot those of the assailants nearest to them had little chance of escape two or three lads together sprung upon one and pulled him down and so when the pursuit ended twentynine of the assailants had fallen into their hands in addition to this a score of them lay or sat by the road with broken heads and bones the work of the pitmens weapons  of the lads the greater part had been badly knocked about and some lay insensible in the road the prisoners were brought together five of the pitmen with twenty of the lads marched with those able to walk to the village where they shut them up in the schoolroom the other pitmen remained in charge of the wounded of both sides and the rest of the party were sent back to mr brooks to fetch the women and girls near the house they met mr brook accompanied by his two menservants and gardener armed with spades hurrying forward and he expressed his delight at the issue of the conflict but shook his head at the number of serious injuries on both sides  in a shed near the house were a number of hurdles and twenty of these were at once sent forward with the men to carry those unable to walk into the village  mrs dodgson turned pale as her husband his face covered with blood entered the diningroom where huddled together the frightened girls were standing mrs dodgson aided by nelly hardy having done her utmost to allay their fears  i am not hurt mr dodgson said heartily at least not seriously but i fear that some are it is all over now and those ruffians have fled jack simpson and a party are outside to escort you home we dont know who are hurt yet but they will be carried to the girls schoolroom and attended there harry shepherd has gone on to get the doctor up and mr brook is sending off a man on horseback to birmingham for some more medical aid and a body of police to take charge of the fellows we have captured they will be in by the early train  everything was quiet in stokebridge when the party with the prisoners arrived the pitmen before starting had gone into the publichouse to get any sober enough to walk to join them and the few who had kept up the dancing alarmed at the serious nature of the affair of which they had tacitly approved scattered to their homes  the news of the conflict however quickly circulated lights appeared in windows and the women who had sons or daughters at the fête flocked out into the streets to hear the news many other pitmen whom there had not been time enough to summon soon joined them and deep indeed was the wrath with which the news of the assault was received most of the men at once hurried away to the scene of conflict to see who were hurt and to assist to carry them in and the sole ground for satisfaction was that the women and girls had all escaped injury     chapter xx  the arm of the law   that was a sad night at stokebridge seven of the lads were terribly injured and in two cases the doctors gave no hope of recovery thirteen of the other party were also grievously hurt by the blows of the pitmens helves some had limbs broken and three lay unconscious all night most of the boys had scalp wounds inflicted by stones or sticks which required dressing worst of all was the news that among the twentyfive uninjured prisoners were eight who belonged to stokebridge besides five among the wounded  very few in the village closed an eye that night mothers went down and implored the pitmen on guard to release their sons but the pitmen were firm moreover mr brook as a magistrate had placed the two constables of the place at the door with the strictest order to allow none of the prisoners to escape the six oclock train brought twenty policemen from birmingham and these at once took charge of the schoolhouse and relieved the pitmen of their charge the working of the mine was suspended for the day and large numbers of visitors poured into the place so desperate a riot had never occurred in that neighbourhood before for even the attack upon the machinery of the mine was considered a less serious affair than this  not only did curiosity to learn the facts of the case attract a crowd of visitors but there were many people who came from the pit villages near to inquire after missing husbands and sons and loud were the wailings of women when it was found that these were either prisoners or were lying injured in the temporary hospital  strangers entering the village would have supposed that a great explosion had taken place in some neighbouring pit blinds were down women stood at the doors with their aprons to their eyes children went about in an awed and silent way as if afraid of the sound of their own voice many of the young men and lads had their heads enveloped in surgical bandages and a strange and unnatural calm pervaded the village the chequers and other publichouses however did a roaring trade for the sightseer in the black country is the thirstiest of men  it was soon known that the magistrates would sit at mr brooks at one oclock and a policeman went round the village with a list of names given him by mr dodgson to summon witnesses to attend jack simpson had strongly urged that his name might not be included in the first place because above all things he hated being put forward and in the second as he pointed out to the schoolmaster it might excite a feeling against him and hinder his power for good if he the leader of the young men was to appear as a witness against the elders especially as among the prisoners was tom walker with whom he had fought as jack could give no more testimony than his companions and as generally it was considered an important and responsible privilege to appear as witness mr dodgson omitted jacks name from the list  there was some groaning in the crowd when the uninjured prisoners were marched out under escort of the police for the attack upon young women was so contrary to all the traditions of the country that the liveliest indignation prevailed against all concerned in it the marquee used the night before for the theatricals had been hastily converted into a justice room at a table sat mr brook with four other magistrates with a clerk to take notes the prisoners were ranged in a space railed off for the purpose and the general public filled the rest of the space  jane haden was the first witness called she gave her evidence clearly but with an evident wish to screen some of the accused and was once or twice sharply reproved by the bench she could not say who were among the men she saw gathered nor recognize any of those who had used the threatening expressions which had so alarmed her that she went round to arouse the elder men and then ran off to warn the returning party  mrs haden sir john butler who was the chairman of the magistrates said very great praise is due to you for your quickness and decision had it not been for this there can be no doubt that the riot would have led to results even more disastrous than those which have taken place at the same time it is the feeling of the court that you are now trying to screen the accused for it can hardly be that passing so close you could fail to recognize some of those whom you heard speak  mr dodgson then gave his evidence as did several of the lads who proved the share that the accused had taken in the fray and that they were captured on the spot while two of the pitmen proved that when they arrived upon the spot a desperate riot was going on and that they joined in the fray to assist the party attacked  the examination lasted for four hours at the end of which the whole of the prisoners were remanded to prison the case being adjourned for two days  before these were passed both the lads whose cases had been thought hopeless from the first died and the matter assumed even a more serious appearance before the next hearing several of the prisoners offered to turn kings evidence and stated that they had been incited by the young women at the feast  great excitement was caused in the village when ten or twelve young women were served with warrants to appear on the following day they were placed in the dock with the other prisoners but no direct evidence was taken against them the number of the accused were further swelled by two men belonging to other villages who had been arrested on the sworn evidence of some of the lads that they had been active in the fray  at the conclusion of the case the whole of the male prisoners were committed for trial on the charges of manslaughter and riot after these had been removed in custody sir john butler addressed a severe admonition to the women  it had he said been decided not to press the charge against them of inciting to riot but that they had used expressions calculated to stir the men up to their foul and dastardly attack upon a number of young women and girls there could be no doubt the magistrates however had decided to discharge them and hoped that the inward reproach which they could not but feel at having a hand in this disgraceful and fatal outrage would be a lesson to them through life  trembling and abashed the women made their way home many of the crowd hissing them as they passed along  when six weeks later the assizes were held four of the prisoners including tom walker who was proved to be the leader were sentenced to seven years penal servitude ten men had terms of imprisonment varying from two to five years and the rest were let off with sentences of from six to eighteen months  very long did the remembrance of the black feast as it came to be called linger in the memories of the people of stokebridge and the surrounding district great as was the grief and suffering caused alike to the friends of those injured and of those upon whom fell punishment and disgrace the ultimate effect of the riot was however most beneficial to stokebridge many of the young men who had most strongly opposed and derided the efforts of their juniors to improve themselves were now removed for in addition to those captured and sentenced several of those who had taken part in the riot hastily left the place upon the following day fearing arrest and punishment for their share in the nights proceedings few of them returned after the conclusion of the trial nor did the prisoners after the termination of their sentences for the feeling against them in the district was so strong that they preferred obtaining work in distant parts of the country  a similar effect was produced upon the young women the narrow escape which they had had of being sent to prison the disgrace of being arrested and publicly censured the averted looks of their neighbours and the removal from the place of the young men with whom they had been used to associate combined to produce a great effect upon them  some profited by the lesson and adapted themselves to the altered ways of the place others after trying to brave it out left stokebridge and obtained employment in the factories of birmingham while others again previously engaged to some of the young men who had left the village were sooner or later married to them and were heard of no more in stokebridge  this removal by one means or another of some forty or fifty of the young men and women of the place most opposed to the spirit of improvement produced an excellent effect other miners came of course to the village to take the places of those who had left but as mr brook instructed his manager to fill up the vacant stalls as far as possible with middleaged men with families and not with young men the newcomers were not an element of disturbance  the price of coal was at this time high and mr brook informed the clergyman that as he was drawing a larger income than usual from the mines he was willing to give a sum for any purpose which he might recommend as generally useful to the families of his workpeople the vicar as usual consulted his valued assistants the dodgsons and after much deliberation it was agreed that if a building were to be erected the lower story of which should be fitted up as a laundry and washhouse upon the plan which was then being introduced in some large towns it would be an immense boon to the place the upper story was to be furnished as a readingroom with a few papers and a small library of useful and entertaining books for reading upon the spot or lending plans were obtained and estimates given and mr brook expressed his willingness to contribute the sum of eighteen hundred pounds for which a contractor offered to complete the work     chapter xxi  a knotty question   it has not been mentioned that at the fête at mr brooks on the memorable occasion of the black feast mr merton and his daughter were staying as guests with mr brook mr merton was much struck with the extraordinary improvement which had taken place in the bearing and appearance of the young people  yes mr dodgson whom he congratulated upon the change said it is entirely due to the suggestion which you made upon my arrival here the nightschools for lads and the sewing and cooking classes for the girls have done wonders and i have found in the lad you recommended to my attention jack simpson an invaluable ally without him indeed i think that our plan would have been a failure he is a singular young fellow so quiet yet so determined the influence he has over the lads of his own age is immense  he is more than singular mr merton said warmly he is extraordinary you only see one side of his character i see both as a scholar he is altogether remarkable he could carry off any open scholarship at cambridge and could take away the highest honours he could pass high up among the wranglers even now and has a broad and solid knowledge of other subjects  indeed mr dodgson said surprised this is quite new to me i know that he studies hard privately and that he went over to see you once a month but i had no idea that his acquirements were anything exceptional and indeed although his speech is often superior to that of the other young fellows he often makes mistakes in grammar and pronunciation  mr merton laughed that is one of his peculiarities he does not wish to be thought above his fellows look at his dress now but if you saw him with me and heard him talking with the first men of education and science in birmingham you would share the astonishment they often express to me and would take him not only for a young gentleman but for one of singular and exceptionally cultured mind  jacks attire indeedit was after the conclusion of the cricketmatch and he had changed his clotheswas that of the ordinary pitman in his sunday suit a black cutaway coat badly fitting and made by the village tailor a black waistcoat and trousers with thick highlow shoes his appearance had attracted the attention of miss merton who as he approached her held out her hand  how are you jack what on earth have you been doing to yourself you look a complete guy in these clothes i was half tempted to cut you downright  jack laughed  this is my sunday suit miss merton it is just the same as other peoples  perhaps it is the girl said laughing and looking round with just a little curl of her lip but you know better jack why should you make such a figure of yourself  i dress here like what i am jack said simply a pitman at your house i dress as one of your fathers guests  i suppose you please yourself and that you always do mr jack simpson you are the most obstinate incorrigible  ruffian jack put in laughing  well i dont know about ruffian the girl said laughing too but jack who is that girl watching us the quietlooking girl in a dark brown dress and straw bonnet  that is my friend nelly hardy jack said seriously  yes you have often spoken to me about her and i have wanted to see her what a nice face she has and handsome too with her great dark eyes jack you must introduce me to her i should like to know her  certainly jack said with a pleased look and accompanied by alice he walked across the lawn towards her  nelly turned the instant that they moved and walking away joined some other girls jack however followed  nelly he said when he reached her this is miss merton who wants to know you miss merton this is my friend nelly hardy  nelly bent her head silently but alice held out her hand frankly  jack has told me so much about you she said that i wanted above all things to see you  nelly looked steadily up into her face it was a face any one might look at with pleasure frank joyous and kindly it was an earnest face too less marked and earnest than that now looking at her but with lines of character and firmness  nellys expression softened as she gazed  you are very good miss merton i have often heard of you too and wanted to see you as much as you could have done to see me  i hope you like me now you do see me miss merton laughed you wont be angry when i say that i like you though you did turn away when you saw us coming  you are accustomed to meet people and be introduced nelly said quietly i am not you see  i dont think you are shy miss merton said smiling but you had a reason perhaps some day when we know each other better you will tell me i have been scolding jack for making such a figure of himself you are his friend and should not let him do it  jack laughed while nelly looked in surprise at him  what is the matter with him she asked i dont see that there is anything wrong  not wrong miss merton said only singular to me he has got on clothes just like all the rest which dont fit him at all and look as if they had been made to put on to a wooden figure in a shop window while when we see him he is always properly dressed  nelly flashed a quiet look of inquiry at jack  you never told me jack she said with an aggrieved ring in her voice that you dressed differently at birmingham to what you do here  there was nothing to tell really he said quietly i told you that i had had some clothes made there and always wore them at mr mertons but i dont know and he smiled that i did enter into any particulars about their cut indeed i never thought of this myself  i dont suppose you did jack the girl said gently for she knew how absolutely truthful he was but you ought to have told me but see they are getting ready to go into the tent and i must help look after the young ones  what a fine face she has alice said but i dont think she quite likes me jack  not like you jack said astonished what makes you think that she was sure to like you why even if nobody else liked you nelly would because you have been so kind to me                                       for the next few days the serious events of the night absorbed all thought indeed it was not until the following sunday afternoon that jack and nelly hardy met harry shepherd who generally accompanied them in their walks upon this day was still suffering from the effects of the injuries he had received in the riot jack and his companion talked over that event until they turned to come back  then after a pause the girl asked suddenly how do you like alice merton jack  jack was in no way taken by surprise but ignorant that the black eyes were keenly watching him he replied  oh i like her very much i have often told you so nelly  do you like her better than me jack  jack looked surprised this time  what should put such a thought in your head lass you know i like you and harry better than any one in the world we are like three brothers it is not likely i should like alice merton whom i only see once a month better than you she is very kind very pleasant very bright she treats me as an equal and i would do anything for her but she couldnt be the same as you are no one can perhaps he said years onfor you know that i have always said that i should not marry till im thirty thats what my good friend told me more than ten years agoi shall find some one i shall like as well as you but that will be in a different way and you will be married years and years before that let me think you are nearly seventeen nelly the girl nodded her face was turned the other way yes you are above a year younger than i am some girls marry by seventeen i wonder no one has been after you already nelly there is no girl in the village to compare with you  but nelly without a word darted away at full speed up the lane towards home leaving jack speechless with astonishment she hasnt done that for years he said its just the way she used to do when we were first friends if she got in a temper about anything she would rush away and hide herself and cry for hours what could i have said to vex her about her marrying or having some one courting her there couldnt be anything in that to vex her jack thought for some time sitting upon a stile the better to give his mind to it finally he gave up the problem in despair grumbling to himself one never gets to understand girls here ive known nelly for the last seven years like a sister and there she flies away cryingi am sure she was crying because she always used to cry when she ran awayand what it is about i have not the least idea now i mustnt say anything about it when i meet her next i know that of old unless she does first but as likely as not she will never allude to it  in fact no allusion ever was made to the circumstance for before the following sunday came round john hardy had died he had been sinking for months and his death had been looked for for some time it was not a blow to his daughter and could hardly be a great grief for he had been a drunken worthless man caring nothing for his child and frequently brutally assaulting her in his drunken fits she had attended him patiently and assiduously for months but no word of thanks had ever issued from his lip his character was so well known that no one regarded his death as an event for which his daughter should be pitied it would however effect a change in her circumstances hardy had ever since the attack upon the vaughan received an allowance from the union as well as from the sick club to which he belonged but this would now cease and it was conjectured by the neighbours that th old ooman would have to go into the house and nelly would go into a factory at birmingham or wolverhampton or would go into service nellys mother was a broken woman years of intemperance had prematurely aged her and her enforced temperance during the last few months had apparently broken her spirit altogether and the coarse violent woman had almost sunk into quiet imbecility     chapter xxii  the solution   among others who talked over nelly hardys future were mr and mrs dodgson they were very fond of her for from the first she had been the steadiest and most industrious of the young girls of the place and by diligent study had raised herself far in advance of the rest she had too been always so willing and ready to oblige and help that she was a great favourite with both  i have been thinking mrs dodgson said to her husband on the evening of the day of john hardys death whether as miss bolton the assistant mistress is going to leave at the end of the month to be married nelly hardy would not make an excellent successor for her there is no doubt she is fully capable of filling the situation her manners are all that could be wished and she has great influence with the younger children the only drawback was her disreputable old father it would hardly have done for my assistant to appear in school in the morning with a black eye and for all the children to know that her drunken father had been beating her now he is gone that objection is at an end she and her mother who has been as bad as the father but is now i believe almost imbecile could live in the little cottage miss bolton occupies  i think it would be an excellent plan my dear excellent we could have no one we should like better or who could be a more trustworthy and helpful assistant to you by all means let it be nelly hardy i will go up and speak to mr brook tomorrow as he is our patron i must consult him but he will agree to anything we propose let us say nothing about it until you tell her yourself after the funeral  mrs dodgson saw nelly hardy several times in the next few days and went in and sat with her as she worked at her mourning but it was not until john hardy was laid in the churchyard that she opened the subject  come up in the morning my dear she had said that day i want to have a talk with you  on the following morning nelly in her neatlyfitting black mourning dress made her appearance at the schoolhouse after breakfast a quarter of an hour before school began  sit down my dear mrs dodgson said i have some news to give you which will i think please you of course you have been thinking what to do  yes m i have made up my mind to try and get work in a factory  indeed nelly mrs dodgson said surprised i should have thought that was the last thing that you would like  it is not what i like nelly said quietly but what is best i would rather go into service and as i am fond of children and used to them i might with your kind recommendation get a comfortable situation but in that case mother must go to the house and i could not bear to think of her there she is very helpless and of late she has come to look to me and would be miserable among strangers i could earn enough at a factory to keep us both living very closely  well nelly your decision does you honour but i think my plan is better have you heard that miss bolton is going to leave us  i have heard she was engaged to be married some day m but i did not know the time was fixed  she leaves at the end of this month that is in a fortnight and her place has already been filled up upon the recommendation of myself and mr dodgson mr brook has appointed miss nelly hardy as her successor  me exclaimed nelly rising with a bewildered air oh mrs dodgson you cannot mean it  i do indeed nelly your conduct here has been most satisfactory in every way you have a great influence with the children and your attainments and knowledge are amply sufficient for the post of my assistant you will of course have miss boltons cottage and can watch over your mother you will have opportunities for studying to fit yourself to take another step upwards and become a headmistress some day  mrs dodgson had continued talking for she saw that nelly was too much agitated and overcome to speak  oh mrs dodgson she sobbed how can i thank you enough  there are no thanks due my dear of course i want the best assistant i can get and i know of no one upon whom i can rely more thoroughly than yourself you have no one but yourself to thank for it is your good conduct and industry alone which have made you what you are and that under circumstances of the most unfavourable kind but there is the bell ringing for school i suppose i may tell mr brook that you accept the situation the pay thirty pounds a year and the cottage is not larger perhaps than you might earn at a factory but i think  oh mrs dodgson nelly said smiling through her tears i accept i accept i would rather live on a crust of bread here than work in a factory and if i had had the choice of everything i should prefer this  mr dodgson here came in shook nellys hand and congratulated her and with a happy heart the girl took her way home  jack upon his return from the pit found nelly awaiting him at the corner where for years she had stood he had seen her once since her fathers death and had pressed her hand warmly to express his sympathy but he was too honest to condole with her on a loss which was he knew a relief he and harry had in the intervening time talked much of nellys prospects jack was averse in the extreme to her going into service still more averse to her going into a factory but could suggest no alternative plan  if she were a boy he said it would be easy enough i am getting eighteen shillings a week now and could let her have five easily and she might take in dressmaking there are plenty of people in the villages round would be glad to get their dresses made but she would have to live till she got known a bit and you know she wouldnt take my five shillings i wouldnt dare offer it to her now if it was you there would be no trouble at all you would take it of course just as i should take it of you but she wouldnt because shes a lassit beats me altogether i might get mother to offer her the money but nelly would know it was me sharp enough and it would be all the same  i really think that nelly might do well wi dressmaking harry said after a pause here all the lasses ha learnt to work but as you say in the other villages they know no more than we did here three years back if we got some bills printed and sent em round i should say she might do there are other things you dont seem to ha thought on jack he said hesitatingly youre only eighteen yet but you are earning near a pound a week and in another two or three years will be getting mans pay and you are sure to rise have you never thought of marrying nelly  jack jumped as if he had trodden on a snake  i marry nelly he said in astonishment what i marry nelly are you mad harry you know i have made up my mind not to marry for years not till im thirty and have made my way and as to nelly why i never thought of her nor of any other lass in that way her least of all why she is like my sister what ever put such a ridiculous idea in your head why at eighteen boys havent left school and are looking forward to going to college those boy and girl marriages among our class are the cause of half our troubles thirty is quite time enough to marry how nelly would laugh if she knew what youd said  i should advise you not to tell her harry said dryly i greatly mistake if she would regard it as a laughing matter at all  no lasses are strange things jack meditated again but harry you are as old as i am and are earning the same wage why dont you marry her  i would harry said earnestly tomorrow if shed have me  you would jack exclaimed as much astonished as by his friends first proposition to think of that now why you have always been with her just as i have you have never shown that you cared for her never given her presents nor walked with her nor anything and do you really care for her harry  aye harry said shortly i have cared for her for years  and to think that i have never seen that jack said why didnt you tell me why you are as difficult to understand as she is and i thought i knew you so well  what would have been the use harry said nelly likes me as a friend thats all  thats it jack said of course when people are friends they dont think of each other in any other way still harry she may get to in time nellys pretty well a woman shes seventeen now but she has no one else after her that i know of  well jack i fancy she could have plenty after her for shes the prettiest and best girl o the place but you see you are always about wi her and i think that most people think it will be a match some day  people are fools jack burst out wrathfully who says so just tell me who says so  people say so jack when a young chap and a lass walk together people suppose there is something in it and you and nelly ha been walking together for the last five years  walking together jack repeated angrily we have been going about together of course and you have generally been with us and often enough halfadozen others that is not like walking together nelly knew and every one knew that we agreed to be friends from the day we stood on the edge of the old shaft when you were in the water below and we have never changed since  i know you have never changed jack never thought of nelly but as a true friend i did not know whether now you might think differently i wanted to hear from your own lips now i know you dont that you have no thought of ever being more than a true friend to her i shall try if i cannot win her  do jack said shaking his friends hand i am sure i wish you success nothing in the world would please me so much as to see my two friends marry and though i do think yes i really do harry that young marriages are bad yet i am quite sure that you and nelly would be happy together anyhow and when do you mean to ask her  what an impatient fellow you are jack harry said smiling nelly has no more idea that i care for her than you had and i am not going to tell her so all at once i dont think he said gravely mark me jack i dont think nelly will ever have me but if patience and love can win her i shall succeed in the end  jack looked greatly surprised again  dont say any more about it jack harry went on it ull be a long job o work but i can bide my time but above all if you wish me well do not even breathe a word to nelly of what i have said  from this interview jack departed much mystified  it seems to me he muttered to himself lads when theyre in love get to be like lasses theres no understanding them i know nowt of love myself and what ive read in books didnt seem natural but i suppose it must be true for even harry who i thought i knew as well as myself turned as mysterious aswell as a ghost what does he mean by hes got to be patient and to wait and it will be a long job if he likes nelly and nelly likes himand why shouldnt shei dont know why they shouldnt marry in a year or two though i do hate young marriages anyhow ill talk to her about the dressmaking idea if harrys got to make love to her it will be far better for him to do it here than to have to go walking her out o sundays at birmingham if she would but let me help her a bit till shes got into business it would be as easy as possible  jack however soon had the opportunity of laying his scheme fully before nelly hardy and when she had turned off from the road with him she broke out  oh jack i have such a piece of news but perhaps you know it do you she asked jealously  no i dont know any particular piece of news  not anything likely to interest me jack  no jack said puzzled  honour you havent the least idea what it is  honour i havent jack said  im going to be a schoolmistress in place of miss bolton  illustration the new schoolmistress  no jack shouted delightedly i am glad nelly i am glad why it is just the thing for you harry and i have been puzzling our heads all the week as to what you should do  and what did your united wisdom arrive at nelly laughed  we thought you might do here at dressmaking jack said after a bit you know  the thought was not a bad one she said it never occurred to me and had this great good fortune not have come to me i might perhaps have tried it was good of you to think of it and so you never heard a whisper about the schoolmistress i thought you might perhaps have suggested it somehow you know you always do suggest things here  no indeed nelly i did not hear miss bolton was going  i am glad the girl said  are you jack replied in surprise why nelly wouldnt you have liked me to have helped you  yes and no jack but no more than yes i do owe everything to you it was you who made me your friend you who taught me you who urged me on you who have made me what i am no jack dear she said seeing that jack looked pained at her thanks i have never thanked you before and i must do it now i owe everything to you and in one way i should have been pleased to owe this to you also but in another way i am pleased not to do so because my gaining it by if i may say so my own merits show that i have done my best to prove worthy of your kindness and friendship  tears of earnestness stood in her eyes and jack felt that disclaimer would be ungracious  i am glad he said again after a pause and now miss hardy and he touched his hat laughing that you have risen in the world i hope you are not going to take airs upon yourself  nelly laughed it is strange she said that i should be the first to take a step upwards for mrs dodgson is going to help me to go in and qualify for a headschoolmistressship some day but jack it is only for a little time you laugh and call me miss hardy today but the time will come when i shall say sir to you you are longer beginning but you will rise far higher but we shall always be friends shall we not jack  always nelly jack said earnestly wherever or whatever jack simpson may be he will ever be your true and faithful friend and nothing which may ever happen to me no rise i may ever make will give me the pleasure which this good fortune which has befallen you has done if i ever rise it will make me happy to help harry but i know you would never have let me help you and this thought would have marred my life now that i see you in a position in which i am sure you will be successful and which is an honourable and pleasant one i shall the more enjoy my rise when it comesdoes any one else know of it he asked as they went on their way  no one she said who should know it before you  harry will be as glad as i am he said remembering his friends late assertion  yes harry will be very glad too nelly said but jack felt that harrys opinion was of comparatively little importance in her eyes he is a good honest fellow is harry and i am sure he will be pleased and so i hope will everyone  jack felt that the present moment was not a propitious one for putting in a word for his friend                                       harry shepherd carried out his purpose for two years he waited and then told his love to nelly hardy one bright sunday afternoon when they were walking in the lane  no harry no she said humbly and sadly it can never be do not ask me i am so so sorry  can it never be harry asked  never the girl said you know yourself harry it can never be i have seen this coming on for two years now and it has grieved me so but you know i am sure you know why it cannot be  i know the young fellow said i have always known that you cared for jack a thousand times more than for me and its quite natural for he is worth a thousand of me but then then and he hesitated  but then she went on jack does not love me and you do that is so harry but since i was a child i have loved him i know none better that he never thought of me except as a friend that he scarcely considered me as a girl i have never thought that it would be otherwise i could hardly wish that it were jack will rise to be a great man and must marry a lady but she said steadfastly i can go on loving him till i die  i have not hoped much nelly but remember always that i have always cared for you since you first became jacks friend i have cared for you if he had loved you i could even stand aside and be glad to see you both happy but i have known always that this could never be jacks mind was ever so much given up to study he is not like us and does not dream of a house and love till he has made his mark in the world remember only that i love you as you love jack and shall love as faithfully some day perhaps long hence he added as nelly shook her head you may not think differently but may come to see that it is better to make one mans life happy than to cling for ever to the remembrance of another at any rate you will always think of me as your true friend nelly always trust me  always harry in the future more than lately for i have seen this coming now that we understand each other we can be quite friends again     chapter xxiii  the explosion at the vaughan   at twelve oclock on a bright summer day mr brook drove up in his dogcart with two gentlemen to the vaughan mine one was the government inspector of the district the other a newlyappointed deputy inspector whom he was taking his rounds with him to instruct in his duties  i am very sorry that thompson my manager is away today mr brook said as they alighted had i known you were coming i would of course have had him in readiness to go round with you is williams the underground manager in the pit he asked the bankman whose duty it was to look after the ascending and descending cage  no sir he came up about half an hour ago watkins the viewer is below  he must do then mr brook said but i wish mr thompson had been here perhaps you would like to look at the plan of the pit before you go down is williamss office open  yes sir the bankman answered  mr brook led the way into the office  hullo he said seeing a young man at work making a copy of a mining plan who are you  the young man rose  jack simpson sir i work below but when its my nightshift mr williams allows me to help him here by day  ah i remember you now mr brook said let me see what you are doing thats a creditable piece of work for a working collier is it not he said holding up a beautifully executed plan  mr hardinge looked with surprise at the draughtsman a young man of some one or twoandtwenty with a frank open pleasant face  why you dont look or talk like a miner he said  mr merton the schoolmaster here was kind enough to take a great deal of pains with me sir  have you been doing this sort of work long mr hardinge asked pointing to the plan  about three or four years mr brook said promptly  jack looked immensely surprised  mr brook smiled  i noticed an extraordinary change in williamss reports both in the handwriting and expression now i understand it you work the same stall as haden do you not  yes sir but not the same shift he had a mate he has worked with ever since my father was killed so i work the other shift with harvey  now let us look at the plans of the pit mr hardinge said  the two inspectors bent over the table and examined the plans asking a question of mr brook now and then jack had turned to leave when his employer ceased to speak to him but mr brook made a motion to him to stay what is the size of your furnace mr brook asked mr hardinge  its an eightfoot furnace mr brook replied  do you know how many thousand cubic feet of air a minute you pass  mr brook shook his head he left the management of the mine entirely in the hands of his manager  mr hardinge had happened to look at jack as he spoke and the latter thinking the question was addressed to him answered  about eight thousand feet a minute sir  how do you know mr hardinge asked  by taking the velocity of the air sir and the area of the downcast shaft  how would you measure the velocity theoretically mr hardinge asked curious to see how much the young collier knew  i should require to know the temperature of the shafts respectively and the height of the upcast shaft  how could you do it then  the formula sir is m  htt480x h being the height of the upcast t its temperature t the temperature of the exterior air and x  t32 degrees  you are a strange young fellow mr hardinge said may i ask you a question or two  certainly sir  could you work out the cuberoot of say 999888777  jack closed his eyes for a minute and then gave the correct answer to five places of decimals  the three gentlemen gave an exclamation of surprise  how on earth did you do that mr hardinge exclaimed it would take me ten minutes to work it out on paper  i accustomed myself to calculate while i was in the dark or working jack said quietly  why you would rival bidder himself mr hardinge said and how far have you worked up in figures  i did the differential calculus sir and then mr merton said that i had better stick to the mechanical application of mathematics instead of going on any farther that was two years ago  the surprise of the three gentlemen at this simple avowal from a young pitman was unbounded  then mr hardinge said  we must talk of this again later on now let us go down the pit this young man will do excellently well for a guide but i am afraid mr brook that i shall have to trouble you a good deal as far as i can see from the plan the mine is very badly laid out and the ventilation altogether defective what is your opinion he asked turning abruptly to jack and wishing to see whether his practical knowledge at all corresponded with his theoretical acquirements  i would rather not say sir jack said it is not for me to express an opinion as to mr thompsons plan  let us have your ideas mr brook said just tell us frankly what you would do if you were manager of the vaughan  jack turned to the plan  i should widen the airways and split the current that would raise the number of cubic feet of air to about twelve thousand a minute it is too far for a single current to travel especially as the airways are not wide the friction is altogether too great i should put a split in here take a current round through the old workings to keep them clear widen these passages split the current again here and then make a cut through this new ground so as to take a strong current to sweep the face of the main workings and carry it off straight to the upcast but that current ought not to pass through the furnace but be let in above for the gas comes off very thick sometimes and might not be diluted enough with air going straight to the furnaces  your ideas are very good mr hardinge said quietly now we will get into our clothes and go below  so saying he opened a bag and took out two mining suits of clothes which first taking off their coats he and his companion proceeded to put on over their other garments mr brook went into his office and similarly prepared himself while jack who was not dressed for mining went to the closet where a few suits were hung up for the use of visitors and others and prepared to go down then he went to the lamproom and fetched four davylamps while he was away mr brook joined the inspectors  that young pitman is as steady as he is clever he said he has come several times under my attention in the first place the schoolmaster has spoken to me of the lads efforts to educate himself then he saved another boys life at the risk of his own and of late years his steadiness and good conduct have given him a great influence over his comrades of the same age and have effected great things for the place the vicar and schoolmaster now are never tired of praising him  he is clearly an extraordinary young fellow mr hardinge said do you know his suggestions are exactly what i had intended to offer to you myself you will have some terrible explosion here unless you make some radical changes  that evening the inspectors stayed for the night at mr brooks and the next day that gentleman went over with them to birmingham where he had some business his principal object however was to take them to see mr merton to question him farther with regard to jack simpson  mr merton related to his visitors the history of jacks efforts to educate himself and gave them the opinion he had given the lad himself that he might had he chosen have taken a scholarship and then the highest mathematical honours he has been working lately at engineering and calculating the strains and stresses of iron bridges he said and now mr brook i will tell youand i am sure that you and these gentlemen will give me your promise of secrecy upon the subjectwhat i have never yet told to a soul it was that lad who brought me word of the intended attack on the engines and got me to write the letter to sir john butler but that is not all sir it was that boyfor he was but seventeen thenwho defended your enginehouse against the mob of five hundred men  bless my heart merton why did you not tell me before why ive puzzled over that ever since and to think that it was one of my own pitboys who did that gallant action and i have done nothing for him  he would not have it told sir he wanted to go on as a working miner and learn his business from the bottom besides his life wouldnt have been safe in this district for a day if it had been known but i think you ought to be told of it now the lad is as modest as he is brave and clever and would go to his grave without ever letting out that he saved the vaughan and indeed all the pits in the district but now that he is a man it is right you should know but pray do not let him imagine that you are aware of it he is very young yet and will rise on his own merits and would dislike nothing so much as thinking that he owed anything to what he did that night i may tell you too that he is able to mix as a gentleman with gentlemen ever since i have been over here he has come over once a month to stay with me from saturday to monday he has mixed with what i may call the best society in the town here and has won the liking and esteem of all my friends not one of whom has so much as a suspicion that he is not of the same rank of life as themselves  what am i to do mr hardinge mr brook asked in perplexity what would you advise  i should give him his first lift at once mr hardinge said decidedly it will be many months before you have carried out the new scheme for the ventilation of the mine and believe me it will not be safe if there come a sudden influx of gas till the alterations are made make this young fellow deputy viewer with special charge to look after the ventilation in that way he will not have to give instruction to the men as to their work but will confine his attention to the ventilation the state of the air the doors and so on even then his position will for a time be difficult but the lad has plenty of selfcontrol and will be able to tide over it and the men will get to see that he really understands his business you will of course order the underground manager and viewers to give him every support the underground manager at any rate must be perfectly aware of his capabilities as he seems to have done all his paper work for some time  never were a body of men more astonished than were the pitmen of the vaughan when they heard that young jack simpson was appointed a deputy viewer with the special charge of the ventilation of the mine  a deputy viewer is not a position of great honour the pay is scarcely more than that which a getter will earn and the rank is scarcely higher this kind of post indeed is generally given to a miner of experience getting past his workas care attention and knowledge are required rather than hard work that a young man should be appointed was an anomaly which simply astonished the colliers of the vaughan the affair was first known on the surface and as the men came up in the cages the news was told them and the majority instead of at once hurrying home stopped to talk it over  it be the rummest start i ever heard on one said ah here comes bill haden hast heard t news bill  what news  why your jacks made a deputy what dost think o that right over heads o us all didst eer hear tell o such a thing  no i didnt bill haden said emphatically its t first time as eer i heard o t right man being picked out wiout a question o age i know him and i tell ee he maynt know t best place for putting in a prop or of timbering in loose ground as well as us as is old enough to be his fathers but he knows as much about t book learning of a mine as one of the government inspector chaps you mightnt think it pleasant for me as has stood in t place o his father to see him put over my head but i know how t boy has worked and i know what he is and i tell ee ill work under him willing jack simpson will go far you as live will see it  bill haden was an authority in the vaughan pit and his dictum reconciled many who might otherwise have resented the appointment of such a lad the enthusiastic approval of harry shepherd and of the rest of the other young hands in the mine who had grown up with jack simpson and knew something of how hard he had worked and who had acknowledged his leadership in all things also had its effect and the new deputy entered upon his duties without anything like the discontent which might have been looked for being excited  the most important part of jacks duties consisted in going round the pit before the men went down in the morning to see that there was no accumulation of gas in the night and that the ventilation was going on properly the deputy usually takes a helper with him and jack had chosen his friend harry for the postas in the event of finding gas it has to be dispersed by beating it with an empty sack so as to cause a disturbance of the air or if the accumulation be important by putting up a temporary bratticing or partition formed of cotton cloth stretched on a framework in such a way as to turn a strong current of air across the spot where the gas is accumulating or from which it is issuing the gas is visible to the eye as a sort of dull fog or smoke if the accumulation is serious the main body of miners are not allowed to descend into the mine until the viewer has with assistance succeeded in completely dispersing it  its a lonesome feeling harry said the first morning that he entered upon his duties with jack simpson to think that we be the only two down here  its no more lonesome than sitting in the dark waiting for the tubs to come along harry and its far safer there is not the slightest risk of an explosion now for there are only our safetylamps down here while in the day the men will open their lamps to light their pipes make what regulations the master may the men will break them to get a smoke  upon the receipt of mr hardinges official report strongly condemning the arrangements in the vaughan mr brook at once appointed a new manager in the place of mr thompson and upon his arrival he made him acquainted with the extent of jacks knowledge and ability and requested him to keep his eye specially upon him and to employ him as far as possible as his righthand man in carrying out his orders  i wish that main wind drift were through jack said one day six months after his appointment as he was sitting over his tea with bill haden the gas is coming in very bad in the new workings  wuss nor i ever knewt jack its a main good job that the furnace was made bigger and some o th airways widened for it does come out sharp surely in th old part where i be a dont notice it but when i went down yesterday where peter jones be working the gas were just whistling out of a blower close by  another fortnight and the airway will be through dad and that will make a great change i shall be very glad for the pits in a bad state now  ah thou thinkst a good deal of it jack because thoust got part of the sponsibility of it it dont fret me  i wish the men wouldnt smoke dad i dont want to get a bad name for reporting them but its just playing with their lives  bill haden was silent he was given to indulge in a quiet smoke himself as jack working with him for five years well knew  well jack thou knowst theres a craving for a draw or two of bacca  so there is for a great many other things that we have to do without jack said if it were only a question of a man blowing himself to pieces i should say nought about it but it is whether he is willing to make five hundred widows and two thousand orphans rather than go for a few hours without smoking what is the use of davylamps what is the use of all our care as to the ventilation if at any moment the gas may be fired at a lamp opened for lighting a pipe i like my pipe but if i thought there was ever any chance of its becoming my master i would never touch tobacco again  three days later when jack came up from his rounds at ten oclock to eat his breakfast and write up his journal of the state of the mine he saw mr brook and the manager draw up to the pit mouth jack shrank back from the little window of the office where he was writing and did not look out again until he knew that they had descended the mine as he did not wish to have any appearance of thrusting himself forward for another hour he wrote and then the window of the office flew in pieces the chairs danced and the walls rocked while a dull heavy roar like distant thunder burst upon his ears  he leaped to his feet and rushed to the door black smoke was pouring up from the pits mouth sticks and pieces of wood and coal were falling in a shower in the yard and jack saw that his worst anticipation had been realized and that a terrible explosion had taken place in the vaughan pit     chapter xxiv  in deadly peril   for a moment jack stood stunned by the calamity there were he knew over three hundred men and boys in the pit and he turned faint and sick as the thought of their fate came across him then he ran towards the top of the shaft the bankman lay insensible at a distance of some yards from the pit where he had been thrown by the force of the explosion two or three men came running up with white scared faces the smoke had nearly ceased already the damage was done and a deadly stillness seemed to reign  jack ran into the enginehouse the engineman was leaning against a wall scared and almost fainting  are you hurt john  no  pull yourself round man the first thing is to see if the lift is all right i see one of the cages is at bank and the force of the explosion is in the upcast shaft just give a turn or two to the engine and see if the winding gears all right slowly  the engineman turned on the steam there was a slight movement and then the engine stopped  a little more steam jack said the cage has caught but it may come  there was a jerk and then the engine began to work  that is all right jack said whether the lower cage is on or not stop now and wind it back and get the cage up again does the bell act i wonder  jack pulled the wire which when in order struck a bell at the bottom of the shaft and then looked at a bell hanging over his head for the answer none came  i expect the wires broke jack said and went out to the pits mouth again  the surfacemen were all gathered round now the tipmen and the yardmen and those from the cokeovens all looking wild and pale  i am going down jack said we may find some poor fellows near the bottom and cant wait till some headman comes on the ground who will go with me i dont want any married men for you know lads there may be another blow at any moment  i will go with you one of the yardmen said stepping forward theres no one dependent on me  i too said another its no odds to any one but myself whether i come up again or not heres with you whatever comes of it  illustration after the first explosionthe search party  jack brought three safetylamps from the lamproom and took his place in the cage with the two volunteers  lower away he shouted but go very slow when we get near the bottom and look out for our signal  it was but three minutes from the moment that the cage began to sink to that when it touched the bottom of the shaft but it seemed an age to those in it they knew that at any moment a second explosion might come and that they might be driven far up into the air above the top of the shaft mere scorched fragments of flesh not a word was spoken during the descent and there was a general exclamation of thank god when they felt the cage touch the bottom  jack as an official of the mine and by virtue of superior energy at once took the lead  now he said let us push straight up the main road  just as they stepped out they came across the bodies of two men and stooped over them with their lamps  both dead jack said we can do nought for them  a little way on and in a heap were some waggons thrown together and broken up the body of a pony and that of the lad his driver then they came to the first doora door no longer not a fragment of it remaining in the doorboys niche the lad lay in a heap they bent over him  he is alive jack said will you two carry him to the cage i will look round and see if there is any one else about here beyond this way there is no hope make haste look how the gas is catching inside the lamps the place is full of firedamp  the men took up the lad and turned to go to the bottom of the shaft jack looked a few yards down a crossroad and then followed them he was in the act of turning into the next road to glance at that also when he felt a suck of air  down on your faces he shouted and springing a couple of paces farther up the crossroad threw himself on his face     chapter xxv  the imprisoned miners   there was a mighty roara thundering sound as of an express traina blinding light and a scorching heat jack felt himself lifted from the ground by the force of the blast and dashed down again  then he knew it was over and staggered to his feet the force of the explosion had passed along the main road and so up the shaft and he owed his life to the fact that he had been in the road off the course he returned into the main road but near the bottom of the shaft he was brought to a standstill the roof had fallen and the passage was blocked with fragments of rock and broken waggons he knew that the bottom of the shaft must be partly filled up that his comrades were killed and that there was no hope of escape in that direction for a moment he paused to consider then turning up the side road to the left he ran at full speed from the shaft he knew that the danger now was not so much from the firedampthe explosive gasas from the even more dreaded chokedamp which surely follows after an explosion and the cessation of ventilation  many more miners are killed by this chokedamp as they hasten to the bottom of the shaft after an explosion than by the fire itself chokedamp which is carbonic acid gas is heavier than ordinary air and thus the lowest parts of a colliery become first filled with it as they would with water in all coalmines there is a slight sometimes a considerable inclination or dip as it is called of the otherwise flat bed of coal the shaft is almost always sunk at the lower end of the area owned by the proprietors of the mine as by this means the whole pit naturally drains to the sump or well at the bottom of the shaft whence it is pumped up by the engine above the loaded waggons too are run down from the workings to the bottom of the shaft with comparative ease  the explosion had as jack well knew destroyed all the doors which direct the currents of the air and the ventilation had entirely ceased the lower part of the mine where the explosion had been strongest would soon be filled with chokedamp the product of the explosion and jack was making for the old workings near the upper boundary line of the pit there the air would remain pure long after it had been vitiated elsewhere  it was in this quarter of the mine that bill haden and some twenty other colliers worked  presently jack saw lights ahead and heard a clattering of steps it was clear that as he had hoped the miners working there had escaped the force of the explosion which had without doubt played awful havoc in the parts of the mine where the greater part of the men were at work  stop stop jack shouted as they came up to him  is it fire jack bill haden who was one of the first asked  yes bill didnt you feel it  some of us thought we felt a suck of air a quarter hour since but we werent sure and then came another which blew out the lights come along lad there is no time for talking  its of no use going on jack said the shafts choked up i came down after the first blow and i fear theres no living soul in the new workings by this time they must be full of the chokedamp  the men looked at each other with blank faces  hast seen brook jack asked eagerly  ay he passed our stall with johnstone ten minutes ago just before the blast came  we may catch him in time to stop him yet jack said if he has gone round to look at the walling of the old goafs there are three men at work there  ill go with you jack bill haden said our best place is my stall lads he went on turning to the others that is pretty well the highest ground in the pit and the air will keep good there as long as anywheremay be till help comes you come along of us mate he said turning to the man who worked with him in his stall  as they hurried along jack in a few words told what had taken place as far as he knew it five minutes run brought them to the place where the masons were at work walling up the entrance to some old workings they looked astonished at the newcomers  have you seen the gaffers  ay they ha just gone on there dont you see their lights down the heading no well i saw em a moment since  come along jack said quick i expect theyve met it  at full speed they hurried along presently they all stopped short the lights burnt low and a choking sensation came on them  back jack for your life gasped bill haden but at that moment jacks feet struck something which he knew was a body  down at my feet help he cried  he stooped and tried to raise the body then the last gleam of his light went outhis lungs seemed to cease acting and he saw no more  when he came to himself again he was being carried on bill hadens shoulder  all right dad he said i am coming round now put me down  thats a good job jack i thought thoudst scarce come round again  have you got either of the others  weve got brook youd your arm round him so tight that ned and i lifted you together hes on ahead the masons are carrying him and neds showing the way canst walk now  yes im better now how did you manage to breathe dad  we didnt breathe jack were too old hands for that when we saw you fall we just drew back took a breath and then shut our mouths and went down for you just the same as if wed been a groping for you under water we got hold of you both lifted you up and carried you along as far as we could before we drew a breath again youre sharp jack but you dont know everything yet and bill haden chuckled to find that for once his practical experience taught him something that jack had not learned from his books  jack now hurried along after bill haden and in a few minutes reached the place fixed upon here the miners were engaged in restoring consciousness to mr brook who under the influence of water dashed on his face and artificial respiration set up by alternately pressing upon the chest and allowing it to rise again was just beginning to show signs of life their interest in their employment was so great that it was not until mr brook was able to sit up that they began to talk about the future  jacks account of the state of things near the shaft was listened to gravely the fact that the whole of the system of ventilation had been deranged and the proof given by the second explosion that the mine was somewhere on fire needed no comment to these experienced men it sounded their deathknell gallant and unceasing as would be the efforts made under any other circumstance to rescue them the fact that the pit was on fire and that fresh explosions might at any moment take place would render it an act of simple madness for their friends above to endeavour to clear the shaft and headings and to restore the ventilation the fact was further impressed upon them by a sudden and simultaneous flicker of the lamps and a faint shake followed by a distant rumble  another blast bill haden said that settles us lads we may as well turn out all the lamps but two so as to have light as long as we last out  is there no hope mr brook asked presently coming forward after he had heard from hadens mate the manner in which he had been so far saved  not a scrap master said bill haden we are like rats in a trap and it would ha been kinder of us if wed a let you lay as you was  your intention was equally kind mr brook said but is there nothing that we can do  nowt bill haden said we have got our dinners wi us and might make em last a mouthful at a time to keep life in us for a week or more but what ud be th use of it it may be weeksay or monthsbefore they can stifle the fire and make their way here  can you suggest nothing jack mr brook asked you are the only officer of the pit left now he added with a faint smile  jack had not spoken since he reached the stall but had sat down on a block of coal with his elbows on his knees and his chin on his handsa favourite attitude of his when thinking deeply  the other colliers had thrown themselves down on the ground some sobbed occasionally as they thought of their loved ones above some lay in silence  jack answered the appeal by rising to his feet  yes sir i think we may do something  the men raised themselves in surprise  in the first place sir i should send men in each direction to see how near the chokedamp has got there are four roads by which it could come up i would shut the doors on this side of the place it has got to roll blocks of coal and rubbish to keep em tight and stop up the chinks with wet mud that will keep the gas from coming up and there is air enough in the stalls and headings to last us a long time  but that would only prolong our lives for a few hours jack and i dont know that that would be any advantage better to be choked by the gas than to die of starvation mr brook said and a murmur from the men showed that they agreed with him  i vote for lighting our pipes one of the miners said if there is fiery gas here it would be better to finish with it at once  there was a general expression of approval  wait jack said authoritatively wait till i have done you know mr brook we are close to our north boundary here in some places within a very few yards now the logan which lies next to us has been worked out years ago of course it is full of water and it was from fear of tapping that water that the works were stopped here a good deal comes in through the crevices in no 15 stall which i expect is nearest to it now if we could work into the logan the water would rush down into our workings and as our pit is a good deal bigger than the logan ever was it will fill the lower workings and put out the fire but wont reach here then we can get up through the logan where the air is sure to be all right as the water will bring good air down with it we may not do it in time but it is a chance what do you say sir  it is worth trying at any rate mr brook said bravo my lad your clear head may save us yet  by gum jack but youre a good un bill haden said bringing down his hand upon jacks shoulder with a force that almost knocked him down while the men with revived hope leaped to their feet and crowding round shook jacks hands with exclamations of approval and delight  now lads mr brook said jack simpson is master now and we will all work under his orders but before we begin boys let us say a prayer we are in gods hands let us ask his protection  every head was bared and the men stood reverently while in a few words mr brook prayed for strength and protection and rescue from their danger  now jack he said when he had finished give your orders  jack at once sent off two men along each of the roads to find how near the chokedamp had approached and to block up and seal the doors it was necessary to strike a light to relight some of the lamps but this was a danger that could not be avoided  the rest of the men were sent round to all the places where work had been going on to bring in the tools and dinners to no 15 stall to which jack himself bill haden and mr brook proceeded at once no work had been done there for years the floor was covered with a black mud and a close examination of the face showed tiny streamlets of water trickling down in several places an examination of the stalls or working places on either side showed similar appearances but in a less marked degree it was therefore determined to begin work in no 15  you dont mean to use powder jack bill haden asked  no dad without any ventilation we should be choked with the smoke and there would be the danger from the gas when we think we are getting near the water we will put in a big shot so as to blow in the face  when the men returned with the tools and the dinners the latter done up in handkerchiefs jack asked mr brook to take charge of the food  there are just twenty of us sir without you and nineteen dinners so if you divide among us four dinners a day it will last for five days and by that time i hope we shall be free  four men only could work at the face of the stall together and jack divided the twenty into five sets  we will work in quarterofanhour shifts at first he said that will give an hours rest to a quarter of an hours work and a man can work well we know for a quarter of an hour when we get done up we will have halfhour shifts which will give two hours for a sleep in between  the men of the first shift stripped as usual to the waist set to work without an instants delay and the vigour and swiftness with which the blows fell upon the face of the rock would have told experienced miners that the men who struck them were working for life or death those unemployed jack took into the adjacent stalls and set them to work to clear a narrow strip of the floor next to the upper wall then to cut a little groove in the rocky floor to intercept the water as it slowly trickled in and lead it to small hollows which they were to make in the solid rock the water coming through the two stalls would thus collected be ample for their wants jack then started to see how the men at work at the doors were getting on these had already nearly finished their tasks on the road leading to the main workings chokedamp had been met with at a distance of fifty yards from the stall but upon the upper road it was several hundred yards before it was found on the other two roads it was over a hundred yards the men had torn strips off their flannel jackets and had thrust them into the crevices of the doors and had then plastered mud from the roadway on thickly and there was no reason to fear any irruption of chokedamp unless indeed an explosion should take place so violent as to blow in the doors this however was unlikely as with a fire burning the gas would ignite as it came out and although there might be many minor explosions there would scarcely be one so serious as the first two which had taken place  the work at the doors and the water being over the men all gathered in the stall then jack insisted on an equal division of the tobacco of which almost all the miners possessed somefor colliers forbidden to smoke often chew tobacco and the tobacco might therefore be regarded both as a luxury and as being very valuable in assisting the men to keep down the pangs of hunger this had to be divided only into twenty shares as mr brook said that he could not use it in that way and that he had moreover a couple of cigars in his pocket which he could suck if hard driven to it  now that they were together again all the lamps were extinguished save the two required by the men employed with work to be done and a hope of ultimate release the mens spirits rose and between their spells they talked and now and then even a laugh was heard  mr brook although unable to do a share of the work was very valuable in aiding to keep up their spirits by his hopeful talk and by anecdotes of people who had been in great danger in many ways in different parts of the world but who had finally escaped  sometimes one or other of the men would propose a hymnfor among miners as among sailors there is at heart a deep religious feeling consequent upon a life which may at any moment be cut shortand then their deep voices would rise together while the blows of the sledges and picks would keep time to the swing of the tune on the advice of mr brook the men divided their portions of food small as they were into two parts to be eaten twelve hours apart for as the work would proceed without interruption night and day it was better to eat however little every twelve hours than to go twentyfour without food  the first twentyfour hours over the stallor rather the heading for it was now driven as narrow as it was possible for four men to work simultaneouslyhad greatly advanced indeed it would have been difficult even for a miner to believe that so much work had been done in the time there was however no change in the appearances the water still trickled in but they could not perceive that it came faster than before as fast as the coal fellfor fortunately the seam was over four feet thick so that they did not have to work upon the rockit was removed by the set of men who were next for work so that there was not a minute lost from this cause  during the next twentyfour hours almost as much work was done as during the first but upon the third there was a decided falling off the scanty food was telling upon them now the shifts were lengthened to an hour to allow longer time for sleep between each spell of work and each set of men when relieved threw themselves down exhausted and slept for three hours until it was their turn to wake up and remove the coal as the set at work got it down  at the end of seventytwo hours the water was coming through the face much faster than at first and the old miners accustomed to judge by sound were of opinion that the wall in front sounded less solid and that they were approaching the old workings of the logan pit in the three days and nights they had driven the heading nearly fifteen yards from the point where they had begun upon the fourth day they worked cautiously driving a borer three feet ahead of them into the coal as in case of the water bursting through suddenly they would be all drowned  at the end of ninety hours from the time of striking the first blow the drill which jack holding it bill haden was just driving in deeper with a sledge suddenly went forward and as suddenly flew out as if shot from a gun followed by a jet of water driven with tremendous force a plug which had been prepared in readiness was with difficulty driven into the hole two men who had been knocked down by the force of the water were picked up much bruised and hurt and with thankful hearts that the end of their labour was at hand all prepared for the last and most critical portion of their task     chapter xxvi  a critical moment   after an earnest thanksgiving by mr brook for their success thus far the whole party partook of what was a heartier meal than usual consisting of the whole of the remaining food then choosing the largest of the drills a hole was driven in the coal two feet in depth and in this an unusually heavy charge was placed  were done for after all bill haden suddenly exclaimed look at the lamp  every one present felt his heart sink at what he saw a light flame seemed to fill the whole interior of the lamp to strike a match to light the fuse would be to cause an instant explosion of the gas the place where they were working being the highest part of the mine the fiery gas which made its way out of the coal at all points above the closed doors had being lighter than air mounted there  put the lamps out jack said quickly the gauze is nearly red hot in a moment they were in darkness  what is to be done now mr brook asked after a pause  there was silence for a whilethe case seemed desperate  mr brook jack said after a time it is agreed is it not that all here will obey my orders  yes certainly jack mr brook answered  whatever they are  yes whatever they are  very well jack said you will all take your coats off and soak them in water then all set to work to beat the gas out of this heading as far as possible when that is done as far as can be done all go into the next stall and lie down at the upper end you will be out of the way of the explosion there cover your heads with your wet coats and bill wrap something wet round those cans of powder  what then jack  thats all jack said i will fire the train if the gas explodes at the match it will light the fuse so that the wall will blow in anyhow  no no a chorus of voices said you will be killed  i will light it jack bill haden said i am getting on now its no great odds about me  no dad jack said i am in charge and it is for me to do it you have all promised to obey orders so set about it at once bill take mr brook up first into the other stall he wont be able to find his way about in the dark  without a word bill did as he was told mr brook giving one hearty squeeze to the lads hand as he was led away the others accustomed to the darkness from boyhood proceeded at once to carry out jacks instructions wetting their flannel jackets and then beating the roof with them towards the entrance to the stall for five minutes they continued this and then jack said  now lads off to the stall as quick as you can cover your heads well over lie down i will be with you in a minute or or as jack knew well he would be dashed to pieces by the explosion of the gas he listened until the sound of the last footstep died awaywaited a couple of minutes to allow them to get safely in position at the other end of the next stalland then holding the end of the fuse in one hand and the match in the other he murmured a prayer and stooping to the ground struck the match no explosion followed he applied it to the fuse and ran for his life down the narrow heading down the stall along the horse road and up the next stall its alight he said as he rushed in  a cheer of congratulation and gladness burst from the men cover your heads close jack said as he threw himself down the explosion is nigh sure to fire the gas  for a minute a silence as of death reigned in the mine then there was a sharp cracking explosion followedor rather prolongedby another like thunder and while a flash of fire seemed to surround them filling the air firing their clothes and scorching their limbs the whole mine shook with a deep continuous roaring the men knew that the danger was at an end threw off the covering from their heads and struck out the fire from their garments some were badly burned about the legs but any word or cry they may have uttered was drowned in the tremendous roar which continued it was the water from the logan pit rushing into the vaughan for five minutes the noise was like thunder then as the pressure from behind decreased the sound gradually diminished until in another five minutes all was quiet then the party rose to their feet the air in the next stall was clear and fresh for as the logan pit had emptied of water fresh air had of course come down from the surface to take its place  we can light our lamps again safely now bill haden said we shall want our tools lads and the powder there may be some heavy falls in our way and we may have hard work yet before we get to the shaft but the roof rock is strong so i believe we shall win our way  it lies to our right jack said like our own it is at the lower end of the pit so as long as we dont mount we are going right for it  there were as haden had anticipated many heavy falls of the roof but the water had swept passages in them and it was found easier to get along than the colliers had expected still it was hard work for men weakened by famine and it took them five hours of labour clearing away masses of rock and floundering through black mud often three feet deep before they made their way to the bottom of the logan shaft and saw the light far above themthe light that at one time they had never expected to see again  what oclock is it now sir bill haden asked mr brook who had from the beginning been the timekeeper of the party  twelve oclock exactly he replied it is four days and an hour since the pit fired  what day is it sir for ive lost all count of time  sunday mr brook said after a moments thought  it could not be better bill haden said for there will be thousands of people from all round to visit the mine  how much powder have you bill jack asked  four twentypound cans  let us let off ten pounds at a time jack said just damp it enough to prevent it from flashing off too suddenly break up fine some of this damp wood and mix with it it will add to the smoke  in a few minutes the devil was ready and a light applied it blazed furiously for half a minute sending volumes of light smoke up the shaft  flash off a couple of pounds of dry powder bill haden said there is very little draught up the shaft and it will drive the air up  for twenty minutes they continued letting off devils and flashing powder then they determined to stop and allow the shaft to clear altogether of the smoke  presently a small stone fell among themanotherand another and they knew that some one had noticed the smoke     chapter xxvii  rescued   a stranger arriving at stokebridge on that sunday morning might have thought that a fair or some similar festivity was going on so great was the number of people who passed out of the station as each train came in for the day stokebridge was the great point of attraction for excursionists from all parts of staffordshire not that there was anything to see the vaughan mine looked still and deserted no smoke issued from its chimneys and a strong body of police kept all except those who had business there from approaching within a certain distance of the shaft still less was there to see in stokebridge itself every blind was downfor scarce a house but had lost at least one of its members and in the darkened room women sat silently weeping for the dead far below  for the last four days work had been entirely suspended through the district and the men of the other collieries as well as those of the vaughan who belonging to the other shift had escaped hung about the pit yard in the vague hope of being able in some way to be useful  within an hour of the explosion the managers of the surrounding pits had assembled and in spite of the fact that the three volunteers who had first descended were without doubt killed plenty of other brave fellows volunteered their services and would have gone down if permitted but the repeated explosions and the fact that the lower part of the shaft was now blocked up decided the experienced men who had assembled that such a course would be madnessan opinion which was thoroughly endorsed by mr hardinge and other government inspectors and mining authorities who arrived within a few hours of the accident  it was unanimously agreed that the pit was on fire for a light smoke curled up from the pit mouth and some already began to whisper that it would have to be closed up there are few things more painful than to come to the conclusion that nothing can be done when women half mad with sorrow and anxiety are imploring men to make an effort to save those below  jane haden quiet and tearless sat gazing at the fatal shaft when she was touched on the shoulder she looked up and saw harry  thou art not down with them then harry  no i almost wish i was harry said i came up with jack and hurried away to get breakfast when i heard the blow i ran up and found jack had just gone down if i had only been near i might have gone with him and the young man spoke in regret at not having shared his friends fate rather than in gladness at his own escape  dost think theres any hope harry  its no use lying and theres no hope for jack mother harry said but if any ones saved its like to be your bill he was up in the old workings a long way off from the part where the strength of the blow would come  its no use telling me harry i ask but i know how it is there aint a chancenot a chance at all if the pits afire theyll have to flood it and then it will be weeks before they pump it out again and when they bring jack and bill up i shant know em thats what i feel i shant even know em  dont wait here mrs haden nought can be done now the inspectors and managers will meet this evening and consult what is best to be done  is your father down harry i cant think of aught but my own or id have asked afore  no he is in the other shift my brother willy is down come mother let me take you home  but mrs haden would not move but sat with scores of other women watching the mouth of the pit and the smoke curling up till night fell  the news spread round stokebridge late in the evening that the managers had determined to shut up the mouth of the pit if there was still smoke in the morning then as is always the case when such a determination is arrived at there was a cry of grief and anger throughout the village and all who had friends below protested that it would be nothing short of murder to cut off the supply of air women went down to the inn where the meeting was held and raved like wild creatures but the miners of the district could not but own the step was necessary for that the only chance to extinguish the fire was by cutting off the air unless the dreadful alternative of drowning the pit was resorted to  in the morning the smoke still curled up and the pits mouth was closed boards were placed over both the shafts and earth was heaped upon them so as to cut off altogether the supply of air and so stifle the fire this was on thursday morning nothing was done on friday and on saturday afternoon the mining authorities met again in council there were experts there now from all parts of the kingdomfor the extent of the catastrophe had sent a thrill of horror through the land it was agreed that the earth and staging should be removed next morning early and that if smoke still came up water should be turned in from the canal  at six in the morning a number of the leading authorities met at the mine men had during the night removed the greater part of the earth and the rest was now taken off and the planks withdrawn at once a volume of smoke poured out this was in any case expected and it was not for another halfhour when the accumulated smoke had cleared off and a straight but unbroken column began to rise as before that the conviction that the pit was still on fire seized all present  i fear that there is no alternative mr hardinge said the pit must be flooded  there was not a dissentient voice and the party moved towards the canal to see what would be the best method of letting in the water when a cry from the men standing round caused them to turn and they saw a dense white column rise from the shaft  steam every one cried in astonishment  a low rumbling sound came from the pit  what can have happened mr hardinge exclaimed in surprise this is most extraordinary  all crowded round the pit mouth and could distinctly hear a distant roaring sound presently this died away gradually the steam ceased to rise and the air above the pit mouth was clear  there is no smoke rising one of the inspectors said what on earth can have happened let us lower a light down  hoisting gear and rope had been prepared on the first day in case it should be necessary to lower any one for the wire rope had snapped when the attempt had been made to draw up the cage after the second explosion and the sudden release from the strain had caused the engine to fly round breaking some gear and for the time disabling it from further work a hundred and forty fathoms of rope the depth of the shaft being a hundred and twenty had been prepared and was in readiness to be passed over a pulley suspended above the shaft a lighted candle in a candlestick was placed on a sort of tray which was fastened to the rope and then it was lowered gradually down eagerly those above watched it as it descendeddowndown till it became a mere speck below then it suddenly disappeared  stop mr hardinge who was directing the operations said  there are six more fathoms yet sirnigh sevenbefore it gets to the hundredandtwenty fathom mark  draw up carefully lads what can have put the light out forty feet from the bottom of the shaft chokedamp i suppose but its very singular  when the candle came up to the surface there was a cry of astonishment the tray and the candle were wet the whole of those present were astounded and mr hardinge at once determined to descend himself and verify this extraordinary occurrence there was no fear of an explosion now taking a miners lamp he took his seat in a sling and was lowered down just before the rope had run out to the point at which the light was extinguished he gave the signal to stop by jerking a thin rope which he held in his hands  there was a pause and in a minute or two came two jerks the signal to haul up  it is so he said when he gained the surface there are forty feet of water in the shaft but where it came from is more than i can tell  much astonished at this singular occurrence the group of mining engineers walked back to breakfast at stokebridge where the population were greatly excited at the news that the pit was flooded to the miners it was a subject of the greatest surprise while the friends of those in the pit received the news as the deathblow of their last hopes it was now impossible that any one could be alive in the pit  at ten oclock the mining authorities went again to discuss the curious phenomenon all agreed that it was out of the question that so large a quantity of water had accumulated in any old workings for the plan of the pit had been repeatedly inspected by them all some inclined to the belief that there must have been some immense natural cavern above the workings and that when the fire in the pit burned away the pillars left to support the roof this must have fallen in and let the water in the cavern into the mine others pointed out that there was no example whatever of a cavern of such dimensions as this must have been being found in the coal formation and pointed to the workedout logan pit which was known to be full of water as the probable source of supply  during the previous four days the plan had been discussed of cutting through from the logan which was known to have been worked nearly up to the vaughan boundary this would enable them to enter the pit and rescue any miners who might be alive but the fact that to erect pumping gear and get out the water would be an affair of many weeks if not months had caused the idea to be abandoned as soon as broached to those who argued that the water had come from the logan it was pointed out that there were certainly several yards of solid coal between the vaughan and the logan still standing and that as the force of the explosion was evidently near the vaughan shaft it was incredible that this barrier between the pits should have been shattered however it was decided to solve the question one way or the other by an immediate visit to the top of the old logan shaft  they were just starting when they heard a movement in the street and men setting off to run a moment later a miner entered the room hurriedly there be a big smoke coming up from the old logan shaft it be too light for coal smoke and i dont think it be steam either  with exclamations of surprise the whole party seized their hats and hurried off it was twenty minutes sharp walking to the shaft where by the time they reached it a large crowd of miners and others were already assembled as they approached eager men ran forward to meet them  it be gunpowder smoke sir  there was indeed no mistaking the sulphurous smell  its one of two things mr hardinge said either the fire has spread to the upper workings some powder bags have exploded and the shock has brought down the dividing wall in which case the powder smoke might possibly find its way out when the water from the logan drained in or else in some miraculous way some of the men have made their escape and are letting off powder to call our attention at any rate let us drop a small stone or two down if any one be below he will know he is noticed then he turned to the miners standing round i want the pulley and rope that we were using at the vaughan and that small cage that was put together to work with it i want two or three strong poles to form a tripod over the pit here and a few long planks to make a stage  fifty willing men hurried off to fetch the required materials  the smoke is getting thinner a good deal one of the managers said now if youll hold me i will give a shout down  the mouth of the pit was surrounded by a wooden fencing to prevent any one from falling down it the speaker got over this and lay down on his face working nearer to the edge which sloped dangerously down while others following in the same way held his legs and were in their turn held by others when his head and shoulders were fairly over the pit he gave a loud shout  there was a deathlike silence on the part of the crowd standing round and all of those close could hear a faint murmur come from below  then arose a cheer echoed again and again and then halfadozen fleetfooted boys started for stokebridge with the news that some of the imprisoned pitmen were still alive  mr hardinge wrote on a piece of paper keep up your courage in an hours time the cage will come down wrapped it round a stone and dropped it down a messenger was despatched to the vaughan for the police force stationed there to come up at once to keep back the excited crowd and with orders that the stretchers and blankets in readiness should be brought on while another went into stokebridge for a surgeon and for a supply of wine brandy and food and two or three vehicles no sooner were the men sent off than mr hardinge said in a loud tone  every moment must be of consequence they must be starving will any one here who has food give it for them  the word was passed through the crowd and a score of picnic baskets were at once offered filling one of them full with sandwiches from the rest mr hardinge tied the lid securely on and threw it down the shaft there is no fear of their standing under the shaft he said they will know we shall be working here and that stones might fall  in less than an hour thanks to the willing work of many hands a platform was constructed across the mouth of the logan shaft and a tripod of strong poles fixed in its place the police kept the crowd by this time very many thousands strong back in a wide circle round the shaft none being allowed inside save those who had near relatives in the vaughan these were for the most part women who had rushed wildly up without bonnets or shawlsjust as they stood when the report reached them that there were yet some survivors of the explosion at full speed they had hurried along the roadsome pale and still despairing refusing to allow hope to rise again but unable to stay away from the fatal pit others crying as they ran some even laughing in hysterical excitement most excited because most hopeful were those whose husbands had stalls in the old workings for it had from the first been believed that while all in the main workings were probably killed at once by the first explosion those in the old workings might have survived for days  jane haden walked steadily along the road accompanied by harry shepherd who had brought her the news and by nelly hardy  i will go she said but it is of no use they are both gone and i shall never see them again  then she had put on her bonnet and shawl deliberately and slowly and had started at her ordinary pace protesting all along against its being supposed that she entertained the slightest hope but when she neared the spot her quivering lips and twitching fingers belied her words nelly remained outside the crowd but harry made a way for jane haden through the outside circle of spectators  a smaller circle of some thirty yards in diameter was kept round the shaft and within this only those directing the operations were allowed to enter mr hardinge and one of the local managers took their places in the cage the rope was held by twenty men who at first stood at its full length from the shaft and then advanced at a walk towards it thus allowing the cage to descend steadily and easily without jerks as they came close to the shaft the signal rope was shaken another step or two slowly and carefully taken and the rope was seen to sway slightly the cage was at the bottom of the shaft three minutes pause the signal rope shook and the men with the end of the rope started again to walk from the shaft  as they increased their distance the excitement in the great crowd grew and when the cage showed above the surface and it was seen that it contained three miners a hoarse cheer arose the men were assisted from the cage and surrounded for a moment by those in authority and one of the head men raised his hand for silence and then shouted  mr brook and twenty others are saved an announcement which was received with another and even more hearty cheer  illustration saved  passing on the rescued men moved forward to where the women stood anxiously gazing blackened as they were with coaldust they were recognizable and with wild screams of joy three women burst from the rest and threw themselves in their arms but only for a moment could they indulge in this burst of happiness for the other women crowded round  who is alive for gods sake tell us who is alive  then one by one the names were told each greeted with cries of joy till the last name was spoken and then came a burst of wailing and lamentation from those who had listened in vain for the names of those they loved  jane haden had not risen from the seat she had taken on a block of broken brickwork  no no she said to harry i will not hope i will not hope and while harry moved closer to the group to hear the names of the saved she sat with her face buried in her hands  the very first names given were those of jack simpson and bill haden and with a shout of joy he rushed back the step told its tale and jane haden looked up rose as if with a hidden spring and looked at him  both saved he exclaimed and with a strange cry jane haden swayed and fell insensible  an hour later and the last survivor of those who were below in the vaughan pit stood on the surface the last cage load being mr brook jack simpson and mr hardinge by this time the mourners had left the scene and there was nothing to check the delight felt at the recovery from the tomb as it was considered of so many of those deemed lost  when mr brookwho was a popular employer and whose popularity was now increased by his having although involuntarily shared the dangers of his menstepped from the cage the enthusiasm was tremendous the crowd broke the cordon of police and rushed forward cheering loudly mr hardinge after a minute or two held up his hand for silence and helped mr brook on to a heap of stones although mr brook as well as the rest had already recovered much thanks to the basket of food thrown down to them and to the supply of weak brandy and water and of soup which those who had first descended had carried with them he was yet so weakened by his long fast that he was unable to speak he could only wave his hand in token of his thanks and sobs of emotion choked his words mr hardinge however who had during the hour below learned all that had taken place and had spoken for some time apart with mr brook now stood up beside him  my friends he said in a loud clear voice which was heard over the whole crowd mr brook is too much shaken by what he has gone through to speak but he desires me to thank you most heartily in his name for your kind greeting he wishes to say that under god his life and the lives of those with him have been saved by the skill courage and science of his underviewer jack simpson mr brook has consulted me on the subject and i thoroughly agree with what he intends to do and can certify to jack simpsons ability young as he is to fill any post to which he may be appointed in a short time i hope that the vaughan pit will be pumped out and at work again and when it is mr jack simpson will be its manager  the story of the escape from death had already been told briefly by the miners as they came to the surface and had passed from mouth to mouth among the crowd and mr hardinges announcement was greeted with a storm of enthusiasm jack was seized by a score of sturdy pitmen and would have been carried in triumph were it not that the startling announcement coming after such a long and intense strain proved too much for him and he fainted in the arms of his admirers     chapter xxviii  changes   beyond the body of the crowd outside the ring kept by the police stood nelly hardy watching without a vestige of colour in her face for the news from below she had given a gasping sigh of relief as the names passed from mouth to mouth by the crowd met her ear and had leaned for support against the wall behind her so great was her faith in jacks resources and in jacks destiny that she had all along hoped and the assertion that those who had first gone down to rescue the pitmen must have fallen victims to the second explosion had fallen dead upon her ears  the school had been closed from the date of the accident and had it not been so she felt that she could not have performed her duties hour after hour she had sat in her cottage alonefor her mother had died a year beforeexcept when mrs dodgson who had long suspected her secret came to sit awhile with her or harry brought the latest news during this time she had not shed a tear and save for her white face and hard unnatural voice none could have told how she suffered harry had brought her the news of the smoke being seen from the shaft of the logan pit before he carried it to mrs haden and she had at once thrown on her bonnet and jacket and joined them as they started from the village when she reached the pit she had not attempted to approach but had taken her place at a distance several of her pupils with whom she was a great favourite had come up to speak to her but her hoarse not now dear please go away had sufficed to send them off but deeply agitated as she was she was hopeful and deep as was her joy at the news of jacks safety she was hardly surprised dropping her veil to hide the tears of joy which streamed down her cheeks she turned to go home but she was more shaken than she had thought and she had to grasp at the wall for support  so she waited until the last of the miners arrived at the surface and heard the speech of the government inspector then when she heard jacks elevation announced the news shook her even more than that of his safety had done and she fainted when she recovered the crowd was gone and harry only stood beside her he had felt that she would rather stand and watch alone and had avoided going near her but when jack was driven off he had hastened to her side he knew how she would object to her emotion becoming known and had contented himself with lifting her veil untying her bonnet strings putting her in a sitting attitude against the wall and waiting patiently till she came round  are you better now he inquired anxiously when she opened her eyes  yes i am well now she said glancing hastily round to see if others beside himself had noticed her situation i am quite well  dont try to get up sit still a few minutes longer he said dont try to talk  he has got his rise at last she said smiling faintly and looking up he has gone right away from us at a bound  i am glad harry said simply he has earned it he is a grand a glorious fellow is jack of course i shall never be to him now what i have been but i know that he will be as true a friend as ever though i may not see so much of him  you are more unselfish than i harry but as he was to rise it was better that it should be at a bound far above me now i am better let me go home  jack simpsons fainting fit had been but of short duration his sturdy organization soon recovered from the shock which the fresh air and mr hardinges announcement had made upon a frame exhausted by privation fatigue and excitement none the less was he astonished and indignant with himself at what he considered a girlish weakness his thoughts were however speedily diverted from himself by a pitman telling him that jane haden was in a second faint close by mr brooks carriage had been sent for in readiness immediately the possibility of his being found alive had appeared and that gentleman insisted upon mrs haden being lifted into it and upon jack taking his seat beside her to support her he then followed and amidst the cheers of the crowd started for stokebridge  mrs haden recovered before reaching the village and leaving her and jack at their home with an intimation that the carriage would come at an early hour next morning to fetch the latter up to the hall mr brook drove off alone  that afternoon was a proud day for bill haden and his wife but a trying one for jack  every one in the place who had the slightest knowledge of him called to shake his hand and congratulate him on his promotion his friends of boyhood first among them harry was one of the earliest comers and tears fell down the cheeks of both as they clasped hands in silent joy at their reunion not a word was spoken or needed  go round to nelly jack said in an undertone as other visitors arrived tell her i will come in and see her at seven oclock come again yourself before that let us three meet together again  so quickly did the callers press in that the little room could not hold them and jack had to go to the front door there to shake hands and say a word to all who wanted to see him it was quite a levée and it was only the fact that the gloom of a terrible calamity hung over stokebridge that prevented the demonstration being noisy as well as enthusiastic  by six oclock all his friends had seen him and jack sat down with bill haden and his wife then jane hadens feelings relieved themselves by a copious flood of tears and bill himself though he reproached her for crying on such an occasion did so in a husky voice  thou art going to leave us jack jane haden said and though we shall miss thee sorely thou mustnt go to think that bill or me be sorry at the good fortune that be come upon you thou hast been a son and a good son to us and ha never given so much as a days trouble i knowd as how youd leave us sooner or later there was sure to be a time when all the larning thou hast worked so hard to get would bring thee to fortune but i didnt think twould come so soon  bill haden removed from his lips the pipewhich in his endeavour to make up for loss of time he had smoked without ceasing from the moment of his rescueand grunted an acquiescence with his wifes speech  my dear mother and dad jack said there must be no talk of parting between us as yet of course it is too soon to form plans for the future but be assured that there will be no parting you took me when i was a helpless baby but for you i should have been a workhouse child and might now be coming out of my apprenticeship to a tinker or a tailor i owe all i have all i am to you and whatever fortune befall me you will still be dad and mother for a short time i must go to the hall as mr brook has invited me and we shall have much to arrange and talk over afterwards i suppose i shall have to go to the managers house but of course arrangements will have to be made as to mr fletchers widow and children and when i go there of course you will come too  theest a good un lad bill haden said for mrs hadens tears prevented her speech but i doubt what thou sayst can be but we neednt talk that over now but t old ooman and i be none the less glad o thy words jack though the bit and sup that thou hadst here till you went into th pit and began to pay your way aint worth the speaking o thou beats me atogether jack when un sees a good pup un looks to his breed and un finds it pure but where thou getst thy points from beats me atogether thy mother were a schoolmasters daughter but she had not the name o being fond o larning and was aways weak and ailing thy dad my mate jack simpson was as true a mate as ever man had but he were in no ways uncommon the old ooman and i ha reared ye but arter all pups dont follow their fostermother for the best bull pup aint noways injured by having a halfbred un or for the matter o that one wi no breed at all as a fostermother besides the old ooman and me has no points at all cept on my part such as are bad uns so it beats me fairly it downright shakes uns faith in breeding  here harrys tap was heard at the door and jack leaving bill haden to ponder over his egregious failure in proving true to blood joined his friend outside  scarce a word was spoken between the two young men as they walked across to nelly hardys little cottage by the schoolhouse the candles were already lighted and nelly rose as they entered  my dear nelly  my dear jack she said throwing her arms round his neck as a sister might have done and kissing him for the first time in her life and crying my dear jack thank god you are restored alive to us  thank god indeed jack said reverently it has been almost a miracle nelly and i am indeed thankful we prayed nearly as hard as we worked and god was with us otherwise assuredly we had never passed through such danger uninjured i thought many a time of you and harry and what you would be doing and thinking  i never gave up hope did i harry she said i thought that somehow such a useful life as yours would be spared  many other useful lives have been lost nelly jack said sadly but it was not my time  and now nelly said changing her tone there are other things to talk of will you please take a chair sir and she dropped a curtsy didnt i tell you jack she said laughing at the astonishment in jacks face that when you congratulated me on getting my post here and called me miss hardy that the time would come when i should say sir to you it has come jack sooner than we expected but i knew it would come  then changing her tone again as they sat looking at the fire she went on you know we are glad jack harry and i more glad than we can say that needs no telling between us does it  none jack said we are one we three and no need to say we are glad at each others success  we have had happy days nelly said but they will never be quite the same again we shall always be friends jack alwaystrue and dear friends but we cannot be all in all to each other i know dear jack she said as she saw he was about to speak vehemently that you will be as much our friend in one way as ever but you cannot be our companion it is impossible jack we have trod the same path together but your path leaves ours here we shall be within sound of each others voices we shall never lose sight of each other but we are no longer together  i have not thought it over yet jack said quietly it is all too new and too strange to me to see yet how things will work but it is true nelly and it is the one drawback to my good fortune that there must be some little change between us but in the friendship which began when you stood by me at the old shaft and helped me to save harry there will be no change i have risen as i always had determined to rise i have worked for this from the day when mr pastor my artist friend told me it was possible i might reach it but i never dreamed it would come so soon and i have always hoped and thought that i should keep you both with me how things will turn out we do not know but dear friends and he held out a hand to each believe me that i shall always be as i am now and that i shall care little for my good fortune unless i can retain you both as my dearest friends     chapter xxix  the new manager   the next day preparations for pumping out the vaughan commenced but it took weeks to get rid of the water which had flowed in in five minutes then the work of clearing the mine and bringing up the bodies commenced  this was a sad business a number of coffins equal to that of the men known to be below at the time of the explosion were in readiness in a shed near the pit mouth these were sent down and the bodies as they were found were placed in them to be carried above in scarcely any instances could the dead be identified by the relatives six weeks in the water having changed them beyond all recognition only by the clothes could a clue be obtained then the funerals began a great grave a hundred feet long by twelve wide had been dug in the churchyard and in this the coffins were laid two deep  some days ten some fifteen some twenty bodies were laid there and at each funeral the whole village attended who could know whether those dearest to them were not among the shapeless forms each day consigned to their last restingplace  at last the tale was complete the last of the victims of the great explosion at the vaughan was laid to rest the blinds were drawn up and save that the whole of the people seemed to be in mourning stokebridge assumed its usual aspect  upon the day before the renewal of regular work jack simpson accompanied by mr brook appeared upon the ground and signified that none were to descend until he had spoken to them he had already won their respect by his indefatigable attention to the work of clearing the mine and by the care he had evinced for the recovery of the bodies  few however of the hands had spoken to him since his accession to his new dignity now they had time to observe him and all wondered at the change which had been wrought in his appearance clothes do not make a man but they greatly alter his appearance and there was not one but felt that jack looked every inch a gentleman when he began to speak their wonder increased except to mr dodgson harry nelly hardy and some of his young comrades jack had always spoken in the dialect of the place and the surprise of the colliers when he spoke in perfect english without a trace of accent or dialect was great indeed  standing up in the gig in which he had driven up with mr brook he spoke in a loud clear voice heard easily throughout the yard  my friends he said my position here is a new and difficult one so difficult that did i not feel sure that you would help me to make it as easy as possible i should shrink from undertaking it i am a very young man i have grown up among you and of you and now in a strange way due in a great measure to the kindness of your employers and in a small degree to my own exertions to improve myself i have come to be put over you now it is only by your helping me that i can maintain this position here you will find in me a true friend i know your difficulties and your wants and i will do all in my power to render your lives comfortable those among you who were my friends from boyhood can believe this the rest of you will find it to be so any of you who are in trouble or in difficulty will if you come to me obtain advice and assistance but while i will try to be your friend and will do all in my power for your welfare it is absolutely necessary that you should treat me with the respect due to mr brooks manager without proper discipline proper work is impossible a captain must be captain of his own ship though many of his men know the work as well as he does and i am glad to be able to tell you that mr brook has given me full power to make such regulations and to carry out such improvements as may be conducive to your comfort and welfare he wants and i want the vaughan to be a model mine and stokebridge a model village and we will do all in our power to carry out our wishes we hope that no dispute will ever again arise here on the question of wages there was one occasion when the miners of the vaughan were led away by strangers and paid dearly for it we hope that such a thing will never occur again mr brook expects a fair return and no more than a fair return for the capital he has sunk in the mine when times are good you will share his prosperity when times are bad you like he must submit to sacrifices if disputes arise elsewhere they need not affect us here for you may be sure that your wages will never be below those paid elsewhere and now i have said my say let us conclude by trusting that we shall be as warm friends as ever although our relations towards each other are necessarily changed  three rousing cheers greeted the conclusion of jacks speech after which he drove off with mr brook as the men gathered round the top of the shaft an old miner exclaimed dang it all i ha it now i was wondering all the time he was speaking where i had heard his voice before i know now as sure as im a living man it was jack simpson as beat us back from that there enginehouse when we were going to stop the pumps in the strike  now that the clue was given a dozen others of those who had been present agreed with the speaker the event was now an old one and all bitterness had passed had it been known at the time or within a few months afterwards jacks life would probably have paid the penalty but now the predominant feeling was one of admiration those who had during the last few weeks wearily watched the pumping out of the vaughan felt how fatal would have been the delay had it occurred when the strike ended and they were penniless and without resources and no feeling of illwill remained  he be a game un to think o that boy standing alone agin us a and not a soul as much as suspected it didst know ot bill haden  noa bill said never so much as dreamt ot but now i thinks it over it be loikely enoo i often thought what wonderful luck it were as he gave me that ere bottle o old tom and made me as drunk as a loord joost at th roight time and i ha thought it were curious too seeing as never before or since has he givd me a bottle o liquor but now it all comes natural enough well to be sure and to think that lad should ha done all that by hisself and neer a soul the wiser you may be sure the gaffer didnt know no more than we or hed a done summat for the lad at the time he offered rewards too for the finding out who t were as had done it and to think twas my jack well well he be a good plucked un too they didnt ca him bulldog for nowt for it would ha gone hard wi him had t been found out im main proud o that lad  and so the discovery that jack had so wished to avoid when it was at last made added much to the respect with which he was held in the vaughan pit if when a boy he would dare to carry out such a scheme as this it was clear that as a man he was not to be trifled with the reputation which he had gained by his courage in descending into the mine in his battle with tom walker and by the clearheadedness and quickness of decision which had saved the lives of the survivors of the explosion was immensely increased and any who had before felt sore at the thought of so young a hand being placed above them in command of the pit felt that in all that constitutes a man in energy courage and ability jack simpson was worthy the post of manager of the vaughan mine  bill haden was astonished upon his return home that night to find that his wife had all along known that it was jack who had defended the vaughan and was inclined to feel greatly aggrieved at having been kept in the dark  did ye think as i wasnt to be trusted not to split on my own lad he exclaimed indignantly  we knew well enough that thou mightest be trusted when thou wert sober bill his wife said gently but as about four nights a week at that time thou wast drunk and might ha blabbed it out and had known nowt in the morning o what thoudst said jack and i were of a mind that less said soonest mended  may be you were right bill haden said after a pause a man has got a loose tongue when hes in drink and i should never ha forgiven myself had i harmed t lad     chapter xxx  risen   it was not until the pit was cleared of water and about to go to work again that the question of bill haden and his wife removing from their cottage came forward for decision jack had been staying with mr brook who had ordered that the house in which the late manager had lived should be put in good order and furnished from top to bottom and had arranged for his widow and children to remove at once to friends living at a distance feeling as he did that he owed his life to the young man he was eager to do everything in his power to promote his comfort and prosperity and as he was apart from the colliery a wealthy man and a bachelor he did not care to what expense he went  the house the great house on the hill as jack had described it when speaking to his artist friend pastor years before was a far larger and more important building than the houses of managers of mines in general it had indeed been originally the residence of a family owning a good deal of land in the neighbourhood but they when coal was discovered and work began sold this property and went to live in london and as none cared to take a house so close to the coalpits and village of stokebridge it was sold for a nominal sum to the owner of the vaughan and was by him used as a residence for his manager  now with the garden nicely laid out redecorated and repaired outside and in and handsomely furnished it resumed its former appearance of a gentlemans country seat mr brook begged jack as a favour not to go near the house until the place was put in order and although the young man heard that a birmingham contractor had taken it in hand and that a large number of men were at work there he had no idea of the extensive changes which were taking place  a few days before work began again at the vaughan jack went down as usual to the hadens for he had looked in every day to say a few words to them on his way back from the pitmouth now dad he said we must not put the matter off any longer i am to go into the managers house in a fortnights time i hear they have been painting and cleaning it up and mr brook tells me he has put new furniture in and that i shall only have to go in and hang up my hat now i want for you to arrange to come up on the same day  we ha been talking the matter over in every mortal way the old woman and me jack and ill tell ee what weve aboot concluded on one side thou really want t have us oop wi ee  yes indeed dad jack said earnestly  i know thou dost lad me and jane both feels that well thats an argiment that way then theres the argiment that naturally thou wouldst not like the man who hast brought thee oop to be working in the pit o which thou wast manager thats two reasons that way on the other side there be two and the old ooman and me think they are stronger than tothers first we should be out o place at the house oop there thou wilt be getting to know all kinds o people and whatever thou mayst say jack your mother and me would be oot o place thats one argiment the next argiment is that we shouldnt like it jack we should feel we were out o place and that our ways were out o place and we should be joost miserable instead o doing us a kindness youd joost make our lives a burden and i know ee dont want to do that wes getting on in loife and be too old to change our ways and nothing thou couldst say could persuade us to live aways dressed up in our sunday clothes in your house  well dad i might put you both in a comfortable cottage without work to do  what should i do wiout my work jack noa lad i must work as long as i can or i should die o pure idleness but i neednt work at a stall im fifty now and although i ha got another fifteen years work in me i hope my bones beant as liss as they was thou might give me the job as underground viewer i can put in a prop or see to the firing o a shot wi any man oive told my mates you want to have me and the old woman oop at th house and theyll know that if i stop underground it be o my own choice i know lad it wouldnt be roight for me to be a getting droonk at the chequers and thou manager but i ha told t old ooman that i will swear off liquor altogether  no no dad jack said affected at this proof of bill hadens desire to do what he could towards maintaining his dignity i wouldnt think ot if you and mother feel that youd be more happy and comfortable hereand maybe you are right i didnt think over the matter from thy side as well as my own as i ought to have doneof course you shall stay here and of course you shall have a berth as underviewer as for swearing off drink altogether i wouldnt ask it of you though i do wish you could resolve never to drink too much again you ha been used to go to the chequers every night for nigh forty years and you couldnt give it up now you would pine away without somewhere to go to however this must be understood whenever you like to come up to me i shall be glad to see you and i shall expect you on sundays to dinner if on no other day and whenever the time shall come when you feel dad that youd rather give up work there will be a cottage for you and mother somewhere handy to me and enough to live comfortably and free from care  thats a bargain lad and im roight glad it be off my mind for i ha been bothering overt ever since thee spoke to me last  the same evening jack had a long talk with harry his friend although healthy was by no means physically strong and found the work of a miner almost beyond him he had never taken to the life as jack had done and his friend knew that for the last year or two he had been turning his thoughts in other directions and that of all things he would like to be a schoolmaster he had for years read and studied a good deal and mr dodgson said that with a year in a training college he would be able to pass he had often talked the matter over with jack and the latter told him now that he had entered his name in st marks college chelsea had paid his fees six months in advance his savings amply sufficing for this without drawing upon his salary and that he was to present himself there in a weeks time  the announcement took away harrys breath but as soon as he recovered himself he accepted jacks offer as frankly as it was made it had always been natural for jack to lend him a hand and it seemed to him as to jack natural that it should be so now  have you told nelly  no i left it for you to tell harry i know of course one reason why you want to be a schoolmaster and she will know it too she is a strange girl is nelly i never did quite understand her and i never shall why on earth she should refuse you i cant make out shes had lots o other offers these last four years but its all the same theres no one she cares for why shouldnt she take you  i can wait harry said quietly theres plenty of time perhaps some day i shall win her and i thinkyes i think nowthat i shall  well jack said cheerfully as you say theres plenty of time ive always said thirty was the right age to marry and you want eight years of that and nelly wont get old faster than you do so if she dont fall in love with any one else it must come right she has stood out for nearly four years and though i dont pretend to know anything of women i should think no woman could go on saying no for twelve years  harry although not given to loud mirth laughed heartily at jacks views over lovemaking and the two then walked across to nelly hardys cottage jack told her what bill haden and his wife had decided and she approved their determination then harry said what jack had arranged for him  nelly shook her head as if in answer to her own thoughts while harry was speaking but when he ceased she congratulated him warmly  you were never fit for pitwork harry and a schoolmasters life will suit you well it is curious that jacks two friends should both have taken to the same life  jacks surprise was unbounded when a month after the reopening of the vaughan mr brook took him over to his new abode his bewilderment at the size and completeness of the house and its fittings was even greater than his pleasure  but what am i to do alone in this great place mr brook he asked i shall be lost here i am indeed deeply grateful to you but it is much too big for me altogether  it is no bigger now than it has always been mr brook said and you will never be lost as long as you have your study there and he pointed to a room snugly fitted up as a library and study you will be no more lonely than i or other men without wives and families besides you know these may come some day  ah but that will be many years on jack said i always made up my mind not to marry till i was thirty because a wife prevents you making your way  yes but now that you have made your way so far jack a wife will aid rather than hinder you but it will be time to think of that in another three or four years you will not find it so dull as you imagine jack there is your work which will occupy the greater part of your day there is your study for the evening you will speedily know all the people worth knowing round here i have already introduced you to a good many and they will be sure to call as soon as you are settled here in the stable my dear boy you will find a couple of horses and a saddle and a dogcart so that you will be able to take exercise and call about i shall keep the horses i consider them necessary for my manager my men will keep the garden in order and i think that you will find that your salary of £350 a year to begin with ample for your other expenses  jack was completely overpowered by the kindness of his employer but the latter would not hear of thanks why man i owe you my life he said what are these little things in comparison  jack found fewer difficulties than he had anticipated in his new position his speech at the opening of the mine added to the favour with which he was held for his conduct at the time of the explosion and further heightened the respect due to him for his defence of the vaughan as he went through the mine he had ever a cheery good morning bob good morning jack for his old comrades and the word sir was now universally added to the answered good morning a concession not always made by colliers to their employers  the miners soon felt the advantages of the new managers energy backed as he was in every respect by the owner the work as laid down by the government inspector was carried out and mr brook having bought up for a small sum the disused logan mine in which several of the lower seams of coal were still unworked the opening between the pits was made permanent and the logan shaft became the upcast to the vaughan thus greatly simplifying the work of ventilation lessening the danger of explosion and giving a means of escape for the miners should such a catastrophe recur in spite of all precautions  as nearly half the old workers at the pit had perished in the explosion an equal number of new hands had to be taken on jack sharing the anxiety of the vicar and mr dodgson that all the good work should not be checked by the ingress of a fresh population directed that all vacancies should be filled up by such colliers of good character as resided at stokebridge working for other pits in the neighbourhood as the vaughan promised to be the most comfortable and wellworked pit in the country these were only too glad to change service and more names were given in than vacancies could be found for as all the inhabitants of stokebridge had participated in the benefits of the night schools and classes and in the improvements which had taken place the advance of the village suffered no serious check from the catastrophe at the vaughan     chapter xxxi  conclusion   three years more of progress and stokebridge had become the model village of the black country the chief employer of labour his manager the vicar and schoolmaster all worked together for this end the library had been a great success and it was rare indeed for a drunken man to be seen in the streets even of a saturday night many of the publichouses had closed their doors altogether and in addition to the library a large and comfortable clubhouse had been built  the men of an evening could smoke their pipes play at bagatelle chess draughts or cards and take such beer as they required any man getting drunk or even noisy to be expelled the club this however was a rule never requiring to be called into force the building was conducted on the principle of a regimental canteen the beer was good and cheap but not strong no spirits were sold but excellent tea coffee and chocolate could be had at the lowest prices  the building was closed during the day but beer was sent out both for dinners and suppers to those who required it there was a comfortable room where women could sew knit and talk as they pleased or they could if they liked sit in the general room with their husbands entertainments and lectures were of frequent occurrence and the establishment supplemented by the library and washhouse did wonders for stokebridge  the promise made by mr brook at the fête had been carried out a choirmaster came over twice a week from birmingham and the young people entered into the scheme with such zest that the choir had carried away the prize three years in succession at birmingham the nightschool was now carried on on a larger scale than ever and the school for cooking and sewing was so well attended that mrs dodgson had now a second assistant to encourage the children and young people an annual show was held at which many prizes were given for gardening needlework dressmaking carpentering and a variety of other subjects it was seldom indeed that an untidy dress was to be seen still more uncommon that a foul word was heard in the streets of stokebridge nothing could make the rows of cottages picturesque as are those of a rural village but from tubs placed in front creepers and roses climbed over the houses while the gardens behind were gay with flowers  no young woman needed to remain single in stokebridge longer than she chose for so noteworthy were they for their housewifely qualities that the young pitmen of the villages round thought themselves fortunate indeed if they could get a wife from stokebridge bill cummings fred wood and several others of jacks boy friends were viewers or undermanagers of the vaughan and many had left to take similar situations elsewhere  jack simpson was popular with all classes with the upper class his simple straightforwardness his cheerfulness and good temper made him a great favourite although they found it hard to understand how so quiet and unassuming a young fellow could be the hero of the two rescues at the vaughan for now when the fact was known jack no longer made a secret of his share in the attack by the rioters on the enginehouse among the pitmen his popularity was unbounded of an evening he would sometimes come down to the clubroom and chat as unrestrainedly and intimately as of old with the friends of his boyhood and he never lost an opportunity of pushing their fortunes  once a week he spent the evening with bill haden and his wife who always came up and passed sunday with him when he was at home at this time all ceremony was dispensed with the servants were sent out of the room and when the pitman and his wife became accustomed to their surroundings they were far more at their ease than they had at first thought possible  on the evenings when he went down to his mother he always dropped in for an hours talk with his friend nelly there was no shadow of change in their relations nelly was his friend firm and fast to whom he told all his thoughts and plans harry was assistant master in a school at birmingham and was as he told jack still waiting patiently  jack was now often over at birmingham and one night he said to nelly  nelly i promised you long ago that i would tell you if i ever fell in love  and you have come to tell me now she asked quietly  yes he said if it can be called falling in love for it has been so gradual that i dont know how it began perhaps three years ago when she refused another man i was glad of it and of course asked myself why i was glad there came no answer but onei wanted her myself  i suppose it is alice merton nelly said as quietly as before  of course jack said it could be no one else i suppose i like her because she is the reverse of myself she is gentle but lively and full of fun she is made to be the light of a hard working mans home i am not at all gentle and i have very little idea of fun alice is made to lean on some one i suppose i am meant to be leant upon i suppose it is always the case that opposite natures are attracted towards one another the one forms the complement of the other  nelly sat thinking this then was the reason why she had never attracted jack both their natures were strong and firm both had full control over themselves although both of a passionate nature both had the capability of making great sacrifices even of life if necessary both had ambition and a steady power of work no wonder jack had thought of her as a comrade rather than as a possible wife while harry gentler and easily led patient rather than firm leaned upon her strong nature  i think dear jack she said that miss merton is the very woman to make you happy you have known each other for twelve years and can make no mistake i need not say how truly and sincerely i wish you every happiness there was a quiver in her voice as she spoke but her face was as firm and steadfast as ever and jack simpson as he walked homewards did not dream that nelly hardy was weeping as if her heart would break over this final downfall of her lifes dream it was not that she had for the last seven years ever thought that jack would ask her to be his wife but she would have been content to go on to the end of her life as his first and dearest friend then she said at last thats done with jack and i will always be great friends but not as we have been perhaps it is as well better now than ten years on  then her thoughts went to harry to whom indeed during the last few years they had gone oftener than she would have admitted to herself he is very faithful and kind and good and i suppose one of these days i shall have to give in he will not expect much but he deserves all i could give him  in after years however nelly shepherd learned that she could give her husband very true and earnest love and the headmaster and mistress of the largest school at wolverhampton are regarded by all who know them and by none less than by jack simpson and his wife as a perfectly happy couple  it is ten years since jack married alice merton who had loved him for years before he asked her to be his wife jack is now part proprietor of the vaughan pit and is still its real manager although he has a nominal manager under him he cannot however be always on the spot as he lives near birmingham and is one of the greatest authorities on mining and the first consulting engineer in the black country at mr brooks death he will be sole proprietor of the vaughan that gentleman having at jacks marriage settled its reversion upon his wife  dinner is over and he is sitting in the garden surrounded by those he most cares for in the world it is the 1st of june a day upon which a small party always assembles at his house by his side is his wife and next to her are harry shepherd and nelly between the ladies a warm friendship has sprung up of late years while that between the three friends has never diminished in the slightest on jacks other hand sits an artist bearing one of the most honoured names in england whose health jack always proposes at this dinner as the founder of his fortune next to the artist sits mr brook and beyond him mrs simpsons father a permanent resident in the house now but some years back a professor of mathematics in birmingham playing in the garden are six children two of whom call the young simpsons cousins although there is no blood relationship between them and walking with them are an old couple who live in the pretty cottage just opposite to the entrance of the grounds and whom jack simpson still affectionately calls dad and mother         the end
