                      preface    a few pages by way of forespeache  the plain unvarnished tale of the travel in midian undertaken by the second expedition which like the first owes all to the liberality and the foresight of his highness ismail i khediv of egypt forms the subject of these volumes during the four months between december 19 1877 and april 20 1878 the officers employed covered some 2500 miles by sea and land of which 600 not including bypaths were mapped and planned and we brought back details of an oldnew land which the civilized world had clean forgotten  the public will now understand that one and the same subject has not given rise to two books i have to acknowledge with gratitude the many able and kindly notices by the press of my first volume the gold mines of midian etc messrs c kegan paul  co 1878 but some reviewers succeeded in completely misunderstanding the drift of that avant courier it was an introduction intended to serve as a base for the present more extensive work andfoundations intended to bear weight must be solid its object was to place before the reader the broad outlines of a country whose name was known to every schoolboy whilst it was a vox et praeterea nihil even to the learned before the spring of 1877 i had judged advisable to sketch with the able assistance of learned friends its history and geography its ethnology and archaeology its zoology and malacology its botany and geology the drift was to prepare those who take an interest in arabia generally and especially in wild mysterious midian for the present work which one foresaw would be a tale of discovery and adventure thus readers of the land of midian revisited may feel that they are not standing upon ground utterly unknown and the second publication is shortened and lightenedperhaps the greatest advantage of allby the prolegomena having been presented in the first  the purpose of the last expedition was to conclude the labours begun during the spring of 1877 in a mining country unknown or rather fallen into oblivion hence its primary objective was mineralogical the twentyfive tons of specimens brought back to cairo were inspected by good judges from south africa australia and california and all recognized familiar metalliferous rocks the collection enabled me to distribute the mining industry into two great branches1 the rich silicates and carbonates of copper smelted by the ancients in north midian and 2 the auriferous veins worked but not worked out by comparatively modern races in south midian the region lying below the parallel of elmuwaylah it is indeed still my conviction that tailings have been washed for gold even by men still living we also brought notices and specimens of three several deposits of sulphur of a turquoisemine behind ziba of salt and saltpetre and of vast deposits of gypsum these are sources of wealth which the nineteenth century is not likely to leave wasted and unworked  in geography the principal novelties are the identification of certain ruined cities mentioned by ptolemy and the harrahs or plutonic centres scattered over the seaboard and the interior i venture to solicit the attention of experts for my notes on elharrah that great volcanic chain whose fair proportions have been so much mutilated by its only explorer the late dr wallin beginning with damascan trachonitis and situated in the parallel of north lat 28 degrees about sixty direct miles east of the red sea it is reported to subtend the whole coast of northwestern arabia between elmuwaylah north lat 27 degrees 39 and elyambu north lat 24 degrees 5 equally noticeable are the items of information concerning the wady hamz the lands end of egypt and the most important feature of its kind in northwestern arabia its name wrongly given by wallin is unknown to the hydrographic chart and to the erudite pages of my friend professor aloys sprenger who however suspects with me that it may be the mouth of the celebrated wady elkura for further topographical details the reader is referred to the itineraries of the expedition offered to the royal geographical society of london  some of the principal sites were astronomically determined by commanders ahmed musallam and nasir ahmed of the egyptian navy the task of mapping and planning was committed to the two young stafflieutenants sent for that purpose they worked well in the field and their sketches were carefully executed whilst under my superintendence but it was different when they returned to cairo the maps sent to the little exposition at the hippodrome see conclusion were simply a disgrace to the staffbureau my departure from egypt caused delay and when the chart reached me it was far from satisfactory names had been omitted and without my presence it could not have been printed with the able assistance of mr william j turner of the royal geographical society who found the work harder than he expected it has been reduced to tolerable shape still it is purely provisional and when mining operations shall begin a far more careful survey will be required  as regards archaeology the second expedition visited described and surveyed eighteen ruins of cities and towns some of considerable extent in north midian besides seeing or hearing of some twenty large mashghal apparently the ateliers of vagrant gypsylike gangs this total of thirtyeight is not far short of the forty traditional midianite settlements preserved by the mediaeval arab geographers many others are reported to exist in the central or inland region and fifteen were added by the south country including the classical temple or shrine found upon the bank of the wady hamz before mentioned the most interesting sites were recommended to m lacaze whose portfolio was soon filled with about two hundred illustrations in oil and watercolours pencil croquis and sunpictures all except the six coloured illustrations which adorn this volume have been left in egypt his highness resolved to embody the results of our joint labours in a large album illustrated with coloured lithographs maps and plans explained by letterpress and prepared at the citadel cairo  the meteorological journal was kept by myself assisted at times by mr clarke mr david duguid engineer of the mukhbir whose gallant conduct will be recorded chap viii and commander nasir ahmed of the sinnar obliged me by registering simultaneous observations at sealevel the whole was reduced to shape by mr w j turner of the royal geographical society  my private collection of mineralogical specimens was deposited with professor m h n storymaskelyne the spiritspecimens of zoology filled three large canisters and the british museum also received a hare and five birds mr r b sharpe four bats rhinopoma and a mouse six reptiles five fishes thirtyfive crustaceans and about the same number of insects five scorpions six leeches sixty molluscs four echinoderms and three sponges dr a gunther appendix iii determined and named two new species of reptiles mr frederick smith appendix iii took charge of the insects mr edward j miers f ls etc described the small collection of crustaceae annals and magazine of natural history for november 1878 finally edgar a smith examined and named the shells collected on the shores of the akabah gulf and the northeastern recess of the red sea  the main interest of the little hortus siccus was the alpine flora gathered at an altitude of five thousand feet above sealevel the plants were offered to sir joseph dalton hooker of kew and professor d oliver of the herbarium has kindly furnished me with a list of the names appendix iv mr william carruthers and his staff also examined the spiritspecimens of fleshy plants appendix iv  mr reginald stuart poole keeper of coins and medals and mr barclay v head were good enough to compare with their rich collections the coins of ancient midian found chap iii for the first time at maghair shuayben1 some years ago mr robert ready of the british museum had bought from a jew yusuf kalafat  a miscellaneous collection which included about sixty of the socalled midianitic coins but the place of discovery is wholly unknown the assistant keeper read a paper on arabian imitations of athenian coins midianitic himyaritic and others at a meeting of the numismatic society november 21 1878 and i did the same at the royal asiatic society december 16 1878 the little find of stone implements rude and worked and the instruments illustrating the mining industry of the country appeared before the anthropological section of the british association which met at dublin august 1878 and again before the anthropological institute of london december 10 1878  finally the skulls and fragments of skulls from midian were submitted to professor richard owen the superintendent of natural history and my learned friend kindly inspected the egyptian and palmyrene crania which accompanied them the whole was carefully described by dr c carter blake phd before the lastnamed seance of the anthropological institute december 10 1878  the tons of specimens brought to cairo were i have said publicly exhibited there and created much interest but the discovery of a miningcountry some three hundred miles long once immensely wealthy and ready to become wealthy once more is not likely to be accepted by every one jealous and obstructive officials did not think much of it rivals opposed it with even less ceremony a mild ring in egypt attempted in vain to run the hamamat and darfor mines chap iii against midian consequently the local press was dosed with rumours which retailed by the home papers made the latter rife in contradictory reports to quote one case only the turquoisegangue from ziba chap xii was pronounced by the inexpert mineralogists at the citadel cairo who attempted criticism to be carbonate of copper because rich silicates of that metal were shown at the exposition no one seemed to know that the fine turquoises of midian have been sold for years at suez and even at cairo  there was indeed much to criticise in the collection which had been made with a marvellous carelessness but we must not be hard upon m marie he is an engineer utterly ignorant of mineralogy and of assaying he was told off to do the duty and he did it as well as he couldin other words very badly he neglected to search for alluvial gold in the sands every wady which cuts at right angles the metalliferous maritime chains should have been carefully prospected these sandy and quartzose beds are natural conduits and sluiceboxes but the search for tailings is completely different from that of goldveins and requires especial practice the process indeed may be called purely empirical it is not taught in jermyn street nor by the ecole des mines in this matter theory must bow to rule of thumb the caprices of alluvium are various and curious enough to baffle every attempt at scientific induction thus the habits of the metal so to speak must be studied by experiment with patient labour the most accomplished mineralogist may pass over rich alluvium without recognizing its presence where the rude prospector of california and australia will find an abundance of streamgold evidently the proportion of tailings must carefully be laid down before companies are justified in undertaking the expensive operation of quartzcrushing hence m tiburce morisot a practical digger from south africa introduced at cairo by his compatriot m marie to my friend m yacoub artin bey found a fair opportunity of proposing to his highness the khediv october 1878 a third expedition in search of sandgold the viceroy however true to his undertaking refused to sanction any interloping  the highly distinguished m ferdinand de lesseps when en route to paris kindly took charge of some cases of specimens for analysis but the poorest stuff had been supplied to him by m marie and the results of which i never heard were probably nil the samples brought to england by order of his highness the khediv were carefully assayed the largest collection was submitted to dr john percy frs smaller items were sent to the wellknown houses messrs johnston and matthey of hatton garden and messrs edgar jackson and co associates of the royal school of mines fourteen samples finally special observations were made by mr john l jenken of carrington through mr j h murchison of british lead mines etc etc etc by lieutcolonel ross the distinguished author of pyrology and by lieutcolonel bolton who kindly compared the rocks with those in his cabinet m gastinelbeys analysis of the specimens brought home by the first expedition will be found at the end of chap viii  the following is the text of dr percys report  metallurgical laboratory royal school of mines jermyn street london dec 13 1878  dear sir  i now send the results of the analytical examination of the specimens which you submitted to me for that purpose the examination has been conducted with the greatest care in the metallurgical laboratory of the royal school of mines by mr richard smith who for the last thirty years has been constantly engaged in such work and in whose accuracy i have absolute confidence it is impossible that any one should have taken greater interest in or have devoted himself with greater earnestness to the investigation i have almost entirely confined myself to a statement of facts as i understand that was all you required for the guidance of his highness the khedive                             section

and combined carbon or white castiron containing small quantities of lead copper and silver and free from antimony platinum and gold it is evidently the product of a fusion operation a few shots of lead were attached to the surface of the metalen11  dr percy concludes the assays in these words  three of the specimens nos 14 15 and 19 from the same locality contain gold the amount of gold however is small i consider these indications of the presence of the precious metal not altogether unsatisfactory and certainly to justify further exploration my conviction is that the ancients were adepts in the art of extracting gold and that owing to the small value of human labour they could get out as much of the metal as could now be done they knew perfectly what was worth working and what was not and i think it likely that what you have brought home had been rejected by the ancients as unworkableen12 further search may lead to the discovery of workable stuff but would doubtless require a good deal of time unless lucky accident should intervene  the specimens nos 2 3 5 22 and 23 contain sufficient iron to render them available as iron ores provided they occur in large quantity the copper present in no 21a is too small in amount to render it available as a source of that metal footnote analyses of copper ore from midian at the citadel cairo gave in certain cases forty percent if it is practicable on a large scale by handlabour or other means to separate the copper mineral as in b it would be sufficiently rich in copper provided the cost of the transit were not too great  the specimen no 17 is only of scientific interest as it gives off an acid vapour when heated and this substance may have been used by the ancients in the separation of silver from gold by the process termed cementation  i remain dear sir yours very truly  signed  john percy md frs lecturer on metallurgy at the royal school of mines london  capt r f burton etc  upon this able report i would offer the following observations we who have travelled through a country like midian finding everywhere extensive works for metallurgy barrages and aqueducts cisterns and tanks  furnaces firebricks and scoriae open mines and huge scatters of spalled quartz with the remains of some eighteen cities and towns which apparently fell to ruin with the industry that founded and fed themwe i say cannot but form a different and a far higher idea of its mineral capabilities than those who determine them by the simple inspection of a few specimens the learned dr percy at once hits the mark when he surmises that worthless samples were brought home and this would necessarily occur when no metallurgist no practical prospector was present with the expedition as will appear from the following pages all the specimens were collected a ciel ouvert and wholly without judgment  i therefore expect that future exploration will develop midian as it has done india the quartzose outcrop called the wynaad reef madras presidency produced only a few poor pennyweights per ton two and seven being the extremes while much of it was practically unproductive presently in february 1878 the district was visited by sir andrew clarke of australian experience member of the viceregal council he invited mr brough smyth of victoria to explore and test the capabilities of the country and that eminent practical engineer discovered in an area of twentyfive by thirteen miles ninety outcrops some yielding they say two hundred ounces per ton of gold fine and coarse with jagged pieces as large as peas and british india now hopes to draw her gold coinage from wynaad  i conclude this abstract of the book which would have been reduced in size had the mass of matter permitted with the heartfelt hope that the grand old land of midian will not be without attraction to the public of europe  richard f burton  athenaeum club  december 16                                 contents                                part i

                      chapter i               preliminaryfrom trieste to midian    throughout the summer of 1877 i was haunted by memories of mysterious midian the golden region appeared to me in the glow of primaeval prosperity described by the egyptian hieroglyphs as rich in agriculture and in fertility according to the old hellenic travellers as in its centres of civilization and in the precious metals catalogued by the sacred books of the hebrews again i saw the mining works of the greek the roman and the nabathæan whose names are preserved by ptolemy the forty cities mere ghosts and shadows of their former selves described in the pages of the mediaeval arab geographers and the ruthless ruin which under the dominion of the bedawin gradually crept over the land of jethro the tale of her rise and fall forcibly suggested algeria that province so opulent and splendid under the masters of the world converted into a fiery wilderness by the representatives of the gentle and gallant turk and brought to life once more by french energy and industry and such was my vision of a future midian whose rich stores of various minerals will restore to her wealth and health when the two khedivial expeditions shall have shown the world what she has been and what she may be again  i was invited to resume my exploration during the winter of 187778 by the viceroy of egypt ismail i a prince whose superior intelligence is ever anxious to develop the resources of his country his highness was perhaps the only man in his own dominions who believing in the buried wealth of midian had the perspicacity to note the advantages offered by its exploitation for the world around the viceroy pronounced itself decidedly against the project my venerable friend linant pasha suggested a comparison with the abandoned diggings of the upper nile forgetting that in at least half of midian land only the tailings have been washed whereas in the bishárí country and throughout the etbaye between the meridians of berenike and sawákín the very thinnest metallic fibrils have been shafted and tunnelled to their end in the rock by those marvellous labourers the old egyptians in the hamámát country again the excessive distances both from the nile and from the red sea together with the cost of transport must bar all profit even worse are the conditions of fayzoghlú and dárfor whilst the mines of midian begin literally at the shore  another pasha wrote to me from alexandria congratulating me upon having discovered during our first expedition a little copper and iron generally the official public knowing that i had brought back stones not solid masses of gold and silver loudly deplored the prospective waste of money and money after the horseplague the low nile and the excessive exigencies of the shortsighted creditor was exceptionally scarce the truly oriental view of the question was taken by an official whom i shall call Árif pashathe knowing one when told that m george marie the government engineer detailed to accompany the first expedition had sent in official analyses with sample tubes of gold and silver thus establishing the presence of auriferous and argentiferous rocks on the arabian shore son excellence exclaimed imprudent jeune homme thus to throw away the chances of life had he only declared the whole affair a farce a flam a sell a canard the viceroy would have held him to be honest and would have taken care of his future  still through bad report the khediv who had mastered with his usual accuracy of perception and judgment the subject of midian and her mines was staunch to his resolve and when one of his european financiers a controleur général de dépenses the normal round peg in the square hole warned him that there were no public funds for such purpose his highness warmly declared on dit that the costs of the expedition should be defrayed at his own expense  meanwhile i had passed the summer of 1877 in preparation for the work of the ensuing winter a long correspondence with many learned friends and a sedulous study of the latest geographers especially german taught me all that was known of mining in arabia generally and particularly in midian during my six months absence from egypt my vision was fixed steadily upon one point the expedition that was to come and when his highness was pleased to offer me in an autograph letter full of the kindest expressions the government of dárfor i deferred accepting the honour till midian had been disposed of  unhappily certain kindly advisers persuaded me to make well better by a visit to karlsbad and a course of its alkaline fountains of health never was there a greater mistake the air is bad as the water is good the climate is reeking damp like that of western africa and as in st petersburg a plaid must be carried during the finest weather its effects rheumatic and neuralgic may be judged by the fact that the doctors must walk about with pocketed squirts for the hypodermal injection of opium almost all those whom i knew there wanting to be better went away worse and in my own case a whole month of midian sun and a sharp attack of ague and fever were required to burn out the hexenschuss and to counteract the deleterious effects of the hygeian springs  at last the happy hour for departure struck and on october 19 1877 the austrohungarian espero capitano colombo steamed out of trieste on board were sefer pasha our host of castle bertoldstein and my learned friends the aulic councillor alfred von kremer austrian commissioner to egypt and dr heinrich

off the old port eunostus which now looks brandnew we landed and the next day saw me at cairo such was my haste that i could pay only a flying visit to the broken beerbottles the burst provisiontins the iceplants and the hospitable society of ramleh the sandheap and my many acquaintances had barely time to offer their congratulations upon the prospects of my becoming an egyptian  my presence at the capital was evidently necessary a manner of association for utilizing the discoveries of the first expedition had been formed in london by the messieurs vignolles who knew only the scattered and unofficial notices issued without my privity by english and continental journals their representative general nuthall formerly of the madras army had twice visited cairo in august and october 1877 seeking a concession of the mines and offering conditions which were perfectly unacceptable the viceroy was to allow contrary to convention the free importation of all machinery to supply guards who were not wanted and in fact to guarantee the safety of the workmen who were perfectly safe in return ten per cent on net profits fifteen being the royalty of the suez canal was the magnificent inducement offered to the viceregal convoitise i could not help noting by no means silently this noble illustration of the principle embodied in sic vos non vobis i was to share in the common fate of originators discoverers and inventors the find was mine the profits were to goelsewhere general nuthall professed inability to regard the matter in that light while to all others it appeared in no other however after a few friendly meetings the representative left egypt with the understanding that possibly we might work together when the exploration should have been completed his highness who had verbally promised me either the concession or four per cent on gross produce acted en prince simply remarking that the affair was in my hands and that he would not interfere with me  i must not trouble the reader with the tedious tale of the pains and the labour which accompany the accouchement of such an expedition all practicals know that to organize a movement of sixty men is not less troublesomeindeed rather more sothan if it numbered six hundred or six thousand the viceroy had wisely determined that we should not only carry out the work of discovery by tracing the precious metals to their source but also that we should bring back specimens weighing tons enough for assay and analysis quantitive and qualitive in london and paris consequently miners and mining apparatus were wanted with all the materials for quarrying and blasting my spirit sighed for dynamite but experiments at trieste had shown it to be too dangerous the party was to consist of an escort numbering twentyfive súdán soldiers of the line negroes liberated some two years ago a few madanjiyyah minemen and thirty haggárah stonemen or quarrymen  the government magazines of cairo contain everything but the difficulty is to find where the dispersed articles are stored there is a something of redtapeism but all is plain sailing compared with what it would be in europe the express orders of his highness husayn kámil pasha minister of finance and acting minister of war at once threw open every door had this young prince not taken in the affair a personal interest of the liveliest and most intelligent nature we might have spent the winter at cairo and here i cannot refrain from mentioning amongst other names that of mr alfred e garwood ce locomotive superintendent who in the short space of four months has introduced order and efficiency into the chaos known as the bulák magazines with his friendly cooperation and under his vigorous arm difficulties melted away like hail in a tropical sun general stone pasha the chief of staff also rendered me some assistance by lending the instruments which stood in his own cabinet de travailen13  poor cairo had spent a seedy autumn the russoturkish campaign which had been unjustifiably allowed by foreign powers to drain egypt of her gold and lifebloodsome 25000 men since the beginning of the servian preludenot only caused abundant sorrow to the capital but also frightened off the strangerhost which habitually supplies the poorer population with sovereigns and napoleons the horsepest a bad typhus after raging in 1876 and early 1877 had died out unfortunately so had the horses and the wellbred finetempered and highspirited little egyptians were replaced by a mongrel lot hastily congregated from every breeding ground in europe the fellahs who had expected great things from the mission of mm goschen and joubert asked wonderingly if those financiers had died while a scanty nile ten to twelve feet lower they say than any known during the last thousand years added to the troubles of the poor by throwing some 600000 feddans acres out of gear and by compelling an exodus from the droughty right to the left bank finally when the river of egypt did rise it rose too late and brought with it a feverish and unwholesome autumn briefly we hardly escaped the horrors of europe            herbstesahnung triste spuren

successes the prophet gallantly took the field as in the days of yúsuf bin ishák this time the vehicle of revelation was the learned shayhk má  alaysh who was ordered in a dream by the apostle of allah upon whom be peace to announce the victory of the moslem over the infidel and as the vision took place in jemádi elakhir june the first prediction was not more unsuccessful than usual shortly afterwards the same reverend man again dreamt that seeing two individuals violently quarreling with voies de fait he had hastened like a true believer to separate and to reconcile them but what was his surprise when the brawlers proved to be the sultan and the czar the former administering condign personal punishment to his hereditary foe this the enlightened shaykh determined was a sign that in september the osmanli would be gloriously triumphant nor was he far wrong the russians who had begun the campaign like the english in india with a happy contempt both for the enemy and for the elementary rules of war were struck with a cold fit of caution instead of marching straight upon and intrenching themselves in adrianople they vainly broke their gallant heads against the improvised earthworks of plevna and ignorant europe marvelling at the prowess of the noble turk ignored the fact that all the best turkish soldiers were slavs originally christians renegades of old unable to speak a word of turkish preserving their bosniac familynames and without one drop of turkish blood in their veins sulayman pashás army was about as turkish as are the poles or the hungarians  not the less did cairo develop the normal seasonhumours of the frank among the various ways of doing the pyramids i registered a new one mr a  junior unwilling wholly to neglect them sent his valet with

as well as the gay and whiskycumsoda became popular as upon the banks of the thames and the tweed as happens on dark days the moneydigger was abroad and one anecdote deserves record many years ago an old widow body had been dunned into buying for a few piastres a ragged little manuscript from a pauper maghrabi these west africans are par excellence the magicians of modern egypt and syria and here they find treasure like the greeks upon the shores of the northern adriatic perhaps there may be a basis for the idea oral traditions and written documents concerning buried hoards would take refuge in remote regions comparatively undisturbed by the storms of war and inhabited by races more or less literary at any rate the maghrabi darwaysh went his ways assuring his customer that when her son came of age a fortune would be found in the little book and true enough the boy reaching mans estate read in its torn pages ample details concerning a dafinah hoard of great value he was directed by the manuscript to a certain spot upon the mukattam range immediately behind the cairene citadel where the removal of a few stones would disclose a choked shaft the latter would descend to a tunnel full of rubbish and one of the many sidings would open upon the golden chamber the permission of government was secured the workmen began and the directions proved truebarring the treasure towards which progress was still being made such was the legend of cairo as recounted to me by my good friend yacoub artin bey i can only add to it allaho aalamallah is allknowing  the sole cause of delay in beginning exploration was the want of money and this of course even the prince minister of finance could not coin egypt the fertile the wealthy the progressive was indeed at the time all but insolvent at the suggestion of foreigners profitable investments which yielded literally nothing had been freely made for many a year and the sole results were money difficulties and debt the european financiers had managed admirably for their shareholders but having assumed the annual national income at a maximum instead of a minimum they had brought the goose of the golden eggs to the very verge of death the actionnaires were to receive with a punctuality hardly possible in the east the usurious interest of six per cent not including one per cent for sinking fund meanwhile the officers and officials military naval and civil had been in arrears of salary for seven to fifteen months and even the jews refused to cash at any price their pay certificates  nothing could be more unwise or unjust than the exactions of the creditors men must live if not paid they perforce pay themselves and thus of every hundred piastres hardly thirty find their way into the treasury ten times worse was the condition of the miserable felláhín who were selling for three or four napoleons the bullocks worth fifteen per head thus they would tide over the present year but a worse than indian famine was threatened for the following and the bakkál at once petty trader and moneylender whose interest and compound interest here amount as in bombay to hundreds per cent would complete the ruin which the low nile and the christian creditor had begun  a temporary reduction of interest to three per cent with one per cent of amortization should content the greedy shareholder who seeks to combine high profits with perfect security during november 1877 there were five mps at shepheards and all cried shame upon the financial condition of the country sir george campbell opened the little game in his inside view of egypt fortnightly review dec 1877 he drew a graphic picture of the abnormal state of poor egypt he expressed the sensible opinion that in the settlement the claims of the bondholders have been too exclusively considered and he concluded that no more payments of debtinterest should be made until official arrears are discharged  at last the phare dalexandrie november 29 1877 doubtless under official inspiration put forth the following article greatly to the satisfaction of the unfortunate employés  si nos renseignements particuliers sont exacts le comité des finances vient de prendre une excellente décision elle consiste en ce que aussitôt largent pour le paiement du prochain coupon préparé le ministere avant tout autre procédera au paiement des appointements arriérés des employés  nous apprenons on outre que s a le ministre des finances même a déclaré molu proprio que jusquau complet paiement des arriérés dûs aux employés et dans le cas oú il se présenterait une dépense de grande importance prévue même par le budget de ne pas en ordonner le paiement sans au préalable le sommettre à ladhésion du comité  nous applaudissons de toutes nos forces à cette bonne nouvelle dabord parcequelle affirme une fois de plus la scrupuleuse exactitude quon apporte au paiement des coupons ensuite elle prouve le vif intérèt qu inspire au gouvernement la situation de ses nombreux employés enfin elle nous fait espérer quaprès avoir songé à eux on soccupera aussi à payer les autres sommes portées et prevues au budget de lannée  accordingly on december 2nd the prince minister of finance took heart of grace and distributed among the officials one months pay with a promise that all arrears should presently be made good on the same day his highness issued to the expedition 2000 napoleons in addition to the 620 already expended upon instruments and provisions this was the more liberal as i had calculated the total at 1500 the more however the better in such work it is money versus time the former saving the latter and we were already late in the yearit had been proposed to start on november 15th and we had lost three precious weeks of fine autumnal weather the stores were equally abundant i wanted one forge and received three  of course many details had been forgotten eg a farrier and change of muleirons a tinsmith and tinning tools a sulphurstill boots for the soldiers and the quarrymen small shot for specimens and so forth i had carried out my idea of a dragoman with two servants and the result had been a model failure especially in the most important department the true desert cook is a man sui generis he would utterly fail at the criterion and even at shepheards but in the wilderness he will serve coffee within fifteen minutes and dish the best of dinners within the hour after the halt  mr clarke and lieutenant amir worked with a will and they were ably seconded by colonel ali bey robi and lieutenantcolonel of the staff mohammed bey báligh but the finishing touch to such preparations must be done by the master hand and my unhappy visit to karlsbad rendered that impossible the stores and provisions were supplied by mm voltéra brothers of cairo i cannot say too much in their praise and the packing was as good as the material m gross of shepheards was good enough to let me have a barrel of claret which improved every week by travelling and which cost only a franc a bottle it began as a bon ordinaire and the little that returned to cairo ranked with a quasigrand vin at least as good as the fourshilling medoc finally dr lowe of cairo kindly prepared for us a medicine chest containing about £10 worth of the usual drugs and appliancescalomel tartar emetic and laudanum blister plaster and simple ointmenten14  a special train was made ready for thursday december 6th and at ten am after taking leave of their highnesses who courteously wished me good luck and godspeed the expedition found itself under weigh we were accompanied to the station by many kind friends my excellent kinsman lord francis and lady f conyngham yacoub artin bey general stone and mm george garwood girard and guillemine  the change from the damp air of cairo to the drought of the desert was magical light ailments and heavy cares seemed to fall off like rags and tatters we halted at zagázig remarking that this young focus of railway traffic has become the eastern key of lower egypt as benhá is to the western delta and prophesying that some day not far distant will see the glories of bubastis revived here we picked up my old friend haji wali whom agehe declares that he was born in the month mízán of 1797had made only a little fatter and greedier we gave a wide berth to the future alexandria ismailíyyah whose splendid climate has been temporarily spoilt by the sweetwater canal of the same name the soil became literally sopped and hence the intermittent fevers which have lately assailed it a similar disregard for drainage has ingeniously managed to convert into pesthouses simla and other himalayan sanitaria  the day ended with running the train into the suez docks so as to embark all our impediments on the next morning and i fondly expected saturday to see us sail but the weatherwise had been true in their forecasts friday opened with howling screaming gusts of southerly wind and during the night we were treated to a fierce display of stormthunder and lightning and rain the gale caused one collision on the canal and twentyfive steamers were delayed near the bitter lake it broke down the railway and sanded it up for miles and it levelled fifty english and forty egyptian telegraphpostsan ungentle hint to prefer the telephone saturday the beginning of winter opened with a cold raw souther and a surging sea which washed over the dockpiers in such weather it was impossible to embark ten mules without horseboxes on sunday the waves ran high but the gale fell about sunset to a dead calm as usual in the gulf the breakers and white horses at once disappeared and the slaty surface fringed with dirty yellow immediately reassumed its robes of purple and turquoise blue the ill wind however had blown us some good by deluging with longhopedfor rain the now barren mountains of midian  this fortuna according to the people sets in with the fourth coptic month kayhaken15 which begins the first arbaín fortyday period and the fourth day is known as the imtizáj elfaslayn or mixture of the two seasonsautumn and winter the storm is expected to blow three days from the azyab southeast or from the shirs southwest the qualities of the several winds are described in the following distich            mirísi shaytán wa gharbi wazírhu           tiyáb sultán wa sharki nazírhu       the southwesters a

saying of the arab sailor            when the moon sleeps the seaman may sleep           when the moon stands the seaman must stand  the sleeping moonnáim or rákid also called yemániis that of the first quarter which we mark concave to the left the standing moon is that of the last  our stay at suez was saddened by the sudden death of marius isnard who had acted cook to the first khedivial expedition the poor lad aged only eighteen had met us at the suez station delighted with the prospect of another journey he had neglected his health and after a suppression of two days which he madly concealed gangrene set in and he died a painful death at the hospital during the night preceding our departure  on december 10th we ran down from suez quay in the bird of the sea tayr elbahr the harbour mouche or little steamlaunch accompanied by the governor saíd bey who has not yet been made a pasha by mr consul west by the genial raíf bey wakíl elkomandaníyyah or acting commodore of the station by mr willoughby faulkner my host at suez by the messieurs levick and by other friends in the highest spirits we boarded our guncarriage the aviso mukhbir captain mohammed siráj and after many mutual good wishes we left the new docks at 610 pm  nothing could be more promising than the weather a young moon mirrored in a sea smooth as oil the giver of good news elmukhbir however for once failed in her mission she had lately conducted herself well upon a trial trip round the zenobia lightship newport rocken16 but the two arab firemen who acted engineers wornout greybeards that hated the idea of four months on the barbarous arabian shore had choked the tubes with wastage and had filled the single boiler taking care to plug up instead of opening the reliefpipe the consequence was that the engines sweated at every pore steam instead of water streamed from the sides and the chimney discharged besides smoke a heavy shower of rain the engine john jameson engineer newcastleontyne 1866 a good article in prime condition as far as a literally rotten boiler would allow presently revenged itself by splitting the airpipe of the condenser from top to bottom and after two useless halts the captain reported to me that we must return to suez what a beginning the fracture somewhat relieved the machinery we did better work after than before the accident but we were ignobly towed into dock by the ships boats  a telegram with a procèsverbal was at once sent off to the prince saíd bey and raíf bey hastened to our aid and mr williams superintending engineer of the khedivíyyah line with the whole of his staff stripped and set to work at the peccant tubes and airpump they commenced with extinguishing a serious fire which burst from the wasteroomby no means pleasant when close to kegs of blastingpowder carefully sewn up in canvas they laboured with a will and before sunset mr williams informed us that he would guarantee the engines for eight days when we were starting on a dangerous cruise for four months he also supplied us with an egyptian boilermaker and with eleven instead of sixty new tubes we lost fortytwo of the old ones between suez and elmuwaylah before sunset we made a trial trip the wretched old kettle acting tant bien que mal we returned to reembark the soldiers and the mules and we set out for the second time at 530 pm  the mukhbir 130 feet long 380 tons and 80 to go horsepower under charge of the english or rather scotch engineer mr david duguid who had taken the place of the two arab firemen began with 7 12 knots an hour 68 revolutions per minute and a pressure of 9 lbs to the square inch the condenservacuum was 26 inches 30 being complete13 lbs next morning the rate declined to six miles in consequence of the boiler leaking and matters became steadily worse as a french writer says of the genre humain we were placed not entre le bien et le mal but entre le mal et le pire after sundry narrow escapes in the gulf of akabah we were saved as will be seen by a manner of miracles briefly the mukhbir caused us much risk heartburn and loss of time  seven am december 11th found us crossing the birkat faraúnpharaohs gulfsome sixty miles from the great port its horrors to native craft i have already described in my pilgrimage between this point and ras zafaránah higher up the wind seems to split a strong southerly gale will be blowing whilst a norther of equal pressure prevails at the gulfhead and vice versâ suez indeed appears to be in more ways than one a hydrographical puzzle when it is low water in and near the harbour the flow is high between the straits of jobal and the daedalus light and the ebb tide runs out about two points across the narrows whilst the flood runs in on a line parallel with it finally when we returned hardly making headway against an angry norther suez enjoying the sweet south was congratulating the voyagers upon their weather  the loss of a good working day soon made itself felt the north wind rose causing the lively mukhbir whose ballast bytheby was all on deck to waddle dangerously for the poor mules and it was agreed nem con to put into tor harbour we found ourselves at ten am december 12th within the natural pier of coralline and we were not alone in our misfortune an english steamer making suez was our companion this place has superseded el wijh as the chief quarantine station for the return pilgrimage and i cannot sufficiently condemn the changeen17 the day lagged slowly as we       walked in grief by the merge of the manyvoiced       sounding sea  but we looked in vain for our tender a sambúk of fifty tons elmusahhil rais ramazan which prince husayn had thoughtfully sent with us as postboat she disappeared on the evening of the 11th and she did not make act of presence until the 16th when her master was at once imprisoned in the fort of elmuwaylah moreover the owner mohammed bukhayt of suez who had received £90 as advance for three monthsothers said £60 for fourprovided her with only a few days provisions leaving us to ration his crew  a wintry norther in these latitudes is not easily got rid of according to the people here as in the akabah gulf it lasts three days and dies after a quiet noon whereas on the 13th when we expected an escape it rose angrily at one pm i was much cheered by the pleasant news of m bianchi the local deputato di sanità who assured us that a pernicieuse was raging at elmuwaylah and that it was certain death to pass one night in the fort the only fire that emitted all this smoke was the fact that during the dateharvest of northwestern arabia july and august agues are common and that at all seasons the well water is not honest and is supposed to breed trifling chills in the prairies of the far west i heard of a man who rode some hundreds of miles to deliver himself of a lie nothing like solitude and the desert for freshening the fancy another individual who was much exercised by our journey was khwájeh konstantin a syriangreek trader son of the old agent of the convent whose blue goggles and comparatively tight pantaloons denoted a certain varnish and veneer it is his practice to visit elmuwaylah once every six months when he takes in exchange for cheap tobacco secondhand clothes and poor cloth the coral the pearls fished for in april the gold dust the finds of coin and whatever else will bring money such is the course and custom of these small monopolists who at raitha and elsewhere much dislike to see quiet things moved  at length after a weary day of far niente when even le sommeil se faisait prier we hardened our hearts and at nine pm as the gale seemed to slumber we stood southwards the mukhbir rolled painfully off ras mohammed which obliged us with its own peculiar gusts and the akabah gulf as usual acted windsail a long détour was necessary in order to spare the mules which however are much less liable to injury under such circumstances than horses having a knack of learning to use sealegs  the night was atrocious so was the next morning but about noon we were cheered by the sight of the glorious mountainwalls of wellremembered midian which stood out of the clear blue sky in passing grandeur of outline in exceeding splendid dour of colouring and in marvellous sharpness of detail once more the power of the hills was on us  three pm had struck before we found ourselves in broken water off the fort of elmuwaylah where our captain cast a single anchor and where we had our first escape from drifting upon the razorlike edges of the coralline reefs in fact everything looked so menacing with surging sea around and sable stormclouds to westward that i resolved upon revisiting our old haunt the safe and docklike sharm yáhárr here we entered without accident and were presently greeted by the sayyid abd elrahím our former káfilahbáshi who had ridden from elmuwaylah to receive us the news was good a truce of one month had been concluded between the huwaytát and the maázah probably for the better plundering of the pilgrims this year the latter were many the wakfah or standing upon mount ararat fell upon a friday consequently it was a hajj elakbar or greater pilgrimage very crowded and very dangerous in more ways than one  i had given a free passage to one sulaymán aftáhi who declared himself to be of the beni ukbah when he was a huwayti of the jeráfín clan after securing a free passage and provision gratis when the ship anchored he at once took french leave on return i committed him to the tender mercies of the governor saíd bey the soldiers the quarrymen and the mules were landed and the happy end of the first stage brought with it a feeling of intense relief like that of returning to alexandria hitherto everything had gone wrong the delays and difficulties at cairo at suez the death of poor marius isnard and the furious storm the breakdown of the engine the fire in the wasteroom and lastly the rough and threatening gale between the harbour and elmuwaylah what did the wise king mean by better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof i only hope that it may be applicable to the present case in the presence of our working ground all evils were incontinently forgotten and after the unusual dankness of the egyptian capital and the blustering winds of the gulf and the sea the soft and delicate air of the midian shore acted like a cordial for the first time after leaving alexandria i felt justified in taper de loeil with the clearest of consciences  the preliminary stage ended with disembarking at the fort elmuwaylah all our stores and properties including sundry cases of cartridges and five hundred pounds of pebblepowder which had been stored immediately under the main cabin and its eternal cigarettes and allumettes the implements as well as the provisions were made over to the charge of an old albanian one rajab aghá who at first acted as our magazineman for a consideration of two napoleons per month in advance if possible this done the mukhbir returned into the dock yáhárr in order to patch up her kettle which seemed to grow worse under every improvement we accompanied her after ordering a hundred camels to be collected well knowing that as this was the bairam id or greater festival nothing whatever would be done during its three days duration  the respite was not unwelcome to me it seemed to offer an opportunity for recovering strength at cairo i had taken the advice of a learned friend if not an apostle of temperance at any rate sorely afflicted with the temperance idea who by threats of confirmed gout and lumbago fatty degeneration of the heart and liver ending in the possible rupture of some valve had persuaded me that man should live upon a pint of claret per diem how dangerous is the clever brain with a monomania in it according to him a glass of sherry before dinner was a poison whereas half the world especially the eastern half prefers its potations preprandially a quarter of the liquor suffices and both appetite and digestion are held to be improved by it the result of turning over a new leaf in the shape of a phial of thin gladstone was a lumbago which lasted me a long month and which disappeared only after a liberal adhibition of diffusible stimulants  it required no small faith in ones good star to set out for a six weeks work in the desert under such conditions my consolation however was contained in the lines attributed to half a dozen who wrote good english       he either fears his fate too much           or his deserts are small      who dares not put it to the touch           to gain or lose it all  this time however mind was tranquil whatever matter might suffer as the novelist says lighting upon a grain of gold or silver betokens that a mine of the precious metal must be in the neighbourhood it had been otherwise with my first expedition a forlorn hope a miracle of moral audacity the heaviest of responsibilities incurred upon the slightest of justifications upon the pinch of sand which a tricky and greedy old man might readily have salted it reminds me of a certain philip sober who in the morning fainted at the sight of the precipice which he had scaled when philip drunk i look back with amazement upon no i  note  the second khedivial expedition to midian was composed of the following officers and men the european staff

     chapter ii the startfrom elmuwaylah to the white mountain and aynúah    i landed at elmuwaylah described in my last volumeen18 on the auspicious wednesday december 19 1877 under a salute from the gunboat mukhbir which the fort answered with a rattle and a patter of musketry all the notables received us in line drawn up on the shore close to our camp to the left stood the civilians in tulipcoloured garb next were the garrison a dozen báshbuzuks en bourgeois and mostly armed with matchlocks then came out quarrymen in uniform but without weapons and lastly the escort twentyfive men held the place of honour on the right the latter gave me a loud hip hip hurrah as i passed the tents a total of twenty including two fourpolers for our mess and for the stores with several large canvas shedspáls the angloindian calls themgleamed white against the darkgreen fronds of the dategrove and the magnificent background of the scene was the dibbagh block of the tihamah or lowland mountains  the usual palaver at once took place during which everything was sweet as honey after this pleasant prelude came the normal difficulties and disagreeablesit had been reported that i was the happy possessor of £22000 mostly to be spent at elmuwayiah the unsettled arabs plunder and slay the settled arabs slander and cheat  a whole day was spent in inspecting the soldiers and mules in despatching a dromedarypost to suez with news of our unexpectedly safe arrival and in conciliating the claims of rival bedawin his highness the viceroy had honoured with an order to serve us hasan ibn salim shaykh of the beni ukbah a small tribe which will be noticed in a future page last spring these men had carried part of our caravan to aynúnah and they having no important bloodfeuds i had preferred to employ them but abd elnabi of the tagayáthuwaytát clan had been spoilt by overkindness during my reconnaissance of 1877 besides i had given him a bowieknife without taking a penny in exchange in my first volume he appears as a noble savage with a mixture of the gentleman here he becomes a mere fellahbedawi  the claimants met with the usual ceremony right hands placed on the opposite left breaststhis is not done when there is bad bloodforeheads touching and the word of peace salám ceremoniously ejaculated by both mouths then came the screaming voices the high words and the gestures which looked as if the kurbáj whip were being administered the huwayti stubbornly refused to march with the other tribe whom moreover he grossly insulted he professed perfect readiness to carry me and mine gratis the while driving the hardest bargain he spoke of our land when the country belongs to the khediv he openly denied his allegiance he was convicted of saying if these christians find gold there will be much trouble fitneh to us moslems and at a subsequent time he went so far as to abuse an officer i had shaykhd him shayyakhtuh that is promoted him in rank said the sayyid abd elrahím and the honour had completely changed his manners nasaggharhu we will small him was my reply the only remedy in fact was to undo what had been done to cut down as easterns say the tree which i had planted so he was solemnly and conspicuously disrated the fee one dollar per diem allotted as travelling and escortallowance to the chiefs was publicly taken from him and he at once subsided into an ignoble walad lad under the lead of his uncle shaykh aláyan ibn rabí the latter is a man of substance who can collect at least two thousand camels though much given to sulking on the whole he behaved so well that the expedition ended i recommended him to his highness the viceroy for appointment to the chieftainship of his tribe and the usual yearly subsidy with him was associated his cousin shaykh furayj an excellent man of whom i shall have much to say and thus we had to fee three bedawi chiefs including hasan the latter was a notable intriguer and mischiefmaker ever breeding bad blood and his termper was rather violent than sullen when insulted by a soldier he would rush off for his gun ostentatiously light the match walk about for an hour or two threatening to shyute and then apparently forget the whole matter  all wanted to let their camels by the day whereas the custom of arabia is to bargain for the march thus the pilgrims pay one dollar per stage of twelve hours and the postdromedary demands the same sum besides subsistencemoney and bakhshish but our long and frequent halts rendered this proceeding unfair to the bedawin i began by offering seven piastres tariff and ended by agreeing to pay five per diem while in camp and ten when on the roaden19 of course it was too much but our supply of money was ample and the viceroy had desired me to be liberal in the nile valley where the price of a camel is some £20 the average daily hire would be one dollar on the other hand the animal carries during short marches 700 lbs the american officers in upper egypt reduced to 300 lbs the 500 lbs heaped on by the súdáni merchants in india we consider 400 lbs a fair load and the midianite objects to anything beyond 200 lbs  i have no intention of troubling the reader with a detailed account of our three first stages from elmuwaylah to the jebel elabyaz or white mountainen20 on december 21st leaving camp with the most disorderly of caravans106 camels instead of 80 dromedaries not includedwe marched to the mouth of the wady tiryam where we arrived before our luggage and provisions lacking even adams ale the shaykhs took all the water which could be found in the palmboothies near the shore and drank coffee behind a bush this sufficed to give me the measure of these walljumpers  early next morning i set the quarrymen to work with pick and basket at the northwestern angle of the old fort the latter shows above ground only the normal skeletontracery of coralline rock crowning the gentle sandswell which defines the lip and jaw of the wady and defending the townlet built on the northern slope and plain the dimensions of the work are fiftyfive mètres each way the curtains except the western where stood the báb elbahr sea gate were supported by one central as well as by angular bastions the northern face had a cant of 32 degrees east mag and the northwestern tower was distant from the sea seventytwo metres whereas the southwestern numbered only sixty the spade showed a substratum of thick old wall untrimmed granite and other hard materials further down were various shells especially bénitiers  tridacna gigantea the harp here called sirinbáz and the pearloyster sheepbones and palm charcoal pottery admirably cooked as the bedawin remarked and glass of surprising thinness iridized by damp to rainbow hues this possibly the remains of lachrymatories was very different from the modern bottlegreen which resembles the old roman lastly appeared a ringbezel of lapis lazuli unfortunately the royal gem of epiphanus was without inscription  whilst we were digging the two staffofficers rode to the dategroves of wady tiryam and made a plan of the ancient defencesthe results of the first khedivial expedition had either not been deposited at or had been lost in the staff bureau cairo they found that the late torrents had filled up the sand pits acting as wells and the people assured them that the fiumara had ceased to show perennial water only about five or six years ago  the second march was disorderly as the first it reminded me of driving a train of unbroken mules over the prairies the men were as wild and unmanageable as their beasts it was every ones object to get the maximum of money for the minimum of work the escort took especial care to see that all their belongings were loaded before ours were touched each load was felt and each box was handweighed before being accepted the heaviest rejected by the rich were invariably left to the poorest and the lowest clansmen with the weakest and leanest of animals all at first especially objected to the excellent boxesa great comfortmade for the expeditionen21 at the citadel cairo but they ended with bestowing their hatred upon the planks the tables and the long tentpoles as a rule after the fellows had protested that their camels were weighted down to the earth we passed them on the march comfortably ridingfor the orbán cant walk and no wonder at the haltingplace they unbag a little barley and wheatmeal make dough thrust it into the fire break bread and wash it down with a few drops of dirty water this copious refection ends in a thimbleful of thick black coffee and a pipe at home they have milk and ghí clarified butter in plenty during the season game at times and on extraordinary occasions a goat or a sheep which however are usually kept for buying corn in egypt but it is a caution to see them feed alle spalle altrui  nothing shabbier than the packsaddles nothing more rotten than the ropes as these desert ships must weigh about half the sturdy animals of syria and the egyptian delta future expeditions will perhaps do well to march their carriage round by elakabah the people declare that the experiment has been tried but that the civilized animal sickens and dies in these barrens they forget however the two pilgrimcaravans  at this season the beasts are halfstarved their kitchen is a meagre ration of bruised beans and their daily bread consists of the dry leaves of thorn trees beaten down by the makhbat a flaillike staff and caught in a large circle of matting elkhasaf in sinai the vegetation fares even worse the branches are rudely lopped off to feed the flocks only holy trees escape this mutilation with the greatest difficulty we prevented the arabs tethering their property all night close to our tents either the brutes were cold or they wanted to browse or to meet a friend every movement was punished with a wringing of the halter and the result may be imagined  we slept that night at wady sharmá of this ruined town a plan was made for the goldmines of midian by lieutenant amir who alone is answerable for its correctness we afterwards found layers of ashes slag and signs of metalworking to the northeast of the enceinte where the furnace probably stood the outline measures 1906 metres not several kilometres and desultory digging yielded nothing but charcoal cinders and broken pottery it was not before nine am on the next day that i could mount my old white stumbling starting mule the delay being caused by m maries small discovery which will afterwards be noticed we crossed both branches of the sharmá water and ascending the long sandslope of the right bank we again passed the bedawi cemetery i sent lieutenants amir and yusuf to prospect certain stoneheaps which lay seawards of the graves and they found a little heptangular demilune concave to the north the curtains varying from a minimum length of ten to a maximum of eighty metres and the thickness averaging two metres seventyfive centimetres it was possibly intended like those above wady tiryam to defend the western approach and superficially viewed it looks like a line of stones heaped up over the dead with that fine birdseye view of the valley which the bedawi loves for his last sleepingplace  thence we passed through the dry báb sea gap cut by a torrent in the regular line of the coralline cliff the opening of the wady melláh off which lay our sambúk marching up the wady makadah our experienced eyes detected many small outcrops of quartz formerly unobserved in the sole and on the banks the granite hills here as throughout midian were veined and dyked with two different classes of plutonic rock the red and pink are felsites or finegrained porphyries the black and bottlegreen are the coarsegrained varieties easily disintegrating and forming hollows illustration with caption fortification on the cliff commanding the right bank of wady sharma in the harder granite the ride was made charming by the frontage of picturesque jebel urnub with its perpendicular pinnacles upon rocksheets dropping clear a thousand feet its jutting bluffs its three huge flying buttresses that seemed to support the mighty wallcrest and its many spits and organs some capped with finials that assume the aspect of loganstones there was no want of animal life and the yellow locusts were abroad one had been seized by a little lizard which showed all the violent muscular action of the crocodile there were small longeared hares suggesting the leporide sign of gazelles appeared and the bedawin spoke of wolves and hyenas foxes and jackals  we camped upon the old ground to the southwest of the jebel elabyaz and at the halt our troubles forthwith began the water represented to be near is nowhere nearer than a two hours march for camels and it is mostly derived from rainpuddles in the great range of mountains which subtends maritime midian but this was our own discovery the halffellah bedawin like the shepherds their predecessors in the days of abimelech and jethro are ever chary of their treasure the only object being extra camelhire after eating your salt a rite whose significance bytheby is wholly ignored throughout midian and its neighbourhood they will administer under your eyes a silencing nudge to an overcommunicative friend the very children that drive the sheep and goats instinctively deny all knowledge of the themáil pits and holes acting as wells  at the head of the wady elmakadah we halted six days december 2430 this delay gave us time to correct the misapprehensions of our flying visit the height of the jebel elabyaz whose colour makes it conspicuous even from the offing when sailing along the coast was found to be 350 not 600 feet above the plain the grand filon which a mauvais plaisant of a reviewer called the grand filou forms a nick near the hilltop but does not bifurcate in the interior the fork is of heavy greenish porphyritic trap also probably titaniferous iron with a trace of silveren22 where it meets the quartz and the granite standing upon the old man with which we had marked the top i counted five several dykes or outcrops to the east inland and one to the west cutting the prism from north to south the superficial matter of these injections showed concentric circles like ropy lava the shape of the block is a saddleback and the lay is westeast curving round to the south the formation is of the coarse grey granite general throughout the province and it is dyked and sliced by quartz veins of the amorphous type crystals being everywhere rare in midian  the filons and filets varying in thickness from eight metres to a few lines are so numerous that the whole surface appears to be quartz tarnished by atmospheric corrosion to a dull palegrey yellow while the fracture sharp and cutting as glass or obsidian is dazzling and milkwhite except where spotted with pyritescopper or iron the neptunian quartz again has everywhere been cut by plutonic injections of porphyritic trap veins averaging perhaps two metres with a northsouth strike and a dip of 75 degrees mag west if the capping were removed the subsurface would doubtless bear the semblance of a honeycomb  the jebel elabyaz is apparently the centre of the quartzose outcrop in north midian madyan proper we judged that it had been a little worked by the ancients from the rents in the reef that outcrops like a castlewall on the northern and eastern flanks there are still traces of roads or paths while heaps strews and scatters of stone handbroken and not showing the natural fracture whiten like snow the lower slopes of the western hill base they contrast curiously with the hard felspathic stones and the lithographic calcaires bearing the mosslike impress of metallic dendrites these occur in many parts near the seaboard and we found them in southern as well as in northern midian the conspicuous hill is one of four mamelons thus disposed in birdseye view the dotted line shows the supposed direction of the lode in the jibál elbayzá the collective name  on the plain to the north of the jebel elabyaz also i found curdles of porphyritic trap and parallel trapdykes cutting the courses of largegrained grey granite as many as three outcrops of the former appeared within fourteen yards this convinced me that the whole of the solid square thirty kilometres six by five where the quartz emerges is underlaid by veins and veinlets of the same rock moreover i then suspected and afterwards ascertained that the quartz of the jibál elbayzá as the bedawin call this section is not a local peculiarity it everywhere bursts not only the plain between the sea and the coastrange but the two parallels of mountain which confine it on the east in fact throughout our northern march the arabs understanding that its object was marú the generic name for quartzen23 brought us loads of specimens from every direction nothing is easier than to work the purely superficial part a few barrels of gunpowder and half a dozen english miners with pick and crowbar suffice even our dawdling feckless quarrymen easily broke and spelled for camel loading some six tons in one day  our short sennight was not wasted yet i had an uncomfortable feeling that the complication of the country called for an exploration of months and not hours every day some novelty appeared the watercourses of the gháts or coastrange were streaked with a heavy metallic quartzose black sand which m marie vainly attempted to analyze we afterwards found it in almost every wady and running north as far as elakabah whilst with few exceptions all our washings of red earth chloritic sand and bruised stone yielded it and it only it is apparently the produce of granite and syenite and it abounds in african egypt i was in hopes that tungsten and titaniferous iron would make it valuable for cutlery as the black sand of new zealand experiments in the citadel cairo produced nothing save magnetic iron with a trace of lead but according to colonel ross the learned author of pyrology or fire chemistryen24 it is iserine or magnetic ilmenite titaniferous ironsand containing eightyeight per cent of iron oxides and sesquioxides with eleven per cent of titanic acid  the arabs brought in fine specimens of hematite and of copper ore from wady gharr or ghurr six miles to the south of camp here were found two waterpits in a welldefined valley the nearer some ten miles southwest of the jebel elabyaz the other about two miles further to the northwest making a total of twelve about the latter there was however no level ground for tents a mile and a half walking almost due north led to a veinlet of copper 30 metres long by 030 thick with an eastwest strike and a dip of 45 degrees south this metal was also found in the hills to the south crystalline pyroxene and crystallized sulphates of lime apparently abound while the same is the case with carbonate of manganese and other forms of the metal so common in western sinai briefly our engineer came to the conclusion that we were in the very heart of a mining region  we made a general reconnaisance december 27th of a place whence specimens of pavonine quartz had come to hand following the wady ifriyá round the north and east of the white mountain we fell into the wady simákh of wild sumach that drains the great gap between the pinnacles and the buttresses of the urnubtihámah section after riding some two miles we found to the southeast fragments of dark iridescent and metallic quartz they emerge from the plain like walls bearing northsouth with 36 degrees of westing and a westward dip of 15 degrees to 20 degreesexactly the conditions which australia seeks and which produced the huge welcome nugget of ballarat they crop out of the normal trapdyked grey granite and select specimens show the fine panaché lustre of copper m marie afterwards took from one of the geodes a pinch of powder weighing about half a gramme and cupelled a bright dustshot bead weighing not less than two centigrammes without further examination he determined it to be argentiferous when it was possibly iron or antimony on the other hand the silver discovered in the grand filon by so careful and conscientious an observer as gastinel bey and the fact that we are here on the same line of outcrop and at a horizon three hundred feet lower are reassuring  this vein which may be of great length and puissance i took the liberty of calling the filon husayn from the prince who had so greatly favoured the expedition here we had hit upon the negrosen25 or coloured quartzose formations of mexico in which silver appears as a sulphure and we may expect to find the colorado or argillaceous that produces the noble metal in the forms of chlorure bromure and iodure the former appears everywhere in midian but our specimens are all superficial taken à ciel ouvert to ascertain the real value and the extent of the deposits required exposure of the veins at a horizon far lower than our means and appliances allowed us to reach if the rock prove argentiferous i should hope to strike virgin silver in the capillary or aborescent shape below above it as on the summit of the jebel elabyaz and generally in the marú hills and hillocks of north midian the dull white quartz is comparatively barren showing specks of copper crystals of pyrites the crowgold of the old english miner and dark dots of various metals which still await analysis  thus i would divide the metalliferous quartzes of this northmidianite region into two chief kinds those stained green and light blue whose chief metallic element is copper with its derivatives and the iridescent negro which may shelter the colorado in south midian the varieties of quartz are incomparably more numerous and almost every march shows a new colour or constitution  about the jebel elabyaz as in many mining countries water is a serious difficulty the principal deposit lies some three miles east of the camping ground in a nakb or gorge elasaybah offsetting from the great fiumara elsimákh and apparently it is only a rainpool throughout midian i may say men still fetch water out of the rock m philipin whilst pottering about this place saw two beden ibex with their young which suggests a permanent supply of drinken26  however that may be nortons abyssinian pumps for which i had vainly applied at cairo would doubtless discover the prime necessary in the wadys many of the latter being still damp and muddy moreover the crible continue à grilles filtrantes the invention of mm huet and geyler introduced we are told into the mechanical treatment of metals a principle which greatly economizes fluid founded upon the fact that sands of nearly the same size but of different densities when mixed in liquid and subjected to rapid vertical oscillation range themselves by order of weight the heavier sinking and not allowing passage to lighter matter the new sieve offers the advantages of a single and simple instrument with increased facility for treating poor dirt finally as i shall show the country is prepared by nature to receive a tramway and the distance to the sea does not exceed fourteen miles liberally computeden27  either the rainwater affected the health of the party or it suffered from the excessive dryness and variations of the atmosphere eight to nine hundred feet above sealevel aner 2910 ranging in the tents between 92 degrees by day and 45 degrees at night a piercing killing temperature in the desert moreover the cold weather is mostly the unwholesome season in hot lands and vice versâ hence the arab proverb harárat eljebel wa lá bardhá the heat of the hills and not their cold old haji wali lost his appetite complained of indigestion and clamoured to return home ahmed kaptán suffered from sulb lumbago and bad headache whilst lieutenant yusuf was attacked by an ague and fever which raised the mouth thermometer to 102 degrees103 degrees calling loudly for aconite these ailments affected the party more or less the whole way but it was not pleasant to see them begin so soon when our work of collecting specimensthree tons from the jebel elabyaz and three from the filon husaynwas finished i resolved upon returning to the coast and treating our loads at the sharmá water we reached the valley mouth on december 30th and we greatly enjoyed the change from the harshness of the inland to the mildness of the seaboard air  we stayed at sharmá much disliking its remarkably monotonous aspect for another week till january 7 1878 yule the wheel despite the glorious treelogs and roaring fires had been a failure at the white mountain the dragoman had killed our last turkey and had forgotten to bring the plumpudding from elmuwaylah there was champagne but that is not the stuff wherewithal to wash down tough mutton new years day on the other hand had all the honours its birth was greeted with a flow of whiskypunch wherein wine had taken the place of water and we drank the health of his highness the founder of the expedition in a bottle of dry mumm the evening ended with music and dancing by way of praying the old year out and the new year in mersál the boruji performed a wild solo on his bugle and another negro ahmed elshinnáwi played with the nái or reedpipe one of those monotonous and charming minorkey airsi call them so for want of a word to express themwhich extend from midian to trafalgar and which find their ultimate expression in the lovely iberian zarzuelaen28 the boy husayn genínah a small cyclops in a brown felt calotte and a huge military overcoat cut short caused roars of laughter by his ultragaditanian style of dancing i have also reason to suspect that a jig and a breakdown tested the solidity of the plank table while a jews harp represented europe in fact throughout the journey reminiscences of mabille and the music halls contrasted strongly with the memories of majestic and mysterious midian and to make the shock more violent some friend malè salsus sent me copies of the cosmopolitan spectator and the courteous mayfair which at once became waste paper for bedawi cartridges  our rosh há shanah new years day was further distinguished by the discovery of a vein and outcrop of metalliferous quartz about half an hours walk and bearing nearly east 80 degrees mag from camp we followed the wady sharmá and found above its gate the masonryfoundation of a square work near it lay the graves of the wild men one with the normal awning of palmfronds honoris causâ there were signs of stonequarrying and at one place a road had been cut in the rock leaving on the north the left side of the watercourse with its rushes scirpus and hugeheaded reeds arundo donax its dates and daumsthe two latter often scorched and killed by the careless bedawiwe struck into a parallel formation the wady el wuday bonedry and much trodden by camels arrived at the spot we found that the confused masses of hill subtending the regular cliffline of the old coast are composed of grey granite seamed with snowy quartz and cut by the usual bands of bottlecoloured porphyritic trap which here and there becomes red some of the heights are of greenishyellow chloritic felspar well adapted for brickmaking the surface of the land is scattered with fragments of white silex and fine red jasper banded with black oligistic iron this rock close hard and fine enough to bear cutting appears everywhere in scatters and amongst the conglomerates only one fossil was picked up a mould so broken as to be quite useless  we also followed out m maries find to which he had been guided by a patch of red matter conspicuous on the road from tiryam to sharmá for forty minutes we skirted the seaward face of the old cliff a line broken by many deep watergashes and buttressed by goz or high heaps of loose white sand we then turned eastwards or inland ascended a nakb gorge and saw as before the corallines and carbonates of lime altered fused scorified and blackened by heated injections the grey granite scored with quartz veins running in all rhumbs and the porphyritic trap forming crests that projected from the sands the cupriferous stone struck eastwest with a dip to the south the outcrops visible without digging measured fifteen to twenty metres long by one to one and a half in breadth  new years day also restored to us the pup páijí when quite a babe it had walked up to me in the streets of cairo evidently claimed acquaintanceship and straightway followed me into shepheards where having a certain sneaking belief in metempsychosis i provided it with bed and board during our third march to the white mountain being given to violent yelps which startled both mules and camels the small thing had been left to walk and had apparently made friends with an arab goatherd after nine days absence without leave páijí reappeared with dirty rags tied round its bony back and wasted waist showing an admirable skeleton and making the most frantic demonstrations of joy the loss of the poor little brute had affected all our spirits we thought that the hyenas and the ravens had seen the last of it and it received a warm welcome home  m lacaze unlike the rest took a violent fancy for the wady sharmá the waterscenery enchanted him his sketches were almost confined to the palmgrowth and to the greenery so unexpected in arid midian where according to the old and exploded opinion moses wrote the book of job the idea of arabia is certainly not associated with flowing rills and waving trees and rustling zephyrs every morning i used to awake surprised by the song of the naiad the little runnel whimpling down its bed of rushes stone and sand and the response of the palms making music in the landbreeze  finally on new years day lieutenant amir guided by shaykh furayj and escorted by soldiers and miners made a three days trip to the wady urnub there he surveyed a large isolated mará or quartzhill some twentytwo to twentyfive direct miles southeast of the main outcrop thus giving a considerable extent to the northern miningfocus this feature is described as being four or five times larger than the jebel elabyaz proper and the specimens of quartz and grey granite proved it to be of the same formation it showed a broken outline with four great steps or dykes which had apparently been worked in the basal valleys and spread over the land generally was found a heavy yellow sand calcareous and full of silex the guide called it awwal hismá the hismá frontier  our travellers returned by a parallel line southerly and more direct in the wady urnub the maázah of the salímát clan received them with apparent kindness inwardly grumbling the while at their land being spied out and they especially welcomed furayj who being a brave soldier is also noted as a peacemaker all the men were armed and wore the same dress as the huwaytát like these they also breed camels and assesthat is they are not cowarabs certain travellers on the upper nile have distributed the bedawin into these two groups add horsearabs and assarabs and you have all the divisions of the race as connected with the socalled lower animals about three hours  eleven miles from sharmá camp some pyramids of sand were pointed out in the wady rátiyah the bedawin call one of them the goz ethannán moaning sandheap they declare that when the hajjcaravan passes or rather used to pass by that way before the early sixteenth century when sultán selim laid out his maritime highroad a naubah orchestra was wont to sound within its bowels this tale which bytheby is told of two other places in midian may have been suggested by the jebel elnákús bell mountain in sinailand but as the arabs perform visitation and sacrifice to the moaningheap the superstition probably dates from ancient days ruins are also reported to exist in the jebel fas the southern boundary of the urnub valley and further south in the jebel elharb i was told by some one whose name has escaped me of a dolmen mounted upon three supports lieutenant amir also brought copper ore from the wady urnub and from the ras wady elmukhbir specimens of a metal which the arabs use as a kohl or collyrium it proved however iron not antimony and the same mistake has been made in the sinaitic peninsula  at wady sharmá we rigged up under the superintendence of m philipin a trough and a cradle for washing the black sands the pounded quartz of the jebel elabyaz and the red sands these latter had shown a trace of silver 110000 to the first expedition we mixed it with mercury and amalgamed it in goatskins the men moved them to and fro but of course the water evaporated and the mass speedily became dry the upper or superficial white yielded only as far as our engineer could judge a little copper and bright knobs of pyrites the negros or iridized formations of the filon husayn on a lower horizon gave the dubious result already alluded to all the experiments were conducted in the rudest way of course a quantity of metal may have escaped notice and a fair proportion of the powdered stone was reserved for scientific treatment in europe  during our first trip we had found upon the right jaw of the wady sharmá a ruined village of workmen probably slaves whose bothans measured some twelve feet by eight they differ from the nawámis or mosquitohuts as the word is generally translated only in shapethe latter are circular with a diameter of ten feetand they perfectly resemble the small stone hovels in the wady mukattab which professor palmer desert of the exodus p 202 supposes to have been occupied by the captive miners and their military guardians this time we ascended the coralline ridge which forms the left jamb at its foot a rounded and half degraded dorsum of stiff gravel the nucleus of its former self showed a segment of foundationwall and the state of the stone suggested the action of fire possibly here had been a furnace the summit also bears signs of human occupation the southern part of the buttresscrest still supports a double concentric circle with a maximum diameter of about fifteen feet the outside is of earth apparently thrown up for a rampart behind a moat and the inside is of rough stones going south along the dorsum we found remains of oval foundations a trench apparently cut in the rock pottery often an inch and more thick and broken handmills made of the new red sandstone of the hismá finally at the northernmost point where the cliffedge falls abruptly with a natural arch towards the swamp about one kilometre broad at the báb we came upon another circle of rough stones we were doubtful whether these rude remains were habitations or old graves nor was the difficulty solved by digging into four of them the pick at once came upon the groundrock hitherto these ruins have proved remarkably sterile the only products were potsherds fragments of handmills and a fine lump of white marble rukhám supposed to come from the jebel ellauz  amongst our followers was a kázi of the arabs one jabr bin abd elnabi who is a manner of judge in civil but not in criminal matters before the suit begins the plaintiff or his surety deposits a certain sum in coin corn or other valuables and lays his damages at so much the defendant if inclined to contest the claim pays into court the disputed amount and the question is settled after the traditional and immemorial customs of the tribe this man covetous as any other disciple of justinian was exceedingly anxious to obtain the honorarium of a shaykh and he worked hard to deserve it shortly before our departure from sharmá he brought in some scoriae and slag broken and streaked with copperin fact ekvolades they are thinly scattered over the seaward slope of the left jaw where the stone nowhere shows a trace of the mineral in situ as however the expedition had found native copper in three places more or less near the jebel elabyaz it was decided that the ore had been brought from the interior  we were again much puzzled concerning the form of industry which gave rise to such a large establishment as sharmá agriculture was suggested and rejected and we finally resolved that it was a branchtown that supplied ore to the great smeltingplace and workshop of the coast aynúnah and possibly carbonate of lime to serve for flux  the distance along the winding wady between the settlement and the sea westward where the watercourse ends in sandheaps is seven to eight miles and the coast shows no sign of harbour or of houses about three miles however to the northwest is the admirable bay of aynunah unknown to the charts defended on both sides by sandspits and open only between the west and the northwest where reefs and shoals allow but a narrow passage its breadth across the mouth from east to west measures at least five thousand metres and the length inland useful for refuge is at least three thousand at the bottom of this noble límán the kolpos so scandalously abused by the ancients are three sandy buttresses metalled with water rolled stones and showing traces of graves possibly here may have been the site of an ancient settlement the arabs call the southern anchorage marked by a post and a pit of brackish water elmusaybah or musaybat sharmá its only present use seems to be embarking bundles of rushes for matmaking in egypt the northeastern end of the little gulf is the gád jád or mersá of elkhuraybah before described as the port of aynunah  at the musaybah i stationed our tender the sambúk elmusahhil which carried our heavy goods specimens by the ton rations and stores forge planks and crowbars the sailors lost no time in showing their rapacity every day they dunned us for tobacco and when we made a counterdemand for the excellent fish which was caught in shoals they simply asked what will you pay for it i imprudently left my keg of specimenspirits on board this ignoble craft and the consequence was that it speedily became bonedry the musaybah bight is a direct continuation of the wady elmelláh which joining that of elmakadah runs straight up to the jebel elabyaz and to the filon husayn these metalliferous quartzes cannot be further from the coast than a maximum distance of fourteen miles and the broad smooth watercourse with its easy gradients points it out as the site of the future tramway i should prefer a simpler form of the pioneer steam caravan or saddlebackrailway system patented by mr john l haddan ce formerly of damascusen29 he recommends iron as the best material for the construction and the cost delivered at alexandria would not exceed £1200 instead of £3000 to £20000 per kilometre including the rolling stock as the distance from the port is nothing £300 per kilometre would be amply sufficient for fixing up but i should reduce the price to £500 for the transport of some 50 tons per diem by proper management of the rails or the main rail it would be easy for trained camels to draw the train up the wady and the natural slope towards the sea would give work only to the brake where derailments are not possible  at sharmá we saw the crescent when the englishmen turned their money in their pockets and the egyptian offficers muttered a blessing upon the coming moon every day we waxed more weary of the place possibly the memories of the first visit were not pleasant many in camp still suffered and an old bedawi uncle to shaykh alayan died and was buried at aynúnah the number of servants also made us uncomfortable the head dragoman whose memory was confined to his carnet forgot everything and had we trusted to him half the supplies would have returned to suez probably for the benefit of his own shop at zagázig i soon found his true use and always left him behind as magazineman storekeeper and guardian of reserve provisions he was also a dangerous mischiefmaking fellow and such men always find willing ears that ought to know better petros the zante man was the model of a tipotenios an anybody who seemed to have been born limp without bones or brains he was sent back as soon as possible to cairo the worst point of these worthies was that they prevented for their own reasons the natives working for us while they preferred eternal chatter and squabbles to working themselves so the greek element was reduced to george the cook a short squat unwashed fellow who looked like a fairhercules out of luck who worked like three and who loudly clamoured for a revolver and a bowieknife his main fault professionally speaking was that he literally drenched us with oil till the store happily ran out his complexion was that of an animated ripe olive evidently the result of his own cookery his surprise when i imperatively ordered plain boiled rice instead of a mess dripping with grease and when told to boil the fish in sea water and to serve up the bouillon was high comedy doubtless he has often since his return astounded his hellenion by describing our frankish freaks and mad eccentricities  the stationary camp also retained lieutenant yusuf and mm duguid and philipin with thirteen soldiers and sixteen miners the six camels were placed under gabr kázi elorbán and all the staybehinds were charged with washing the several earths with scouring the country for specimens and with transporting sundry tons of the black sand before mentioned old haji wali probably frightened by the arabs and maddened by the idea that during his absence in the thick of the cotton season the fellahs of zagázig would neglect to pay their various debts began to malinger with such intensity of purpose that i feared lest he would kill himself to spite us the venerable shylock who ever pleaded poverty had made some £300 by lending a napoleon say on january 1st which became a sovereign on february 1st not to speak of the presents and benevolences which the debtor would be compelled to offer his creditor so he departed for elmuwaylah whence some correspondent had warned him that a pilgrim boat was about to start declaring that he was dying and trotting his mule as hard as it would go the moment a safe corner was turned he stayed two days on board the gunboat and straightway returned to egypt and the cotton seasonwe had the supreme satisfaction however to hear that he had gone through the long quarantine at tor yet after our return he reproached me with inimitable coolness and effrontery for not having behaved well to him  on the morning of january 7th a walk of two hours and twenty minutes  seven miles northwards and mostly along the shore of the noble musaybat sharmá transferred us to wellremembered aynúnah the sea in places washed over slabs of the fine old conglomerates which in this country line the banks and soles of all the greater wadys these are the cascalho of the brazil a rock which is treated by rejecting the pebbles and by pounding the silicious paste the air was softer and less exciting than that of sharmá and although the vegetation was of the crapaud mort damour huehere a sickly green there a duller brown than april had showedthe scene was more picturesque the gate was taller and narrower and the recollection of a happy first visit made me return to it with pleasure birds were more abundant longshanked waterfowl with hazel eyes redlegged rail the brown swallow of egypt greenblue flycatchers and a black muscivor with a snowywhite rump of which i failed to secure a specimen we also saw the terncoloured plover known in egypt as domenicain and red kingfishers the game species were fine large green mallard dark pintail quail and redbeaked brown partridge with the soft black eye  new formations began to develop themselves and the sickly hues of the serpentines and the chlorites so rich in the new world appeared more charming than brow of milk or cheek of roseen30 there were few changes a halfpeasant bedawi had planted a strip of barley near the camping place the late floods had shifted the course of the waters more datetrees had been wilfully burned a big block of quartz brother to that which we had broken had been carried off and where several of the old furnaces formerly stood deep holes dug by the moneyhunter now yawned i again examined the two large fragments of the broken barrage and found that they were of uncut stone compacted with fine cement which contained palmcharcoal  at aynúnah we gave only one day to work while m lacaze sketched the views we blasted with gunpowder more than half charcoal the madan elfayrúz turquoise mine as the arabs called it on the right side of the wady the colour and texture were so unlike the true lapis pharanitis that we began to suspect and presently we ascertained from the few remaining fragments it had been worked for copperthe carbonates and the silicates which characterize cyprus presently good specimens of the latter were brought to us from the jebel elfará by a bedawi pauper ayd of the tagaygáthuwaytát tribe these halfnaked shepherds and goatherds who know every stone in the land are its best guides not the shaykhs who as a rule see little or nothing outside their tents from our camp the direction as reported by ahmed kaptán was 102 degrees mag and the distance three miles i afterwards sent lieutenant yusuf from elmuwaylah to make a detailed planen31  we also dug in an old pit amongst the christian graves to the southeast of the camp and below the left jamb of the gate here also the bedawin had been at work and when unable to work deep enough they told us wonderful tales of an alabaster slab which doubtless concealed vast treasures in arabia as in africa one must look out for what there is not as well as for what there is after spending a morning in sinking a twelvefeet shaft we came upon a shapeless corallineboulder which in old times had slipped from the seaface of the cliff to the left of the valley i ascended this height and saw some stones disposed by the hand of man but there were no signs of a large slaveminer settlement like that on the other side of the báb  in the afternoon mr clarke led a party of quarrymen across the graveyards to elkhuraybah the seaport of aynúnah and applied them to excavating the floor of a cistern and the foundations of several houses a little pottery was the only result it was a slow walk of forty minutes and thus the total length of the aqueducts would be three miles not between four and five kilometres i had much trouble and went to some expense in sending camels to fetch a written stone which placed at the head of every newly buried corpse is kept there till another requires it it proved to be a broken marble pillar with a modern arabic epitaph in the gád elkhuraybah the little inlet near the gumruk customhouse as we called in waggery the shed of palmfronds at the base of the eastern sandspit lay five small sambúks which have not yet begun fishing for motherofpearl here we found sundry tents of the tagaygáthuwaytát the half fellahs that own and spoil the once goodly land the dogs barked at us but the men never thought of offering us hospitality we had an admirable view of the tihámah mountainszahd with its nick the parrotbeak of jebel elshátí the three perpendicular pinnacles and flying buttresses of jebel urnub the isolated lump of jebel fás the single cupola of jebel harb the huge block of dibbagh with its tall truncated tower the little umm jedayl here looking like a pyramid and the four mighty horns of jebel shárr  i left aynúnah under the conviction that it has been the great warshah workshop and embarkingplace of the coastsection extending from elmuwaylah to makná and that upon it depended both wady tiryam and sharmá with their respective establishments in the interior moreover the condition of the slag convinced me that iron and the baser metals have been worked here in modern times perhaps even in our own but by whom i should not like to say                               chapter iii             breaking new ground to magháir shuayb    on january 9th we left aynúnah by the hajjroad and passed along the quarry hill visited during my first journey the crest has old cuttings and new cuttings the latter still worked for bedawi headstones the dwarf pillar with the mysterious cup is reflected by the nubians who hollow out the upper part of the stela to a depth of eight or ten inches without adding any ornament hence perhaps the sawahíli custom of the inserted porcelainplate  after issuing from the stony and sandy gorge which forms the short cut we regained the hajjroad and presently sighted a scene readily recognized fronting us the northern horizon was formed by the azure wall of tayyib ismen32 the mountain of the good name backed by the far grander peaks of jebel mazhafah the latter rises abruptly from the bluer gulf of elakabah and both trend to their culminating points inland or eastward on our right followed the unpicturesque metalliferous heap of jebel zahd or aynúnah mountain whose brèche de roland seems to show from every angle its chocolatecoloured heights contain they say furnaces and mashghal or ateliers where the marú quartz was worked for ore in places it is backed by the pale azure peaks of jebel ellauz this mountain of almonds is said to take its name from the trees probably bitter which flourish there as within the conventwalls of st catherine sinai they grow i was told high up in the clefts and valleys and here also are furnaces both above and below of its white sparkling and crystallized marble truly noble material a tombstone was shown to me and i afterwards secured a slab with a broken arabic inscription and a ball apparently used for rubbing down meal the lauz appears to be the highest mountain in northern midianland unfortunately it is to be reached only viâ sharaf two long stations ahead and i could not afford time for geographical research to the prejudice of mineralogical its nearer foothill is the jebel khulayf and this feature contains according to the bedawin seven wells or pits whose bottom cannot be seen between the almond block and its northern continuation jebel munífah we saw a gorge containing water and sheltering at times a few tents of the amírát arabs in the same block we also heard of a sarbút or rock said to be written over  the regular cone of elmaklá ends the prospect in the northeastern direction looking westward we see the ghastly bare and naked secondary formation the rughám of the bedawin not to be confounded with rukhám alabaster or saccharine marble we afterwards traced this main feature of the akabah gulf as far south as the wady hamz it is composed of the sulphates of limealabaster gypsum and the plaster with which the tertiary basin of paris supplies the world and of the carbonates of limemarble chalk kalkspar shells and eggs the broken crests of the jibál elhamrá the red hills backing maknáen33 and the jagged black peaks of their eastern parallel the kalb elnakhlah look like plutonic reefs or islandchains emerging from the secondary sea the latter whose bleached and skeleton white is stained here and there by greenishyellow sands chlorite and serpentine stands boldly out from the chaos of purpling mountains composing sinai and ending southwards in the azure knobs of threeheaded tirán island the country in fact altogether changed quartz had disappeared and chlorite had taken its place  we passed the night at elusaylah a ghadir or hollow without drainage which the sinking of water cakes with mud and covers with an irregular circle of salsolaceous trees a patch of dark metallic green this usaylah is eaten by camels but rejected by mules here our post reached us from suez on the seventh day having started on the 2nd inst a dollar was offered to the bedawi who eyed the coin indignantly declaring that it ought to be a ginni guinea i had also given him some tobacco and repented as usual my generosity  next day we finished the last and larger part of the second pilgrimstage from elmuwaylah our arabs had been dodging and much disappointed about converting a two days into a three days march they punished us by feeding their camels on the road and by not joining us till the evening as before there was no game till we approached the springs yet tufts and scatters of tamarisks samur inga unguis and arák salvadora looked capable of sheltering it and now beyond the level and monotonous desert we began to see our destinationpalms and tufty trees at the mouth of a masked wady this watercourse runs between a background of reddishbrown rock the foothills and subranges of the grand block elzánah to the north and a foreground of paleyellow starknaked gypsum apparently tongueshaped above the latter tower two sisterquoins of ruddy material the shigdawayn to which a tale hangs  presently we fell into and ascended the great wady afár which begins in the hismá or red region east of the double coastrange after receiving a network of secondary valleys that enable it to flow a torrent as in france every ten to twelve years it falls into the mínat elayánát a little port for native craft which will presently be visited we left this wady at a bend some two hundred metres wide called the broad of the jujube from one of the splendid secular trees that characterize north midian near the campingground we shall find another veteran zizyphus whose three huge stems springing from a single base argue a green old age here both banks of the fiumara are lined with courses of rough stone mostly rounded and rolled boulders evidently the ruins of the waterconduits which served to feed the rich growth of the lower afal the vegetation of the gorgemouth developed itself to dates and daums tamarisks and salsolaceæ out of which scuttled a troop of startled gazelles we turned the righthand jamb of the gate and found ourselves at the water and campingground of magháir shuayb  the general appearance of the stationbasin is novel characteristic and not without its charms especially when the sunset paints the plain with the red red gold and washes every barren peak with the tenderest loveliest rosy pink under an intensely clear sapphirecoloured sky rises a distant rim of broken and chocolatecoloured traphills set off by pale hillocks and white flats of gypsum here and there crystallized by contact with the plutonics the formation mostly stands up either in stiff cones or in long spines and ridges whose perpendicular walllike crests are impossible to climb the snowy cliffs rest upon shoulders disposed at the angle of rest and the prevailing dull drabyellow of the base is mottled only where accidental fracture or fall exposes the glittering saltlike interior the gashes in the flank made by wind and rain disclose the coregrey granite or sandstone coloured by manganese the greater part of the old city was built of this alabasterlikeen34 material when new it must have been a scene in fairyland time has now degraded it to the appearance and the consistence of crumbling salt the quoinshaped hills of the foreground all uptilted and cliffing to the north show the curious mauve and red tints of the manycoloured clays called in the brazil tauá even the palms are peculiar their tall upright crests of lively green fronds their deadbrown hangings and their trunks charred black by the careless bedawi form a quaint contrast with the genteel nattily dressed and cockneyfied brooms of egypt and the hejaz and that grandeur may not be wanting to the view on the east rise the peak and pinnacles of the almond mountain jebel ellauz whilst northwards the jebel elzanah a huge dome forms the horizon  this place evidently the capital of madyan proper is the greek word        which ptolemy vi 7 places amongst his mesogeian towns in north lat 28 degrees 15 minutesen35 and it deserves more than the two pages of description which ruppell bestowed upon iten36 we will notice its natural features before proceeding to the remains of man here the wady afár takes the name of elbadá sweeping from west to east it is deflected to a northsouth line roughly speaking by the gate of the shigdawayn twinhills standing nearly east and west of one another now become a broad welldefined treedotted bed with stiff silt banks here and there twenty to twentyfive feet high it runs on a meridian for about a mile including the palmorchard and the campingground it then turns the west end of the jebel elsafrá a mass of gypsum on the left bank and it bends to the east of south having thus formed a figure of z after escaping from the imprisoning hills the fiumara bed now about threequarters of a mile broad is bisected longitudinally by a long and broken lump of chloritic or serpentine sandstone and rises in steps towards the right bank upon which the pilgrims camp reaching the plain the wady flares out wildly containing a number of riverine islands temporary but sometimes of considerable size it retains sufficient moisture to support a clump of palmsthat which we saw from afarit bends to the southeast and lastly it trends seaward  the water of bada springs from the base of the hill elsafrá oozing out in trickling veins bedded in soft dark mud it can be greatly increased by opening the fountains and economized by a roofing of mat we tried this plan which only surprised the unready arab after swinging to the left bank and running for a few yards it sinks in the sand yet on both sides there are signs of labour showing that even of late years the valley has seen better days long leats and watercourses have been cut in the clay and are still lined with the whiteflowered rijlah whose nutritive green leaf is eaten raw or boiled by the fellahs of egypt the wild growth however is mostly bitter on both sides are little square plots fenced against sheep and goats by a rude abattis of stripped and dead boughs jujube and acacia young dates have been planted in pits some are burnt and others are torn for the bedawi mischievous and destructive as the cynocephalus will neither work nor allow others to work the ushash or frondandreed huts much like huge birdsnests are scattered about in small groups everywhere except near the water wherever a collection of bones shows a hyenas lair the hunters have built a screen of dry stone  in fact magháir shuayb was spoken of as an arab happy valley but its owners the masáíd a spiritless tribe numbering about seventy tents are protégés of the tagaygát this huwayti clan is on bad terms with khizr and brahim bin makbúl and the brother shaykhs of the imrán recognized by the egyptian government claim the land where they have only the right of transit bedawi clans and subtribes always combine against stranger families but when there is no foreign war they amuse themselves with pilling and plundering sabring and shooting one another i believe that the palms were roasted to death by the imrán although the shaykhs assured me that the damage was done this year by a careless masúdi when cooking his food the tribe appears to be egyptoarab like the huwaytat and the maázah having congeners at ghazzah gaze and at ras elwady near egyptian tell elkebir consequently rüppell is in error when he suspects that die musaiti are ein judenstamm the unfortunates fled towards the sea and left the valley desolate about seven months ago their shaykh is dead and a certain agíl bin muhaysin a greedy foolish kind of fellow mentioned during my first journey aspires to the dignity and the profit of chieftainship he worried me till i named a dog after him and then he disappeared  the ruins of large extent for north midian and equal to those of all the towns we have seen put together begin with the palmorchard on the left bank the jebel elsafrá shows the foundations of what may have been the arx it is a double quoin the taller to the south the lower to the north and both bluff in the latter direction the dip is about 45 degrees the upper parts of the dorsa are scatters of white on brownyellow stone and below it where the surface has given way appear mauvecoloured strata as if stained by manganese viewed in profile from the west the site of elmuttalien37 as the arabs call the hauteville becomes a tall uptilted wedge continued northwards by the smaller feature and backed by a long skyline a high ridge of plaster pale coloured with glittering points  this isolated yellow hill a horse in icelandic parlance rising about two hundred feet above the valleysole is separated by a deep narrow gorge from the adjacent eastern range the slopes now watertorn and jagged may formerly have declined in regular lines and evidently all were built over to the crest like those of syrian safet the foundations of walls and rockcut steps are still found even on the far side of the eastern feature the knifeback is covered with the foundations of what appears to be a fortified laura or palace a straight street running northsouth with 5 degrees west mag it serves as base for walls one metre and a half thick opening upon it like rooms of these we counted twenty on either side at the northern end of the horse which like the southern has been weathered to a mere spur is a work composed of two semicircles fronting to the north and east a bastion of wellbuilt wall in three straight lines overhangs the perpendicular face of the eastern gorge in two places there are signs of a similar defence to the south but time and weather have eaten most of it away the ground sounds hollow and the feet sink in the crumbling heaps evidently the whole building was of rughám gypsum and in the process of decay it has become white as blocks of ice here and there powdered with snow  on the narrow flat ledge between the western base of this safrá and the eastern side of the bada valley lie masses of ruin now become mere rubbish bits of wall built with cut stone and waterconduits of fine mortar containing like that of the pyramids powdered brick and sometimes pebbles we carried off a lump of sandstone bearing unintelligible marks possibly intended for a man and a beast we called it st george and the dragon but the former is afootpossibly the bedawin stole his steed there was a frustum or columndrum of fine white marble hollowed to act as a mortar like the moslem headstone of the same material it is attributed to the jebel ellauz where ancient quarries are talked of there were also makrákah rubstones of closegrained red syenite and fragments of the basalt handmills used for quartzgrinding part of a mortar was found made of exceedingly light and porous lava  southeast of the hauteville falls in the now rugged ravine khashm elmuttalí snout of the high town it leads to the apex of the coralline formations scattered over with fragments of gypsum here amorphous there crystalline or talclike and all dazzling white as powdered sugar signs of tent foundations and of buildings appear in impossible places and the heights bear two burj or watchtowers one visible afar and dominating from its mamelon the whole land the return to the main valley descends by another narrow gorge further to the southeast called shab eldarak or strait of the shield the tall perpendicular and overhanging walls apparently threatening to fall would act testudo to an indian file of warriors high up the right bank of this gut we saw a treetrunk propped against a rock by way of a ladder for the treasureseeker the shabsole is flat with occasional steps and overfalls of rock polished like mirrors by the raintorrents the mouth shows remains of a masonrydam some fourteen feet thick by twentyone long and immediately below it are the bases of buildings and watercourses  walking down the left bank of the great wady and between these secondary gorges that drain the yellow hill we came upon a dwarf mound of dark earth and rubbish this is the siyághah mint and smiths quarter a place always to be sought as balbak and palmyra taught me remains of tall furnaces now level with the ground were scattered about and mr clarke long trained to find antiques brought back the first coins picked up in ancient midian the total gathered here and in other parts of magháir shuayb was 258 of which some two hundred were carried home untouched the rest treated with chloritic and other acids came out well one was a silver oval which may or may not have been a token eleven were thick discs differing from the normal type unfortunately the legends are illegible the rest inform bits of green stuff copper and bronze were glued together by decay and apparently eaten out of all semblance of money until the verdigris of ages is removed  all are cast like the roman as before bc 217 and some show the tail the distinguishing feature is the human eye not the outa of horusen38 so well known to those who know the pyramids but the last trace of athenes profile two are roman a nerva with sc on the reverse and a claudius augustus bearing by way of countermark a depressed oblong of 20100 by 14100 of inch with a raised figure erect draped and holding a sceptre or thyrsus there is also a constantius struck at antioch the gem of the little collection was a copper coin thinly encrusted with silver proving that even in those days the midianites produced smashers similarly the egyptian miners did the pharaoh by inserting lead into hollowed gold the obverse shows the owl in low relief an animal rude as any counterfeit presentment of the greek words ever found in troy it has the normal olivebranch but without the terminating crescent which however is not invariably present on the proper right whilst the left shows a poor imitation of the legend greek word    nh the silvering of the reverse has been so corroded that no signs of the goddesss galeated head are visible my friend mr w e hayns of the numismatic society came to the conclusion that it is a barbaric midianitish imitation of the greek tetradrachm which in those days had universal currency like the shilling and the franc the curious bits of metal which also bear the owl may add to our knowledge of the nabathaean coins first described i believe by the learned duc de luynesen39  another interesting find was a flatbottomed thickwalled clay crucible of small size 2 1016 inches high by 2 416 inches across the mouth exactly resembling the article picked up at hamámát the latter however contains a remnant of litharge possibly showing that the old egyptians worked the silver which may have been supplied by the colorado quartz  i would here crave leave to make a short excursus to the ancient ophirs of egypt proper where we are told by an inscription in the treasury of ramses the great fourteen centuries before christ the gold and silver mines yielded per annum a total of 32000000 minæ  £90000000 dr h brugschbey first drew attention to hamámát where as he had learned from diodorus i 49iii 12 and from the papyri the precious metals had been extensively worked the wells of hamamat lie between keneh on the nile and kusayr cosseir on the red sea and the land is held by the abábdah arabs who have taken charge from time immemorial of the rich commercial caravans the formation of the country much resembles that of midian and the metalliferous veins run from northeast to southwest in arabia however the filons are of unusual size in africa they are small the terminating fibrils as it were of the asiatic focus while the dark continent lacks that wealth of iron which characterizes the opposite coast  by the courtesy of generals stone and purdy i was enabled after return to cairo in may 1878 to inspect the collection admirably arranged in order of place and poor as well disposed it is nevertheless useful to students and it was most interesting to us the only novelty is asbestos produced in the schist the raw material is now imported by the united states and used for a variety of purposes it is said to exist in mount sinai we found none in midian where the schist formations are of great extent probably because we did not look for it the collection was made by colonel colston and mr l h mitchell a mining engineer attached to the egyptian staff spent several weeks spalling sundry tons of quartz after finding a speck of gold the work was considered to be done general stone however sensibly deprecated any attempt to exploit the minerals the country lacks wood and water and the expense of cameltransport from hamámát to kusayr and thence in ships to suez would swallow up all the profits  that egypt was immensely rich in old days we know from several sources appian tells us that the treasury of ptolemy philadelphus contained 740000 talents and assuming with ebersen40 the egyptian at half the Æginetan we have the marvellous sum of £83250000 according to diodorus i 62 the treasury of rhampsinit concerning which herodotus ii 121 122 heard a funny story from his interpreter contained 4000000 talents equal to at least £450000000 this rich kings treasurehouse has been found portrayed in the farfamed temple of medinat habú the mass of wealth gold silver copper and spices is enormous and while the baser metals are in bars the precious are stored in heaps sacks and vases  the goldmines of the old coptosplain the modern kobt south of keneh are preserved to all time by the earliest known map it has survived whilst those of the milesian anaximander bc 610 547 of hekataeus ob bc 4 76 also from miletus and called the father of geography ebers and of ptolemy the pelusian are irretrievably lost a papyrus in the turin museum contains a plan of the mineral region spoken of in two stel those of radesiyyah and kuban describing the supply of drinkingwater introduced into the desert between kuban and the red sea chabasen41 has published a coloured facsimile of this map the goldcontaining mountains are tinted red and the words tu en nub mons aureus are written over them in hieratics  the only modern goldworkings of egypt are in the mudíriyyat nomos of famaka the frontier town better known as fayzoghlú from its adjacent heights the washings were visited lately march 1878 by my enterprising friend dr p matteucci and m gessi in old days this local cayenne had a very bad name convicts were deported here with a frightful mortality it is still a station for galleyslaves and it has a considerable garrison but we no longer hear of an abnormal fatality the surface was much turned over by the compulsory miners and european geologists and experts were sent to superintend them at last the diggings did not pay and were abandoned but the natives do by rule of thumb despite their ignorance of mineralogy without study of ground and lacking coordination of labour what the government failed to do they have not struck the chief vein if any exist but during the heavy rains of the kharif autumn in the valley of the túmát river herds of slaves are sent yearly to wash gold and they find sufficient to supply the only known coinbars or ingots  beyond the siyághah the left bank is gashed by the ravines draining the southeastern prolongation of the yellow hill water cuts through this rotten formation of rubbish like a knife into cheese forming deep chasms here narrow there broad with walls built up as it were of fragments and ready to be levelled by the first rains the lines of street and the outlines of tenements can be dimly traced while revetments of rounded boulders show artificial watercourses and defences against the now driedup stream the breadth of this the eastern settlement varies with the extent of the ledge between the gypsumhills and the sandy wady the length may be a kilometre the best preserved traces of crowded building end with the southeastern spur of the jebel elsafrá beyond them is a huge cemetery the ancient graves are pits in the ground a few still uncovered the many yawning wide and all of them ignoring orientation those of the moderns on the contrary front towards meccah the bedawin of this country seem ever to prefer for their last homes the most ancient sites they place the body in a pit covered with a large slab or a heap of stones but they never fill in the hollow as is usual among moslems with earth the arrangements suit equally well the hyena and the skullcollector and thus i was able to make a fair collection of bedawi crania  at the southeastern end of the outliers projected by the jebel elsafrá where a gentle slope of red earth falls towards the valleybank is the only group of building of which any part is still standing the site may be old but the present ruins are distinctly mediæval dating probably from the days of the egyptian mameluke sultans beginning from below and to the southwest is a hauz or cistern measuring twentysix by nineteen and a half metres with a depth of nine to ten feet the material is cut sandstone cemented outside with mortar containing the normal brickcrumbs and pebbles and inside mixed with mud at the northeastern and southwestern corners are retaining buttresses in two steps exactly like those in the inland fort of elwijh at the two other angles are flights of stairs and the sole is a sheet of dried silt to the southeast lies the remnant of a small circular furnace and on the northnortheast a broken wall shows where stood the bayt elsaghir or smaller reservoir a narrow conduit of cut stone leads with elaborate zigzags towards two sakiyah drawwells hollowed in the gypsum the southern an oval of five metres ten centimetres is much dilapidated and its crumbling throat is spanned by a wornout arch of the surrounding secondary rock close to the northwest is the other revetted with cut stone and measuring six metres in diameter it is an elaborate affair with a pointed arch and a regular keystone circular sadúd or walls for supporting the haulingapparatus and minor reservoirs numbering three on a detached hillock a few paces to the north stands the fort which defended the establishment the short walls of the parallelogram measure fifteen metres forty centimetres and the long eighteen metres sixty centimetres the gate choked by ruins leads to a small hall with a masked entrance opening to the right there is a narrow room under the stone steps to the west and two others occupy the eastern side this fort is to be restored for the better protection of pilgrims and shortly after our departure an egyptian engineer sulayman effendi came from suez to inspect and report upon it  according to local modern tradition this scatter of masonry was the original site of the settlement called after the builder bir elsaidánithe well of saídán for watering each caravan the proprietor demanded a camel by way of fee at last a maghribí that is a magician refused to part betook himself to the present camping ground sank pits and let loose the copious springs the old wells then dried up and the new sources gave to this section of the great wady afál its actual name wady elbadáof the innovation so hateful to the conservative savage hence rüppells beden which would mean an ibex  on the opposite or right bank of the broad and sandy bed the traces of ancient buildings extend to a far greater distance at least to two kilometres they have been a continuous line of forts cisterns and tenements still marked out by the bases of long thick walls the material is mostly gypsum leprouswhite as the skin of gehazi but here and indeed generally throughout midian the furious torrents uncontrolled during long ages by the hand of man have swept large gaps in the masses of homestead and public buildings again the ruins of this section are distributable into two kindsthe city of the living and the city of the dead  the former of considerable extent hugs the watercourse and crowns all the natural spurs that buttress the bed beginning from the north lie two blocks of building considerable in extent the southern called by the arabs elmalká is a broken parallelogram further down stream the bank is a vast strew of broken pottery and one place covered with glass fragments was named by our soldiers elkhammárahthe tavern or the hotel as in ancient etruria so here the people assemble after heavy rains to pick up what luck throws in the way it is said that they often gather gold pieces square as well as round bearing by way of inscription prayers to the apostle of allah some of us however had a shrewd suspicion that the tibr or pure golddust is still washed from the sands and cast probably in rude moulds  behind inland or westward of this southern town lies the city of the dead unlike the pitted graveyard to the northeast the cemetery is wholly composed of catacombs which the bedawin call magháir caves or bíbán doors the sites are the sides and mouths of four little branchvalleys which cut through the hillocks representing the wadybank the northernmost is known as wady elkhurayk because it drains a height of that name the others bear the generic term wady elsafrá so called like the hauteville hill from the tawnyyellow colour of the rocks the catacombs fronting in all directions because the makers were guided by convenience not by ceremonial rule are hollowed in the soft new sandstone underlying the snowy gypsum and most of the façades show one or more horizontal lines of natural beadwork rolled pebbles disposed parallelly by the natural action of water in the most ruinous the upper layer is a cornice of hard sandstone stained yellow with iron and much creviced the base a soft conglomerate of the same material is easily corroded and the supernal part caves in upon the principle which is destroying niagara at each side of the doorways is a mastabah stone bench also rockhewn and with triple steps the doorjambs which have hollowings for hinges and holes for bars are much worn and often broken they are rarely inclined inwards after the fashion of egypt a few have windows or rather portholes flanking the single entrance the peculiarities and the rare ornaments will be noticed when describing each receptacle taken as a whole they are evidently rude and barbarous forms of the artistic catacombs and towertombs that characterize petra and palmyra  the magháir may roughly be divided into four topical groups these arethe northern outliers the tombs of the kings so called by ourselves because they distinguish themselves from all the others the buttressed caves two sets and the southern outliers the first mentioned begin with a ruin on the right jaw of the khurayk gorge it is dug in strata dipping as usual from northwest to southeast it faces eastward and the entrance declines to the south all external appearance of a catacomb has disappeared a rude porch a frame of sticks and boughs like the thatched eaves of a bulgarian hut stands outside while inside signs of occupation appear in hearths and goatdung in smoky roof and in rubbishstrewn floor over another ruin to the west are graffiti of which copies from squeezes and photographs are here given there are two loculi in the southern wall and in the southeastern corner is a pit also sunk for a sarcophagus a hillside to the south of this cave shows another dug in the tauá or coloured sandstone and apparently unfinished part of it is sanded up and its only yield an egyptian oiljar of modern make probably belonged to some pilgrim crossing the second dwarf gorge we find on the right bank a third large ruin of at least fourteen loculi the hard upper reef dipping at an angle of 30 degrees and striking from northwest to southeast fell in when the soft base was washed away by weather and the anatomy of the graves is completely laid bare higher up the same wady is a fourth maghárah also broken down the stuccocoating still shows remnants of red paint and the characters possibly arab wasm or tribemarksare cut into an upright entrancestone  the precipitous left bank of the third gorge contains the three finest specimens which deserve to be entitled the tombs of the kings of these the two facing eastward are figured by rüppell p 220 in the antiquated style of his day with fanciful foreground and backgrounden42 his sketch also places solid rock where the third and very dilapidated catacomb of this group disposed at right angles fronts southwards possibly the façades may once have been stuccoed and coloured now they show the bare and pebblebanded sandstone  the southernmost which may be assumed as the type has an upright door flanked by a stone bench of three steps over the entrance is a defaced ornament which may have been the bust of a man in rüppell it is a kind of geometrical design the frontage has two parallel horizontal lines raised to represent cornices each bears a decoration resembling crenelles or oriental ramparts broken into three steps the lower set numbers eight including the half ornaments at the corners and the higher seven the interior is a mixture of upright recesses probably intended for the gods or demons and of horizontal loculi whose grooves show that they had lids there is no symmetry in the niches in the sarcophagi or in the paths and passages threading the graves the disposition will best be understood from the groundplans drawn by the young egyptian officers their sketches of the façades are too careless and incorrect for use but the want is supplied by the photographs of m lacaze  above these three tombs of the kings are many rockcavities which may or may not have been sepulchral time has done his worst with them we mounted the background of a quoinshaped hill by a welltrodden path leading to the remnants of a rude burj watchtower and to a semicircle of dry wall garnished with a few sticks for hanging rags and tatters the latter denotes the musallat shuayb or prayingplace of prophet jethro and here our sayyid and our shaykh took the opportunity of applying for temporal and eternal blessings the height at the edge of the precipice which cliffing to the north showed a view of our camp and of yubú and shushú islands was in round numbers 450 feet aner 29402894 from this vantageground we could distinctly trace the line of the wady makná beginning in a round basin at the western foot of the northern shigd mountain and its subrange while low rolling hills along which we were to travel separated it from the wady badaafál to the south  two other important sets of catacombs which i will call the buttressed caves are pierced in the right flank of the same gorge at the base of a little conical hill quaintly capped with a finial of weathered rock the material is the normal silicious gravelgrit traversed and cloisonné by dykes of harder stone beginning at the south we find a range of three facing eastward and separated from one another by flying buttresses of natural rock no 1 has a window as well as a door next to it is a square with six open loculi ranged from north to south no 3 shows a peculiaritytwo small pilasters of the rudest egyptian doric the only sign of ornamentation found inside the tombs a small break in the southwestern wall connects it with the northernmost loculus of no 2 furthest north are three bevelholes noting the beginning of a catacomb and round the northern flank of the detached cone are six separate caves all laid waste by the furious northern gales  the second set is carved in the bluff eastern end of an adjoining reef that runs away from the wady it consists of four sepulchres with the normal buttresses they somewhat resemble those of the kings but there are various differences no 2 from the south is flanked by pilasters with ramshorn capitals barbarous forms of ionic connected by three sets of triglyphs the pavement is of slabs there is an inner niche and one of the corners has apparently been used as an oven on a higher plane lies a sunken tomb with a deep drop and footholes by way of ladder outside it the rocky platform is hollowed apparently for graves the other three facades bear the crenelle ornaments the two to the north show double lines of seven holes drilled deep into the plain surface above the door as if a casing had been nailed on while the northernmost yielded a fragmentary inscription on the southern wall these are doubtless the inscribed tablets on which the names of kings are engraved alluded to in the jihannumá of haji khahífahen43 rounding the reef to the north we found three catacombs in the worst condition one of them showed holes drilled in the façade  the southern outliers lie far down the wady afál facing east and hewn in the left flank of a dwarf gulley which falls into the right bank not far from the site called by our men the tavern the group numbers three all cut in the normal sandstone with the harder dykes which here stand up like ears the principal item is the upper cave small square and apparently still used by the arabs in the middle of the lintel is a lump looking like the mutilated capital of a column the two lower caves show only traces  there is a tradition that some years ago a frank rüppell after removing his arab guides dug into the tombs and found nothing but human hair several of the horizontal loculi contained the bones of men and beasts i did not disturb them as all appeared to be modern the floors sounding hollow gave my companions hopes of finds but i had learned after many a disappointment how carefully the bedawi ransack such places we dug into four sepulchres including the sunken catacomb and the southern inscribed tomb usually six inches of flooring led to the groundrock in the sarcophagi about eight inches of tamped earth was based upon nine feet of sand that ended at the bottom the only results were mouldering bones bits of marble and pottery and dry seeds of the kaff maryam the rose of jericho anastatica which here feeds the partridges and which in egypt supplies children with medicine and expectant mothers with a charm as the plant is bibulous opening to water and even to the breath it is placed by the couch and its movement shows what is to happen the cave also yielded specimens of bats rhinopoma macrophyllum with fat at the root of their spiky tails  i have described at considerable length this ruined madiáma which is evidently the capital of madyan proper ranking after petra in one point it is still what it was a chief station upon the highway then nabatí now moslem which led to the ghor or wady elarabah but in

kindly drew my attention to an interesting passage in his work and was good enough to copy for me the source of his information tile harris papyrus no 1 in the british museum  the first king of the twentieth dynasty born about bc 1200 and residing at thebes was rameses iii whose title ramessu panuter or nuti ramses the god became in the hands of the greeks rhampsinitos this great prince ascending the throne in evil days applied himself at once to the internal and external economy of his realm he restored the castedivisions and carried fire and sword into the lands of his enemies he transported many captives to egypt fortified his eastern frontier and built in the gulf of suez a fleet of large and small ships in order to traffic with pun and the holy landen46 and to open communication with the incensecountry and with the wealthy shores of the indian ocean  not less important says our author p 594 for egypt which required before all things the copper applied to every branch of her industry was the sending of commissioners by land on donkey back and by sea to explore and exploit the rich cupriferous deposits of atháka in the neighbourhood of the akabah gulf this metal with the glance of gold was there cast in brickshape and was transported by sea to the capital  the king also restored his attention to the treasures of the sinaitic peninsula which had excited the concupiscence of the egyptians since the days of king senoferuen47 bc 3700 loaded with rich presents for the sanctuary of the goddess hathor the protectress of mafkaland chosen employés were despatched on a royal commission to the peninsula for the purpose of supplying the pharaohs treasury with the highly prized bluegreen copperstones mafka turkisenen48  these lines were published by dr brugschbey before he had heard of my discoveries of metals and of a modern turquoisedigging in the land of midian he had decided that atháka lay to the east of suez chiefly from the insistence laid upon the shipping seagoing craft would certainly not be required for a sail of three or four hours moreover as i have elsewhere shown jebel atakáh the mountain of deliverance at the mouth of the wady musá was referred to the jews at some time after the christian era and probably during the fourth and fifth centuries when pilgrimages to the apocryphal mounts sinai became the fashion  during the summer of 1877 dr brugschbey was kind enough to copy and to translate the original document upon which he founded his short account of the atháka coppermines i offer it to the reader in full  the order of the alphabet is that adopted by dr brugschbey it relies for the first letter upon the authority of plutarch who asserts that the egyptian abecedarium numbered the square of five twentyfive and that it opened with greek which also expresses the god thoththis is the case with hieroglyph the leaf of some waterplant the sequence of the letters has been suggested by a number of minor considerations we begin with the vowels and proceed to the labial the liquids and so forthen49  the sense of the highly interesting inscription in its english order would be  i have sent my commissioners to the land atháka to the thoseen50 great mines of copper or coppersen51 which are in this place atháka and their ie the commissioners shipsen52 were loaded carrying them the metals

through abú ikrimah maulá bilál bin elháris elmuzni had averred the apostle of allah upon whom be peace enfeoffed the said bilál with a bit of ground containing a mountain and a gold mine that the sons of bilál sold part of the grant to one umar bin abd elazíz when a gold mine or according to others two gold mines were found in it that they said to the buyer verily we sold to thee land for cultivation and we did not sell thee gold miningground that they brought the letter of the apostle upon whom be peace in a bound volume that umar kissed it and rubbed it upon his eyes and said of a truth let me see what hath come out of it the mine and what i have laid out upon it then he deducted from them the expenses of working and returned to them the surplus    and i was told by musab

which is probably compiled from elkazwíní says sub voce madyan after giving the movement of the word it is a city of the tribe of shuayb opposite tabúk and upon the sea of elkulzum six stages maráhil separating the two it is larger than tabúk and in it is the well whence moses watered the flocks of shuayb finally it repeats that madyan is under the district of tabariyyá or tiberiasen79 vol iii p 64 edidit t g j juynboll lugduni batavorum 1854 e duobus codd mss  i conclude this unpopular chapter with some remarks by dr badger concerning the apparent connection of jethro and elmedínahen80 it struck me when studying madyan which is the name of a place as well as of a manen81 that yáthrib the ancient term of almadínah might have served the same double purpose at all events it was singular to find a yáthrib somewhere near madyan and that the word was not far removed from the hebrew yithro the name given in hebrew to moses midianite fatherinlaw i also note that the septuagint renders the hebrew yithro by greek peshito by arabic yathrûn which the new arabic version of the bible published at bairut syria follows making it arabic yáthrûn the name in hebrew exod iv 18 is also written hebrew yether  my theory is this firstly there is no dependence to be placed on the masoretic points especially when affixed to names of places secondly we have no certain knowledge of the language used by the midianites in those ancient times their territory extended northwards towards palestine and from their very intimate relations with the israelites as friends and as enemies both nations appear to have understood each other perfectly may not their language then have been a dialect of the arameanen82 if so the hebrew yithro of the bible might have been hebrew yithrab yathrib etc instances of the apocopated hebrew   b are common in the chaldean or syrochaldaic at the present day eg arabic yáheb alaha is pronounced yáualaha arabic yashuáyaheb becomes yashuáyau etc the final beth arabic b or the arabic heb being converted into a arabic w hence why may not hebrew yithro have been originally hebrew yithrab or yathrib of course this is only a conjecture of mine  mr e stanley poole loc cit says that the arabs dispute whether the name medyen be foreign or arabic and whether medyen spoke arabic he considers the absurd enumeration of the alphabetical kings elmasúdi quoted above to be curious as possibly containing some vague reference to the language of midian when these kings are said contemporaneously to have ruled over meccah western nejd yemen medyen egypt etc it is extremely improbable that midian ever penetrated into yemen notwithstanding the hints of arab authors to the contrary yákút elhamawi born ah 574 or 575  ad 117879 and died ah 626  ad 1228 in the mujam elbuldán cited in the journ of the deutsch morgen gesellschaft declares that a south arabic dialect is of midian and elmasúdi apud schultens pp 158159 inserts a midianite king among the rulers of yemen the latter however is more probable than the former it may be an accidental and individual not a material occurrence  the following list of ruins some cities others towns were all with two

between the two hills elrakhamatayn and at sundry other places which we were unable to visit beyond the hisma i also collected notices of elkaráyyá large ruins first alluded to by wallin p 316en84  during our exploration of the region below elmuwaylah my southern midian and our cruise to elhaura the following sites were either seen or reported  1 ruins in the wady dukhán south of the wady

zulmarwah of bilázurí extensive remains of buildings a huge reef of quartz carefully worked and smaller ruins further down the valley  14 the classical temple or tomb on the left bank of the great wady hamz dividing southern midian from elhejaz in the turkish dominions  15 large remains in two divisions at elhauráen85  concerning the ateliers details will be found in the following pages many of them suggest a kind of compromise between the camps and settlements of the stone age where eg at pressigny and grimes graves the only remnant of man is a vast strew of worked silexes and the wandering fraternity of freemasons who hutted themselves near the work in hand and i would here lay special stress upon my suspicion that the ancestors of the despised hutaym may have been the gypsycaste that worked the metals in midian  for the date of the many ruins which stud the country i will assume empirically that their destruction is coeval with that of the christian churches in negeb or the south countryen86 that adjoins midian proper on the northwest it may date from either the invasion of khusrau anúshírawán the conquering sassanian king chosroes ad 531579 or from the expedition sent by the caliph omar and his successors beginning in ad 651 but as will appear in the course of these pages there was a second destruction and that evidently dates from the early sixteenth century when sultán selim laid out his maritime road for the hajjcaravan before that time the egyptian caravans as will be seen marched inland and often passed from midian to elhijr                                 chapter v          work at and excursions from magháir shuayb    by the blessing of nebi shuayb and a glance from his eyrie i at once suspected that the western shigd was the mountain on a mountain alluded to by haji walien87 and on january 12 1878 i ascertained that such was the case the old man had given me a handsketch of the most artless showing a gorge between two rocks a hill of two stages to the left or west and a couple of wadys draining it to the sea one wady makná trending northwest and the other wady afál southwest the word ishmah affixed to the northern part of the route is evidently the hismá plateau and not as i had supposed it to be the jebel tayyib ism  nor had we any difficulty in discovering haji walis tree a solitary mimosa to the right of the caravantrack springing from the sands of the shigdawayn gorge the latter is formed by the sisterblocks before alluded to the western shigd on the right of the wady afál is composed of carbonate of lime and sandstones dyed with manganese the whole resting upon a core of grey granite the formation is the same as the eastern feature but the lines of the latter are gentler and the culminating tower is wanting  the western shigd indeed is sufficiently peculiar it is the southern apex of a short range numbering some four heads the eastern flank discharges the wady kizáz which feeds the afál and the western the wady makná the summit of the broken and spiny cone is a huge perpendicular block apparently inaccessible as a tower and composed of the dull yellow ferruginous conglomerate called elsafrá the tint contrasts strongly with a long line of bright white rugham gypsum bisecting the head of the wady makná below the apex is a thick stratum of manganesestained rock the upper line with a dip of 15 deg towards the main valley looks much like a row of bulwarks which had slipped from the horizontal while still bluff between the northeast and east indeed the shape is so regular that m lacaze at first sight asked if it was une construction  as soon as the washingtrough was brought up from sharmá we opened operations by digging a trench at least twelve feet deep in the reentering angle of the bed close to the mimosa tree the sand pink above and chloritic yellow below ended in a thick bed of waterrolled pebbles not in groundrock nor did it show the couch of excellent clay which usually underlies the surface and which i have said is extracted through pits to make sundried brick swish and other building materials we also secured some of the bloodred earth from the eastern tail of the northern shigh the manganesestained tauá and the gravelly sand washed out of the cascalhogravel the latter very promising the result of our careless working however was not successful the normal ilmenite black sand of magnetic iron took the place of golddust and this unlookedfor end again made us suspicious of my old friends proceedings the first occasion was that of his notable malingering had he bought a pinch of tibr pure gold from the bedawin and mixed it with the handful of surface stuff  had the assayer at alexandria played him a trick  or had an exceptionally heavy torrent really washed down auriferous tailings i willingly believe the latter to have been the case and we shall presently see it is within the range of possibility traces of gold were found by lieutenantcolonel w a ross through his pyrological process in the sandy clays brought from the mouth of wady makná  meanwhile despite our magnificent offers the arabs managed to keep inviolate their secretif they had one an old man now a rich merchant and householder at suez had repeatedly declared to mr a g k levick that in his young days the bedawin washed gold in midian till the industry fell into disrepute during my last visit he was unfortunately absent upon a pilgrimage after our return he asserted that he had sent for specimens of the sand but that it paid too little even for transport this abd elhámid elshámi interviewed after our return by mr clarke declared more than once and still declares that many years ago he obtained from the wady zibá behind the settlement a certain quantity of reddish sand which appeared auriferous he roasted and washed the contents of three small baskets called coffasen88 by europeans and this yielded a pinch of what looked like pure gold  in camp our men spoke freely of tibr stored in quills carried behind the ear and sold at sueznot at cairo for fear of consequences yet neither promises nor bribes would persuade the poorest to break through the rule of silence the whole might have been a canard on the other hand there was also a valid reason for reticence the open mouth would not long have led to a sound throat so our many informants contented themselves with telling us frequent tales of gold ornaments picked up after rain they showed us a ring made from a bit found on the tabúk road and they invariably assure us that we shall find wondrous thingsabout the next station  at magháir shuayb we wasted a whole fortnight january 1124 1878 in vain works and i afterwards bitterly repented that the time had not been given to south midian yet the delay was pleasant enough after the month which is required to acquire or to recover the habit of tentlife the haltingday was mostly spent as follows at six am and somewhat later on cold mornings the boruji sounds his réveillékum yá habíbí sáh elnaum rise friend sleep is done as the egyptian officers interpret the call a curious business he makes of it when his fingers are half frozen yet bugler mersál abú dunya is a man of ambition who persistently and despite the coarse laughter of europeans repairs for quiet practicing to the bush we drink tea or coffee made by engineer ali marie or by quartermaster yusuf not by europeans two camels supply us with sweet milk butter we have brought and nothing is wanted for complete comfort but bread  we then separate to our work after telling off the quarrymen to their several tasks inveterate idlers and neerdoweels their only object in life is not to labour a dozen of them will pass a day in breaking ten pounds weight of stone they pound in the style of the eastern tobacconist with a very short stroke and a very long stay at last they burst the sieves in order to enjoy a quieter life they will do nothing without superintendence whilst the officer is absent they sit and chat smoke or lie down to rest and they are never to be entrusted with a waterskin or a bottle of spirits the fellows will station one of their number on the nearest hill whilst their comrades enjoy a sounder sleep they are the greatest of cowards and yet none would thus have acted sentinel even in the presence of the enemy these useful articles all expect a liberal bakhshísh when the journey is done with the usual asiatic feeling they know that they deserve nothing but my dignity obliges me to largess on this occasion it did not  those told off to dig prefer to make a deep pit because fewer can work together at it rather than scrape off and sift the two feet of surface which yield antíkas they rob what they can every scrap of metal stylus manilla or ring is carefully tested scraped broken or filed in order to see whether it be gold punishment is plentifully administered but in vain we cannot even cure their unclean habits of washing in and polluting the fountain source three europeans would easily do the work of these thirty poor devils  mr clarke is our campmanager in general he is also our jäger he shoots the wild poultry duck and partridge sandgrouse and bob white the quail for half our dinners and the arabs call him the angel of death belonging to the birds he failed to secure a noble eagle in the wady afál whose nest was built upon an inaccessible cliff he described the bird as standing as high as our table and with a width of six to seven feet from wing to wing he also brought tidings of a large horned owl possibly the same species as the fine bird noted at sinai the arabs call it classically búmah and vulgarly umm kuwayk mother of squeaking the fellahin believe that it sucks out childrens eyes and hence their name massásah here as in the sinaitic peninsula the owl and the hyena are used as charms and the burnt feathers of the former and the boiled flesh of the latter superior filth are considered as infallible specifics for numerous disorders in other parts of arabia the hooting of the owl portends death and the cry fátfát is interpreted he is gone gone  the two staffofficers make plans and sketches of the new places or they protract their fieldbooks working very hard and very slowly i have but little confidence in their routesurveys sights are taken from muleback and distances are judged by the eye true the protractions come out well but this is all the worse suggesting the process commonly called doctoring for the style of thing however dead reckoning did well enough  m lacaze is the most ardent accompanied by his favourite orderly salámat elnahhás an intelligent negro from dárfor he sets out after breakfast with a bit of bread a flagon of water a tentumbrella and his tools which he loses with remarkable punctuality to spend the whole day sketching painting and photographing m philipin is our useful man he superintends the washingcradle he wanders far and wide gun in hand bringing us specimens of everything that strikes the eye and he is great at his forge the bedawin sit for hours gazing attentively as he converts a file into a knife and illustrating the reverence with which in early days men regarded vulcan and wayland smith  at eleven am the bugle sounds tijrí taakul run and feed a signal for déjeuner à la fourchette it is a soup a stew and a puláo pilaff of rice and meat sheep or goat the only provisions that poor midian can afford accompanied by onions and garlic which are eaten like apples washed down with bon ordinaire followed by cheese when we have it and ending with tea or coffee george the cook proves himself an excellent man when deprived of oil and undemoralized by contact with his fellow greeks after feeding the idlers who have slumbered or rather have remained in bed between eight pm and six to seven am generally manage a couple of hours siesta loudly declaring that they have been wide awake one of the party seems to live by the blessing of him who invented sleep and he is always good for half of the twentyfour hourshow they must envy him whose unhappy brains can be stupefied only by poisonous chloral  at two pm after drinking tea or coffee once more we proceed to another four hours spell of work as sunset and the cold hours draw near all assemble about the fire generally two or three huge palm trunks whose blaze gladdens the soul of the lonely nightsentinel and assembling the shaykhs of the arabs we gather from them information geographical historical and ethnological the amount of invention of pure fancy of airy lying is truly sensational while at the same time they conceal from us everything they can and more especially everything we most wish to know firstly they do not want us to spy out the secrets of the land and secondly they count upon fleecing us through another season during the whole day but notably at this hour we have the normal distractions of the arabian journey one man brings and expects bakhshísh for a bit of broken metal or some ridiculous stone another grumbles for meat and a third wants tobacco medicine or something to be had for the asking i am careful to pay liberally as by so doing the country is well scoured  dinner at seven pm is a copy of what was served before noon it is followed by another sitting round the fire which is built inside the mess tent when cold compels at times the conversation lasts till midnight and when cognac or whisky is plentiful i have heard it abut upon the battle of waterloo and the immortality of the soul piquet and écarté are reserved for life on board ship our only reading consists of newspapers which come by camel post every three weeks and a few tauchnitz often odd volumes i marvel as much as hamlet ever did to see the passionate influence of the storyteller upon those fullgrown children bearded men to find them in the midst of this wild new nature so utterly absorbed by the fictitious weal and woe of some poor creature of the authors brain that they neglect even what they call their meals  allow their teas to cool and strain their eyesight poring over page after page in the dim light of a rusty lantern thus also the egyptian after sitting in his café with all his ears and eyes opened their widest whilst the storyteller drones out the old tale of abú zayd will dispute till midnight and walk home disputing about what under such and such circumstances they themselves would have done to me the main use of tauchnitz was to make arabia appear the happier by viewing from the calm vantageground of the desert the meanness and the littlenesses of civilized lifein novels  the marchingday is only the haltingday in movement by seven am in winter and four am in spring we have breakfasted and are ready to mount mule or dromedary more generally however we set out accompanied by the sayyid and the shaykhs for a morning walk the tents and most important of all the tenttable are left to follow under the charge of the egyptian officers who allow no dawdling with us are the cook and the two bodyservants riding of course they carry meat drink and tobacco in my big tin cylinder intended to collect plants and they prefer to give us cold whilst we fight for hot breakfasts after resting between ten am and noon in some shady spot generally under a thorn we ride on to the campingground which we reach between two and three pm this is the worst part of the day for man and beast especially for the muleshence the necessity of early rising  the average work rarely exceeds six hours  eighteen to twenty miles even this if kept up day after day is hard labour for our montures venerable animals whose chests galled by the breaststraps show that they have not been broken to the saddle accustomed through life to ply in a state of semisomnolence between cairo and the citadel they begin by proving how unintelligent want of education can make one of the most intelligent of beasts they trip over every pebble and are almost useless on rough and broken ground they start and swerve at a man a tree a rock a distant view or a glimpse of the sea they will not leave one another and they indulge their pet dislikes this shies at a camel that kicks at a dog presently tamaddun as the arabs say urbanity or more literally being citified asserts itself as in the human cockney and at last they become cleverer and more knowing than any countrybred they climb up the ladders of stone with marvellous caution and slip down the slopes of sand on their haunches they round every rathole which would admit a hoof and they know better than we do where water is they are not always well treated the galloping griff is amongst us who enjoys lambing and bucketing even a halfdonkey of course the more sensible animal of the two is knocked up whilst the rider assumes the airs of one versed in the haute école the only difficulty by no fault of the mules was the matter of irons shoeless they could travel only in sand and as has been said the farrier was forgotten  amongst our recreant shaykhs i must not include furayj bin rafía elhuwaytí a man of whom any tribe might be proud and a living proof that the bedawi may still be a true gentleman a short figure meagre of course as becomes the denizen of the desert but hard as nails he has straight comely features a clean dark skin and a comparatively full beard already like his hair waxing white although he cannot be fortyfive a bullet in the back and both hands distorted by sabrecuts attempts at assassination due to his own kin do not prevent his using sword gun and pistol he is the agíd of the tribe the african captain of war as opposed to the civil authority the shayhk and to the judicial the kázi at first it is somewhat startling to hear him prescribe a slit weasand as a cure for lying yet he seems to be known loved and respected by all around him including his hereditary foes the maázah he is the only bedawi in camp who prays naturally he is a genealogist rich in local lore he counteracts all the intrigues by which that ratfaced little rascal shaykh hasan elukbi tries to breed mischief between friends he is a walking map it would be easy to draw up a rude plan of the country from his information he does not know hours and miles but he can tell to a nicety the comparative length of a march and when ignorant he has the courage to say madri dont know he never asked me for anything nor told a lie nor even hid a waterhole willing and ready to undertake the longest march the hardest work his word is házirim hereand he will even walk to mount a tired man seated upon his loudvoiced little hijnen89 remarkable because it is of the noble bishári strain bred between the nile and the red sea he is ever the guide in chief at last it ends with nádi shaykh furayjcall shaykh furayjwhen anything is to be done to be explained to be discovered i would willingly have recommended him for the chieftainship of his tribe but he is not wealthy he wisely prefers to see the dignity in the hands of his cousin alayán who bytheby is helpless without him he remained with us to the end he seemed to take a pride in accompanying the expedition by sea to elhaurá and by land to the wady hamz far beyond the limits of his tribe when derided for mounting a pair of government bluchers tied over bare feet with bits of glaring tasselstring from his camelsaddle he quoted the proverb whoso liveth with a people forty days becomes of them we parted after the most friendly adieu or rather au revoir and he was delighted with some small gifts of useful weaponsi wonder whether shaykh furayj will prove milk to use sir walter scotts phrase which can stand more than one skimming  in such wild travel the travellers comfort depends mainly upon weather usually the air of magháir shuayb was keen pure and invigorating with a distinct alternation of landbreeze by night and of seabreeze by day nothing could be more charming than the flushing of the mountains at sunrise and sunset and the magnificence of the windy wintry noon the rocky spires pinnacles and domes glowing with gorgeous golden light and the lower ranges shaded with hazy blue umberred and luminous purple fell into picture and formed prospects indescribably pure and pellucid but the average of the aneroid 2919 gave an altitude of eight hundred feet and even in this submaritime region the minimum temperature was 42 deg f ranging to a maximum of 85 deg f in the shade these are extremes which the soft egyptian body reared in the house or the hut could hardly support  darwaysh effendi followed suit after yusuf effendi it was a study to see him swathed to the nose bundled in the thickest clothes with an umbrella opened against the sun and with a soldier leading his staid old mule bukhayt ahmar and several of the soldiers were laid up ahmed kaptán was incapacitated for work by an old and inveterate hernia the effect he said of riding his violent little beast and a sound ague and fever which continued three days obliterated in my own case the last evils of karlsbad we had one night of rain january 15 beginning gently at 230 am and ending in a heavy downfallunfortunately a pluviometer was one of the forgotten articles before the shower earth was dry as a bone shortly after it sprouts of the greenest grass began to appear in the low places and under the shadow of the perennial shrubs the cold damp seemed to make even the snakes torpid for the first time in my life i trod upon onea clairvoyante having already warned me against serpents and scorpions there were also bursts of heat ending in the normal three grey days of raw piercing norther and followed by a still warmer spell upon the gulf of elakabah a violent gale was blowing on the whole the winter climate of inland midian is trying and a speedy return to the seaboard air is at times advisable while south midian feels like thebes after cairo the coast climate is simply perfect save and except when elaylí the stormwind from akabat aylah is abroad my meteorological journal was carefully kept despite the imperfection of the instruments mr clarke registered the observations during my illness mr duguid and násir kaptán made simultaneous observations on board the ships and dr maclean kindly corrected the instrumental errors after our return to cairoen90  i had proposed to march upon the hismá or sandy plateau to the east which can be made from magháir shuayb without the mortification of a nakb or ladder of stone thereupon our tagaygáthuwaytát shaykhs and camelmen began to express great fear of the imranhuwaytát refusing to enter their lands without express leave and the presence of a ghafír surety our caravanleader the gallant sayyid at once set off in search of brahim bin makbúl second chief of the imrán and recognized by the egyptian government as the avocat spokesman and diplomatist the liar and intriguer of his tribe this man was found near elhakl hagul two long marches ahead he came in readily enough holding in hand my kerchief as a pledge of protection and accompanied by three petty chiefs musallam sad and muhaysin all with an eye to bakhshísh in fact every nakedfooted cousin a little above the average clansman would call himself a shaykh and claim his musháhirah or monthly pay not a cateran came near us but affected to hold himself dishonoured if not provided at once with the regular salary brahim was wholly beardless and our egyptians quoted their proverb sabáh elkurúd wa lá sabán elajrúdbetter see illomened monkeys in the morning than the beardless man as the corruption of the best turns to the worst so the bedawi a noble race in its own wilds becomes thoroughly degraded by contact with civilization i remember a certain chief of the wuld ali tribe near damascus who was made a freemason at bayrút and the result was that brother mohammed became a model villain  by way of payment for escort and conveyance to the hismá brahim expected a recognition of his claim upon the soil of magháir shuayb which belongs to the wretched masáid he held the true ishmaelitic tenet that as sayyidná our lord Ádam had died intestate so all men arabs have a right to all things provided the right can be established by might hence the saying of the fellah shun the arab and the itch thus encouraged by the shaykhs the dodges of the clansmen became as manifold as they were palpable they wanted us to pay for campingground they complained aloud when we cut a palmfrond for palms or used a rotten fallen trunk for fuel they made their sheep appear fat by drenching them with water the people of the fort elmuwaylah determined not to déroger sent to us for sale the eggs laid by our own fowls and so forth  presently brahim brought in his elder brother khizr bin makbúl about as illconditioned a cuss as himself very dark with the left eye clean gone this worthy appeared pretentiously dressed in the pink of desert fashiona scarlet cloak sheepskinlined and bearing a huge patch of blue cloth between the shoulders a crimson caftan and red morocco boots with irons resembling icecramps at the heels like brahim he uses his bákúr or crooked stick to trace lines and dots upon the ground similarly the yankee whittles to hide the trick that lurks in his eyes khizr tents in the hismá and his manners are wild and rough as his dwellingplace possibly manly brusque certainly like the desert druzes of the jebel haurán he paid his first visit when our shaykhs were being operated upon by the photographer i fancied that such a novelty would have attracted his attention for the moment but no his first question was aysh ujratíwhat is the hire for my camels finally these men threw so many difficulties in our way that i was compelled to defer our exploration of the eastern region to a later day  after a week of washing for metals at magháir shuayb it was time to move further afield on january 17th the egyptian staffofficers rode up the wady afál and beyond the two pyramidal rocks of white stone which have fallen from the towered shigd they found on its right bank the ruins of a small atelier it lies nearly opposite the mouth of the wady tafrígh which is bounded north by a hill of the same name and south by the lesser shigd beyond it comes the wady nimir the broad drain of the jibál elnimir hills of the leopard feeding the afál the upper valley is said to have water and palms after a leg to the northeast 45 deg mag they found the afál running from due north and one hour  three miles led them to other ruins on the eastern side of the low hills that prolong to the north the greater shigd the names of both sites were unknown even to shaykh furayj the foundations of uncut boulders showed a semicircle of buildings measuring 229 paces across the horseshoe they counted eleven tenementsprobably occupied by the slaveowners and superintendentssquares and oblongs separated by intervals of from fortyfive to ninetyseven or a hundred paces on the northnortheast lay the chief furnace a parallelogram of some twentythree paces built of stone and surrounded by scatters of broken white quartz and scoriæ these two workshops seem to argue that the country was formerly much better watered than it is now moreover it convinced me that the only rock regularly treated by the ancients in this region was the metallic marú quartz   i had heard by mere chance of a white mountain at no great distance in the mass of hills bounding to the north the secondary formations of magháir shuayb on january 21st m marie and lieutenant amir were detached to inspect it they were guided by the active furayj and a bedawi lad hamdán of the amírát who on receiving a stone dollar ie silver could not understand its use travelling in a general northern direction the little party reached their destination in about three hours  nine miles they found some difficulty in threading a mile and a quarter of very ugly road a nakb passing through rocks glittering with mica a ladder of stony steps and overfalls with angles and zigzags where camels can carry only halfloads the european dismounted the egyptian who was firm in the saddle rode his mule the whole way we afterwards however explored a comparatively good road viâ the wady murákh to the seaboard which will spare the future metalsmelter much trouble and expense  the quartz mountain is like almost all the others the expanded mushroomlike head of a huge filon or vein and minor filets thread all the neighbouring heights the latter are the foothills of the great jebel zánah a towering dark and domeshaped mass clearly visible from magháir shuayb this remarkable block appeared to me the tallest we had hitherto seen it is probably the tayyibat ism 6000 of the hydrographic chart the travellers ascended the jebel elmarú trembling the while with cold and from its summit some fifteen hundred feet above sealevel they had a grand view of the seaboard and the sea they brought home specimens of the rock and fondly fancied that they had struck gold it was again that abominable crowgold pyrites which has played the unwary traveller so many a foul practical joke  during our stay at magháir shuayb the camp had been much excited by bedawi reports of many marvels in the lands to the north and the northeast the arabs soon learned to think that everything was worth showing they led m lacaze for long miles to a rock where bees were hiving a halfnaked umayri shepherd one suwayd bin saíd had told us of a hajar masdúd closed stone about the size of a tent with another of darker colour set in it the arabs had been unable to break it open but they succeeded with a similar rock in the hismá finding inside only tibn tribulated straw and charcoal another had seen a kidr dahab golden pot in the aligán section of the wady elhakl hagul where it leaves the hismá and a matchlockman had brought down with his bullet a bit of precious metal from the upper part this report prevails in many places it may have come all the way from pharaohs treasury at petra or from the sinaitic wady lejá at the mouth of the latter is the hajar elkidr potrock which every passing arab either stones or strikes with his staff hoping that the mysterious utensil will burst and shed its golden shower moreover a halfwitted maázi by name masáí had tantalized us with a glorious account of the house of antar in the hismá and the cistern where that negro hero and poet used to water his horses near its massive walls rises a hazbah steep and solitary hillock with dims or layers of ashlar atop he had actually broken off a bit of greenstone sticking in the masonry and sold it to a man from tor khwájeh kostantin for a large sumtwo napoleons a new shirt and a quantity of coffee a similar story is found in the bádiyat eltíh the desert north of the sinaitic peninsula at the ruined cairns of kharabat lussán the ancient lysa an arab saw a glimmer of light proceeding from a bit of curiously cut stone this he carried away with him and sold to a christian at jerusalem for three poundsen91  shaykh brahím had also heard of this marvel but he called it the haráb antar ruin of antar and he placed it in the wady elhakl about an hours ride south of the wady afál finally a tablet in the wady hawwayi adorned with a dragon and other animals was reported to me and the memory of inscriptions mentioned in the jihannumá was still importunate evidently all these were mere fancies or at best gross distortions of facts the bedawin repeat them in the forlorn hope of bakhshísh and never expect action to be taken next morning they will probably declare the whole to be an invention yet it is never safe to neglect the cry of wolf our most remarkable discovery the temple at the wady hamz was made when report promised least  accordingly on january 24th i despatched with shaykhs khizr and brahím as guides mr clarke and the two stafflieutenants towards elrijm the next station of the pilgrimcaravan riding up the wady afál they reached after an hour and threequarters the ruins known as igár muása name of truly barbarous sound the settlement had occupied both banks but the principal mass was on the left here two blocks separated by a hillock lay to northeast and southwest of each other apparently dwellingplaces they were composed of a masonrycistern and of fourteen buildings detached squares and oblongs irregular both in orientation and in size the largest measuring eighty by fifty metres and the smallest five by four the material was of waterrolled boulders huge pebbles without mortar or cement there were no signs of a furnace nor were the usual fragments of glass and pottery strewed about to the north and running up the northnortheastern slope stood a line of wall two metres broad and three hundred long it ended at the southwestern extremity in five round towers razed to their foundations it was suggested that this formed part of a street laid out on the plan of the jebel elsafrá the hauteville of magháir shuayb on the right bank of the wady appeared a heap of stones suggesting a burj fine hard compact and purpleblue slate was collected in the ruins and the red conglomerates on either side of the watercourse suggested that cascalho had been worked  after riding their dromedaries some three hours halts not included the travellers were asked why they had not brought their tents because we expect to return to camp this evening then it leaked out that they had not reached halfway to the closed stone while the dragontablet would take a whole day unprepared for a wintry night in the open some twelve hundred feet above sealevel they rode back at full speed greatly to the disgust of the arabs who at this hungry season rarely push their lean beasts beyond three and a half to four miles an hour lieutenant amir who is invaluable in the field would have pressed forward not so the european  i did not see shaykhs khizr or brahím for many a day nor did we attempt any more reconnaissances to the north of magháir shuayb  not the least pleasant part of our evenings work was collecting information concerning the origin of the tribes inhabiting modern midian and as on such occasions a mixed multitude was always present angry passions were often let rise as my previous volume showed the tribes in this egyptian corner of northwestern arabia number threethe huwaytát the maknáwi and the beni ukbah the two former of late date and all more or less connected with the nile valley amongst them i do not include the hutaym or hitaym a tribe of pariahs who like the akhdám serviles of maskat and yemen live scattered amongst although never intermarrying with their neighbours as a rule the numbers of all these tribes are grossly exaggerated the object being to impose upon the pilgrimcaravans and to draw blackmail from the government of egypt the huwaytát for instance modestly declare that they can put 5000 matchlocks into the field i do not believe that they have 500 the maázah speak of 2000 which may be reduced in the same proportion whilst the baliyy have introduced their 37000 into european books of geography when 370 would be nearer the mark i anticipate no difficulty in persuading these egyptoarabs to do a fair days work for a fair and moderate wage the bedawin flocked to the suez canal took an active part in the diggings and left a good name there they will be as useful to the mines and thus shall midian escape the mortification of the redflannelshirted jove while enjoying his golden shower  i first took the opportunity of rectifying my notes on the origin of the huwaytat tribeen92 according to their own oral genealogists the first forefather was a lad called alayán who travelling in company with certain shurafá descendants of the apostle and ergò held by his descendants to have been also a sherif fell sick on the way at elakabah he was taken in charge by atíyyah shaykh of the then powerful maázah tribe who owned the land upon which the fort stands a clerk able to read and to write he served his adopted father by superintending the accounts of stores and provisions supplied to the hajj the arabs who before that time embezzled at discretion called him elhuwayti the man of the little wall because his learning was a fence against their frauds he was sent for by his egyptian friends these however were satisfied by a false report of his death he married his benefactors daughter he became shaykh after the demise of his fatherinlaw he drove the maázah from elakabah and he left four sons the progenitors and eponymi of the midianite huwaytát their names are alwán imrán suwayid and said and the list of nineteen tribes which i gave in the goldmines of midian is confined to the descendants of the third brother  the huwaytát tribe is not only an intruder it is also the aggressive element in the midianite family of bedawin and of late years it has made great additions to its territory if it advances at the present rate it will after a few generations either eat up as africans say all the other races or by a more peaceful process assimilate them to its own body  we also consulted shaykh hasan and his cousin ahmed alias abú khartúm concerning the origin of his tribe the beni ukbah according to our friend furayj the name means sons of the heel akab because in the early wars and conquests of elislám they fought during the day by the moslems side and at night when going over to the nazarenes they lost the spoor by wearing their sandals heel foremost and by shoeing their horses the wrong way all this they indignantly deny and they are borne out by the written genealogies who derive them from ukbah the son of maghrabah son of heram of the kahtániyyah joctanite arabs some of the noblest of bedawi blood they preserve the memory of their ancestor ukbah and declare that they come from the south that is they are of hejázi descent consequently far more ancient than the huwaytát at first called elmusálimah they were lords of all the broad lands extending southward between shámah syria and the wady dámah below the port of zibá and this fine valley retains under its huwayti occupants the title of ukbíyyahukbahland thus they still claim as milk or unalienable property the wadys gharr sharmá aynúnah and others whilst their right to the ground upon which fort elmuwaylah is built has never been questioned  the first notable event in the history of the beni ukbah was a quarrel that arose between them and their brothertribe the beni amr the ayn eltabbákhahen93 the fine water of wady madyan now called wady makná was discovered by a hutaymi shepherd of the beni ali clan while tending his flocks others say that the lucky man was a hunter following a gazelle however that may be the find was reported to the shaykh of the musálimah beni ukbah who had married ayayfah the sister of ali ibn nejdi the beni amr chief whilst the latter had also taken his brotherinlaws sister to wife the discoverer was promised a jinu or sabátah datebunch from each palmtree and the rivals waxed hot upon the subject the musálimah declared that they would never yield their rights a certain ancestor asaylah having first pitched tent upon the rughámat makná or white horse of makná a furious quarrel ensued and as usual in arabia as in hibernia both claimants prepared to fight it out  to repeat the words of our oral genealogist furayj now when the wife of the shaykh of the musálimah had heard and understood what satan was tempting her husband to do against her tribe she rose up and sent a secret message to her brother of the beni amr warning him that a certain person fulán was about to lay violent hands on the beautiful valley of elmadyan hearing this the beni amr mustered their young men and mounted their horses and dromedaries and rode forth with jingling arms and at midnight they found their opponents asleep in elkhabten94 the beasts being tied up by the side of their lords so they cut the cords of the camels they gagged the hunter who guided the attack they threatened him with death if he refused to obey and they carried him away with them towards makná  when the musálimah awoke they discovered the deceit they secured their beasts and they hastened after the enemy following his track like azrail both met at makná when a battle took place and allah inclined the balance towards the beni amr the musálimah therefore became exiles and took refuge in egypt and in the flow of days it so happened that the shaykh of the beni amr awoke suddenly at midnight and heard his wife as she sat grinding at the quern sing this quatrain       if the handmill of fate grind down our tribe      we will bear it o thou allah that aidest to bear      but if the mill grind the foeman tribe      we will pound and pound them as thin as flour  whereupon the shaykh in his wrath seized a stone and cast it at his wife and knocked out one of her front teeth she said nothing but she took the tooth and wrapped it in a rag and sent it with a message to her brother the shaykh of the musálimah now this chief was unable to revenge his sister singlehanded so he travelled to syria and threw himself at the feet of the great shaykh of the wuhaydi tribe who was also a sherif  the wuhaydi despatched his host together with the warriors of the musálimah and both went forth to do battle with the beni amr the latter being camped in a valley near aynúnah tethered their dogs and some say left behind their old peopleen95 and lit huge bonfires whence the name of the place is wady umm nírán the mother of fires to this day before early dawn they had reached in flight the wady arawwah of the jibál eltihámah in the morning the musálimah and the wuhaydi finding that a trick had been practiced upon them followed the foe and beat him in the wady arawwah killing the shaykh and the chief of the musálimah gave his widowed sister as wife to the wuhaydi and settled with his people in their old homes the beni amr fled to the hismá and exiled themselves to kerak in syria where they still dwell owning the plain called ganán shabíb there is now peace between the beni ukbah and their kinsmen the beni amr  the second event in the history of the tribe the tale of abú ríshen96 shall also be told in the words of furayjafter the course of time the beni ukbah aided by the maázah made war against the shurafá who were great lords in those days and plundered them and drove them from their lands the victors were headed by one salámah a huwayti who dwelt at elakabah and who had become their guest in those ages the daughters of the tribe were wont to ride before the host in their hawádig camellitters singing the warsong to make the warriors brave as salámah was the chief mubáriz champion in single combat the girls begged him to wear when fighting a white ostrich feather in his chainhelmet that they might note his deeds and chant in his name hence his title abú ríshthe father of a feather the sherifs being beaten made peace taking the lands between wady dámah and elhejaz whilst the beni ukbah occupied midian proper north midian between dámah and shámah syria  abú rísh who was a friend to both victor and vanquished settled among the sherifs in the sirr country south of wady dámah he had received to wife as a reward for his bravery the daughter of the shaykh of the beni ukbah and she bare him a son id whose tomb is in the wady ghál between zibá and elmuwaylah on the yaum elsubúh seventh day after birth the mother of id followed the custom of the arabs and after the usual banquet presented the babe to the guests including her father who made over wady aynúnah in free gift to his grandson now id used to lead caravans to cairo for the purpose of buying provisions and he was often plundered by the maázah who had occupied by force the wadys sharmá tiryam and surr of elmuwaylah  this id ibn salámah left by a huwayti woman a son alayán surnamed abú takíkah father of a scar from a sabrecut in the forehead he was the founder of the tugaygáthuwaytát clan and his descendants still swear by his name once upon a time when leading his caravan he reached the wady afál and he learned that his enemies the maázah and the black slaves who garrisoned elmuwaylah were lurking in the wady marayr so he placed his loads under a strong guard and he hastened with his kinsmen of the huwaytát to the hismá where the maázah had left their camels undefended these he drove off and rejoined his caravan rejoicing the maázah hearing of their disaster hurried inland to find out the extent of the loss abandoning the black slaves who nevertheless were still determined to plunder the káfilah alayán was apprized of their project and reaching the wady umm gehaylah he left his caravan under a guard and secretly posted fifty matchlockmen in elsuwayrah east of the hills of elmuwaylah he then behold his cunning tethered between the two hosts at a place called zilah east of the tomb of shaykh abdullahen97 ten camelcolts without their dams roused by the bleating the negro slaves followed the sound and fell into the ambush and were all slain  alayán returned to the sirr country when his tribe the huwaytát said to him hayya up to battle with these maázah and beni ukbah either they uproot us or we uproot them so he gathered the clan and marched to a place called elbayzáen98 where he found the foe in front on the next day the battle began and it was fought out from friday to friday a truce was then made and it was covenanted to last between evening and morning but at midnight the enemy arose left his tents pitched and fled to the hismá alayán followed the fugitives came up with them in the wady sadr and broke them to pieces upon this they took refuge in egypt and syria  after a time the beni ukbah returned and obtained pardon from alayan the huwayti who imposed upon them six conditions firstly having lost all right to the land they thus became brothers ie serviles secondly they agreed to give up the privilege of escorting the hajjcaravan thirdly if a huwayti were proved to have plundered a pilgrim his tribe should make good the loss but if the thief escaped detection the beni ukbah should pay the value of the stolen property in coin or in kind fourthly they were bound not to receive as guests any tribe enumerating a score or so at enmity with the huwaytát fifthly if a shaykh of huwaytát fancied a dromedary belonging to one of the beni ukbah the latter must sell it under cost price and sixthly the beni ukbah were not allowed to wear the abá or arab cloaken99  the beni ukbah were again attacked and worsted in the days of sultan selim by their hereditary foe the maázah they complained at cairo and the mamlúk beys sent down an army which beat the enemy in the wady surr they had many quarrels with their southern neighbours the baliyy at last peace was made and the land was divided the beni ukbah taking the tract between wadys damah and elmuzayrib since that time the tribe has been much encroached upon by the huwaytat it still claims however as has been said all the lands between elmuwaylah and makná where they have settlements and the jebel harb where they feed their camels they number some twentyfive to thirty tents boasting that they have hundreds and as will appear their shaykh hasan elukbi amuses himself by occasionally attacking and plundering the wretched maknáwis or people of makná a tribe weaker than his own                                chapter vi      to makná and our work therethe magáni or maknáwis    after a silly fortnight at old madiáma i resolved to march upon its seaport makná the greek      of ptolemy which the people call also madyanen100 we set out at seven am january 25th and after a walk of fortyfive minutes we were shown by furayj a ghadír or shallow basin of clay shining and bald as an old scalp from the chronic sinking of water in the middle stood two low heaps of fine white cement mixed with brick and gravel while to the west we could trace the framework of a mortared fiskíyyah cistern measuring five metres each way the ruin lies a little south of west 241 deg mag from the greater shigd and it is directly under the catacombed hill which bears the prayingplace of jethro a tank in these regions always presupposes a waterpit and there are lingering traditions that this is the well of moses so generally noticed by mediæval arab geographers it is the only one in the wady makná not to mention a modern pit about an hour and a half further down the valley sunk by the bedawin some twenty feet deep the walls of the latter are apparently falling in and it is now bonedry but the veritable moses well seems to have been upon the coast and if such be the case it is clean forgotten true masáíd the mad old maázi attempted to trace a well inside our camp by the seashore but the beni ukbah to whom the land belongs had never heard of it  after marching about six miles we entered a gorge called umm elbíbán the mother of gates formed by the stony spurs of the wady bank the number of birds and trees especially in the syenitic valleys showed that water could not be far off at 1010 am a halt was called at the halfway place a bay or hollow in the left cliff elhumayrahthe little redan overhanging wall of ruddy grit some eighty feet high with strata varying in depth from a few lines to as many fathoms all differing in colour and all honeycombed fretted and sculptured by wind and rain above the red grit weathered into a thousand queer shapes stood strata of chloritic sand a pale yellowgreen and capping it rose the usual dullbrown carbonate of lime large fossil oysters lay in numbers about the base suggesting a prehistoric feast of the titans amongst them is the monstrous tridacna gigantea which sometimes attains a growth of a yard and a half one of these is used as a bénitier at the church of saint sulpice paris amongst the layers were wavy bands of waterrolled crystals jaspers bloodstones ironrevetted pebbles and almonds which in the brazil accompany and betray the diamonden101 we had no time to make a serious search but when the metals shall be worked it will perhaps be advisable to import a skilled prospecter from the brazil or the cape of good hope  at noon we met the heavensent lifesustaining seabreeze and now the broad and wellmarked wady makná with its rosypink sands narrowed to a gut flanked and choked on both sides north and south by rocks of the strangest tricolour greenblack yellowwhite and rustyred the gloomy peak which had long appeared capping the heights ahead proved to be the culmination of a huge upthrust of porphyritic trap bottlegreen when seen under certain angles and dull dead sable at others it was variegated by cliffs and slopes polished like dark mirrors and by sooty sandshunts disposed at the natural slope crumbling outside the lower strata pass from the cellular to the compact and are often metalliferous when in contact with the quartz at these salbandes the richest mineral deposits are always found set in and on the black flanks and looking from afar like the gouts of a bloodstone are horizontal beds perpendicular spines and detached blocks of felsitic porphyry and of rustyred syenite altered broken and burnt by plutonic heat in places where the trap has cut through the more modern formations it has been degraded by time from a dyke to a ditch the latter walled by the ruddy rocks and sharply cut as a castlemoat and already we could see on the right of the wady those cones and crests of ghastly glaring white gypsum which we had called the hats  these gloomy cliffs approaching the maritime plain sweep away to the south and melt into the red hills visited on our first excursion they are known as the jebel elabdaynof the two slaves this perhaps is the doric pronunciation of the bedawin for abdínslaves presently we sighted the familiar features of the seaboard described in my first volume especially the rughámat elmargas to the north and westward the gulf of akabah looking cool and blue in the arabian glare after five hours and thirty minutes  seventeen miles and a half in the saddle we reached makná  i had thought of encamping near the prayingplace of moses a fine breezy site which storms would have made untenable as at sharmá camels must turn off to the right over the banks when approaching the mouth of the wady madyan whose bed is made impassable by rocks and palmthicket we then proposed to pitch the tents upon the valley sands within the gate but this was overruled by the sayyid who told grisly tales of fever and ague finally we returned to our former ground near the old conglomerates and the mass of new shells which ledge the shore of the little harbour approaching it we were delighted to see the gunboat mukhbir steaming up despite the contrary wind from sharm yáhárr she was towing the sambúk which brought from aynúnah bay our heavy gear rations and tools this was a stroke of good luck already we were on half rations and provant for men and mules threatened to run short  our week at makná january 25february 2 justified the pleasant impression left by the first visit and enabled us to correct the inaccuracies of a flying survey  this valley of waters with its pink and yellow chloritic sands is bounded on the right near the sea by a sandbank about one hundred feet high a loose sheet thinly covering the dykes of syenite and the porphyritic trap which in places peep out possibly it contains like the left flank veins of quartz lowered by corrosion and concealed by the sanddrift spread by the prevalent western winds the highlevel abounds in detached springs probably the drainage of the rughámat makná the huge horse or buttress of gypsum bearing northeast from the harbour the principal veins number three the uppermost and sweetest is the ayn eltabbákhah in the middle height is eltúyuri umm eltuyúr with the dwarf cataract and its tinkling song whilst the brackish ayn elfaraí occupies the valley sole besides these a streak of palms perpendicular to the run of the wady shows a rainbasin dry during the droughts and higher up the outlying dates springing from the arid sands are fed by thin veins which damp the rocky base hence probably dr beke identified the place with the elim of the exodus his artists sketch from the sea p 340 is however absolutely unrecognizable  the highlevel spring and the middle water rise in sandy basins course down deeply furrowed beds of grit and after passing through a tangle of vegetation a dense forest of palms alive and dead and open patches sown with grain wilfully waste their treasures in the upper slope of the right bank this abundance of water has developed a certain amount of industry although the bedawin tear to pieces the young maledates whose tender green growth at the base of the fronds supplies them with a chaw a number of artificial runners has been trained to water dwarf barleyplots whose fences of datefronds defend them from sheep and goats and further down the bank are the fruit trees which first attracted our attention  the lowlevel water consists of two springs the upper is the ayn elaryánah springing from the sands under the datetrees which line the right and left sides apparently it is the drainage of a gypsum hat called elkulayb the little dogin their doric the bedawin pronounce the word galáib further down the bed and divided by a tract of dry sand is the ayn elfarai which also rises from both banks forms a single stream sleeps in deep pellucid pools like fairy baths among the huge boulders of grey granite and finally sinks before reaching the shore when these waters shall again be regulated as of old they will prove amply sufficient for the vegetable and the mineral anton the greek who everywhere saw the shop was so charmed with the spot that he at once laid out his establishment here shall be the hotel there the billiard and gambling room and there the garden the kiosk the buvettein fact he projected a miners paradise  on the crest of this right bank above the vegetation lies the traditional musallat musá moses oratory of which the foundations or rather the basestones are in situ the larger enceinte measures without including two walls projecting from the northeast and northwest angles an oblong of thirtyseven by twentyfive feet and as usual with midianite ruins it has been built of all manner of material the inner sanctum opens to the west the northern and southern basementlines only remaining the former is composed of eight blocks of gypsum resembling alabaster five being larger than the others and the southern of three upon these the bedawin still deposit their simple exvotos oyster and other shells potsherds and coloured pebblesen102  the left or opposite bank which wants water is formed by the tall conglomeratecapped cliffs which support the muttali or hauteville and by the warty block called jebel elfahísát in the goldmines of midian chap xii it is called elmuzayndi an error of my informants for elmuzeúdi the latter is the name of the small red hill north of our camp i again visited the high town which is about a hundred feet above the valley presently it will disappear bodily as its base is being corroded like the jebel elsafrá of magháir shuayb the walls still standing form a long room running northsouth and the two adjoining closets set off to the northeast and southeast this sadly shrunken upper settlement covers the remnant of the rocky plateau to the east there are also traces of building on the southern slopes ruined heaps of the usual material gypsum dot and line the short broad valley to the north which rejoices in the neat and handy name wady majrá sayl jebel elmarú here however they are hardly to be distinguished from the chloritic spines and natural sandbanks that stud the bed the only antiquities found in the muttali were a stone cut into parallel bands and the fragment of a basalt door with its pivot acting as hinge in the upper part it reminded me of the græcoroman townlets in the haurán where the credulous discovered giant cities and similar ineptitudes our search for midianite money was in vain mr clarke however picked up near the sea a silver taymúr the moghal with a curiously twisted kufic inscription ah 734  the ushash or frondhuts of the maknáwi and the beni ukbah were still mostly empty at this season all along the seaboard of northwestern arabia the bedawin are grazing their animals in the uplands and they will not return coastwards till july and august supply the dateharvest the village shows the inconséquence of doors and wooden keys to defend an interior made of cadjan or dry datefronds which bound in bundles make a good hedge but at all times a bad wall one of its peculiar features is what looks like a truncated and roofless oven in this swish cylinder they pound without soaking the datekernels that feed their camels sheep and goats a few youths however who remained in this apology for a deserted village assisted us in nightfishing with the lantern and they brought from the adjoining reefs the most delicate of shell and scale fish the best were the langoustes palinurus vulgaris the clawless lobsters called crawfish crayfish in the united states and the agosta or avagosta of the adriatic it was confounded by the egyptian officers with abú galamboen103 the crab cancer pelagicus the echinidae of various species largespined and smallspined the latter white as well as dullred were preserved in spiritsen104 amongst the excellent fish the marján a scina the sultan elbahr the palamita scomber the makli red mullets mugil cephalus and the búri were monstrous animals with big eyes and long beaks like woodcocks some of these were garnished with rows of ridiculously big teeth i failed to procure live specimens of small turtle and yet the huts were full of carapaces all broken and eightribbed one species the sakar supplies tortoiseshell sold at suez for 150 piastres per ratl or pound the bísah another large kind without carapace is used only for eating both are caught off the reefs and islets an eellike watersnake marrína  murna ophis showed fight when attacked the arabs do not eat it yet they will not refuse the shaggah or large black landsnake  the enforced delay at makná gave us the opportunity of making careful reconnaissances in its neighbourhood during the last spring i had heard of a jebel elkibít sulphurhill on the road to aynúnah but no guide was then procurable shortly after our return a bedawi named jázi brought in fine specimens of brimstone pure crystals adhering to the secondary calcaire and possibly formed by decomposition of the sulphate of lime if this be the case we may hope to find the mineral generally diffused throughout these immense formations of course in some places the yield will be richer and in others poorer further investigation introduced us as will be seen to two southern deposits without including one heard of in northern sinai all lie within a short distance of the sea and all are virgin the bedawin import their sulphur from the barr elajam the popular name for egypt properly meaning persia or any nonarab land thus in one important article midian rivals if not excels the riches of the opposite african shore where for a single mine thirty millions of francs have been demanded by way of indemnity  betimes on january 26th a caravan of four camels for the two quarrymen and the guide set off southwards carrying sacks tools and other necessaries they did not return till the morning of the third day jázi had lost the road and the bedawin rather repented of having been so ready to disclose their treasures of course our men could not ascertain the extent of the deposits but they brought back rich specimens which determined me to have the place surveyed unfortunately i had forgotten a sulphurstill and the engineer vainly attempted to extract the ore by luting together two iron mortars and by heating them to a red heat the only result was the diffusion of the sulphur crystals in the surrounding gypsum this discovery gave me abundant trouble the second searchparty was a failure and it was not till february 18th that i could obtain a satisfactory plan of the northern jebel elkibrít  at makná i was much puzzled by the presence of the porous basalt which had yielded to the first expedition a veinlet of electrongold and silver mixed by the hand of nature the plutonic rock absent from the wady makná appears in scatters along the shore to the north our friend furayj knew nothing nearer than elharrah the volcanic tract bounding the hismá on the east and distant some five days march this was going too far querns of the same material found in all the ruins suggested a neighbouring outcrop moreover during the last spring i had heard of a mining site called nakhil tayyib ism the palmorchard of the mountain of the good name in the socalled range to the north of makná  lieutenant amir was despatched january 27th to seek for basalt with a small dromedarycaravan under the lead of shaykh furayj after winding for about two hours along the shore which is cut by the broad mouths of many a wady and whose corallines grits and limestones are weathered into the strangest shapes he left to the right east the lightcoloured jebel sukk on the southern side of the wady sukk which drains it to the sea a hill of the porous stone which the arabs call hajar elharrah appeared the specimens brought home si vera sunt exposita if they be really taken from an outcrop prove that volcanic centres detached sporadic and unexpected like those found further north occur even along the shore as will afterwards appear another little harrah was remarked by burckhardt syria p 522 about one hour and a quarter north of sinaitic sherm he says here for the first and only time i saw volcanic rocks and he considers that their extension towards ras abú mohammed may have given rise to the name greek  wellsteden105 who apparently had not read burckhardt makes the same remark the many eruptive centres in the limestones of syria and palestine were discovered chiefly by my late friend the loved and lamented charles f tyrwhittdrake it would be interesting to ascertain the relation which they bear to tile great lines of vulcanism in the far interior the hauran and the harrah subtending the coast mountains and dr beke another friend now no more would have been delighted to know that his true mount sinai was not unconnected with a volcanic outbreak  beyond the wady sukk a bad rough path leads along the base of the tayyih ism mountain then the cliffs fall sheer into the sea explaining why caravans never travel that way yet there was a maritime road for we know that abú sufyán on his way from syria to fight the battle of bedr ah 2 passed by a roundabout path for safety along the shore of midian thus compelled the track bends inland and enters a nakb a gash conspicuous from the gulf an immense cañon or couloir that looks as if ready to receive a dyke or vein curious to say a precisely similar formation prolonged to the southwest cuts the cliffs south of marsá dahab in the sinaitic peninsula the southern entrance to the gorge bears signs of human habitation a parallelogram of stones 120 paces by 91 has been partially buried by a landslip  and there are remnants of a dam measuring about a hundred metres in length  about three hundred yards higher up water appears in abundance and palm clumps grow on both sides of it here however all trace of man is wanting the winter torrents must be dangerous and there is no grass for sheep the crevasse now becomes very wild the pass narrows from fifty to ten paces and in one section a loaded camel can hardly squeeze through whilst the cliffwalls of red and grey granite  tower some two thousand feet above the thread of pathen106 water which as usual sinks in the sand is abundant enough in three other places to supply a large caravan and two dateclumps were passed hence if all here told be true the nakhil palmplantation tayyib ism reported to the first expedition  after covering sixteen miles in five hours the caravan had not made more than half the distance to the bir elmáshi where a small marsá or anchorageground called elsuwayhil the little shore nestles in the long sandslope between the mountain tayyib ism and its huge northern neighbour the mazhafah block from this well of the walker a pass leads to the wady marsha where according to certain bedawin are found extensive ruins and bíbán doors or catacombs the whole is however an invention our sayyid had ridden down the valley during his journey to elhakl  on the next day another reconnaissance was made i had been shown fine specimens of quartz from the eastern highlands moreover a bottle of bitter or sulphurwater from the wady mabúg the oblique or crooked valley mentioned in the goldmines of midianen107 had been brought to us with much ceremony those who tasted it indeed were divided as to whether it smacked more of brimstone or of ammonia accordingly mr clarke and lieutenant yusuf walked up the wady makná and ascended the mabúg where the mineral spring proved to be a shallow pool of rainwater much frequented by animals camels included search for the marú was more successful they found a network of veins in the sandstone grits  of the jebel umm lasaf and they thus established the fact that the white stone abounds to the east as well as to the south of makná  meanwhile we were working hard at the jebel elfahísát the great discovery of the northern journey i had been struck by the name of the watercourse to the north of the hauteville wady majrá sayl jebel elmarúthe nullah of the divide of the torrent that pours from the mountain of quartz moreover a maknawi lad id bin mohsin had brought in fine specimens of the negro or iridescent variety offering to show the place lastly other bedawi had contributed fine specimens of marú with the grey copper standing out of it in veins on the evening of january 27th we walked up the picturesque mouth of the makná valley after passing the conglomerate gate and the dwarf plantations on both sides above it we reached in fortyfive minutes the spot where the lower water ayn elfaraí tumbles over rocks of grit and granite on the left bank denoted by a luxuriant growth of rushes is an influent called shab elkázi or the judges passen108 ascending it for a few paces we struck up the broad and open fiumara which i shall call for shortness wady majrá the main trunk of many branches it is a smooth incline perfectly practicable to camels with banks and buttresses of greenyellow chloritic sands and longitudinal spines outcropping from the under surface it carries off the surplus water from the northwestern slopes of that strange wavelike formation the jebel elfahísát which bounds the right southern bank of the wady makná presently we sighted the jebel elmaru the strangest spectacle the apex of the gloomy porphyritic trap is a long spine of the tenderest azurewhite filmy as the finials of milan cathedral and apparently melting into thin air its crest seems abnormally tall and distant and below it a huge grey vein horizontal and wavy cuts and pierces the peaklet of red rock and is cut and pierced in its turn by two perpendicular dykes of porphyritic trap one flanking the right and the left shoulders of the low cone when standing upon the hauteville during my first visit i had remarked this white lady of a vein without however attaching to it any importance  after a quarter of an hours walk up the wady majrá we came to the sandy base of the rocky fahísát and climbed up a torrentladder with drops and stiff gradients which were presently levelled for the convenience of our quarrymen a few minutes swarming placed us upon the narrow knifelike ridge of snowy quartz so weathered that it breaks under the hand this is the aerial head which from below appears so far the summit distant from our camp about one direct mile and a quarter gives 355 degrees to the gypsumhill ras eltárah on the shore 358 degrees to the palmclump nearest the sea and due north 360 degrees all magnetic to the tents which are well in sight the altitude is about six hundred feet aner 2940  the view from this summit of the fahísát is charming as it is extensive westward and broad stretching to the northwest lies the fair blue gulf that shows on its far side the broken mountains of the sinaitic peninsula northwards at our feet stretch the palmgroves of makná a torrent of verdure pouring towards the shore a little to the left sheltered from the boreal wind by the white gypseous ridge ras eltârah the head that surrounds and flanked at both ends by its triangular reefs the sharm makná the past and future port of the mines supports the miniature gunboat no larger than a cock and the sambúk dwarfed to a buoy beyond the purpling harbour along the glaring yellow shore cut by broad wadymouths and dotted here and there with a dateclump the corallines grits and sandstones are weathered to the quaintest forms giant pins and mushrooms columns and ruined castles these maritime lowlands are bounded on the north by heights in three distinct planes the nearest is the jebel sukk low and white farther rises tayyib ism a chocolatecoloured mass studded with small peaks while the horizon is closed by the grand blue wall the jebel elmazhafah in places their precipices drop bluff to the sea but the huge valleymouths separating the two greater ridges have vomited a quantity of sand forming the tapering tongue and tip known as the little shore turning to the east and the southeast we have for horizon the wady elkharaj elakhraj backed by its immense right bank of yellow gypsum which dwarfs even the rughámat makná and over it we catch sight of the dark and gloomy kalb elnakhlah a ridge which running parallel with and inland of the fahísát will be worked when the latter is exhausted  we at once recognized the value of this discovery when reaching the tents we examined the quartz and found it seamed and pitted with veins and geodes containing colorado earthy and crumbling metallic dust chlorure iodure and bromure of silver with various colours red ochreyellow and dark chocolatebrown it stained the fingers and was suspiciously lightnimporte i must regret that here as indeed throughout the exploration all our specimens were taken from the surface we had not time to dig even a couple of feet deep the lad id almost fainted with joy and surprise when the silver dollars were dropped into his hand one by one with the reiteration of heres another for you and heres another this lavishness served to stimulate cupidity and every day the bedawin brought in specimens from half a dozen different places but the satisfaction was at its height when the crucible produced after cupellation a button of silver weighing some twenty grammes from the hundred grammes of what the grumbling californian miners had called in their wrath dashed black dusten109 and when a second experiment yielded twentyeight grammes each fifteen grains and a half and ten centigrammes from 111 grammes or about a quarter of a pound avoirdupois in the latter experiment also the culot came away without the litharge which almost always contains traces of silver and antimony hence we concluded that the proportions were 30110a magnificent result considering that 1212100 is held to be rich ore in the silver mines of the pacific statesen110 the engineer was radieux with pride and joy the yellow tint of the buttons promised goldtwo per cent three per cent immense wealth lay before us a ton of silver is worth 250000 francs meanwhileand now i take blame to myselfno one thought of testing the find even by a blow with the hammer  alas the splendid buttons proved to be iron containing only two and a half grammes of silver to one hundred kilogrammesen111  i can afford to make merry on the absurd mistake which at the time filled the camp with happiness the jebel elfahísát played us an ugly trick yet it is not the less a glorious metalliferous block and i am sure of its future  the rest of our time at makná was given to the study of this discovery the great quartzwall or vein runs nearly due north and south with a dip of 5 degrees west it has pierced the syenite forming a sheet down one peak spanning a second and finally appearing in an apparently isolated knob that bore from the apex 215 degrees mag the upper part like that of the jebel elabyaz is apparently sterile at a lower horizon it becomes panaché and at last almost all is iridescentin fact it is the filon husayn still richer in veins and geodes the filets and fibrils of dust are exposed to sight in the flanks and near the base of the great quartzvein we should never have been able to remove the barren upper capping  every days work brought with it some novelty the jebel elmará the centre or focus of the formation was found to push out veins to the north extending within a few yards of the wady maknás mouth here however the quartz imbedded in grey granite appears cupriferous producing fine grey copper  and the same is the case to the east of the fahísát block other greentinged veins were found bearing 205 degrees mag from our camp there is also a quartzhill whose valleydrain about a mile and a third long leads down to the sea about two minutes walk south of the southern clump of tabernacles occupied by the maknáwis the dust is richest as usual at the walls where the vein is in immediate contact with the heataltered granites whose red variety containing very little mica becomes quasisyenitic certain of the expedition thought that the fahísát showed signs of having been worked by the ancients my eyes could see nothing of the kind and here as in other parts of our strange country there is a medley a confusion of different formations  on february 2nd the day before we left makná the arabs brought in heavy masses of purpleblack metalliferous rock scattered over the gorges and valleys south of the jebel elfahísát while others declared that they could point out a vein in situ our engineer declared it to be argentiferous galena but it proved to be magnetic iron his assays were of the rudest he broke at least one crucible per day lamenting the while that he had been supplied with english articles instead of creusets de bourgogne and no wonder he treated them by a strong blast in a furious coalfire without previous warming his muffle was a wreck and such by degrees became the condition of all his apparatus however as we sought so we found hardly a bedawi lad in camp but unpouched some form of metallic specimens the shaykhs declared that the wealth of kárún must have been dug here and i vainly told them that the place of punishment of korah dathan and abiram is still shown by christians in the convent of mount sinaien112  on january 28th after a ruddy and cloudy sunset elayli the akabah wind beginning at eleven pm gave us a taste of his quality these northers are the tyrants of the gulf which comparatively unbroken by capes and headlands allows them all their own way carrying a strong swell and at times huge waves to meet the tide inflowing from the red sea the storm began with a rush and a roar as if it came from above the gravel striking the canvas sounded like hail or heavy raindrops it then kicked down at one blow the two large tents they had been carefully pitched above the reach of water when wind only was to be guarded against fortunately most of our goods were packed in expectation of embarking on the morrow but the fall broke all the breakables that were not under cover and carried newspapers and pamphlets includingagain alasthe reseau pentagonal of elie de beaumont over the plain southwards till arrested by the heights of jebel elfahísát this bora as it would be called on the adriatic makes the air exceptionally cold and raw before dawn it appears to abate between noon and sunset and it is most violent at night it either sensibly increases or lessens in turbulence with moonrise and it usually lasts from three to seven days we rigged up one of the native huts with the awning of a tent till it looked very like a gypsy dwelling and in patience we possessed our souls grumbling horridly like britons  poor captain mohammed of the mukhbir who had already escaped one shipwreck was in mortal terror he at once got up steam and kept his weary vigil all night he was perfectly safe as the northern reef under which the sambúk musahhil rode easily as if in smooth water and the headland ras eltárah formed a complete defence against the aylí while the natural pier to the south would have protected him from its complement the azyab or southeaster but it would have been very different had the storm veered to the west and the terrible gharbi set in the port of makná which has been described in the goldmines of midianen113 can hardly be called safe on the other hand its floor has not been surveyed and a single briselame seawards would convert it into a dock i should propose a gallegiante a floating breakwater treetrunks in bundles strongly bound together with iron cramps and bands connected by stout rings and staples and made fast by anchors to the bottom and at any rate on the sinaitic shore opposite at the distance of thirteen knots there is as will appear an admirable harbour of refuge  next day the cloudveil lifted and the mountains of sinai and midian which before had been hidden as if by a november fog in london again stood out in sharp and steely blue i proposed to board the gunboat afloat we should have been much more comfortable than ashore in the raw high and dustyladen wind the egyptian officers however quoted the unnautical fellahs favourite saws elbarro birr liahlihiearth is a blessing to those upon herzirtat eljimál wa lá tasbíh elsamakthe roar of the camels and not the prayeren114 of the fish and the sailors saying kalb elbarr wa lá sabá elbahrbetter be a dog ashore than a lion afloat the public voice was decidedly against embarking so two more days of gale were spent in adding to our collection of mineralogy on the other hand the sayyid and the three shaykhs were anxious for a speedy return to elmuwaylah where the hajjcaravan was expected on safar 10  february 11th and where their presence would be officially required  on the last day of january i boated off to the mukhbir several tons of the specimens collected during the northern march including the iron the sulphur and the fine white gypsum crystalline and amorphous which forms the rughámat makná lieutenant yusuf and m philipin were directed to remain in camp until they should have collected and placed upon the seashore ready for embarkation on our return one ton of white quartz three tons  one cubic metre of the iridescent variety and four boxes half full of the silver iron dust whose veins and pockets seam the negro they were also to wash in the cradle two tons of the pounded cascalho conglomerate gravel one ton of the greenyellow chloritic or serpentine sand forming the under surface of the wady makná reduced to four girbahs or watersacks and five tons of the dark metal not argentiferous galena after that they were to visit the northern sulphurhill estimate its contents trace if possible its connection with adjoining formations map the country and prospect for wood water and harbour lastly they were ordered to march with the whole camp including our mules upon elmuwaylah and there to await my return  the three normal days of elaylí had come and gone still the fortunaen115 did not fall the water paved with dark slate and domed with an awning of milkywhite clouds patched here and there with rags and shreds of black wintry mist that poured westward from the suez gulf showed us how ugly the birkat akabah can look as in iceland also the higher rose the barometer the higher rose the norther the latter being a cold dry wind is consequently a heavy wind and when the sky was comparatively clear and blue the display of cirri was noticeable in some places they formed filmy crosses and thready lozenges in others the wrack fell into the shape of the letter z and from the western horizon the curlclouds shot up thin rays with a common centre hid behind the mountains of sinai affecting all the airs of the sun  before leaving makná i must give an account of its peculiar tribe concerning which the goldmines of midianen116 contained sundry inaccuracies these men are not the pauper descendants of the wealthy midianites they cannot boast of ancient race or of noble blood and their speech differs in nothing from that of the arabs around them there can be no greater mistake than to suppose that they represent in any way the ancient nabathæans in features complexion and dress they resemble the halfsettled bedawin around them and like these they show a kind of connection with the sinaitic tribes the magánien117 to whom only the southern clump of huts at makná belongs call themselves fawáidah zubáidah and ramázání after families of the juhayni stock and the fawáidah have by descent some title to the name they are however considered to be khaddamín serviles like the hutaym race by their neighbours who give tile following account of their origin  an egyptian silkseller who accompanied the hajjcaravan happened to fall asleep at kubázah between the stations of aynúnah and magháir shuayb his companions went their ways and he like a beaneater as he was fearing to follow them alone made for makná having married and settled there and seeing in the fertility of the soil a prospective spec he sent to his native country for fellahíncultivateurs and peasantswho were collected from every part of pharoahland and its neighbourhood the newcomers were compelled to pay onehalf of their harvest by way of elakháwah the brothertax in token of subjugation to the beni ukbah the owners of the soil they have gradually acquired milk legal title to the ground according to some they first settled at makná in the days of the beni amr whom they subsequently accompanied to the hismá when flying from the victorious musálimah after peace was patched up they were compelled to make over onefourth of the dateharvest as elakháwah to the imránhuwaytát and to the maázah whilst the tagaygáthuwaytát claimed a bursh or mat of fine reeds as a polltax from every head of man under these hard conditions they are left unmolested and everything taken from them is restored by the shaykhs who receive tribute they have no chief although one sálim ibn juwayfili claims the title  before 1866 the magáni numbered about a hundred tents the wady makná was then they say a garden and its cultivators were remarkable for their goodness and hospitality to strangers but in that year a feud with the beni ukbah was excited as often happens by the belli teterrima causa the women quarrelled with one another saying  thy husband is a slave to my husband and so forth the little tribe hoisting two flags of red and white calico with green palmfronds for staves dared the foe to attack it after a loss of four killed and sundry wounded all ran away manfully leaving their goods at the mercy of the conqueror shaykh hasan elukbí was assisted by the maázah in looting the magáni huts and in carrying off the camels while shaykh furayj vainly attempted conciliation shortly afterwards the maknáwis went in a body to beg aid from hammád elsofi shaykh of the turábín tribe which extends from ghazzah gaza westwards to egypt marching with a host of armed followers he took possession of the palmhuts belonging to the beni ukbah when the owners fled in turn leaving behind their women and children furayj hastened from aynúnah to settle the quarrel and at last the sofi said to him whilst i protect the magáni do thou protect the beni ukbah whereupon the latter returned from their mountainrefuge to elmuwaylah the magáni at the present time are mostly camped about aynúnah and only some fifteen head old men women and boys who did not take part in the fight and who live by fishing remain at makná under the protection of the beni ukbah hence the waters are waste and the fields are mostly unhoed  such is the normal condition of arabia and the arabs what one does the other undoes what this creates that destroys professor palmer tells us another misconception is that all arabs are habitual thieves and murderersen118 fear of the terrible vendetta the blood feud and the blutgeld amounting to about eight hundred dollars prevents the bedawin here as elsewhere slaying any but strangers the travellers experience however was chiefly of the towarah or sinaitic bedawin a race which bad as bad could be in the early quarter of the present century has been thoroughly tamed and cowed by the fear of allah and the consul and the curse pronounced by the jews against their brother ishmael his hand shall be against every man etc must as was known even in the days of gibbon be taken with many a grain of salt  yet the bedawin of midian have till late years been a turbulent mixed multitude and are ready to become troublesome again it is only by building forts and by holding the land militarily that the civilized can hope to tame this vermin i repeat however my conviction that the charming makná valley is fated to see happy years and that the wild man who when ruled by an iron hand is ever ready to do a fair days work for a fair wage especially victuals will presently sit under the shadow of his own secular vines and figtrees  about midnight on february 2nd the tempestuous northerly gale which had now lasted four days and five nights ceased almost suddenly the signs of the approaching calm were the falling of the mercury the increased warmth of the atmosphere and the shifting of the wind towards the east all hailed the change with joy the travellers looked forward to ending their peregrinations while the voyagers myself included hoped safely to steam round the gulf elakabah and to trace as correctly as possible the extent the trend and the puissance of the quartzformations at cairo mr consul rogers told me he had found them in large quantities veining the red grits of petra and i thought it possible that the white stone may extend under the waters of akabah into the peninsula of sinai                                chapter vii                 cruise from maknáto elakabah    this red sea in the land of edom 1 kings ix 26 is still as wellsted entitles it a vast and solitary gulf it bears a quaint resemblance to that eastern fork of the northern adriatic the quarnero whose name expresses its terrible storms while the suez branch shows the longer stretch of the triestine bifurcation yamm elath or eloth as the hebrews called elakabah has by the upheaval of the land lost more of its fair proportions than its western sister it was at one time the embouchure of the jordan extending up the wady elarabah to the asphaltite lake dead sea before the former became so to speak a hill and the latter a hole this view dates from olden times si suppone says cornelius à lapideen119 che sia un sollevamento che accadde mentre un abbassamento formava il mar morto e che il giordano si gettasse nel golfo elanitico yamm ailath ciò é nel mar rosso prima della destruzione di sodoma for the latter date we have only to read when a movement of depression sank the lower jordan valley and its present reservoirs the tiberias lake and the dead sea to their actual level there is nothing marvellous nor unique in the feature as it appears to those suffering from that strange malady holy land on the brain the oxus and the caspian show an identical formation only the sinking has been on a smaller scale  wellsted was unfortunate both in his weather and in his craft to encounter a sea of breakers and northerly gales with a high and dangerous swell in a wretched bugalá ie sambúk and in that perfect tub the palinurus was somewhat like tempting providenceif such operation be possible no wonder that in this gulf in a course of only ninety miles the nautical mishaps were numerous and varied the surveyor however neglected a matter of the highest interest and importance namely to ascertain whether there be any difference of level between the heads of the suez and the akabah waters the vicinity of continuous maritime chains varying from six to nearly nine thousand feet suggests an amount of attraction theoretically sufficient to cause a sensible difference of plane it would be well worth while to run two lines of survey one from elakabah to suez and the other down the eastern flank of the sinaitic peninsula  the mukhbir like the palinurus promised a certain amount of excitement her boiler i have said was honeycombed it was easy to thrust ones fist through it mr david duguid the engineer who on one occasion worked thirtysix hours at a stretch had applied for sixty new tubes and he wanted one hundred and fifty we began with two hundred and forty we lost when in the gulf from three to nine per diem a total of seventy five and the work of the engineroom and the ships carpenters consisted in plugging fractures with stays plates and wedges presently the steamgauge manomètre gave way making it impossible to register pressure the combustion chamber showed a rent of eighteen inches long by one wide the result of too rapid cooling and lastly the donkeyengine struck work under these happy circumstances bursting was not to be expected breaking down was a regular collapse which would have left us like a log upon the stormy waves a new boiler might have cost perhaps £900 and the want of one daily endangered a good ship which could not be replaced for £9000 i therefore determined upon a safer khoriyyah that is steaming by day and anchoring at night in some snug bay it was also agreed nem con to tow the sambúk elmusahhil in order that should accidents happen it might in turn act tug to the steamer or even at a pinch serve us as a lifeboat  nothing becomes makná better than the view on leaving it a varied and attractive picture this with the turquoiseblue of the deep water the purple and leekgreen tints of the shoaly and sandy little port and the tawny shore dotted by six distinct palmtufts they are outliers of the main line yon flood of verdure climbing up and streaming down from the high dry and barren banks of arenaceous drift heaped up and filmed over by the wind and lastly surging through its narrow gate with the clifflets of conglomerate forming the old coast add the bluff headland of the ras eltárah to the north of the harbour and behind it the rughámat makná the greenishyellow flatbacked horse of madyan which shimmering in the sunset with a pearly lustre forms the best of landmarks finish to the south of the wady with the quaint chopping outlines of the jebel elfahísát resembling from afar a huge alligator lying on the water with the similar but lower forms to the north of the valley both reflected in the jibál elhamrá the red hills whose curtains of greenblack trap are broken by sheets of dull deadwhite plaster cap the whole with the mighty double quoin of gypseous jebel elkharaj buttressing the eastern flank of its valley and with the low dark metalrevetted hills of the kalb elnakhlah a copy of the fahísát throw in the background slowly rising as you recede from the shore a curtain of plutonic peaks and buttresses cones quoins cupolas parrotbeaks with every trick of shape from the lumpy zahd to the buttressed and pinnacled urnub with every shade of mountaintint between lapislazuli and plumpurple dome the whole with that marvellous transparent sky the ocean of the air that spreads loveliness over the rugged cheek of the desert and you have a picture which though distinctly arabian you can hardly expect to see in arabia  from the offing also we note how the later formations granite and syenite seamed with a network and often topped by cones of porphyritic trap have upthrust pierced and isolated the older secondaries we traced this huge deposit of sulphates and carbonates of lime from the southern wady hamz through the islets at the mouth of the birkat akabah all along the shore of north midian here it crosses diagonally the northern third of the akabah gulf and forms the northeastern base of the sinaitic peninsula whilst eastward it stretches inland as far as magháir shuayb the general disposition suggests that before the upheaval of the gháts the jibál eltihámah this vast gypseous sheet was a plain and plateau covering the whole country till a movement of depression caused by the upheaval of the igneous mountains sank in it the gulf of akabah at present the surface is here flat there hilly like huge billows breaking mostly to the north and reaching an altitude of twelve hundred feet above the surface hence the lines stretching northsouth the fahísát the red hills and the kalb elnakhlah look like so many volcanic islandreefs floating in a sea of greenishyellow secondaries  like the old irish posthorse the difficulty and danger of our kettle consisted in starting it two tubes at once burst and a new hole yawned in the boiler moreover our anchor had been thrown out in a depth of seventythree feet enfin at nine am february 3rd we stood straight for the sinaitic shore distant thirteen miles direct geographical and in three hours we made the sharm marsá or minat eldahabthe golden anchorage cove or porten120 another hour was spent in steaming southwards to the dockharbour wrongly so called in the charts the pilots and the many sambúks that take refuge in it know the place only as mínát ginái jinái the northern baylet preferred when southerly winds blow is simply the embouchure of the wady dahab fiumara of gold the name is properly applied to the submaritime section of the valley draining the eastern flanks of the socalled mount sinai this great watercourse breaks through the gháts which always fringing similar peninsulas peak to the south it reaches the gulf at a shallow sag marked by a line of palms the centre of three they are fed by their several nullahs and are watered with the brackish produce of sundry wells the statio malefida is defended to the north by a short sandspit and a submerged reef and southwards by a projection of sandstone conglomerate the latter running from northeast to southwest subtends this part of the coast and serves to build up the land after a few years the débris swept down by the watercourses will warp up the shallows dividing shore from outlier such in fact seems to be the general origin of these sandspits beginning as coralline reefs they have been covered with conglomerates and converted into terra firma by the rubbish shot out by the wadymouths  the southern port ginái is formed by a bend in the reef which sweeps round from east to southwest like a scorpions tail the natural seawall at once dangerous and safetygiving protects to the south and southeast diabolitos of black rock visible only at high tide inshore the sickleshaped breakwater runs by east to southwest becoming a sandy hook and enclosing a basin whose depth ranges from seven to twelve fathoms its approach from the south is clean and the western opening is protected by the tall screen of coast cliffs the jebel elginái whose deepblack porphyritic gorge seemingly prolongs that of midianite tayyib ism this is a section of the jibál elsamghi the coastrange which extends as far north as the wady watir the dockport so useful when the terrible norther blows has an admirable landmark visible even from sináfir island and conspicuous at the entrance of the gulf where the sandy slopes of southeastern sinailand end appears a large white blot apparently supporting a block built like a bastion upon a tall hill of porphyritic trap we called this remnant of material harder than the rest burj eldahabthe tower hill of dahab i have been minute in describing the golden harbour scant justice has been done to it by the hydrographic chart and it will prove valuable when the makna mines are opened ahmed kaptán vainly attempted soundingshe was too ill to work wellsteds identification of the site with eziongeber ii ix and the reef with the rockledge which wrecked jehosaphats fleet has one great objectionno ruins are known to exist near iten121  the formation of this part of sinai as far as we can see from the shore reflects in wilder forms and more abrupt lines the opposite coast of midian there is however the important difference that the secondaries and the quartzveins there so important are here wanting the skeletons of mountain and hill appear as if prolonged under water the ruddy syenite is dyked and veined by the familiar network of greenblack porphyritic trap the filons are disposed in parallels striking northsouth with a little easting the dip is westerly about 35 degrees mag and the thickness extends to hundreds of feet often forming a foundation for the upper cliff the subaerial parts are the same warty and pimply growth which appears on the other side nothing could be more wearisome to the alpine climber than such a country he would scale the peaks and ridges for fifty feet to descend thirty on the other side and the frequent wadys ankledeep in loose sand generally end in steep stony couloirs the watercourses whose broad mouths are scattered with thin green contain pebbles and rolled quartzes including fine specimens of the crystallized variety  we landed after an hours row in the gig at the central or main line of palms and on the banks of wady dahab here a full mile wide we found the works of man like those of nature a copy of makná the date trees and clumps are hedgeclosed two scatters of ushash tabernacles show round towers of rough stone broken and patched with palmfrond and further north of the golden valley a few old arab graves have been weathered into mere heaps of large stones these are the kubur elnasárá nazarenes graves of burckhardten122 a name apparently forgotten by the present generation we vainly sought and asked after ruins of old however dízahab might have served to disembark cargo which by taking the landroute northwards as the christian pilgrims still do from elnuwaybi would avoid the dangerous headwaters of elakabah nor could we believe with pocockeen123 that the place derived its name from the mica shining like gold his theory is stultified by the fact that mica is by no means a prominent feature even had the ancients been so ignorant as to be deceived by it  the people were by no means communicative an elderly man with a red turban and sword by side hurried away from us when we addressed him leaving his middleaged wife to follow with a babe on shoulder and a boy in hand she also refused to speak waving her hand by way of reply to every question at last a semicivilized being acquainted with the convent of st catherine selím bin husayn of the muzaynah tribe satisfied our curiosity in view of tobacco and offered a rudely stuffed ibexhead for a shilling in the evening our fishermen visited the reef which supplied admirable rockcod a bream  called sultan elbahr and marján a sciæna but they neglected the fine sirinjah sponges which here grow two feet long the night was dark and painfully still showing nought but the youngest of moons and the gloomiest silhouettes of spectral mountains  we set out at seven am on the next day when an azyab or southeasterly wind was promised by the damp air the slaty sea and the gloomy nimbi on the hilltops a small party landed after two hours steaming in search of quartz which proved to be chloritic sandstones and limestones in the broad valley they found a few muzayni families with their camels sheep and goats these unfortunates had no tents sleeping under the trees they were desperate beggars and although halfstarved they asked a napoleon for a kid declaring that such was its price at the quarantine station of tor here the errors of the hydrographic chart which have been copied literally by the latest and best popular books such as professor palmers desert of the exodus began to excite our astonishment for instance ras kusayr the short one becomes ras arserwhat a name for a headland a good survey will presently become a sine quâ non unfortunately ahmed kaptán was suffering so much that i could not ask him to make solar observations while the rest of us had other matters in hand it was a great disappointment where so much useful work remains to be done  hereabouts the sterile horrors of the hideous sinaitic shore seem to reach their climax the mountains become huge rubbishheaps without even colour to clothe their indecently nude forms and each strives with its neighbour for the prize of repulsiveness the valleys are mere dustshunts that shoot out their rubbish stones gravel and sand in a solid flow like discharges of lava and as jebel mazhafah on the opposite coast is the apex of the visible eastern gháts so beyond this point the sinaitic seachain of mountains begins to decline into mere hills while longer sandpoints project seawards such is the near the real aspect of what viewed from makná appears a scene in fairyland decked and dight in heavenly hues of blue and purple and rosy light       where the bald blear skull of the desert           with golden mountains is crowned  the first sign of a change of formation appeared near the lower southern nuwaybi the little spring which the chart calls wasit here the shore shows blots of deadwhite and mauvered in which our engineer at once detected quartz seeing it prolonged in straight horizontal lines and the red overlying the white i suspected kaolin and the normal tauá coloured clays my conjecture was confirmed on the next day hereabouts wellsted ii 151 also remarked the colouring of the hills which resemble those of sherm some of a deepblue tinge and others streaked with a brilliant red and violet we then doubled a long sandspit running out to sea eastward and forming on the north a deep bay well protected from the souther whilst several lines of reef and shallow to the north defend it from the angry bora this anchorage is known to the pilots as wásit and it occupies the southern half of the bay the northern half and its palmgroves being called the upper nuwaybi about wásit the datepalms are scattered and the large sanddrifts ever threaten to bury them alive behind it yawns the great gash wady watír which shows its grand lines even from the opposite side of the gulf this is the route by which christian pilgrims from syria make the sinai monastery rounding on camels the northern end of elakabah the main valley receives from the north the wady elayn which can be reached in half a day from the south distant one whole march comes the wady elhazrah this is doubtless the hazeroth of the exodus meaning the fenced enclosures of a pastoral people and a modern traveller figures and describes it as the most beautiful and romantic landscape in the desert at least so said the lately shipped guide mabruk ibn sulayyim elmuzayni  after a run of six hours and thirty minutes  thirty miles we cast anchor off wásit there was nothing to see ashore save some wretched muzaynah two males and three females helpmates meet for them living like savages on fish and shellmolluscs drinking brackish water and sleeping in the bush rather than take the trouble to repair the huts they have no sheep but a few camels and by way of boats they use catamarans composed of two palmtrunks their homemade hooks resemble the schoolboys crooked pin yet these starvelings would not fetch specimens of the white stuff distant perhaps two direct miles of crosscut seen near nuwaybi and still visible they also refused without preliminary bakhshísh to show or even to tell where certain ruins concerning which they spoke or romanced are found in their hills and yet there are theologians who would raise poverty the most demoralizing of all conditions to the rank of an ecclesiastical virtue  at 6 30 am on the next day the mukhbir stood eastwards to avoid the northern reef presently we passed the upper nuwaybi a creeklet to the northwest of wásit with a straggling line of palms fed by the huge wady muzayríj from this point to the akabah head all the coast is clean of man the jibál elsamghi now become the sinaitic jibál elshafah lip mountains the latter stretching northwards to the hajjroad and forming the western wall of the arabah valley whose name they assume jibál elarabah the scene abruptly shifts a mottle of clouds sheds moving shadows over the hillcrests and relieves them from the appalling monotony of yesterday brilliant rainbow hues red green mauve purple yellow and white clays gleam in the lowlands and form dwarf bluffs while inland peering above the granites the syenites and the porphyries of the coast pale quoins and naked cones again show the familiar secondary formation of midianitish makná we were not surprised to hear that sulphur had been found in the gypsum of these eastern gháts of sinai when a jebel elkibít approached by the wady suwayr was pointed out to us the natural deduction is that the brimstone formation is like the turquoise the copper and the manganese a continuation of the beds that gave a name to mafkaland while the metalliferous strata round in horseshoeform the head of elakabah and run down the arabian shore till they become parallel with those subtending the seaboard of africa  the view of the eastern or midianite coast was even more varied and suggestive far inland and tinged lightblue by distance rose the sharp jagged and sawlike crests of elsharaf under which the hajjcaravan wends its weary way thus escaping the mountains which dip perpendicularly into the sea then come the broad and sandy slopes here and there streaked with dark ridges spanned by the sultáni or sultans highroad and stretching from the gulf to the inner heights the latter are no longer a double parallel chain they bend from southsoutheast to northnorthwest and become the jibál elshará anciently mount seir in fact the eastern retainingwall of the great wady arabah evidently they are primary but a white and purple patch visible from afar suggested a secondary remnant several of the peaks especially the blue block elyitm appeared to be of great height we all remarked its towering stature and trifid headpiece apparently upwards of five thousand feet high before we had heard the tale attached to it abreast of us and on the shore lie the large inlet and little islet elhumayzah the surveyors have abominably corrupted it to omeider north of it a palm grove lining the mouth of a broad wady which snakes high up among the sands and stones denotes the hajjstation elhakl hagul backed by tall arenaceous buttresses  after six hours  twentytwo knots and a half we anchored in the deep channel about threequarters of a kilometre wide that separates the sinaitic mainland from the northern one of the only two islands known in the akabah gulf a scrap of rock crowned with picturesque grey ruins the jezírat faraún of the maps the isle of pharaoh concerning whom traditions are still current it is known to the akabites only as jebel elkalah or forthill hence elgraa in laborde and jezírat elq reieh in arconatien124 burckhardt alone mentions that the ruins are known as eldayrthe convent this human lair is encircled by barrierreefs of coralline broad to the southwest and large in scattered places eastward they form a shallow walllike ledge beyond which blue water at once begins the islandformation is that of the opposite coasts midian and sinai grey granite dyked with decaying porphyritic trap and everywhere veined with white and variouscoloured quartzes the shape is a long oval of about three hundred and twenty by one hundred and fiftytwo metres a saddleback with two stony heads the higher to the north rising a hundred feet or so above sealevel pommel and cantle are connected by a low seat a few yards of isthmus and the three divisions all strongly marked bear buildings the profile from east and west shows four groups to the extreme north a tower backed by the castle donjon on the knob of granite here and there scarped the works upon the thread of isthmus and the walls and bastions crowning the southern knob which being lower is even more elaborately cut to a perpendicular  we landed upon the eastern side of the islet rock where the trunk of a broken mole is covered in rear by a ruined work here being most liable to attack the fortifications are strongest whereas on the west side only a single wall now strewn on the ground with square burj at intervals defends the little boatharbour the latter appears at present in the shape of a fishpond measuring sixty by forty metres sunk below sealevel fed by percolation and exceedingly salt to the east of this water black cineraceous earth shows where the smith had been at work we applied the quarrymen to sift it without other results but bits of glass copper and iron nails  the pier leads to a covered way enabling the garrison safely to circulate round the base of the islet behind it a path much broken and cumbered by débris of the walls winds up the southern face of the northern hill which supports the body of the place it meets another track from the west and a small work defends their junction below it outside the walls we found a well sunk about eight feet in the granite and cemented with fine lime the red plaster in places remaining  above this pit a mihráb or prayerniche fronting meccahwards more exactly 175 degrees mag shows the now ruinous mosque the bedawi declare that it was built by a pasha higher again upon a terreplein are lines of tanks laid out with all that lavishness of labour which distinguishes similar works in syria it is however difficult to assign any date to these constructions the cisterns were explored by mr clarke and lieutenant amir who dug into and planned them they descended by ropes although there are two flights of steps to the west and the southwest the tanks are built up from the base with blocks one foot nine inches long seven inches deep of rubbish were cleared away before reaching the floor composed of black stones bedded in layers of cement above and below and resting upon the groundrock the diggings yielded only big pieces of salt fallen from the walls and a broken handmill of basalt the sides are supported by pilasters of cut stone and the crown by four pillars in a double row the dividing arches according to the plan are not symmetrical hard by measuring twelve metres by twelve is the quarry whence the stone was taken and near it stands the normal egyptian pigeontower with its nestniches  the donjon or body is defended by an enceinte opening northwards upon a large yard where doubtless the garrison mustered and whence a flight of steps leads to the wicket the inside of the works shows the roofless partywalls still standing and the ground is scattered over with the remains of many different races there are drums of columns and fragments of marble pillars but no sign of an inscription even in the upper ramparts two epochs are distinctly traceable the mediæval and the modern the lower ashlar mostly yellow grit is cut and carefully cemented the upper part is generally of rough dry stone the plutonic formations of the islet heaped up with scanty care the embrasures are framed with decaying palmtrunks the loopholes belong partly to the age of archery and nothing can be ruder than the battlements placed close together as if to be manned by bowmen while in not a few places there are the remains of matting between the courses at the highest part we found another carefully cemented sehrij or underground cistern with two sharptopped arches divided by a tall column saracenic certainly and not doricen125 above it a circular aperture arched round with the finest bricks serves to lighten the superstructure it communicates to the north with a hammám whose plan is easily traced by the double flues and earthenware tubes well made and mortared together here we found inscribed on the plaster arona linant 22 mars 1846  the southern knob of the islet supports similar but inferior constructions still more ruinous withal its quarry is on the lower slopes and its granitic base has also been scarped seawards two stout walls twelve feet thick below and six above crossing the length of the rock from north to south here meet in a burj which shows signs of fine tiles on an upper floor whilst a third wall forms a southern spine bisecting the tail of the jezírat the castle is much more dilapidated than when sketched by ruppell the first frank who visited elakabah in 1826 his illustration p 214 of ruinen auf der insel emrag shows a single compact building in good preservation the towers being round when all are square and it is garnished with the impossible foreground and background of his epoch the former enlivened with a noahsark camel being placed quite close when it is distant some ten miles in the german naturalists time the now desolate island was occupied by die emradi a tribe which he suspected to be jewish and of which he told the queerest tales i presume they are the imrámhuwaytát of elhakl and the hismá wellsteds short description ii ix is still correct as in 1838  the castle is evidently european built during the days when the crusaders held elakabah but it probably rests upon roman ruins and the latter perhaps upon egyptian remains of far older date it protected one section of the oldest overland route when the islet formed the key of the gulfhead it subsequently became an eyrie whence its robber knights and baronsincluding possibly john the christian ruler of akabah ad 630 and long after him madcap rainald de chatillon ad 1182could live comfortably and sally out to plunder merchants and pilgrims the saracenic buildings may date as the popular superstition has it from the reign of saláh eldín saladin who in ad 1167 cleared his country of the infidel invader by carrying ships on camelback from cairo later generations of thieves pirates and fishermen naturally made it their refuge and abode i hardly anticipate for it great things in the immediate future although it has been proposed for a coaldepôt  after a day given to tubetinkering with tompions stays plugs plates and wedges to the distraction of the ships carpenter and blacksmith steam was coaxed up and at 915 am february 7th we ran northwards through the deep narrow channel rounding the upper end of the pharaohnic islet here the encircling wall is defended by two square burj to the northeast and to the northwest flanking what is probably the main entrance on the sinaitic mainland to port the broad mouth of the wady elmasri leads to the nakb the rocky pass which so much dreaded till repaired by abbas pasha is popularly said to be described in elakabahthe steep the bedawin however declare that the locale is so called because the gulf here heels yakkab elbahr that is comes to an end at the head of the sea the confused mass of the sinaitic mountains range themselves in line to the west fronting its sister wall the grand block elshará seir while in the middle lies the southern section of the ghor the noble and memorious wady elakabah supposed to have given a name to arabiaen126 the surfacewater still rolls down it after rains and the mirage veiling the valleysole prolongs the gulfwaters far to the north their bed in the old geologic ages the view was charming to us for the first time since leaving suez we saw the contrast of perpendicular and horizontal of height and flat nothing could be more refreshing more gladdening to the eye after niente che montagne as the poor italian described the morea than the soft sweeps and the level lines of the hollow plain it was enjoyable as a heavy shower after an egyptian summer on the next day also the play of light and shade and the hide and seek of sunray and watercloud gave the view a cachet of its own i am sorry to see that scientific geologist mr john milne fgsen127 proposing to cut through the two to five hundred feet of elevation which separate the gulf from the dead sea some thirteen hundred feet below water level does he reflect that he simply proposes to obliterate the whole lower jordan to bury tiberias and its lake about eight hundred feet under the waves in fact to overwhelm half the holy land in a brandnew nineteenthcentury deluge the deluge of milne  all were delighted at having reached our northernmost point without another visit from elayli after one hour and thirtyfive minutes  seven miles the mukhbir anchored in twelve fathoms of water a couple of hundred yards off the fort and its dependent group of browngrey mud buildings half concealed by the luxuriant palms the roads are safe enough here the north wind has not yet gained impetus the southeaster is bluffed off by a long point and in only the strongest gharbí westers ships must run for refuge under the cliffs of sinai  this is not the place to enter into the history of elath ailat ailah Ælana akabah or akabataylah robinson i 250254 and a host of others give ample and reliable details suffice it to say that the site is mentioned in the wanderings deut ii 8 which must not be confounded with the exodus it is subsequently connected with the goldfleet i kings ix 26 etc and conquered by rezin king of syria bc 740 it was permanently lost to the jews 2 kings xvi 6 under the romans this great station upon the overland between the southernmost nabathæan port leukè kóme and petra the western capital was a præsidium held by the tenth legion and a highway connected it with gaza ghazzah measuring one hundred and twenty direct miles when the isthmus of suez numbers only ninetyfive in christian times it had a prince and a bishop and under mohammed and the early moslems it preserved an importance which lasted till the days of the crusaders elmakrízi describes its ruins and here places the northern frontier of the hejaz in his day madyan was thus a section of the tihámat elhejaz the maritime region of the moslems holy land  a group of camels had gathered on the shore and inland lay a mob of pilgrims the hajj elmagháribah numbering some three thousand northwest africans an equally large division had already preceded them to suez letters from egypt assured us that cholera had broken out at meccah and jeddah killing in both places ninetyeight per diem here the pilgrims swore by their allah that all were and ever had been in perfect health it is every mans business to ignore the truth to hide the sick and to bury the dead out of sight hard swearing however did not prevent the hajj undergoing a long quarantine before entering suez the english journals had reported another disaster now that the sultáns power is collapsing the most powerful bedaween tribes are rising because their subsidies are withheld for weeks the great pilgrimtraffic of autumn  add the other three seasons was arrested by them and even between medina and mecca the road is unsafe of this i could hear nothing  we awaited on board the departure of the pauper and infected mogrebbins when the place was clear we fired a gun and after an answer of three i received the visits of the fort officials they were civility itself they immensely admired our two splendid buttons of poor iron and they privily remarked with much penetration that the colour was that of brass they were in truth far wiser than we had been with them came mohammed ibn jád not iját elalawí of the alawlyyinhuwaytát who styles himself shaykh of elakabah he is remarkable for frank countenance pleasant manners and exceeding greed he was gorgeously arrayed in an overall abáyah of red silk and gold thread gasab covering a similar cloak of black wool besides which a longsleeved egyptian caftán striped stuff of silk and wool invested his cotton kamís and libás bagbreeches to his akál or fillet of white fleecy wool hung a talisman his khuff ridingboots were of red morocco and his swordscabbard was covered with the same material the arab ever loves scarlet and all varieties of the sanguine hue are as dear to him as to the british soldier  we held sundry long confabs with shaykh mohammed who seemed to know the neighbourhood unusually well he declared that there were ruins but no trees at ayn elghadyan distant one days march up the wady elarabah and lying near the western wall this is the place first identified by robinson who says nothing about the remains with eziongeber while dean stanley sinai etc p 85 opines that we have no means of fixing the position of the giants shoulderbladeen128 josephus antiq viii 6 4 places it near Ælana and the present distance from the sea like that of heroopolis shaykh elajrúd from suez may show the rise of the wady elarabah within historic times the shaykh assured us that marú was to be found everywhere among the hills east of elakabah and mr milne beke p 405 brought from the very summit of the true mount sinai jebel elyitm a fine piece of quartz the same kind of stone as the brazilian pebbles of which they make the best spectacles we carried off a specimen of native copper from the sinaitic jebel and wady raddádí some six hours to the northwest of the fort it is found strewed upon the ground but not in veins  the stone looked so new that we concluded it to be the work of later generations and the traces of smelting furnaces at old elath confirmed the idea  shaykh mohammed who boasted that his tribe could mount five hundred horsesby which understand fiveoffered his safeguard to the hismá three easy marches without pass or climax up the wady yitm to the east and behind the range elshará he made the region begin northwards at one day south of elmaán the fort lying to the eastsoutheast of petra and he confirmed the accounts of mabrúk the guide who was never tired of expatiating upon its merits the fountains flow in winter in summer the wells are never dry the people especially the huwaytát are kind and hospitable sheep are cheap as dirt at jebel saur a maghrabi magician raised a kidr dahab golden pot but his incense failing at the critical moment it sank before yielding its treasures  pointing northeastwards to the majestic pile in the shara or seir mountains the jebel elyitmen129 a corruption of elyatim the shaykh told us a tale that greatly interested us it appears i have said a remarkable formation from whose group of terminal domes and pinnacles the tomb of aaron on mount hor isen130 they say visible and it is certainly the highest visible peak of the grand wall that forms the right bank of the wady yitm thus it is but one of a long range and the bedawin visit it to make sacrifice according to universal custom at the tomb of a certain shaykh bákir here some years ago came an old man and a young man in a steamer erin belonging to his highness the khediv the former told the arabs that in his books the height was called the jebel elnúr mountain of light a title which apparently he had first applied to the jebel ellauz and the latter climbed to the mountaintop after that they went their way  i quite agree with my lamented friend dr beke that it is an enormous blunder to transfer midian the east country to the west of elarabah and to place it south of the south country elnegeb gen xx i i own that it is ridiculous to make the lawgiver lead his fugitives into a veritable culdesac then a centre of egyptian conquest evidently we have still to find the true mount sinai if at least it be not a myth pure and simple the profound egyptologist dr heinrich brugschbey observes that the vulgar official site lies to the south of and far from the line taken by the beni israil and that the papyri show no route leading to it whilst many have remarked that the sinai of the exodus is described as a single isolated mountain or hill not as one projection from a range of heightsen131 i would also suggest that the best proof of how empirical is the actual identification will be found in the fact that the jewsexcept only the rev jos wolff 1821have never visited nor made pilgrimages to what ought to be one of their holiest of holy places this crucial point has been utterly neglected by the officers of the ordnance survey of sinai it is evident that jebel serbal dates only from the early days of koptic christianity that jebel musá its greek rival rose after the visions of helena in the fourth century whilst the building of the convent by justinian belongs to ad 527 ras sufsafah its rival to the north is an affair of yesterday and may be called the invention of robinson and jebel katerina to the south is the property of ruppell thus the oftquoted legends of the sinaitic arabs are mere monkish traditions adopted by ishmaelitic ignorance the great lawgiver probably led his horde of fugitive slaves over the plains of elnegeb and eltih north of the socalled sinaitic mountainblocks marching in small divisions like those of a modern bedawi tribe and we know from the latest surveys that the land now alternately a fiery or frozen wilderness was once well supplied with wood and water the true mount sinai is probably some unimportant elevation in the desert named by moderns after the wanderings  dr beke i am persuaded is right in denying that mount sinai occupies the site at present assigned to it but i cannot believe that he has found it in the jebel elyitm near elakabah his mount bárghir is evidently a corruption of the wali on the summit shaykh bákira common arab name his mountain of light is a term wholly unknown to the arabs except so far as they would assign the term to any saintly place the sounds heard in the mountain like the firing of a cannon is a legend applied to two other neighbouring places all the bedawin still sacrifice at the tombs of their santons at the little white building which covers the reputed tomb of aaron sheep are slaughtered and boiled in a huge black cauldron the pile of large rounded boulders bearing cut sinaitic inscriptions p 423 are clearly wusúm these tribalmarks which the highly imaginative m de saulcy calls planetary signs are found throughout midian the name of the wady is i have said not elithem but elyitm a very different word lastly the mountain eretówa or ertówa p 404 is probably a corruption of eltaur elhismá the inaccessible wall of the plateau which dr beke calls jebel hismá my old friend with his usual candour and straightforwardness honestly admitted that he had been egregiously mistaken with respect to the volcanic character of the true mount sinai but without the eruption the fire and smoke theory what becomes of his whole argumenten132 save for the death of my friend i should have greatly enjoyed the comical side of his subject the horror and disgust with which he one of the greatest of geographical innovators regards a younger rival theory the exodist innovation of dr heinrich brugschbey the latter is the first who has rescued the march of the children of israel from the condition of mere guesswork described by the rev mr holland  under the guidance of our new acquaintances we rowed to the site of elath which evidently extended all round the gulfhead from northeast to northwest linant and laborde voyage de larabie petrée etc paris 1830 confine it to the western shore near the mouth of the wady elarabah and make eziongeber to face it as suggested by the writings of the hebrews disembarking at the northern palmclump we inspected eldár the old haltingplace of the pilgrimcaravan before new akabah was founded the only ruinsen133 are large blocks under the clearest water and off a beach of the softest sand which would make the fortune of a bathingplace in europe further eastward lies an enclosed dateorchard called elhammám the two pits in it are said to be wells but i suspect the treasureseeker inland and to the north rise the mounds and tumuli the sole remains of ancient elath once the port of petra which is distant only two dromedary marches during rainfloods the site is an island to the west flows the surfacewater of the wady elarabah and eastward the drainage of the wady yitm has dug a welldefined bed a line of larger heaps to the north shows where according to the people ran the city wall finding it thickly strewed with scoriae old and new i decided that this was the siyághah or smiths quarter between it and the sea the surface is scattered with glass shards and slag i inquired in vain for written stones and for the petroleum reported to exist in the neighbourhood  shaykh mohammed declared that of old a chain stretched from the pharaohnic islandcastle to the jebel elburayj or kasr elbedawi on the midianite shore this chain is a lieu commun of eastern legends the bedawis castle is mentioned by robinson and burckhardt syria p 510 as lying one hour south of elakabah moreover the wady yitm whose upper bed shows two ruins was closed at the narrow above the mouth by a fortified wall of stone and lime thus cutting off all intercourse with the interior the bedawin declare it to be the work of king hadíd iron who thus kept out the bení hilál of elnejd we were shown large earthdams thrown across the embouchure of the torrent to prevent the floods injuring the palmgroves of new akabah these may date from ancient days when the old city here extended its southeastern suburb as usual they have become a cemetery modern and moslem and on the summit of the largest the holy shaykh elgirmí jirmí still names his ruined tomb  walking round the eastern bay where the ubiquitous black sand striped the yellow shore we observed that the tide here rises only one footen134 whereas at suez it may reach a metre and a half to seven feet according to the chart the springs attain four feet at omeider elhumayzah some nineteen direct knots to the south and in the sharm yáhárr we found them about one metre presently we entered by wooden doors with locks and keys the carefully kept palmgroves walled with pisé and dry stone wells were being sunk and a depth of nine to ten feet gave tolerably sweet water striking the broad northern trail which leads to the wady yitm and to the upper elarabah still a favourite campingground of the tribesen135 we reached the modern settlement which has something of the aspect of a townlet not composed like elmuwaylah of a single house the women fled at our approach as we threaded the alleys formed by the mud tenements  the forten136 is usually supposed to have been built by sultan selim i in ad 1517 or three years before his death after he had subdued the military aristocracy of the mamlúks who had ruled egypt for three centuries much smaller than that of elmuwaylah it is the normal affair an enceinte once striped red and white curtains flanked by four burj all circular except the new polygon to the northwest and a huge gloomy maingateway fronting north and flanked by two bastions on the proper right side is a circle of stone bearing without date the name of sultán selim khan elfátih who first laid out the pilgrimroute along the red sea shore inside the dark cool porch a large inscription bears the name elashraf kansúr sicen137 elghori the last but one of the circassian mamlúk kings of egypt who was defeated and slain by the turkish conqueror near aleppo in ad 1501 above it stand two stone shields dated ah 992  ad 15831584 in the southern wall of the courtyard is the mosque fronted by a large deep well dug they say during the building of the fort it still supplies the whole hajjcaravan with warmish sweet water on the ground lies a good brass gun with arabic inscription and numerals and the towers commanding the little kitchengardens outside the fortwall are armed with old iron carronades the garrison consisting of half a dozen gunners and a few bashbuzuks looks pale bloodless and unwholesome the heats of summer are almost unsupportable and akabah has the name of a little hell moreover they eat drink smoke sleep chat quarrel and never take exercise the officers complained sadly that i had made them walk perhaps a mile round the bayhead and yet they have within two days of sharp ride that finest of sanitaria the hismá which extends as far north and south as they please to go  i at once made arrangements for a dromedarypost to suez and wrote officially to prince husayn pasha requesting that his highness would exchange the mukhbir for a steamer less likely to drown herself moreover the delay at magháir shuayb had exhausted our resources and the expedition required a months additional rations for men and mules the application was it will appear granted in the most gracious manner with as little delay as possible and my wife who had reached cairo saw that the execution of the order was not put off till the end of march messrs voltéra brothers were also requested to forward another instalment of necessaries and comforts and they were as punctual and satisfactory as before for this postal service and by way of propitiatory present shaykh mohammed received ten dollars of which probably two were disbursed we therefore parted fast friends he giving me an especial invitation to his home in the hismá and i accepting it with the firm intention of visiting him as soon as possible  meanwhile mr clarke and ali marie were busy with buying up such stores as elakabah contains and the officers of the fort who stayed with us to the last were profuse in kind expressions and in little gifts which as usual cost us double their worth in these lands one must expect to be done as surely as in italy what the process will be no one knows till it discloses itself but all experts feel that it is in preparation      note on the supplies to be bought at elakabah    the following is a list of the stores with their prices it must be borne in mind that the hajjcaravan was passing at the time we visited elakabah  a large sheep cost half a napoleon the same was the price of a small sheep with a kid  fowls seventyone bought thirteen pence each pigeons sixpence a head  eggs sixty two for threepence  tobacco 8 lbs coarse and uncut but welcome to the bedawin one shilling per pound  samn liquefied butter for the kitchen also one shilling per pound this article is always dear in arabia but much cheaper than in egypt  pomegranates fifty four shillings a hundred  onions one kantar or cwt one sovereign  thinskinned syrian raisins fivepence per pound  dried figs twopence halfpenny per pound  matches sixteen boxes three halfpence per box  a small quantity of grain may be bought lentils revalenta arabica are to be had in any quantity and they make an admirable travelling soup unfortunately it is supposed to be a food for fellahs and the cook shirks itthe same is the case with junk salt pork and peasepudding on board an english cruiser sour limes are not yet in season they will be plentiful in april a little garden stuff may be had for salads the list of deficiencies is great including bread and beef potatoes ráki and all forms of diffusable stimulants  here as at cairo the piastre is of two kinds metallic debased silver and nonmetallic government pays in the former which is called ságh coin and the same is the term throughout egypt the value fluctuates but 9712 may be assumed  one sovereign english and one hundred to the egyptian lira the second kind used for small purchases is not quite half the value of the former 205100 in northwestern arabia it is called abyas white and tarífá tariff the latter term in cairo always signifying the ságh or metallic the dodges of the shroffs or moneychangers make housekeeping throughout egypt a study of arithmetic they cannot change the value of gold

elakabah to elmuwaylahthe shipwreck             escapedrésumé of the northern journey    i resolved upon hastening back with all speed to elmuwaylah finishing by the way our work of quartzprospecting on the akabah gulf thus far it had been a success we heard of marú in all directions but all had not gone equally well we had already on two occasions been prevented by circumstances from visiting the mysterious hismá and we now determined to devote all our energies to its exploration  two heavy showers having fallen during the dark hours on february 8th aurora looked as if she had passed a very bad night indeed the mistrack trailed along the rock slopes and rested upon the wadysands the mountains veiled their heads in clouds and       above them lightnings to and fro ran coursing evermore           till like a red bewildered map the skies were scribbled oer  meanwhile in the northwest and southwest we sawrare thing in arabiairis holding two perfect bows at the same time not to speak of wind dogs zephyrus the wester here a noted bad character rose from his rocky couch strong and rough beating down the mercury to 56 degrees f after an hour he made way for eurus and the latter was presently greeted by boreas in one of his most boisterous and blustering moods  we steamed off with only a single stoppage for half an hour to cool the enginebearings at 730 am and after one mile we passed on the arabian side a ruin called kasr elbintthe girls palace beyond it lies the kasr elbedawi alias elburayj of the little tower or bastion the traditional holdingpier of the great chain when wellsted ii 146 says here ie at the kasr elbedawi i am told there is a chain extending from the shore to a pier built in the seahe evidently misunderstood the arabs the eastern coast of elakabah begins with an abrupt mountainwall like that which subtends the whole of the sinai shore till it trends south of the mínat eldahab after three miles the heights fall into a stony sandy plain which rises regularly as a rake or stageslope to the shará seir range which closes the horizon after two hours and forty five minutes we passed into the fine open treacherous bay of hagul elhakl distant thirteen knots from elakabah fort to which it is the nearest caravanstation on the northeast and stretching eastward are the high horse or dorsum and the big buttresses of the long broad wady which comes winding from the southeast they appear to be a body of sand but as usual on this coast the superficial sheet the skin hardly covers the syenite and porphyritic trap that form the charpente between west and south a long spit high inland and falling low till where its sandstone blufflet meets the sea proves to be the base of a large and formidable reef which extends in verdigris patches over the blue waters of the bay it is not mentioned by wellsted ii 149 who describes hagool on the arabian shore as a small boatharbour much exposed to the northerly winds the embouchure of the wady nourishes four distinct clumps of datetrees well walled round a few charred and burnt the most of them green and luxuriant these lines are broken by the channels which drain the surface water and between the two western sections appear the ragged frondhuts not a soul was seen on shore  the wind blew great guns outside the bay and the inside proved anything but calm as the water was fiftyeight fathoms deep near the coast our captain found no moorings for his ship except to the dangerous reef and we kept drifting about in a way which would have distracted sensitive nerves i had been told of ruins and tumuli at elhakl which denote according to most authorities the mesogeian town greekancale ptolemy vi 7 27 places this oppidum mediterraneum between mákna or maína madyan and madiáma magháir shuayb the old capital  unwilling however to risk the safety of the gunboat where nothing was to be expected beyond what we had seen at elakabah i resolved after waiting half an hour not to land the sambúk received a cargo of quarrymen and sacks in order to ship at makná the argentiferous galena and other rocks left by lieutenant yusuf and m philipin upon the shore and that done she was directed to rejoin us at tírán island as long as the norther coursed high she beat us hollow in the afternoon however when the gale as usual abated she fell off perhaps purposely not wishing to pass a night in the open by sunset her white sail had clean disappeared having slipped into some snug cove  the arabian shore is here of simpler construction than that of sinai consequently the chart has had a better chance the mukhbir resumed her way southwards in glorious weather a fresh breath blowing from the north and fleecy clouds variegating the sky which was almost as blue as the waves after six miles and a half from elhakl and nearly twenty from elakabah she ran to the west of elhumayzah island the omasír of wellsted ii 149 between which and the mainland is a well sheltered berth it is a great contrast with the hill of the fort the pharaohnic rock this lump some eighty feet high built of secondary gypsum and yellow serpentine like the coast behind it gleaming deadly white pale as a corpse in the gorgeous sunshine and utterly bare except for a single shrub it is based upon a broad darkcoloured barrierreef local tradition here places the kasr elbedawíyyah palace of the bedawi woman or girl but we saw neither sign of building nor trace of population in the second island which the gulf elakabah owns  we then passed sundry uninteresting features and night fell upon us off jebel tayyib ism where familiar scenes began to present themselves the captain had already reduced speed from four and a half to three knots his object being to reach the bugház or gulfmouth after dawn but as midnight drew near it became necessary to ride out the furious gale with the gunboats head turned northwards m lacaze a stouthearted little man worked half the night at the engine assisting mr duguid about four am february 8th a lull in the storm allowed her to resume her southerly course but two hours afterwards an attempt to make the makná shore placing her broadside on to the wind created much confusion in the crockery and commotion among the men always a lively craft she now showed a vokeslike agility for as is ever the case she had no ballast and who would take the trouble to ship a few tons of sand at such moments the engine was our sole standby had it played one of its usual tricks the mukhbir humanly speaking was lost that is she would have been swamped and waterlogged as for setting sail it was not till our narrow escape that i could get the canvas out of stowage in the hold  as the morning wore on the gulf became even rougher with its deep and hollow waves they seemed to come from below as if bent upon hoisting us in the air the surfacewater shivered and the upper spray was swept off by the north wind which waxed colder and more biting as we steered sunwards the sinaitic side now showed its long slopes and at 945 am we passed the palms of the nebíkí anchorage some six miles from the gate on the shore of midian south of the dark fahísát mountains four several buttresses of gypsum decreasing in size as they followed one another eastwards trended diagonally away from the sea this part of the arabian coast ends in a thin point the maps call it ras fartak and the pilots shaykh hamíen138 from a holy mans tomb to which pious visitation is made the other landtongue adjoining to the south is known as the umm ruús or mother of heads i cannot find out whence ruppell borrowed his omel hassanie umm elhassání  as we approached the ugly gape of the formidable gulf the waves increased in size and coursed to all directions as if distorted by the sunken reefs the eastern jamb is formed by tírán island the western by the sandy ras nasráni whose glaring tawny slope is dotted with dark basaltic cones detached and disposed like great ninepins beyond this cape the sinaitic coast as far as ras mohammed the apex of the triangle is fretted with little indentations hence its name elshurúmthe creeks near one of these baylets wellsted chanced upon volcanic rocks which are not found in any other part of the peninsula this sporadic outbreak gives credibility to the little harrah reported to be found upon the bank of the midianitish wady sukk a hideous horrid reef dirty brown and muddy green with white horses madly charging the black diabolitos whose ugly heads form chevaux de frise a stony tongue based upon tírán island and apparently connected from the eastern coast behind extends its tip to midchannel the clear way of the dreaded bugház is easily found in the daytime at night it would be almost impossible and when midian shall be rehabilitated this reef will require a pharos  adieu small spitfire of a gulf the change from the inside to the outside of the birkat elakabah was magical we at once glided into summer seas a mosaic of turquoise and amethyst fanned by the softest of breezes the thermometer showing on deck 63 deg f perhaps the natural joy at our lucky escape from making a hole in the water caused the beauties of the weather and the glories of the scenery to appear doubly charming our captain might have saved fifteen miles by taking the short cut north of tírán island under whose shelter we required a day for boilertinkering his pilot however would not risk it and we were compelled nothing loth and little knowing what we did to round for a second time the western and southern shores  the hill of birds which some have identified with the classical island of isisen139 shows a triune profile what the brazilians call a moela or gizzard of its three peaks the lowest is the eastern and the central is the highest reaching seven hundred not a thousand feet viewed from within the gulf it is a slope of sand which has been blown in sheets up the backing hills the ground plan as seen from a balloon would represent a round head to the north a thin neck and a body rudely triangular the whole measuring a maximum of five miles in length the sandy northern circlet connected by the narrowest of isthmuses sweeping eastward forms the noted port the material is the normal secondary formation sulphates and carbonates of lime supporting modern corallines and conglomerates of shell horizontal lines of harder stone are disposed in huge steps or roads that number three to six on the flank of the western peak the manganesecoloured strata which appeared at magháir shuayb and in the rent bowels of the rughámat makná are conspicuous from the south the whole has been upheaved by syenite which again has been cut by dykes of plutonic stone trap and porphyry  at two pm we anchored in a roadstead to the southeast of the island open to every wind except the norther i had sent lieutenant amir and sundry quarrymen ashore to inspect what looked like a vein of sulphur they delayed two hours instead of a few minutes the boiler was grumbling for rest and not wishing to leave them adrift in an open boat i imprudently consented to await them in a roadstead where the coast was dangerous instead of proceeding as had been intended to the fine landlocked port naturehollowed in the eastern side of the island the old captain pitifully represented to me that his crew could not row and this i found to be generally the case ten miles with the oar would be considered a terrible corvée by the egyptian manowars man  after blowing off steam we at once went afishing the only remarkable result was the discovery that this corner of the red sea is a breedingground for sharks we had not seen one in the gulf of elakabah where last april they swarmed here however the school contained all sizes and every age and they regarded us curiously with their cats eyes large dark and yellowstriped down the middle a small specimen that had just cut its teeth was handed over to the cook despite his loudly expressed disgust the meat was somewhat mealy and shortfibred but we pronounced in committee the seadog to be thoroughly eatable when corrected by pepper garlic and worcester sauce the corallines near the shore were finely developed each bunch like a tropical tree formed a small zoological museum and they supplied a variety of animalculae including a tiny shrimp the evening saw a welldefined halo encircling the moon at a considerable distance and mr duguid quoted the scotch saw       a farawa bruchs a nearawa blast  the blast was nearer than we expected and during the rest of the journey the bruch rarely if ever deceived us yet the night was not much disturbed by the furious northerly gusts showing that the storm which we had escaped was raging in the stillvexed akabah  next morning we landed to the southwest of tíráns easternmost peak with a view of prospecting and adding to our collections on the shore about three hundred feet from the sea is a bank of dead shells which are not found on the northern or sandy end of the island near the water most of them are tenanted by paguri hermits we caught a number of crabs and small fish and we carried off a single rockoyster as yet we had not found out that the ustrídathe vulgar form of the hellenic and classical istiridiyáabounds in these seas after thirty minutes walk up the southern plane of the prism composed of gypseous and coralline rocks veins of white petrosilex resembling broken columels streaks of magnetic black sand and scatters of grit and harder stones we reached the summit of the little ridge it afforded a fine birdseye view of the splendid middle port of the false harbour of the real shoal to its southeast and of the basin which seems to form sináfir island  we now bent to the southwest here the surface is much cut and broken by sandy wadys dotted with a few straggling plants to our right was a goz or inclined arenaceous bank where the south wind had sifted the sand from the gravel disposing the former in the hollows and the latter on the crest of the ripples presently we reached a strange formation which seen from the east appears a huge vein red and rusty beginning close to the sea and crossing the body of the island from south to north while a black cone is so disposed that its southern front simulates a crater a narrow gorge opens upon a semicircular hollow lined with ochraceous or ferruginous matter in fact part of the filon which sends off fibrils in all directions the confusion of formations was startling the floor was here of white petrosilex there of grey granite variegated with squares and lozenges drops and pineapples red green neutral tinted and disposed by oxides of iron and copper in natural designs that looked artificial scattered over the bed of the upper ravine beyond the hollow were carbonates of lime ruddy brown and chocolatehued here a puddingstone there porous like basalt the calcareous sulphates were both amorphous and crystalline the latter affected by contact with plutonic matter the walls of the gash showed a medley of clay breccias disposed in every imaginable way and divided by horizontal veins of heataltered quartz a few paces further led to the head of the ravine where a tumble of huge rocks choking the bed showed that the raintorrents must at times be violent  meanwhile mr clarke and lieutenant amir had walked to the large central harbour hoping there to hit upon sweet water and some stray hutaym fishermen who would show us what we wanted they did not find even the vestige of a hut the two exploring parties saw only three birds in the isle of birds and not one of the venomous snakes mentioned at tehran by wellsted ii ix and described as measuring about thirty inches of a slender form with black and white spots we also utterly failed to discover the sulphur which was once abundant and the naphtha which according to the same authority was produced here in considerable quantities and was used by the arab mariners to pay their boats  the evening was exceptionally fine and calm and we expected on the morrow february 11th a quiet return to elmuwaylah yet a manner of presentiment induced me to summon the engineer and his native assistants and to promise the latter a liberal bakhshísh if by hard work at the boiler all night and by rigging up the ships pump instead of a donkeyengine they could steam off at dawn  unexpectedly about four am a violent sandy and misty wester began to blow and all fancied that we had set sail to the south quite the contrary the engine was still under repair the mukhbir was being tossed and rolled by the inshore set and the sequel is quickest told by an extract from my penny  written in sight of death wind roaring furiously for victims waves worse no chain can stand these sledgehammer shocks chain partsen140 and best sheetanchor with it bower and kedge anchors thrown out and drag fast stranding broadside on sharp coralline reef to leeward distant 150 yards sharks

skinning a sheep he has been wrecked four times and dont care deckpump acting poorly off in very nick of time 915 am general joy damped by broadside turned to huge billows lashed down boxes of specimens on deck and wore round safely made for sináfir followed by waves threatening to poop us howling wind tears mist to shreds second danger worse than first run into green water fangs of naked rock on both sides within biscuitthrow stumps show when the waves yawn nice position for a bandbox of old iron with much difficulty slipped into blue water rounded south end of spit and turned north into glorious sináfir bay safe anchorage in eight fathoms anchor down at 1015 am after one hour of cold sweat distance seven miles on chart nine by course mukhbir never went so fast blown like chaff before wind faces cleared up allround shaking of hands elhamdu lilláhi followed by a drink some wept for joy  the engine or rather the engineer had saved us as the saying is it was touch and gothe nearest thing i ever did see had the rotten old boiler struck work for five minutes when we were clearing out of tírán or steaming along sináfir shore nothing could have kept the ship afloat those who behaved best a fireman a boy who crept into the combustionchamber to clear it and helmsman who having been at liverpool spoke a little english were duly bakhshíshd the same reward was given by mistake to the boilermaker mohammed saíd haddád who had malingered instead of working through the night at suez he had the impudence to ask me for a shahádah testimony to his good character on the whole the conduct of the crew was worthy of all praise  in a decently equipped english steamer we should have laughed at this storm and whistled for more wind but the condition of the mukhbir quite changed the case the masts might have rolled out or she might have sprung a leak at any moment and supposing that we had escaped the crash upon the reef the huge waves and the schools of sharks our situation would have been anything but pleasant the island of tírán as has been shown is a grisly scrap of desert it has no sweet water and its three birds would not long have satisfied thirty hungry men it is far from the mainland the storm which lasted through two days was too violent for raft or boat to live and at so early a season native craft are never seen on these seas briefly a week might have elapsed before our friends at elmuwaylah who were startled by the wildness of the wind could have learned our plight or could have taken measures to relieve the castaways  sináfir island which we have to thank for giving us hospitality on two occasions consists mainly of a bay viewed by the norma verticalis it is shaped like an ugly duckling with an oval wellsted says a circular body of high ground disposed northeast to southwest and with head and neck drooping westward so as to form a mighty pier or breakwater the watery plain within is out of all proportion to the amount of terra firma the bodyprofile shows straightbacked heaps of gypsum some two hundred feet high which become quoinshaped about the middle of the isle these hillocks are connected by low strips of sand growing the usual vegetation especially the pink statice pruinosa  presently our sambúk which had also lost chain and anchor before she could run out of the storm appeared to the northwest of the bay and a pilgrimcraft bound for suez was our companion in good fortune a party landed to examine sináfir which still shows signs of a junction with tírán in days when the secondary formation was an unbroken street the whole segment of a circle extending from sharm yáhárr to northern sinai must have been dry land these reefs and islands are now the only remnants the islet itself seems lately to have been two the neck and head are one and the body is another an evident seacliff marks the junction and what appears like a wady below it is the upraised seabed of coralline to the northwest and outside this strip lies the little port defended by a network of reefs in which our sambúk had first taken refuge the bayshore bears traces of more than one wreck and in the graveyard used by the native sailor an open awning of flotsam and jetsam looks from afar like a tumbledown loghut the number of reefs and shoals shown by stripes of vivid green water promised excellent fishing and failed to keep its promise  at length after a third wasted day we managed despite a new hole in the old boiler to steam out of hospitable sináfir at 630 am on the auspicious wednesday february 13 the appearance of the mukhbir must have been originale enough her canvas had been fished out of the hold but in the place of a mainsail she had hoisted a topsail we passed as close as possible to the isletline of secondary formation beginning with shushu the wedge blufffaced to south the palinurus anchored here in a small bight on the northeast side between two reefs and narrowly escaped being wrecked by a northerly gale at 1045 am we were alongside of baráhkán a double feature lumpy and cliffy connected by a low sandy isthmus the eastern flank gives good shelter to native crafts lastly came yubá the compound quoin the loftiest of the group upwards of 350 feet high with its lowlying neighbour wálih these islets have classical names as i have before mentioneden141 and appear once to have been inhabited even at yubú the least likely of all we heard from several authorities of a deep rockcut well covered with a stone which the arabs could not raise  and now we were able to cast an intelligent glance in review of the scenes made familiar by our first or northern march the surpassing purity of the transparent atmosphere especially at this season causes the land to look as near at twenty as at ten miles and thus both distances showing the horizon with the utmost distinctness appear equally close to the ship beginning towards elakabah the jebel elzánah behind magháir shuayb and its mighty neighbour the jebel ellauz form the horizon of mountains which are not the least amongst the giants southwards appear the jibál eltihámah the noble forms of the seaboard the parallel chains noting the eastern boundary of madyan proper while behind them the jibál elshafah reduced to blue heads and fragments of purple wall are evidently disposed on a far more distant plane  as regards the jibál eltihámah i have registered ad nauseam the names of the eight several blocks into which between elzahd north and elshárr south the curtain rising from a seahorizon seems to divide itself every one consulted gave me a new or a different term and apparently seamen and landsmen have their separate nomenclature thus the pilots call the fás harb and dibbagh blocks jibál elmusaybah tiryam and dámah after the wadys and main valleys that drain them the bedawin again will name the whole block after the part most interesting to them thus the towerlike formation characterizing jebel dibbagh was often called jebel eljimm and even this as will afterwards appear was not quite exacten142  we fired a gun off elmuwaylah where our camp ranged in long line looked clean and natty at five pm we were once more at home in our old quarters the sharm yáhárr the days work had numbered fifty direct geographical miles between sinafir and elmuwaylah with five more to our dock                               résumé  our journey through madyan proper north midian had lasted fiftyfour days december 19 1877 to february 13 1878 during nearly two months the expedition had covered only 105 to 107 miles of ground this however does not include the various bytrips made by the members which would more than double the total nor the cruise of two hundred miles round the gulf of akabah ending at elmuwaylah the total of camels employed varied from 106 to 61 and their hire including bakhshísh and all minor charges amounted according to mr clarke to £316 14s 3d  this section of north midian may be described as essentially a mining country which strange to say of a province so near egypt has been little worked by the ancients the first khedivial expedition brought back specimens of free gold found in basalt apparently eruptive and in corundophyllite which the engineer called greenstone porphyry silver appeared in the red sands in the chloritic quartz and in the titaniferous iron of the jebel elabayz the value being 265 to 300 francs per ton with traces in the scoriæ the second expedition failed to find gold but brought back argentiferous galena in copperstained quartz and possibly in the ochraceous red veins seaming the secondary gypsum with silicates and carbonates of copper select specimens of the latter yielding the enormous proportion of forty per cent in this northern region the great focus of metallic deposit appears to lie between north lat 28° 40 and 27° 50 that is from the jebel tayyib ism north of makná to the southern basin which contains the jebel elabyaz or white mountain its characteristics are the argentiferous and cupriferous ores whereas in south midian gold and silver were worked and the parallelogram whose limits are assigned above might be converted into a northern grant concerning the immense abundance of gypsum and the sulphur which is suspected to be diffused throughout the secondary formation ample details have been given in the preceding pages  the principal ruins of ancient settlements and the ateliers all of them showing vestiges of metalworking numbered eight these are beginning from the south tiryam sharmá aynúnah the jebel elabyaz magháir shuayb makná tayyib ism and elakabah magháir shuayb the madiáma of ptolemy is evidently the ancient capital of the district it was the only place which supplied midianitish nabathæan coins moreover it yielded graffiti from the catacombs fragments of bronze which it will be interesting to compare by assay with the metal of the european prehistoric age and finally stone implements worked as well as rude  i will end with a few words concerning the future industry of north midian  for the success of these mines the greatest economy will be necessary the poorest ore can be treated on the spot by crushing and washing where no expenditure of fuel is required the richer stone that wants roasting and smelting would be shipped when worth the while from north midian to suez there coal is abundant and the deserted premises of dussaudbey belonging to the egyptian government would form an excellent site for a great usine centrale finally the richest specimensespecially those containing as many do a medley of metalswould be treated with the least expenditure and the greatest advantage at swansea or in other parts of england where there are large establishments which make such work their specialty  the following analyses of the specimens brought home by the first khedivial expedition were made at the citadel cairo by the wellknown chemist gastinelbey in conjunction with m george marie

elmuwaylah too late to meet the hajjcaravan which home returning had passed hurriedly through the station on february 9th this institution has sadly fallen off from its high estate of a quarter of a century ago then commanded by an amir elhajjlord of the pilgrimagein the shape of two pashas generals it is now under the direction of a single bey colonel the true believers once numbering thousands were reduced in 187778 to some eight hundred souls of whom only eighty appeared at elmuwaylah and the peculiar modification of modern days is that the mahmal is escorted only by paupers yet the actual number of the hájis who stand upon jebel arafát instead of diminishing has greatly increased the majority prefer voyaging to travelling the rich hire statecabins on board wellappointed infidel steamers and the poor content themselves with faithful sambúks indeed it would seem that all the present measures quarantines of sixty days  and detention at wretched tor comfortless enough to make the healthiest lose health are intended to discourage and deter palmers from proceeding by land if this course be continued a very few years will see the venerable institution represented by only the mahmal and its guard the late said pasha of egypt once consigned the memorial litter per steamfrigate to jeddah the innovation saved ghafr blackmail to the bedawin but it was not approved of by the moslem world  the hájis were so poor that they had nothing for barter or for sale happily however there was a farrier amongst them and lieutenant yusuf took care that our mules were properly shod m philipin had been a maréchal ferrant but a kick or two had left him no stomach for the craft our two fellowtravellers with the whole camp had set out from makná on february 6th and marched up the great wady elkharaj along the eastern flank of the jebel elfahísát the iron mountain they found many outcrops of quartz a rock which appears sporadically all the way to the northern soufrière in two places it was greenstained showing copper while in another hydrated oxide and chromate of iron hematiteen143 abounded after a stage of four hours and twenty minutes they left the caravan struck off to the west accompanied by shaykh furayj and reached their destination here however they met with accidents the mules bolted followed by the shaykhs dromedary and they were obliged to hurry off for fear of losing the caravan now well ahead of them thus when i had ordered lieutenant yusuf to make a detailed plan of the formation he had spent exactly ten minutes on the spot and he appeared not a little proud of his work  this young officer was not a pleasant companion he had doubtless received his orders but he carried them out in a peculiarly disagreeable way taking notes of all our proceedings under our eyes together with lieutenant amir he began to make a collection of geology both being utterly innocent of all knowledge imitated us in picking up specimens mixed them together without notes or labels and on return to cairo duly presented them at the citadel this was all that was required the papers were written to and reported as follows closer examination has shown that the turquoises brought to cairo are merely malachite  and that the existence of any such quantity of gold as would pay for the working is to say the least of it very doubtfulen144  the whole camp indeed was seized with a mania for collecting old háji wali again gathered bits of quartz which he once more presented as goldstone to his friends and acquaintances at zagázig and anton the dragoman triumphantly bore away fragments bristling with micaslate whose glitter he fondly conceived to be silver  lieutenant yusuf was presently despatched with three soldiers three quarrymen jází the arab guide of a former visit and eight camels to bring back specimens of the copper silicate to the south of aynánah and to make a regular survey of the northern solfatara he set out early on february 18th and after twentyone hours of caravanmarching reached the jebel elfara here the outcrop is bounded north by the wady elfara and south by the wadys elmaríkhah and umm nírán the latter forming the general recipient of these nullahs the jebel is about 120 feet high of oval form stretching 1750 metres from northnorthwest to southsoutheast the rich silicate not carbonate of copper which disdains a streak and affects the file is found as usual with this ore only in one part of the valley to the southwest some thirtyfive feet above the sole it is a pocket a circumscribed deposit as opposed to a true vein or a veinfissure the adjoining rocks contain carbonates of iron and copper and the oremass is apparently carbonate of lime this second visit generally confirmed the report of ahmed kaptán except that there were no signs of working as he had supposed the travellers passed the whole of february 20th at the diggings made a plan and sent back two camelloads four sacks of the gangue in charge of a soldier to the fort of elmuwaylah  on the next day the little party made for the wady aynúnah and striking to the left of the straight line crossed the maritime country here a mass of wadys including our old friend the afál this highway to the northern hismá falls i have said into the mínat elayánát a portlet useful to sambúks its sickleshaped natural breakwater curving from west to south resembles that of sinaitic marsá elginái and those which are so common in western iceland on february 22nd a very devious path narrow and rocky lasting for one hour led them about noon to the northern jebel elkibrít the distance from elmuwaylah is about sixtysix miles and the country west of a line drawn from aynúnah to makná was before this march utterly unknown to us consequently to all the civilized world  lieutenant yusufs two journals checking each other his plan and his specimens enable me to describe the northern deposit with more or less accuracy the sulphurhill is a long oval of four hundred metres eastwest by a maximum of one hundred and eighty northsouth but it extends branches in all directions the mineral was also found in a rounded piton a knob on the wady musayr attached to the northeastern side the flattened dome is from fifty to sixty feet high and the piton one hundred and forty the metal underlying a dark crust some twelve to fifteen centimetres thick appears in regular crystals and amorphous fragments of pure brimstone pitting the chalky sulphate of lime blasting was not required the soft material yielded readily to the pick this gypseous or secondary formation was found to extend not only over the adjacent hills but everywhere along the road to makná the important point which now remains to be determined is i repeat whether sulphurveins can be found diffused throughout these nonplutonic rocks  lieutenant yusuf fixed his position by climbing the adjacent hills whence sinafir bore 190° and shushu 150° both magnetic while greater elevations to the west shut out the view of lofty tiran and even of the sinaitic range the nearest water in the wady elnakhil to the northeast was reported to be a two hours march with loaded camels  five miles several little ports quite unknown to the hydrographic chart were visited these are beginning from the north the mínat hamdán lying between makná and dabbah a refuge for sambúks defended like that of old madyan by rising ground to the north about three miles and a quarter further south is the sharm dabbah the sherm dhaba good anchorage of the chart this mass of reefs and shoals may have been one of the excellent harbours mentioned by procopius it receives the wady shab elgánn jánn the watercourse of the demons jann ravine flowing from a haunted hill of red stone near which no arab dares to sleep from that point the travellers struck nine miles and a half to southeast of ghubbat suwayhil this roadstead used only by native craft lies eastward of the long point forming the arabian staple of the gulf elakabahs gate where the coastline of midian bends at a right angle towards the rising sun adjoining it to the east and separated by a long thin spit is the ghubbat elwagab wajb the mouth of the watercourse similarly named it is also known to the katírah or smaller vessel and about a mile up its bed which comes from the northeast there is a well according to jázi the guide this ghubbah gulf distant only four to five hours of slow marching from the sulphurhill will be the properest place for shipping produce in another eastern feature the wady giyál jiyál distant some eleven miles and a half from aynúnah and ending in a kind of sink there is a fine growth of palms about a quarter of a mile long and a supply of wild brackish water in wells and rainpools these uninteresting details will become valuable when the sulphurmines of north midian are ripe for working  from the ghubbat elwagab the path easy travelling over flat ground strikes to the northeast and fourteen miles and a half beyond joins the aynúnah highway on february 26th at the end of nine days work lieutenant yusuf returned to elmuwaylah with two sacks of sulphurbearing chalk which justified his previous report as will appear the expedition was still travelling through the interior after a halt for rest at headquarters he rejoined us on our northward route from zibá and i again found useful occupation for his energies  upon our happy return home ie sharm yáhárr preparations for a march upon the hismá were at once begun my heart was firmly fixed upon this project hoping to find an unworked california to the east of the harrah volcanoes but the shaykhs and camelmen who did not like the prospect of a rough reception by the maázah bandits threw sundry small stumblingblocks in our path it was evidently useless to notice them so far from the spot they would develop themselves only too well as we approached the tribal frontier while these obstacles were being cleared away we carefully examined the little dock that had so often given us shelter in the hour of need and i set a small party to work at the central jebel elkibrit which had been explored by the first expedition  sharm yáhárr is the usual distorted t a long channel heading in a shorter crosspiece it is formed by the confluence of four valleys all composed of corallines and conglomerates of new sandstone those to the north and the northwest show distinct signs of upheaval the two eastern features known as the wady elhárr the hot watercourse of which yáhárr appears to be a corruption bear marks of mans hand the dock is divided into an outer and inner port by a projecting northern point which is not sufficiently marked in the chart enlarged plan at this place where the tide rises a full metre the crew of the mukhbir had built a jetty of rough boulders by way of passetemps and to prevent wading native craft lie inside opposite the ruins of a stone house the existence of a former population is shown by the many graves on the upper plateau in the northern wady elhárr also we picked up specimens of obsidian oligistic iron and admirably treated modern  slags showing copper and iron evidently some gypsylike atelier must once have worked upon the wady yáhárr the obsidian also has apparently been subjected to the artificial fire and a splinter of it contains a paillette of free copper  what concerned us most however was the discovery of oysters which adhering to the reefs projected under water from the rocky northern cliff formed a live conglomerate and from the present time forwards we found the succulent molluscs in almost every bay those to the south where the shallows overlie sand and mud are not so good at this season the ustrída is flat fleshy and full sized the shell has a purple border and the hinge muscle of the savage far stronger than that of the civilized animal together with its exceeding irregularity of shape giving no purchase to the knife makes oysteropening a sore trouble we tried fire but the thickskinned things resisted it for a long time and when they did gape the liquor had disappeared thereby spoiling the flavour the beard was neither black like that of the irish nor colourless as in the english oyster the bedawin who ignore the delicacy could not answer any questions about the spatting seasonprobably it is earlier than ours which extends through june whether also a close time is required as in england to august 4th we could not guess the young probably find a natural culch in the many shells cockle and others that strew the rock sand and clay  knowing that my gallant friend admiral mckillop pasha of alexandria takes great interest in ostreoculture i sent him from suez a barrel of the best midianites the water had escaped by the carelessness of the magazineman enough however remained alive to be thrown into the harbour eunostos where they will i hope become the parents of a fine large progeny of natives similarly we had laid in a store of fortytwo langoustes crayfish for presentation at court and to gladden the hearts of cairéne friends our greeks placed the tubs in the sun and so close to the funnel that after about three hours all the fine collection perished ignobly  we will now proceed to the central jebel elkibrit a superficial examination of which by the first expeditionen145 proved that the upper rock yielded four and the lower nine per cent of tolerably pure brimstone the shortest cut from the dockharbour lies up the southern wady harr with its strangely weathered sandstone rocks soft modern grits that look wormeaten amongst them is a ledgelike block with undermined base projecting from the left bank both the upper and the lower parts are scattered over with wasm or arab tribal marks on our return from elwijh we found this sandstone tongue broken in two the massive root remained in situ but the terminal half had fallen on the ground this was probably the work of an earthquake which we felt at sharm dumayghah on march 22nden146 the track then strikes the modern hajjroad which runs west of and close to the sulphurhill the line is a succession of watercoursesen147 and in wady khirgah we found blocks of the hydrous silicate corundophyllite which may be serpentine it is composed of a multitude of elements especially pyrites after an hour and a quarters sharp walking we hit the broad wady elkibrít which rounds its jebel to the southeast and which feeds the wady eljibbah itself a feeder of the sharm jibbah the latter which gave us shelter in the corvette sinnár captain ali bey is a long blue line of water bounding the western base of the sulphurhill  this central tuwayyil elkibrít is an isolated knob rising abruptly from wadyground measuring some 240 feet in height and about 880 metres in diameter not including its tail of four vertebræ which sets off from northwest to southeast viewed from the north it is as the egyptian officers remarked a regular haram pyramid with a kidneyformed capping of precipitous rock drinkable water like that of the wady elghál is said to be found in the wady elkibrít to the northeast and the country is everywhere tolerably wooded the bedawin brought us small specimens of rockcrystal and fragments of negroquartz apparently rich in metal from a neighbouring maru they placed it amongst the hillmasses to the east and south and we afterwards found it for ourselvesen148  our middle sulphurhill differs essentially from the other two deposits the northern near makná and the southern near elwijh in being plutonic and not sedimentary one would almost say that it smokes and the heataltered condition of the granite the greenstone and other rocks looking as if fresh from a fire suggests that it may be one of the igneous veins thrown westward by the great volcanic region elharrah in parts it is a conglomerate where a quantity of quartz takes the place of chalk and gypsum other deposits are ironstained and have the appearance of the decomposed iron pyrites which abounds in this neighbourhood usually the yield is the normal brimstoneyellow yet some of the beds are deep red as if coloured by ochre or oxide of iron this variety is very common in the solfataras of iceland and i have heard of it in the jebel mokattam near cairo the colour is probably due to molecular changes and possibly shows greater age than the yellow  m philipin was directed to take charge of sergeant mabrúk the nine quarrymen and the bedawi owners of two camels to carry his boringirons forge and water from elmuwaylah i advised him to dig at least forty feet down all round the pyramid wherever surfaceindications attracted notice old experience had taught me that such depth is necessary before one can expect to find brimstone beds like those of sicily the borings brought up sulphur from fourteen metres beyond these six were pierced but they yielded nothing in and around the pyramid m philipin sank five pits the northernmost shaft halfway up the hill gave crystals of the purest sulphur  if the depth of the deposit be not great the surface extent is the pyramid evidently forms the apex of a large vein which strikes northsouth the field consists of this cone with its dependencies especially the yellow cliffs to the north and the south facing in the latter direction a large plain cut by the wady elkibrít moreover a vein of the red variety about three kilometres long by twentyfive to thirty metres broad lies to the southeast near a gypsum hill the latter also yields the crystallized salt which so often accompanies sulphur and heaps of gigantic halffossilized oystershells are strewed about it  m philipin here remained sixteen days february 18march 5 during our absence in the east country on return we found our good blacksmith much changed for the worse whilst in hard work he had been halfstarved the jeráfín bedawin of the neighbourhood having disappeared with their flocks he had been terribly worried by the cameleers and he had been at perpetual feud with the miserable quarrymen i never saw a man less fitted to deal with twolegged natives the latter instinctively divined that he would rather work himself than force others to work and they acted accordingly  the expedition was thus divided into four three working parties and one of idlers anton and petros were left behind to do nothing as magazinemen  lieutenant darwaysh the linesman who was too weak to ride and sublieutenant mohammed the miner who was too old to travel had charge of the sick both found the far niente equally sweet on february 17th i again bade adieu to the gunboat mukhbir and marched with the largest party upon our camp at elmuwaylah distant about six miles one hour and fortyfive minutes the path from sharm yáhárr crosses the hard sands of the maritime plain metalled with the natural macadam of the desert the stone is mostly dark silex the hens liver of the brazil and its surface is kept finely polished and free from patina by the friction of the dustladen winds the line is deeply gashed by short broad gullies the hajjroad running further east heads these ugly nullahs the third and largest channel is wady surr the great valley of elmuwaylah which may be regarded as the southern frontier of madyan proper we shall trace it to its head in the hismá  i had left the camppitching at elmuwaylah to the egyptian officers who naturally chose the site nearest the two northern wells a wave of ground hot by day cold at night windy and dusty at all times moreover the water was near enough to be horribly fouled no wonder that in such a place many of the men fell ill and that one subsequently diedour only loss during the four months march  on february 18th we proceeded under the misguidance of a báshbuzúk of the fort ahmed sálih elmalún to inspect a neighbouring ruin called abá hawáwítthe father of dwelling walls wallin p 30 declares that finding no mention made of muweilih in arab manuscripts nor traces or traditions among the existing generation in the land pointing to a high antiquity he is inclined to consider it a town of modern origin in fact the growth of the egyptian pilgrimage his error is excusable he was a passing traveller and i well remember that for a whole year the true name of a hill immediately behind our house at damascus remained unknown to me we had called it after our own fashion and the term had at once been adopted by all our overpolite native friends indeed this is one of the serious difficulties to be encountered throughout the east by the scrupulous traveller whose greatest fear is that of misleading others the expedition had paid four several visits to elmuwaylah and had never heard a word about ruins when i happened to read out before the shaykhs assembled at magháir shuayb a passage from elmakrízi treating of the destroyed cities of madyan they at once mentioned half a dozen names lying within short distances of the little salt amongst them was abú hawáwít literally meaning tenement walls but here applied in the short form hawáwít to ruins in general  had wali háji as wallin was called by the bedawin looked only ten feet beyond the northeastern tower of the fort near the ruins of a modern mastabah masonry bench he would have found long forgotten vestiges of ovens and slags containing copper and iron the same will prove to be the case about the inland defence of el wijh in fact all these works seem for obvious reasons to have been built upon sites that have been utilized long before their modern day elmuwaylah was probably a more important place than it is at present when the reefharbour which now admits native craft only by a gap to the southwest had not been choked by shoals the sandy soil wants only water to produce a luxuriant perennial growth and every garden can have its well but more life is wanting a man heaps up a thornhedge or builds a swishwall of the brickclay underlying the wady and he forgets only to lay out the field within local history does not it is true extend beyond two hundred years or so the probable date of shaykh abdullahs venerated sepulchre a truncated parallelogram of cut coralline on the wady sughayyir to the north of the settlement yet this little salt is too remarkable a site to have remained unoccupied possibly it is the greek the horse village and fort  which ptolemy vi ii places in north lat 26° 40 true 27° 40 whilst his greek would be the glorious shárr correctly consigned to north lat 27° 20 this argues an error of nearly sixty miles by the geographer or his copyists but chapter xii will attempt to show that the latitude of greek the modern shuwák is also one degree too low so on the east african coast ptolemy places his aromata promontorium which can only be guardafui between north lat 5° and 7° whereas it lies in north lat 11° 41 4  the awwal hawáwít or first ruins begin on the right bank of the surr after one mile and three quarters from camp and bear northeast 55° mag from the minaret of elmuwaylah fort the position is a sandy basin containing old bedawi graves bounded by a low ridge forming a boulderclad buttress to the wady while the circuit of the two may be a mile and a half a crumbling modern tower crowning the right bank and two mahrákah rubstones were the principal remains the situation must have been well chosen in the days when the heights were wooded and the wady was a river we afterwards mapped the body of the place lying about three miles from the fort showing the yubú bank to northwest 298° mag and nearly due west 260° mag elmuwaylahs only house the sayyids the site is a holm or island in the wady surr which here runs eastwest and splits the main line is the southern and a small branch a mere gully occupies the northern bedside  the chief ruin is an oblong of twenty metres by sixteen the short ends facing 195° mag the whole built of huge pebbles the interior is composed of one large room to the north with sundry smaller divisions to the south east and west defence was secured by a wall distant 142 metres thrown across the whole eastern part of the islet outside it are three large pits evidently the site of cisterns the people also told us of a well the bir elashgham which has long been mysteriously hidden immense labour has also been expended in revetting the northern and southern banks both of the islet and the smaller branchbed for many hundreds of yards with round and waterrolled boulders even on a larger scale than at magháir shuayb what all this work meant we were unable to divine perhaps it belonged to the days when the seaboard of midian was agricultural and it was intended as a protection against the two torrents the wadys elzila and abú zabah which here fall into the northern bank  the 18th of february also made itself memorable to the second expedition m marie was strolling near the old furnaces to the northeast of the fort where in 1877 he had picked up an auriferous specimen unfortunately lost before it reached cairo here he again found a fragment of serpentine broken and waterrolled into the semblance of half a globe it showed crust and stains of iron filets of white quartz and a curve  of bright yellow dots disposed like the chainlet of an aneroid thereupon we gravely debated whether these were the remains of a vein or had been brought to the surface by the rubbing and polishing of the stone in water  i could not but remark that the interior which appeared pyritiferous did not show the slightest trace of precious metal still the discovery gave fresh courage to all our people the trophy was shown to every bedawi far and near with the promise of a large reward fifty dollars to the lucky wight who could lead us to the rock in situ the general voice declared that the goldstone was the produce of jebel malayh malíh we afterwards ascertained by marching up the wady surr that it was not in fact the whole neighbourhood was thoroughly well scoured but the results were nil in due course of time the tarnishing and the disappearance of the metal reduced my scepticism to a certainty the gold dots were the trace of some pilgrim or soldiers coppernailed boot it was the first time that this ludicrous mistake arose but not the lastour native friends were ever falling into the same trap  amongst the minor industries of the fort elmuwaylah must be reckoned selling gazelles the bedawin bring them in and so succeed in taming the timid things that they will follow their owner like dogs and amuse themselves with hopping upon his shoulders when thus trained ariel is supposed to be worth half a napoleon the wild ones may be bought at almost every fort as zibá or elwijh                                 chapter x                 through east midian to the hismá    the land of midian is by no means one of the late prince metternichs geographical expressions the present tenants of the soil give a precise and practical definition of its limits their arz madyan extends from elakabah north north lat 29° 28 to elmuwaylah with its wady elsurr north lat 27° 40 it has thus a total latitudinal length of 108 direct geographical milesen149 south of this line the seaboard of northwestern arabia as far as elhejaz has no generic name the bedawin are contented with such vague terms derived from some striking feature as the lands of zibá of wady salmá of wady dámah of elwijh to denote the tract lying between the parallels of elmuwaylah and of wady hamz arabic in north lat 25° 55 15 thus the northsouth length of the southern moiety would be 105 direct geographical miles or a little less than the northern and the grand total would be 213 miles  the breadth of this egyptian province is determined by the distance from the sea to the maritime mountains in madyan proper or north midian the extremes would be twentyfour and thirtyfive miles for the southern half these figures may be doubled here again the bedawin are definitive as regards limits all the tihámah or lowlands and their ranges belong to egypt east of it the daulat shám or government of syria claims possession  i have taken the liberty of calling the whole tract midian the section above elmuwaylah madyan proper i would term north midian and that below it south midian in the days of the ancient midianites the frontiers were so elastic that at times but never for a continuity they embraced sinai and were pushed forward even into central palestine moreover i would prolong the limits eastward as far as the damascusmedínah road this would be politically and ethnologically correct with the exception of the maázah country the whole belongs to egypt and all the tribes formerly nabathæan are now more or less egyptoarab never questioning the rights of his highness the viceroy who garrisons the seaboard forts of the other points historical and geographical i am not so sure my learned friend aloys sprenger remarks let me observe that your extending the name midian over the whole country as far south as the dominions of the porte appears to me an innovation by which the identity of the race along the shore of the gulf of akabah coast down to wajh and hawrá is prejudged would it not be better to leave midian where it always has been and to consider badáen150 the centre of thamûditis as it was at the time of pliny and ptolemy and as it continued to be until the balee baliyy and other qodhâ kudá tribes came from southern arabia and exterminated the thamûdites this is doubtless a valid objection its only weak point is that it goes too far back we cannot be conservatives in geography and ethnology nor can we attach much importance in the nineteenth century to a race the beni tamúd which had wholly disappeared before the seventh on the whole it still appears to me that by adopting my innovation we gain more than we lose but the question must be left for others to decide  in our days two great sultánis or highways bound madyan the less and midian the greater the western followed by the hajj elmisri egyptian caravan dates from the age of sultán selim khán the conqueror who before making over the province to the later mamlúk beys levelled rocks cut through ridges dug wells laid out the track and defended the line by forts before that time the road ran for convenience of water to the east or inland it was in fact the old nabathaean highway which according to strabo connected leukè kóme with the western capital petra further east and far beyond the double chain of maritime mountains is the highway followed by the hajj elshámi syrian or damascus caravan which sets out from constantinople musters at damascus and represents the sultan on both these main lines water is procurable at almost every station and to them military expeditions are perforce limited the parallelogram between the two varying in breadth according to wallin from 90 to 120 miles direct and geographical is irregularly supplied in places with springs wells and rainpits which can always be filled up or salted by the bedawin  the main body of the expedition mr clarke mm marie and lacaze ahmed kaptán and lieutenant amir set out from elmuwaylah at 630 am february 19th escorted by the sayyid and the three salaried shaykhs including our friend furayj the remingtons numbered ten and there were also ten picks of whom five waited upon the mules of the sixtyone camels six were dromedaries and as the road grew lighter our beasts of burden increased somehow or other to sixtyfour the caravan now loads in twenty minutes instead of five hours and when politiké or fear of danger does not delay us we start in a quarter of an hour after the last buglesound this operation is under charge of lieutenant amir who does his best to introduce darforian discipline the camels being first charged with the finátís metal waterbarrels then with the boxes and lastly with the tents  after passing the ruins of abú hawáwit we began at 915 am to exchange the broad wady surr of the flat seaboard with its tall banks of stiff drab clay for a gorge walled with old conglomerates and threading the ruddy and darkgreen foothills of the main ghát as in the wady elmakadah and other winterbrooks the red porphyritic trap heataltered argil easily distinguished by its fracture from the syenites of the same hue appeared to be ironclad coated with a thin crust of shiny black or brown peroxide  this peculiarity was noticed by tuckey in the congo by humboldt in the orinoco and by myself in the são francisco river i also saw it upon the sandstones of the wild mountains east of jerusalem where as here air and not water must affect the oxide of iron in both cases however the cause would be the same and the polish would be a burnishing of nature on a grand scale  after six very slow miles we halted for rest and refection at a thread of water in the section of the surr which receives the wady elnajil the sides were crowded with sheep and goats the latter as in the syrian lowlands almost invariably black and the adjoining rocks had peculiar attractions for hares hawks and partridge in these upland regions water is almost everywhere and generally it is drinkable hence the bedawin naturally prefer them to the coast an umbrellashaped thorntree actually growing on a hilltop and defined by the skyline excited our wonder and admiration for here as in pontus       rara nec hæc felix in apertis eminet arvis            arbor et in terra est altera forma maris  indeed throughout our journey this spectacle always retained its charms aiding fancy to restore the barrens to what they had been in the prosperous days of yore  the wady surr now began to widen out and to become more riant whilst porphyry was almost the only visible rock after a total of ten dawdling miles marching almost due east we found our tents pitched in a broad and quasicircular basin called elsafh the level ground of jebel malíh mount pleasant which the broadspeaking bedawin lengthen to malayh our camelmen had halted exactly between two waters and equally distant from both so as to force upon us the hire of extra animals we did not grumble however as we were anxious to inspect the afrán furnaces said to be found upon the upper heights of the shárrof these apocryphal features more hereafter fresh difficulties the jeráfínhuwaytát tribe that owns the country south of the surr could not be reached under a whole day of dromedaryriding in reality they were camped a few furlongs off but anything to gain £8 per diem for doing nothing two bedawi shepherdlads promised to act guides next morning and duly failed to appear or more probably were forbidden to appear they had also romanced about ruins fountains palms and rushes in the wady elkusayb the southeastern influent at night ahmed elukbi surnamed abú khartúm arrived in camp he had travelled more than once to tabúk carrying grain and though he had failed as a merchant he retained his reputation as a guide as regards the furnaces he also like furayj could speak only from hearsay opinions were divided in camp i saw clearly that a stand was being made to delay us for four or five days and despite grumbling i resolved upon deferring the visit till our return from the interior  the first march had led us eastward instead of northeastward in order to inspect the wady surr from the seaboard this line which drains the northern flank of the shárr mountains appears the directest road into the interior we shall presently see however why the devious northern way of the wady sadr has become the main commercial route connecting elmuwaylah with tabúken151 during the evening we walked up the wady surr finding in its precipitous walls immense veins of serpentine and porphyritic greenstone but not a speck of gold the upper part of the fiumara also showed abundant scatters of waterrolled stones serpentines and hard felspars whose dovecoloured surface was streaked with fibrils and at times with regular veins of silvery lustre as if brought out by friction of the surface i offered a considerable sum to a jeráfín bedawi if he would show the rock in situ he was evidently ignorant of it but like others he referred us to jebel malíh  the whole of the next day february 20th was spent in northing leaving the noisy braying caravan to march straight on its destination we set out 615 am up the wady guwaymarah guided by hasan elukbí who declared that he well knew the sites of the ruined settlements elkhulasah and elzibayyib after walking half an hour we turned eastward into a feeder of the surr the wady elkhulasah whose aspect charmed me this drain of the inner jedayl block was the replica of a fiumara in somaliland a broad treedotted flat of golden sand bordered on either side by an emerald avenue of dense mimosas forming line under the greenstone hills to the right and the redstone heights to the left the interior we again remarked is evidently more rained upon and therefore less sterile and desolate than the coast and the submaritime regions and here one can well imagine large towns being built at last after walking about an hour and a half  four miles and a half towards the shárr with our backs turned upon our goal the ratfaced little intriguer hasan declared that he knew nothing about elkhulasah but that zibayyib lay there pointing to a brightred cliffy peak abálbárid on the left bank of the wady and to others whose heads were blue enough and low enough to argue considerable distance he had intended his cousin gabr to be the real guide and to take to himself all the credit but i had sent off the parlous judge in another direction  mr clarke whose cantering mule had no objection to leave its fellows rode off with the recreant hasan whilst we awaited his return under a tree  instead of hugging abálbárid behind which a watercourse would have taken him straight to his destination he struck away from the wady elkhulasah then crossing on foot and hauling his animal over a rough divide he fell after six miles instead of two into the upper course of the wady surr which he reported to be choked with stones and refusing passage to loaded camelsas will afterwards appear the reverse is the case the ruins of elzibayyib lie at a junction of three or rather four watercourses the eastern is the surr here about five hundred yards broad forming a bulge in the bed and then bending abruptly to the south a short line from the southwest the wady zibayyib drains the abalbárid peak and the northernmost is the wady elsafráen152 upon which the old place stands à cheval the western part is the larger and the more ruinous the thin line three hundred yards long by thirty broad never shows more than two tenements deep owing to the hill that rises behind it here the only furnace was found the eastern block measures one hundred yards by forty both are razed to their basements resembling the miners settlement on the sharmá cliff they attract attention only by their material red boulders being used instead of the green porphyries of the hills and the now desolate spot shows no signs of water or of palmgroves  mr clarke rejoined us after a couple of hours having lost the dog brahim under a sudden change of diet it had become too confident of its strength and thus it is that dogs and men come to grief we retraced our steps down the wady elkhulasah whose jebel is the crupper of the little block umm jedayl the lower valley shows a few broken walls old arab graves and other signs of ancient habitation but i am convinced that we missed the ruins which lay somewhere in the neighbourhood one sulaymán a bedawi of the selálimahhuwaytát tribe who had been rascalized by residence at elmuwaylah was hunted up by the energetic sayyid hoping as usual that no action would be taken upon mere words he declared that elkhulasah stood on the top of a traplump we halted to inspect it and lieutenant amir rode the shaytánah his vicious little shemule up and down steeps fit only for a goat again all was in vain  we then travelled over granite gravel along the western foothills of umm jedayl in which a human figure or statue had been reported to me now however it became a sarbút or upright stone along the flanks of the chief outlier the jebel elramzah distinguished by its red crest and veins the slope was one strew of quartz whole and broken like that which we had seen to the north and which we were to see on our southern journey despising the rotten water offered in two places by the umm jedayl we pitched camp on the fine gravel of the sayl wady eljimm here i heard for the first time after sighting it for many weeks that the latter is the name not of a mountainen153 but of a shab or gully in the jebel dibbagh where waters meet the wady khshabriyyah separating the umm jedayl from its northern neighbour the dibbagh looks like a highway but all declare that it is closed to camels by war or stony ground of its ruins more when we travel to the shárr this days march of four hours  ten miles and a half had been a series of zigzagsnorth northeast west and again north  after a cool pleasant night we set out at 630 am february 21st across the broad sayl towards a bay in the mountains bearing northnorthwest the mouth of the wady zennárah entering the block we made two short cuts to save great bends in the bed the first was the shab elliwéwi the weiwî of wallin p 304wild riding enough the path often winding almost due east when the general direction was northnortheast we saw for the first time pure greenishyellow chlorite outcropping from the granite the animals were apparently hibernating and plants were rare we remarked chiefly the sorrel and the blue thistle or rather wild artichoke the shauk eljemel a thorn loved by camels blepharis edulis which recalled to mind the highlands of syria the second shortcut the wady elgaagah alias sawáwín was the worse of the two the deep drops and narrow gutters in the quartzveined granite induced even the shaykhs to dismount before attacking the descents this is rarely done when ascending for their beasts climb like iceland ponies one of m lacazes most effective croquis is that showing monture and man disappearing in the black depths of a crevice some of the hillcrests were weathered with forms resembling the artificial at the midday haltingground we saw a stonemother nursing a rockchild which might still be utilized in lands where thaumaturgy is not yet obsolete  our course thence lay eastward up the easy bed of the fiumara an eastern section of an old friend the wady tiryam it now takes the wellknown name wady sadr and we shall follow it to its head in the hismá the scene is rocky enough for scotland or scandinavia with its huge walls bristling in broken rocks and blocks its blue slides and its polished sheets of dry watercourse which from afar flash in the sun like living cataracts on the northern or right bank rises the mighty harb whose dome single when seen from the west here becomes a tridactylon splitting into three several heads facing it the northernmost end of the dibbagh range forms a truncated tower conspicuous far out at sea having no name it was called by us burj jebel dibbagh a little further to the east it will prove to be the monstrous pommel of a dwarf saddleback everywhere a favourite shape with the granite outcrop  mm clarke and lacaze who had never before seen anything higher that the hillocks of the isle of wight or the buttes de montmartre were hot upon ascending the almost perpendicular sides of the burj relying upon the parallel and horizontal fissures in the face which were at least ten to twenty feet apart these dark marks probably stained by oxide of iron reminded me of those which wrinkle the granitic peaks about rio de janeiro and which have been mistaken for hieroglyphs  the valleysole is particoloured the sands of the deeper line to the right are tinctured a pale and sickly green by the degradation of the porphyritic traps here towering in the largest masses yet seen while the gravel of the left bank is warm and lively with red grit and syenitic granite looking down the long and gently waving line we feel still connected with the civilized world by the blue and purple screen of sinai forming the splendid background everything around us appears deserted the maázah are up country and the beni ukbah have temporarily quitted these grazinggrounds for the surr of elmuwaylah we camped for the night after a total march of eleven miles at the sayl elnagwah a short nullah at the foot of a granite block similarly named and a gap supplied us with tolerable rainwater  on the next day february 22nd we left the nagwah at seven instead of six am and passed to the right a granitic outcrop in the wady bed a reduced edition of the burj after an hours slow walking we were led by a bedawi lad hasan bin husayn to a rockspur projected northwards from the left side and separating two adjacent sayls or torrentbeds mere bays in the bank of mountains a cut road runs to the top of the granite tongue which faces the westernmost or downstream outbreaks of the huge porphyritic masses on the other side of the wady sadr the ridge itself is strewed with spalled stone quartz broken from the veins that seam the granite and with slag as usual admirably worked not a trace of human habitation appears nor is there any tradition of a settlement having existed here consequently we concluded that this was another atelier of wandering workmen below the rocktongue we found for the first time oxydulated iron and copper either free or engaged in trap and basaltic dykes the former metal also attached in layers to darkred vermeilled jasper here appears streaked with white quartz  resuming our ride we dismounted after four miles at the halfway mahattah haltingplace it is a rondpoint in the wady sadr marked from afar by a tall blue pyramid the jebel elgalah jálah we spent some time examining this interesting bulge here the jibál eltihámah end and the eastern parallel range the jibál elshafah begins the former belong to the huwaytát and to egypt the latter partly to the maázah and to syria the geographical frontier is well marked by two large watercourses disposed upon a meridian and both feeding the main drain the sadrtiryam to the north the wady sawádah divides the granitic harb from the porphyritic jebel sawádah while the southern wady aylán separates the dibbagh from the jebel aylán a tall form distinctly visible from the upper shárr the rest of our eastward march will now be through the shafah massif it resembles on a lower scale the tihámah gháts but it wholly wants their variety their beauty and their grandeur the granites which before pierced the porphyritic traps in all directions now appear only at intervals and this i am told is the case throughout the northern as we found it to be in the southern prolongation of the liprange at the same time there is no distinct geographical separation between the two parallels and both appear not as if parted by neutral ground but rather as topographical continuations of each other  while breaking our fast and resting the mules a few shots ringing ahead caused general excitement we were now on the edge of the enemys country presently three of the maázah came in and explained with their barking voices that their people had been practicing at the níshán target which meant we have powder in abundance one of them at once dubbed elnasnás the satyr from his exceeding monstrous uglinessa baboons muzzle with a scatter of beardkindly volunteered to guide us with the intention of losing the way the dialogue that took place was something as follows  what are your names   a naakal wa nashrab our names are we eat and we drink  where do we find water today  furayj ejaculates the water of the rikáb  a no by allah the arabs will never allow you to drink you should be killed for carrying off in dumús skins the sand of the wady jahd alluding to lieutenant amirs trip  we did not pay much heed to these evil signs ahmed elukbí had been sent forward to obtain a free pass from the chiefs and we hardly expected that the outlying thieves would be daring enough to attack us  resuming our way in a cold wind and a warm sun up the upper wady sadr we threaded the various bends to the south and southeast with a general southsoutheastern direction the normal darkgreen traps and burnished red porphyries and grits were sparsely clad with the shauhat and the yasár trees resembling the salvadora and the tamarix the country began to show a few donkeys and large flocks of sheep and goats the muttons have a fine tog and sell for three dollars and a half the women in charge whose complexions appeared notably lighter than those of the seaboard barked like the men they were much puzzled by a curious bleating which came from the mules and hurriedly counted their kids suspecting that one had been purloined whilst they had some trouble to prevent the whole flock following us all roared with laughter when they found that mr clarke was the performer  we crossed two short cuts over long bends in the wady and at the second found a pothole of rainwater by no means fragrant except to nostrils that love impure ammonia it has a grand name muwah for miyáh elrikáb the waters of the caravan and we made free with it despite the mornings threats we again camped in the valley at an altitude of 2200 feet aner 2780 and though the thermometer showed 66° f at five pm fires inside and outside the messtent were required a wester or seabreeze deflected by the ravines to a norther was blowing and in these regions as in the subfrigid zones of europe wind makes all the difference of temperature during the evening we were visited by the maázah bedawin of a neighbouring encampment they began to notice stolen camels and to wrangle over past timesanother bad sign  setting out on a splendidly lucent morning 645 am february 23rd when the towering heads of harb and dibbagh looked only a few furlongs distant we committed the imprudence of preceding as usual the escort our men had become so timid starting at the sight of every wretched bedawi that they made one long for a rash act after walking about a mile and a half we passed some black tents on the left bank where the sadr enters a narrow rocky gorge and suddenly about a dozen varlets were seen scampering over the walls manning the pass and with lighted matches threatening to fire then loud rang the warsong       hill elzawáib hillahá      wabdi nuhúdak kullahá       loose thy toplocks with a loosing like a lions mane      and advance thy breast all of it opponite pectora without shrinking  other varieties of the slogan are       o man of small mouth un misérable      if we fail who shall win  and       by thy eyes i swear o shecamel if we go to the attack and gird the sword      we will make it a day of sorrow to them and avert from ourselves every ill  we dismounted looked to our weapons and began to parley the ragged ruffians some of them mere boys and these always the readiest to blow the matches of guns longer than themselves began with high pretensions they declared that they would be satisfied with nothing less than plundering us they flouted shaykh furayj and they insulted the sayyid threatening to take away his sword  presently the escort and the arab camelmen were seen coming up at the double the maázah at once became abject kissed our heads and declared there was some mistake i had already remarked whilst the matchlockmen were swarming up the wadysides that the women and children remained in camp and the sheep and goats were not driven off this convinced me that nothing serious had been intended probably the demonstration was ordered from headquarters in order to strike us with a wholesome awe  the fellows gently reproached us with travelling through their country without engaging and paying ghafírguides and protectors so far as owners of the soil they were in their right and manning a pass is here the popular way of levying transit dues on this occasion the number of our remingtons sufficed to punish their insolence by putting the men to flight and by carrying off their camels and flocks but such a step would have stopped the journey and what would not the aborigines protection society have said and done i therefore hired one of the varlets and both parties went their ways rejoicing that the peace had not been broken  the valley winding through the red and green hills was dull and warm till the cool morning easter which usually set about eight am began to blow the effect of increasing altitude showed itself in the vegetation we now saw for the first time the kidád astragalus with horrid thorns and a flower resembling from afar the gooseberry it is common on the hismá and in the south country the kahlá echium a bugloss a boragelike plant with viscous leaves and flowers of two coloursthe young lightpink and the old darkblueeverywhere beautified the sands and reminded me of the istrian hills where it is plentiful as in the nile valley the jaradthorn was not in bloom and the same was the case with the hyacinth dipcadi erythraeum so abundant in the hisma which some of us mistook for a wild onion the zayti lavandula had just donned its pretty azure bloom there were reseda wild indigo tribulus terrestris the blue aristida the pale stipa and the bromus grass red and yellow the ratam spartium with delicate white and pink blossoms was a reminiscence of tenerife and its glorious crater whilst a little higher up the amene cytisus flowering with gold carried our thoughts back to the far past  presently the great fiumara opened upon a large basin denoting the ras head wady sadr native travellers consider this their second stage from elmuwaylah in front the jibál sadr extended far to the right and left a slight depression showing the khuraytah or pass which we were to ascend on the morrow buttressing the left bank of the broad watercourse was the dwarf hill of which we had been told so many tales by day its red sands gleam and glisten like burnished copper during the night fire flashes from the summit in truth its sole peculiarity is that of being yellow amongst the gloomy heights around it whilst the wady elsafrá higher up to the left discharges from its jebel a torrent of quartz and syenite gravel and sand abú khartám the author of the romance was among the party he only smiled when complimented upon the power of his imagination  this was a day of excitement even the mules kept their ears pricked up after a short nine miles we had camped below the jebel kibár and we had remounted our animals to ascend a neighbouring hill commanding a birdseye view of the hismá plain there was evidently much excitement amongst the bedawi shepherds around us and presently ahmed elukbí our messenger appeared in sight officially heading the five chiefs of the maázah who were followed by a tail of some thirty clansmen only two rode horses wretched garrons stolen from the ruwalá the great branch of the anezah which holds the eastern regions the rest rode fine sturdy and longcoated camels which looked syrian rather than midianiteen154 we returned hurriedly to make arrangements for the reception our shaykhs could not without derogating go forth to meet the strangers but the latter were saluted with due ceremony by the bugler and the escort drawn up in line before the messtent  after the usual halfhours delay the palaver to speak africanicè came up and m lacaze had a good opportunity of privily sketching the scene the shaykh mohammed bin atíyyah who boasts falsely that he commands more than half the two thousand males composing the tribe is a tall sinewy man of about fifty straightfeatured fullbearded and gruffvoiced his official style of speaking from the throat a kind of vaccine low imitated in camp for many a day never failed to cause merriment his costume rose to the height of desertfashion described when pourtraying shaykh khizr the imráni his manners were those of a gentleman below the pass and above it he became an unmitigated ruffian who merited his soubriquet elkalb the hound on one side sat his son sálim a large beardless lad who had begun work by presenting us with a sheepgiorgi cook said it cost us £40 on the other was his eldest brother and alter ego the wrinkled sagr sakr has been a resident at cairo and still boasts that he received the tribute of a horse from the viceroy whom he affects to treat as an equal or rather an inferior the others were old sagrs illvisaged son ali and lastly a cunningeyed villain abayd bin sálim the rightful heir to the chieftainship which however he had been unable to keep all the shaykhs were dressed in brandnew garments and glaring glossy kúfíyahs headkerchiefs they trade chiefly with mezáríb in the haurán and during the annual passage to and fro of the damascus caravan they await it at tabúk and threaten to cut off the road unless liberally propitiated with presents of raiment and rations the murátibah honorarium contributed by elshám would be about one hundred dollars in ready money to the headman diminishing with degree to one dollar per annum this would not include free gifts by pilgrims the maázah are under syria that is under no rule at all and they are supposed to be tributary to when in reality they demand tribute from the porte in fact nothing can be more pronounced than the contrast of the bedawin who are subject to egypt and those supposed to be governed by the wretched ottoman  during the palaver all outside was sweet as honey to use the arab phrase and bitter as gall inside the maázah many of whom now saw europeans for the first time eyed the barnetá hat curiously with a certain facial movement which meant this is the first time we have let christian dogs into our land they were minute in observing the escort and not a little astonished to find that all were negroesin the old day egyptian soldiers under the great mohammed ali pasha and his stepson ibrahim pasha had made themselves a terror to the wild man what had now become of them was the mental question when asked whence they had procured the two horses they answered curtly min rabbináfrom our lord thus signifying stolen goods and like mediaeval knights they took a pride in avowing that not one of their number could read or write finally a tent was assigned to them food was ordered and they promised us escort to their dens on the morrow  during the raw and gusty night the mercury sank to 38° f the aneroid 2691 showing about three thousand feet above sealevel and blazing fires kept up within and without the tents hardly sufficed for comfort on the morning of february 24th       over the wold the wind blew cold  and the egyptian officers all donned their gloves the early hours were spent in a last struggle with our shaykhs who now felt themselves and their camels hopelessly entering the lions lair the sole available pretext for delay was that their animals could never carry the boxes and tents up the pass but though very ugly reports prevailed concerning the reception of ahmed elukbí and the observations that had been made last night not a word was suffered to reach my ears until our retreat had been resolved upon such concealment would have been inexcusable in a european in the east it is the rule  at 715 am we struck the camp at jebel kibár and moved due eastward towards the pass this northeastern khuraytah col is termed the khuraytat elhismá or eljils after a hillock on the plateausummit to distinguish it from the similar feature to the southwest the latter is known as the khuraytat elzibá or elt h m  the local pronunciation of tihámah about two miles of rough and broken ground lead to the foot of the ladder the zigzags then follow the line of a mountain torrent the natural pass crossing its bed from left to right and from right again to left the path is the rudest of corniches worn by the feet of man and beast and showing some ugly abrupt turns the absolute height of the ascent is about 450 feet aner 26702625 and the length half a mile the ground composed mostly of irregular rocksteps has little difficulty for horses and mules but camels laden with boards the messtable and long tentpoles must have had a queer timei should almost expect after this to see an oyster walking up stairs of course they took their leisure feeling each stone before they trusted it but they all arrived without the shadow of an accident and the same was the case during the two subsequent descents  we halted on the sath elnakb the passtop to expect the caravan and to prospect the surrounding novelties heaps and piles of dark trap dotted the summit like old graves many of the stones were inscribed with tribal marks and not a few were capped with snowy lumps of quartz detached from their veins in the porphyry this custom which appears universal throughout midian has many interpretations according to some it denotes the terminus of a successful raid others make it show where a dispute was settled without bloodshed whilst as a rule it is an expression of gratitude the bedawi erects it in honour of the man who protected or who did a service to him saying at the same time abyaz alayk yá fulanwhite or happy be it to thee naming the person amongst these votive stones we picked up copperstained quartz like that of aynúnah fine specimens of iron and the dovecoloured serpentine with silvery threads so plentiful in the wady surr the wasm in most cases showed some form of a cross which is held to be a potent charm by the sinaitic bedawin and on two detached waterrolled pebbles were distinctly inscribed lh and vl which looked exceedingly like europe apparently the custom is dying out the modern midianites have forgotten the art and mystery of tribal signs wusúm in many places the people cannot distinguish between inscriptions and bill snooks his mark and they can interpret very few of the latter  looking westward through the inverted arch formed by the two hillstaples of the khuraytah and down the long valley which had given us passage the eye distinguishes a dozen distances whose several planes are marked by all the shades of colour that the most varied vegetation can show there are blackbrowns chocolatebrowns and light umberbrowns brightreds and dullreds grassgreens and cypressgreens neutral tints and french greys contrasting with the rosy pinks the azures the purples and the golden yellows with which distance paints the horizon from a few feet above the colfloor appear the eastern faces of the giants of the coastrange and our altitude some 3800 feet gave us to a certain extent a measure of their grand proportions  we now stand upon the westernmost edge of the great central arabian plateau known as elnejd the highlands opposed to eltihámah the lowland regions in africa we should call it the true subtending the false coast delightful dahome compared with leprous lagos this upland running parallel with the liprange and with the maritime gháts is the farfamed hismá it probably represents a remnant of the old terrace which like the secondary gypseous formation has been torn to pieces by the volcanic region to the east and by the plutonic upheavals to the west the length may be 170 miles the northern limit is either close to or a little south of fort maán and we shall see its southern terminus sharply defined on a parallel with the central shárr not including eljawwen155 an inaccessible fortress to the south it is approached on the southwest by difficult passes easily defended against man and beast further north however the wadys afál near elsharaf elhakl hagul and elyitm at elakabah are easy lines without war stony ground or nakb ravines  the hismá material is a loose modern sandstone showing every hue between bloodred rose pink and dead dull white again and again fragments had been pointed out to us near the coast in ruined buildings and in the remains of handmills and rubstones possibly the true coalmeasures may underlie it especially if the rocks east of petra be as some travellers state a region of the old not the new red according to my informants the hismá has no hills of quartz a rock which appears everywhere except here nor should i expect the region to be metalliferous  we ascended the jebel elkhuraytah a trap hillock some 120 feet high the southern jamb of the khuraytah gate the summit where stands a ruined burj measuring fourteen metres in diameter gives a striking and suggestive view after hard dry living on grisly mountain and unlovely wady this fine open plain slightly concave in the centre was a delightful change of diet to the eyethe first enjoyable sensation of the kind since we had gazed lovingly upon the broad bosom of the wady elarabah the general appearance is that of eastern syria especially the haurán at the present season all is a sheet of pinkish red which in later march will turn to lively green on this parallel the diameter does not exceed a days march but we see it broadening to the north looking in that direction over the gloomymetalled porphyritic slopes upon which we stand the glance extends to a manner of seahorizon while the several planes below it are dotted with hills and hillranges white red and black all dwarfed by distance to the size of thimbles and pincushions the guides especially pointed out the ridge elmukaykam a red block upon red sands and a farfamed rendezvous for raid and razzia nearer the dark lumps of elkhayráni rise from a similar surface nearer still lie the two white dots elrakhamatayn and nearest is the ruddy ridge jebel and jils elrawiyán containing they say ruins and inscriptions of which wallin did not even hear  the eastern versant of the hismá is marked by long chaplets of tree and shrub disposed along the selvage of the watercourses and the latter are pitted with wells sunk after the fashion of the bedawin in this rhumb the horizon is bounded by elharrah the volcanic region whose black porous lavas and honeycombed basalts often charged with white zeolite are still brought down even to the coast to serve as mortars and handmills the profile is a long straight and regular line as if formed under water capped here and there by a tiny head like the syrian kulayb haurán its peculiar dorsum makes it distinguishable from afar and we could easily trace it from the upper heights of the shárr it is evidently a section of the mighty plutonic outburst which has done so much to change the aspect of the parallel midian seaboard wallins account of it p 307 is confined to the place where he crossed the lavaflood and he rendered elharrah which in arabic always applies to a burnt region by redcoloured sandstone  the bedawin far more reasonably declare that this harrah is not a mere patch as it appears in wallins map a narrow oblong not exceeding sixty miles north lat 27°28° disposed diagonally from northwest to southeast according to them it is a region at least as large as the hismá and it extends southwards not only to the parallel of elmedínah but to the neighbourhood of yambú the upper region has two great divisions the harrathismá or the harrah par excellence which belongs to the maázah and which extends southwards through elsulaysilah as far as the jaww the latter region a tract of yellow sand dotted with ruddy hills apparently a prolongation of the hismá separates it from the harrat elawayraz in which the jebel elmuharrak liesen156 this line of volcanism is continued south by the harrat elmushrif pn of a man by the harrat sutúh jaydá and finally by the harrat elbuhayri the latter shows close behind the shore at elhaurá in nearly the same latitude as elmedínah where we shall presently sight it there is great interest and a general importance in this large coastsubtending eruptive range whose eastern counterslope demands long and careful study  sweeping the glance round to south we see the southern of the two jilsayn tall mounds of horizontal strata with ironstone in harder lines and finial blocks this is the jils eldáim so distinguished from the northern jils elrawiyán the lower edge of the hismá swells up in red and quoinlike masses the jibál elzáwiyah and then falls suddenly with a succession of great breaks into the submaritime levels during our next ten days travel we shall be almost in continuous sight of its southern ramparts and buttresses far over the precipices lie the low yellow sands of the rahabah alias the wady dámah and behind it rises the skyblue mountain block which takes a name from the ruins of shaghab and shuwák  we breakfasted upon the khuraytah crest and mr clarke set out to shoot the fine redlegged greek partridges caccabis that haunt the hilltops whilst the rest of us marched with the caravan to the nearest campingground about a mile from the col and lying to the west of the jils elrawiyán it is supplied with excellent drinkingwater by the miyáh eljedayd lying nine hundred to a thousand metres to the southeast on the other hand fuel here a necessary of life was wanting nor could the camels find forage thus we were camped upon the western edge of the hismá the maázah shaykhs who vainly urged us forwards showed a suspicious disappointment at our not reaching their quarters on the far side where they said a camel was awaiting to be slaughtered for our reception  meanwhile we were enjoying the reverse of hospitality the bedawin evidently now held that all which was ours had become theirs their excessive greed made them imprudent not satisfied with eating us up with a coffeepot ever on the fire with demanding endless tobacco and with making their two garrons devour more barley than our eight mules they began to debate aloud as usual how much ready money they should demand this was at last settled at four hundred dollars and the talk was reported to me by the báshbuzúk husayn whom they had compelled to cook for them at the same time unpleasant discussions were beginning this man stole my camel that man killed my father already took the form of threats in fact i almost repented having brought the huwaytát and their camels into the trap still they all respected furayj as might be seen by their rising and making room for him whenever he approached the fire  at last an evil rumour arose that the maázah had determined to supply us with transport and had sent messengers in all directions to collect the animals this step looked uncommonly like a gathering of warmen i was sorely disappointed for more reasons than one the state of affairs rendered a distant march to the east highly unadvisable the principal object of this journey had been to investigate the inland depth of the metalliferous deposits in fact their extent from west to east their northsouth length would be easily ascertained but the width would still remain unknown the land of midian through which we have been travelling has evidently been worked and in places well worked thus the only chance of finding a virgin california would be in the unknown tracts lying to the east of the harrahs too bad to be thwarted in such a project by the exorbitant demands of a handful of thieves  the disappointment was aggravated by other considerations from all that i had heard the hismá is a region full of archæological interest already we were almost in sight of the ruins of ruáfá lying to the north between the two white dots elrakhamatayn further eastward and north of the pilgrimstation záthajj are the remains of karáyyá still unvisited by europeans finally i had been shown when too late to inspect the place a fragment of a nabathæan inscription finely cut in soft white sandstoneen157 it had been barbarously broken and two other pieces were en route the stone is said to be ten feet long  all covered with writings from which annalistic information might be expected it lies or is said to lie about two hours ride north of our camp and beyond the jils elrawiyán famed for hawáwít at first i thought of having it cut to portable size but second thoughts determined me to leave it for another visit or for some more fortunate visitor lastly we were informed a few weeks afterwards that the maázah shaykhs had carried it off to their tentsi fear piecemeal  it was not pleasant to beat a retreat but under the circumstances what else could be done no one was to be relied upon but the europeans and not all even of them the black escort emancipated slaves would have run away at the first shot except only actingcorporal khayr and when i told the officers assembled at mess that we should march back early next morning the general joy showed how little they relished the prospect of an advance then came out in mass the detailsmany doubtless apocryphalwhich should have been reported to me and which had carefully been kept secret the maázah when our messenger first notified our visit had declared that they would have no nazarenes in their mountains that they did not care a fico for egypt why had not effendíná written to them they were his equals not his subjects it was then debated whether they should not raise a force of dromedarymen to fall upon us some of them proposed to summon to their aid the rival chief ibn hermás but the majority thought it would be better to reserve for themselves the hundred dollars per diem of which they proposed to fleece us  of course everything around us was intrigue the máyat taht eltibn water under the straw of the arab saying furayj it is true looked serene and privately offered me to fight the affair out but he was alone in the idea the sayyid was tranquil as usual hasan the ukbi wore an unpleasant appearance of satisfaction as if he had been offered a share in the plunder of the huwaytát and alayán a brave man on his own ground could hardly conceal his dejection i might it is evident have seized shaykh mohammed placed a pistol to his ear and carried him off a prisoner but such grands moyens must be reserved for great occasions the worst symptoms in camp were that the maázah at once knew the whole of my project while the egyptian officers were ever going to their tents and one stayed talking with them till near midnight  february 25th was a day of humiliation i aroused the camp at 430 am and at once gave orders to strike the tents and load the command was obeyed in double quick time but not before shaykh mohammed had visited us to propose a march to his home in the east he was not comfortable probably his reinforcements had still to arrive his face was calm as the easterns generally is but his feet trembled and his toes twitched i drily told him of our changed plans and he left us in high dudgeon the tragicomedy which followed may be divided into six acts  1 the maázah mount their horses and camels i walk up to them and expostulate about so abrupt a departure without even drinking a friendly cup of coffee  2 they dismount and squat in council round the fire sending on three dromedaryriders to crown a hill commanding the pass the burning question is now whether armed clansmen are or are not lurking behind the heights  3 shaykh mohammed comes forward and demands blackmail to the extent of two hundred dollars i offer one hundred dollars  4 our hosts break off the debate in a towering rage refuse coffee and declare that the caravan of effendíná the viceroy shall not be loaded mohammeds feet twitch more violently as the camels are made to kneel  5 the caravan shows too much emotion i pay the two hundred dollars into the chiefs hands he at once demands his sharaf honour in the shape of a kiswah or handsome dress and that failing an additional twentyfive dollars for each of the five headmen i promise that a robe shall be sent from elmuwaylahen158  6 the caravan sets out for the pass when the three dromedaryriders open with the warcry it is stopped with much apparatus by the shaykhs who affect to look upon it as dangerous                                   we now marched without delay upon the col which was reached at 815 am mohammed bin atíyyah having meanwhile disappeared we descended the khuraytat eljils in twentysix minutes and dismissed the remainder of our maázah escort at the foot i vainly offered them safeguard to elmuwaylah which they have not visited for the last dozen years all refused absolutely to pass their own frontiers  au revoir mohammed ibn atíyyah and company  having broken our fast and sent forward the caravan we at once began to descend the southern pass the khuraytat elzibá here the watershed of the wady surr heads and merchants object to travel by its shorter line because their camels must ascend two ladders of rocks instead of one at the top of the wady sadr the col was much longer and but little less troublesome than its northern neighbour the formation was the same and fortyfive minutes placed us in a gully that presently widened to a big valley the wady dahal or elkhuraytah we reached it at 1230 pm and laid down the distance from the summit of the northern col at about five miles and a quarter the air felt tepid the sun waxed hot drinkingwater was found on the left of the bed and a hole in the sole represented a spring which the people say is perennial we were dismounting to quench our thirst at the latter when juno plunged into it and stood quietly eyeing us with an air of intense satisfaction  we spent that night at a place lower down the wady dahal known as the jayb elkhuraytah collar of the col the term jayb is locally applied to two places only the other being the jayb elsalúwwah which we shall presently visit a larger feature than a wady it reminds us of a norfolk broad but it is of course waterless guards were placed around the camp and a wholesome dread of the maázah kept them wide awake the only evil which resulted was that none dared to lead our mules to water and the poor animals were hardly rideable on the next day  of the hismá in its present state we may say as of ushant qui voit ouessant voit la mort nothing can be done towards working the mines of midian until this den of thieves is cleared out it is an asylum for every murderer and bandit who can make his way therea centre of turbulence which spreads trouble all around it under the sham rule of miserable shám syria with its turkish wális men like the late ráshid pasha matters can only wax worse subject to egypt the people will learn discipline and cease to torment the land  happily for their neighbours there will be no difficulty in reducing the maázah they are surrounded by enemies and they have lately been obliged to pay brothertax to the ruwalá as a defence against being plundered the tribute consists of one piece of haircloth about twenty cubits long on the north as far as elmaán they meet the hostile beni sakr jawázi under the shaykh mohammed ibn jázi southwards the baliyy commanded by shaykh

the west would place this vermin between two fires  the tale of my disappointment may conclude with an ethnological notice of those who caused it  the maázah is a syroegyptobedawi clan originally arab or rather syrian but migratory as are all arabs it now extends high up the valley of the nile and it is still found in the wady musá of suez and on the zafaránah block even in egypt it is turbulent and dangerous the men are professional robbers and their treachery is uncontrolled by the bedawi law of honourthey will eat bread and salt with the traveller whom they intend to murder for many years it was unsafe to visit the camps within sight of suez until a compulsory residence at headquarters taught the shaykhs manners the habitat in arabia stretches from the wady musá of petra where they are kinsmen of the tiyáhah the bedawin of the tíhdesert and through maán as far as the birkat elmuazzamah south of tabúk finally they occupy the greater part of the hismá and the northern harrah  according to mohammed elkalb these bandits own the bluest of blue blood their forefather was one wáíl who left by his descendants two great tribes the first and the eldest took a name from their maáz hegoats while the junior called themselves after the annáz shegoats from the latter sprung the great anezah family which occupies the largest and the choicest provinces of the arabian peninsula meanwhile genealogists ignore the maázah  wallin would divide the tribe into two the maázah and the beni atiyá of the latter in midian i could hear nothing except that they represent the kinsmen of the shaykhs family we find benoo ateeyah in maps like that of crichtons 1834 where the maázah are laid down further south and northwards the beni atiyyah are a powerful clan who push their razzias as far as the frontiers of moab my informants declare that the numbers of fighting men in the midianite division of the race may be two thousand two hundred and that they are separated only by allegiance to two rival shaykhs the greater half under ibn hermás is distributed into five clans of whom the first orbán khumaysah contain two septs under mohammed ibn atíyyah elkalb they number also five divisions amongst them are the subút or beni sabt sons of the sabbath that is saturday whom wallin suspects to be of jewish origin relying it would appear principally upon their name the ringing of the large bell suspended to the middle pole of the tents at sunset to hail the return of the camels and the mystic hour of descending night is an old custom still maintained because it confers a barakat blessing upon the flocks and herds certainly there is nothing of the bedawi in this practice and it is distinctly contrary to the tradition of elislam yet many such survivals hold their ground
