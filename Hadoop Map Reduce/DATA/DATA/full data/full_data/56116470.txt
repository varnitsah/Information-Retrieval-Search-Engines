56116470	the saints tragedy     preface by the rev f d maurice ma 1848    the writer of this play does not differ with his countrymen generally as to the nature and requirements of a drama  he has learnt from our great masters that it should exhibit human beings engaged in some earnest struggle certain outward aspects of which may possibly be a spectacle for the amusement of idlers but which in itself is for the study and the sympathy of those who are struggling themselves  a drama he feels should not aim at the inculcation of any definite maxim the moral of it lies in the action and the character  it must be drawn out of them by the heart and experience of the reader not forced upon him by the author the men and women whom he presents are not to be his spokesmen they are to utter themselves freely in such language grave or mirthful as best expresses what they feel and what they are  the age to which they belong is not to be contemplated as if it were apart from us neither is it to be measured by our rules to be held up as a model to be condemned for its strangeness  the passions which worked in it must be those which are working in ourselves  to the same eternal laws and principles are we and it amenable  by beholding these a poet is to raise himself and may hope to raise his readers above antiquarian tastes and modern conventions  the unity of the play cannot be conferred upon it by any artificial arrangements it must depend upon the relation of the different persons and events to the central subject  no nice adjustments of success and failure to right and wrong must constitute its poetical justice the conscience of the readers must be satisfied in some deeper way than this that there is an order in the universe and that the poet has perceived and asserted it  long before these principles were reduced into formal canons of orthodoxy even while they encountered the strong opposition of critics they were unconsciously recognised by englishmen as sound and national  yet i question whether a clergyman writing in conformity with them might not have incurred censure in former times and may not incur it now  the privilege of expressing his own thoughts sufferings sympathies in any form of verse is easily conceded to him if he liked to use a dialogue instead of a monologue for the purpose of enforcing a duty or illustrating a doctrine no one would find fault with him if he produced an actual drama for the purpose of defending or denouncing a particular character or period or system of opinions the compliments of one party might console him for the abuse or contempt of another  but it seems to be supposed that he is bound to keep in view one or other of these ends  to divest himself of his own individuality that he may enter into the working of other spirits to lay aside the authority which pronounces one opinion or one habit of mind to be right and another wrong that he may exhibit them in their actual strife to deal with questions not in an abstract shape but mixed up with the affections passions relations of human creatures is a course which must lead him it is thought into a great forgetfulness of his office and of all that is involved in it  no one can have less interest than i have in claiming poetical privileges for the clergy and no one i believe is more thoroughly convinced that the standard which society prescribes for us and to which we ordinarily conform ourselves instead of being too severe and lofty is far too secular and grovelling  but i apprehend the limitations of this kind which are imposed upon us are themselves exceedingly secular betokening an entire misconception of the nature of our work proceeding from maxims and habits which tend to make it utterly insignificant and abortive  if a man confines himself to the utterance of his own experiences those experiences are likely to become every day more narrow and less real  if he confines himself to the defence of certain propositions he is sure gradually to lose all sense of the connection between those propositions and his own life or the life of man  in either case he becomes utterly ineffectual as a teacher  those whose education and character are different from his own whose processes of mind have therefore been different are utterly unintelligible to him even a cordial desire for sympathy is not able to break through the prickly hedge of habits notions and technicalities which separates them  oftentimes the desire itself is extinguished in those who ought to cherish it most by the fear of meeting with something portentous or dangerous  nor can he defend a dogma better than he communes with men for he knows not that which attacks it  he supposes it to be a set of book arguments whereas it is something lying very deep in the heart of the disputant into which he has never penetrated  hence there is a general complaint that we are ignorant of the thoughts and feelings of our contemporaries most attribute this to a fear of looking below the surface lest we should find hollowness within many like to have it so because they have thus an excuse for despising us  but surely such an ignorance is more inexcusable in us than in the priests of any nation  we less than any are kept from the sun and air our discipline is less than any contrived merely to make us acquainted with the commonplaces of divinity  we are enabled nay obliged from our youth upwards to mix with people of our own age who are destined for all occupations and modes of life to share in their studies their enjoyments their perplexities their temptations  experience often so dearly bought is surely not meant to be thrown away  whether it has been obtained without the sacrifice of that which is most precious or whether the lost blessing has been restored twofold and good is understood not only as the opposite of evil but as the deliverance from it we cannot be meant to forget all that we have been learning  the teachers of other nations may reasonably mock us as having less of direct booklore than themselves they should not be able to say that we are without the compensation of knowing a little more of living creatures  a clergyman it seems to me should be better able than other men to cast aside that which is merely accidental either in his own character or in the character of the age to which he belongs and to apprehend that which is essential and eternal  his acceptance of fixed creeds which belong as much to one generation as another and which have survived amid all changes and convulsions should raise him especially above the temptation to exalt the fashion of his own time or of any past one above the affectation of the obsolete above slavery to the present and above that strange mixture of both which some display who weep because the beautiful visions of the past are departed and admire themselves for being able to weep over themand dispense with them  his reverence for the bible should make him feel that we most realise our own personality when we most connect it with that of our fellowmen that acts are not to be contemplated apart from the actor that more of what is acceptable to the god of truth may come forth in men striving with infinite confusion and often uttering words like the eastwind than in those who can discourse calmly and eloquently about a righteousness and mercy which they know only by hearsay  the belief which a minister of god has in the eternity of the distinction between right and wrong should especially dispose him to recognise that distinction apart from mere circumstance and opinion  the confidence which he must have that the life of each man and the life of this world is a drama in which a perfectly good and true being is unveiling his own purposes and carrying on a conflict with evil which must issue in complete victory should make him eager to discover in every portion of history in every biography a divine morality and mysterya morality though it deals with no abstract personagesa mystery though the subject of it be the doings of the most secular men  the subject of this play is certainly a dangerous one it suggests questions which are deeply interesting at the present time  it involves the whole character and spirit of the middle ages  a person who had not an enthusiastic admiration for the character of elizabeth would not be worthy to speak of her it seems to me that he would be still less worthy if he did not admire far more fervently that ideal of the female character which god has established and not manwhich she imperfectly realisedwhich often exhibited itself in her in spite of her own more confused though apparently more lofty ideal which may be manifested more simply and therefore more perfectly in the england of the nineteenth century than in the germany of the thirteenth  to enter into the meaning of selfsacrificeto sympathise with any one who aims at itnot to be misled by counterfeits of itnot to be unjust to the truth which may be mixed with those counterfeitsis a difficult task but a necessary one for any one who takes this work in hand  how far our author has attained these ends others must decide  i am sure that he will not have failed from forgetting them  he has i believe faithfully studied all the documents of the period within his reach making little use of modern narratives he has meditated upon the past in its connection with the present has never allowed his reading to become dry by disconnecting it with what he has seen and felt or made his partial experiences a measure for the acts which they help him to understand  he has entered upon his work at least in a true and faithful spirit not regarding it as an amusement for leisure hours but as something to be done seriously if done at all as if he was as much under the great taskmasters eye in this as in any other duty of his calling  in certain passages and scenes he seemed to me to have been a little too bold for the taste and temper of this age  but having written them deliberately from a conviction that morality is in peril from fastidiousness and that it is not safe to look at questions which are really agitating peoples hearts merely from the outsidehe has and i believe rightly retained what i should from cowardice have wished him to exclude  i have no doubt that any one who wins a victory over the fear of opinion and especially over the opinion of the religious world strengthens his own moral character and acquires a greater fitness for his high service  whether poetry is again to revive among us or whether the power is to be wholly stifled by our accurate notions about the laws and conditions under which it is to be exercised is a question upon which there is room for great differences of opinion  judging from the past i should suppose that till poetry becomes less self conscious less selfconcentrated more dramatical in spirit if not in form it will not have the qualities which can powerfully affect englishmen  not only were the poets of our most national age dramatists but there seems an evident dramatical tendency in those who wrote what we are wont to call narrative or epic poems  take away the dramatic faculty from chaucer and the canterbury tales become indeed what they have been most untruly called mere versions of french or italian fables  milton may have been right in changing the form of the paradise lostwe are bound to believe that he was right for what appeal can there be against his genius but he could not destroy the essentially dramatic character of a work which sets forth the battle between good and evil and the will of man at once the theatre and the prize of the conflict  is it not true that there is in the very substance of the english mind that which naturally predisposes us to sympathy with the drama and this though we are perhaps the most untheatrical of all people  the love of action the impatience of abstraction the equity which leads us to desire that every one may have a fair hearing the reserve which had rather detect personal experience than have it announced tendencies all easily perverted to evil often leading to results the most contradictory yet capable of the noblest cultivationseem to explain the fact that writers of this kind should have flourished so greatly among us and that scarcely any others should permanently interest us  these remarks do not concern poetical literature alone or chiefly those habits of mind of which i have spoken ought to make us the best historians  if germany has a right to claim the whole realm of the abstract if frenchmen understand the framework of society better than we do there is in the national dramas of shakespeare an historical secret which neither the philosophy of the one nor the acute observation of the other can discover  yet these dramas are almost the only satisfactory expression of that historical faculty which i believe is latent in us  the zeal of our factions a result of our national activity has made earnest history dishonest  our english justice has fled to indifferent and sceptical writers for the impartiality which it sought in vain elsewhere  this resource has failedthe indifferentism of hume could not secure him against his scotch prejudices or against gross unfairness when anything disagreeably positive and vehement came in his way  moreover a practical people demand movement and life not mere judging and balancing  for a time there was a reaction in favour of party history but it could not last long already we are glad to seek in ranke or michelet that which seems denied us at home  much no doubt may be gained from such sources but i am convinced that this is not the produce which we are meant generally to import for this we may trust to welldirected native industry  the time is i hope at hand when those who are most in earnest will feel that therefore they are most bound to be justwhen they will confess the exceeding wickedness of the desire to distort or suppress a fact or misrepresent a characterwhen they will ask as solemnly to be delivered from the temptation to this as to any crime which is punished by law  the clergy ought especially to lead the way in this reformation they have erred grievously in perverting history to their own purposes  what was a sin in others was in them a blasphemy because they professed to acknowledge god as the ruler of the world and hereby they showed that they valued their own conclusions above the facts which reveal his order  they owe therefore a great amende to their country and they should consider seriously how they can make it most effectually  i look upon this play as an effort in this direction which i trust may be followed by many more  on this ground alone even if its poetical worth was less than i believe it is i should as a clergyman be thankful for its publication  f d m    introduction    the story which i have here put into a dramatic form is one familiar to romanists and perfectly and circumstantially authenticated abridged versions of it carefully softened and sentimentalised may be read in any romish collection of lives of the saints  an enlarged edition has been published in france i believe by count montalembert and translated with illustrations by an english gentleman which admits certain miraculous legends of later date and like other prodigies worthless to the student of human character  from consulting this work i have hitherto abstained in order that i might draw my facts and opinions entire and unbiassed from the original biography of elizabeth by dietrich of appold her contemporary as given entire by canisius  dietrich was born in thuringia near the scene of elizabeths labours a few years before her death had conversed with those who had seen her and calls to witness god and the elect angels that he had inserted nothing but what he had either understood from religious and veracious persons or read in approved writings viz the book of the sayings of elizabeths four ladies guta isentrudis and two others the letter which conrad of marpurg her director wrote to pope gregory the ninth these two documents still exist the sermon of otto de ordine praedic which begins thus  mulierem fortem  not satisfied with these he visited monasteries castles and towns interrogated the most aged and veracious persons and wrote letters seeking for completeness and truth in all things and thus composed his biography from which that in surius acta sanctorum jacobus de voragine alban butler and all others which i have seen are copied with a very few additions and many prudent omissions  wishing to adhere strictly to historical truth i have followed the received account not only in the incidents but often in the language which it attributes to its various characters and have given in the notes all necessary references to the biography in canisiuss collection  my part has therefore been merely to show how the conduct of my heroine was not only possible but to a certain degree necessary for a character of earnestness and piety such as hers working under the influences of the middle age  in deducing fairly from the phenomena of her life the character of elizabeth she necessarily became a type of two great mental struggles of the middle age first of that between scriptural or unconscious and popish or conscious purity  in a word between innocence and prudery next of the struggle between healthy human affection and the manichean contempt with which a celibate clergy would have all men regard the names of husband wife and parent to exhibit this latter falsehood in its miserable consequences when received into a heart of insight and determination sufficient to follow out all belief to its ultimate practice is the main object of my poem  that a most degrading and agonising contradiction on these points must have existed in the mind of elizabeth and of all who with similar characters shall have found themselves under similar influences is a necessity that must be evident to all who know anything of the deeper affections of men  in the idea of a married romish saint these miseries should follow logically from the romish view of human relations  in elizabeths case their existence is proved equally logically from the acknowledged facts of her conduct  i may here observe that if i have in no case made her allude to the virgin mary and exhibited the sense of infinite duty and loyalty to christ alone as the mainspring of all her noblest deeds it is merely in accordance with dietrichs biography  the omission of all mariolatry is remarkable  my business is to copy that omission as i should in the opposite case have copied the introduction of virginworship into the original tale  the business of those who make mary to women especially the complete substitute for the saviouri had almost said for all three persons of the trinityis to explain if they can her nonappearance in this case  lewis again i have drawn as i found him possessed of all virtues but those of action in knowledge in moral courage in spiritual attainment infinitely inferior to his wife and depending on her to be taught to pray giving her higher faculties nothing to rest on in himself and leaving the noblest offices of a husband to be supplied by a spiritual director  he thus becomes a type of the husbands of the middle age and of the womanworship of chivalry  woman worship the honour due to the weaker vessel is indeed of god and woe to the nation and to the man in whom it dies  but in the middle age this feeling had no religious root by which it could connect itself rationally either with actual wedlock or with the noble yearnings of mens spirits and it therefore could not but die down into a semisensual dream of femalesaintworship or fantastic idolatry of mere physical beauty leaving the women themselves an easy prey to the intellectual allurements of the more educated and subtle priesthood  in conrads case again i have fancied that i discover in the various notices of his life a noble nature warped and blinded by its unnatural exclusions from those family ties through which we first discern or describe god and our relations to him and forced to concentrate his whole faculties in the service not so much of a god of truth as of a catholic system  in his character will be found i hope some implicit apology for the failings of such truly great men as dunstan becket and dominic and of many more whom if we hate we shall never understand while we shall be but too likely in our own way to copy them  walter of varila a more fictitious character represents the healthy animalism of the teutonic mind with its mixture of deep earnestness and hearty merriment  his dislike of priestly sentimentalities is no anachronism  even in his day a noble lay religion founded on faith in the divine and universal symbolism of humanity and nature was gradually arising and venting itself from time to time as i conceive through many most unsuspected channels through chivalry through the minnesingers through the lay inventors or rather importers of pointed architecture through the german school of painting through the politics of the free towns till it attained complete freedom in luther and his associate reformers  for my fantastic quotations of scripture if they shall be deemed irreverent i can only say that they were the fashion of the time from prince to peasantthat there is scarcely one of them with which i have not actually met in the writings of the periodthat those writings abound with misuse of scripture far more coarse arbitrary and ridiculous than any which i have dared to insert that i had no right to omit so radical a characteristic of the middle age  for the more coarse and homely passages with which the drama is interspersed i must make the same apology  i put them there because they were therebecause the middle age was in the gross a coarse barbarous and profligate agebecause it was necessary in order to bring out fairly the beauty of the central character to show the crooked and perverse generation in which she was a child of god without rebuke  it was in fact the very ferocity and foulness of the time which by a natural revulsion called forth at the same time the apostolic holiness and the manichean asceticism of the mediaeval saints  the world was so bad that to be saints at all they were compelled to go out of the world  it was necessary moreover in depicting the poor mans patroness to show the material on which she worked and those who know the poor know also that we can no more judge truly of their characters in the presence of their benefactors than we can tell by seeing clay in the potters hands what it was in its native pit  these scenes have therefore been laid principally in elizabeths absence in order to preserve their only use and meaning  so rough and common a lifepicture of the middle age will i am afraid whether faithful or not be far from acceptable to those who take their notions of that period principally from such exquisite dreams as the fictions of fouque and of certain moderns whose graceful minds like some enchanted well   in whose calm depths the pure and beautiful alone are mirrored   are on account of their very sweetness and simplicity singularly unfitted to convey any true likeness of the coarse and stormy middle age  i have been already accused by others than romanists of profaning this whole subjectie of telling the whole truth pleasant or not about it  but really time enough has been lost in ignorant abuse of that period and time enough also lately in blind adoration of it  when shall we learn to see it as it was the dawning manhood of europerich with all the tenderness the simplicity the enthusiasm of youthbut also darkened alas with its full share of youths precipitance and extravagance fierce passions and blind selfwillits virtues and its vices colossal and for that very reason always haunted by the twinimp of the colossalthe caricatured  lastly the many miraculous stories which the biographer of elizabeth relates of her i had no right for the sake of truth to interweave in the plot while it was necessary to indicate at least their existence  i have therefore put such of them as seemed least absurd into the mouth of conrad to whom in fact they owe their original publication and have done so as i hope not without a just ethical purpose  such was my idea  of the inconsistencies and shortcomings of this its realisation no one can ever be so painfully sensible as i am already myself  if however this book shall cause one englishman honestly to ask himself i as a protestant have been accustomed to assert the purity and dignity of the offices of husband wife and parent  have i ever examined the grounds of my own assertion do i believe them to be as callings from god spiritual sacramental divine eternal  or am i at heart regarding and using them like the papist merely as heavens indulgences to the infirmities of fallen manthen will my book have done its work  if again it shall deter one young man from the example of those miserable dilettanti who in books and sermons are whimpering meagre secondhand praises of celibacydepreciating as carnal and degrading those family ties to which they owe their own existence and in the enjoyment of which they themselves all the while unblushingly indulgeinsulting thus their own wives and mothers nibbling ignorantly at the very root of that household purity which constitutes the distinctive superiority of protestant over popish nationsagain my book will have done its work  if lastly it shall awaken one pious protestant to recognise in some at least of the saints of the middle age beings not only of the same passions but of the same lord the same faith the same baptism as themselves protestants not the less deep and true because utterly unconscious and practicalmighty witnesses against the two antichrists of their agethe tyranny of feudal caste and the phantoms which popery substitutes for the living christthen

exceedingly and much more concerning the persecutions which she endured patiently in youth  ibid  in one cradle  cf lib i section 2  the princess was laid in the cradle of her boyspouse and says another the infants embraced with smiles from whence the bystanders drew a joyful omen of their future happiness  ibid  if thou love him  cf lib i section 6  the lord by his hidden inspiration so inclined towards her the heart of the prince that in the solitude of secret and mutual love he used to speak sweetly to her heart with kindness and consolation and was always wont on returning home to honour her with presents and soothe her with embraces  it was their custom says dietrich to the last to call each other in common conversation brother and sister  p 24  to his charge  cf lib i section

lengthy professional reflections but the chapter on which this scene is founded is remarkable enough to be given whole and as i have a longstanding friendship for the good old monk who is full of honest naivete and deephearted sympathy and have no wish to disgust all my readers with him i shall give it for the most part untranslated  in the meantime those who may be shocked at certain expressions in this poem borrowed from the romish devotional school may verify my language at the romish booksellers who find just now a rapidly increasing sale for such ware  and is it not after all a hopeful sign for the age that even the most questionable literary tastes must nowadays ally themselves with religionthat the hotbed imaginations which used to batten on rousseau and byron have now risen at least as high as the vies des saints and st francois de sales philothea  the truth is that in such a time as this in the dawn of an age of faith whose future magnificence we may surely prognosticate from the slowness and complexity of its selfdeveloping process spiritual werterism among other strange prolusions must have its place  the emotions and the imaginations will assert their just right to be fedby foul means if not by fair and even selftorture will have charms after the utter dryness and lifeindeath of mere ecclesiastical pedantry  it is good mournful though it be that a few even by gorging themselves with poison should indicate the rise of a spiritual hungerif we do but take their fate as a warning to provide wholesome food before the new craving has extended itself to the many  it is good that religion should have its werterism in order that hereafter werterism may have its religion  but to my quotationswherein the reader will judge how difficult it has been for me to satisfy at once the delicacy of the english mind and that historic truth which the highest art demands  erat inter eos honorabile connubium et thorus immaculatus non in ardore libidmis sed in conjugalis sanctimoniae castitate  for the holy maiden as soon as she was married began to macerate her flesh with many watchings rising every night to pray her husband sometimes sleeping sometimes conniving at her often begging her in compassion to her delicacy not to afflict herself indiscreetly often supporting her with his hand when she prayed  and says another of her biographers being taught by her to pray with her great truly was the devotion of this young girl who rising from the bed of her carnal husband sought christ whom she loved as the true husband of her soul  nor certainly was there less faith in the husband who did not oppose such and so great a wife but rather favoured her and tempered her fervour with overkind prudence  affected therefore by the sweetness of this modest love and mutual society they could not bear to be separated for any length of time or distance  the lady therefore frequently followed her husband through rough roads and no small distances and severe wind and weather led rather by emotions of sincerity than of carnality  for the chaste presence of a modest husband offered no obstacle to that devout spouse in the way of praying watching or otherwise doing good  then follows the story of her nurse waking lewis instead of her and lewiss easy goodnature about this as about every other event of life  and so after these unwearied watchings it often happened that praying for an excessive length of time she fell asleep on a mat beside her husbands bed and being reproved for it by her maidens answered  though i cannot always pray yet i can do violence to my own flesh by tearing myself in the meantime from my couch  fugiebat oblectamenta carnalia et ideo stratum molliorem et viri contubernium secretissimum quantum licuit declinavit  quem

continence at the will of the said conrad salva jure matrimonii  p 59  the open street  cf lib ii section 11  on the rogation days when certain persons doing contrary to the decrees of the saints are decorated with precious and luxurious garments the princess dressed in serge and barefooted used to follow most devoutly the procession of the cross and the relics of the saints and place herself always at sermon among the poorest women knowing says dietrich that seeds cast into the valleys spring up into the richest crop of corn  p 60  the poor of christ  cf lib ii sections 6 11 et passim  elizabeths labours among the poor are too well known throughout one half at least of christendom where she is par excellence the patron of the poor to need quotations  p 61  ill be thy pupil  cf lib

as alms for the poor  she also built a hospital at the foot of the wartburg wherein she placed all those who could not wait for the general distribution     she sold her own ornaments to feed the

 cf lib iv section 1  in the year 1227 there was a general passagium to the holy land in which frederick the emperor also crossed the seas or rather did not cross the seas says heinrich stero in his annals but having got as far as sicily came back againmiserably disappointing and breaking up the expedition whereof the greater part died at the various portsand was excommunicated for so doing and lewis landgrave of the thuringians took the cross likewise in the name of jesus christ and    did not immediately fix the badge which he had received to his garment as the matter is lest his wife who loved him with the most tender affection seeing this should be anxious and disturbed    but she found it while turning over his purse and fainted struck down with a wonderful consternation  p 90  i must be gone  cf lib iv section 2  a chapter in which dietrich rises into a truly noble and pathetic strain coming to schmalcald he says lewis found his dearest friends whom he had ordered to meet him there not wishing to depart without taking leave of them  then follows dietrichs only poetic attempt which basnage calls a carmen ineptum foolish ballad and most unfairly as all readers should say if i had any hope of doing justice in a translation to this genial fragment of an old dramatic ballad and its simple objectivity as of a writer so impressed like all true teutonic poets in those earnest days with the pathos and greatness of his subject that he never tries to improve it by reflections and preaching at his readers but thinks it enough just to tell his story sure that it will speak for itself to all hearts  quibus valefaciens cum moerore commisit suis fratribus natos cum uxore matremque deosculatos filiali more vix eam alloquitur cordis prae dolore illis mota viscera corda

aside scripture parodies and professional stoic sentiment and describe with such life and pathos like any eyewitness a scene which occurred in fact two years before his birth  and thus this prince of peace he continues mounting his horse with many knights etc    about the end of the month of june set forth in the name of the lord praising him in heart and voice and weeping and singing were heard side by side  and close by followed with saddest heart that most faithful lady after her sweetest prince her most loving spouse never alas to behold him more  and when she was going to return the force of love and the agony of separation forced her on with him one days journey  and yet that did not suffice  she went on still unable to bear the parting another full days journey    at last they part at the exhortations of rudolph the cupbearer  what groans think you what sobs what struggles and yearnings of the heart must there have been  yet they part and go on their way     the lord went forth exulting as a giant to run his course the lady returned lamenting as a widow and tears were on her cheeks  then putting off the garments of joy she took the dress of widowhood  the mistress of

who remaining in virginity became a nun of aldenburg of which place she is lady abbess until this day    notes to act iii    p 94  on the freezing stone  cf lib ii section 5  in the absence of her

upon her knees the world is dead to me and all that is pleasant in the world  having said this suddenly springing up with tears she rushed swiftly through the whole length of the palace and being entirely beside herself would have run on to the worlds end usque quaque if a wall had not stopped her and others coming up led her away from the wall to which she had clung  ibid  yon lions rage  cf

took refuge in the church     and when her little ones were brought to her from the castle amid most bitter frost she knew not where to lay their heads    she entered a priests house and fed her family miserably enough by pawning what she had  there was in that town an enemy of hers having a roomy house     whither she entered at his bidding and was forced to dwell with her whole family in a

own age  the doctrine is not of course to be found totidem verbis in the formularies of any sect yet almost all sects preach it and quote scripture for it as boldly as conradthe romish saint alone carries it honestly out into practice  p 126  with pine boughs  cf lib vi section 2  entering a certain desolate court she betook herself sub gradu cujusdam caminatae to the projection of a certain

constancy of her obedience might become known and occasion might be given to her for clinging to god alone  p 128  a leprous boy  cf lib vi section 8  she had several of these proteges successively

mighty to save  cf lib vii section 7  when we read amongst other matters how the objects of her prayers used to become while she was speaking so intensely hot that they not only smoked and nearly melted but burnt the fingers of those who touched them  from whence dietrich bids us learn with what an ardour of charity she used to burn who would dry up with her heat the flow of worldly desire and

certain austere women from whom she endured much oppression patiently for christs sake who watching her rigidly frequently reported her to her master for having transgressed her obedience in giving

beloved child pray for the agonies which i suffer for thou canst  elizabeth waking prayed earnestly and falling asleep again her mother appeared to her and told her that she was freed and that elizabeths prayers would hereafter benefit all who invoked her  of the causes of her mothers murder the less that is said the better but the prudent letter which the bishop of gran sent back when asked to join in the conspiracy against her is worthy notice  reginam occidere nolite timere bonum est  si omnes consentiunt ego non contradico  to be read as a full consent or as a flat refusal according to the success of the plot  p 140  any living soul  dietrich has much on this point headed how master conrad exercised saint elizabeth in the breaking of her own will     and at last forbad her entirely to give alms whereon she employed herself in washing lepers and other infirm folk  in the meantime she was languishing and inwardly tortured with emotions of compassion  i may here say that in representing elizabeths early death as accelerated by a broken heart i have i believe told the truth though i find no hint of anything of the kind in dietrich  the religious public of a petty town in the thirteenth century round the deathbed of a royal saint would of course treasure up most carefully all incidents connected with her latter days but they would hardly record sentiments or expressions which might seem to their notions to derogate in anyway from her saintship  dietrich too looking at the subject as a monk and not as a man would consider it just as much his duty to make her deathscene rapturous as to make both her life and her tomb miraculous  i have composed these last scenes in the belief that elizabeth and all her compeers will be recognised as real saints in proportion as they are felt to have been real men and women  p 142  eructate sweet doctrine  the expressions are dietrichs own  ibid  in her coffin yet  cf lib viii section i  ibid  so she said  cf

the poor  p 143  martha and their brother etc  i have compressed the events of several days into one in this scene i give dietrichs own account omitting his reflections  when she had been ill twelve days and more one of her maids sitting by her bed heard in her throat a very sweet sound    and saying oh my mistress how sweetly thou didst sing she answered i tell thee i heard a little bird between me and the wall sing merrily who with his sweet song so stirred me up that i could not but sing myself  again section 3  the last day she remained till evening most devout having been made partaker of the celestial table and inebriated with that most pure blood of life which is christ  the word of truth was continually on her lips and opening her mouth of wisdom she spake of the best things which she had heard in sermons eructating from her heart good words and the law of clemency was heard on her tongue  she told from the abundance of her heart how the lord jesus condescended to console mary and martha at the raising again of their brother lazarus and then speaking of his weeping with them over the dead she eructated the memory of the abundance of the lords sweetness affectu et effectu in feeling and expression  certain religious person who were present hearing these words fired with devotion by the grace which filled her lips melted into tears  to whom the saint of god now dying recalled the sweet words of her lord as he went to death saying daughters of jerusalem etc  having said this she was silent  a wonderful thing  then most sweet voices were heard in her throat without any motion of her lips and she asked of those round did ye not hear some singing with me  whereon none of the faithful are allowed to doubt says dietrich when she herself heard the harmony of the heavenly hosts etc etc    from that time till twilight she lay as if exultant and jubilant showing signs of remarkable devotion till the crowing of the cock  then as if secure in the lord she said to the bystanders what should we do if the fiend showed himself to us  and shortly afterwards with a loud and clear voice fly fly as if repelling the daemon  at the cockcrow she said here is the hour in which the virgin brought forth her child jesus and laid him in a manger     let us talk of him and of that new star which he created by his omnipotence which never before was seen  for these says montanus in her name are the venerable mysteries of our faith our richest blessings our fairest ornaments  in these all the reason of our hope flourishes faith grows charity burns  the novelty of the style and matter will i hope excuse its prolixity with most readers  if not i have still my reasons for inserting the greater part of this chapter  p 145   i demand it  how far i am justified in putting such fears into her mouth the reader may judge  cf lib viii section 5   the devotion of the people demanding it her body was left unburied till the fourth day in the midst of a multitude     the flesh says dietrich had the tenderness of a living body and was easily moved hither and thither at the will of those who handled it     and many sublime in the valour of their faith tore off the hair of her head and the nails of her fingers even the tips of her ears et mamillarum papillas says untranslatably montanus of spire and kept them as relics  the reference relating to the pictures of her disciplines and the effect which they produced on the crowd i have unfortunately lost  p  146  and yet no pain  cf lib viii section 4  she said though i am weak i feel no disease or pain and so through that whole day and night as hath been said having been elevated with most holy affections of mind towards god and inflamed in spirit with most divine utterances and conversations at length she rested from jubilating and inclining her head as if falling into a sweet sleep expired  p 147  canonisation  cf lib viii section 10  if i have in the last scene been guilty of a small anachronism i have in this been guilty of a great one  conrad was of course a prime means of elizabeths canonisation and as dietrich and his own letter to pope gregory the ninth show collected and pressed on the notice of the archbishop of maintz the miraculous statements necessary for that honour  but he died two years before the actual publication of her canonisation  it appeared to me that by following the exact facts i must either lose sight of the final triumph which connects my heroine for ever with germany and all romish christendom and is the very culmination of the whole story or relinquish my only opportunity of doing conrad justice by exhibiting the remaining side of his character  i am afraid that i have erred and that the most strict historic truth would have coincided as usual with the highest artistic effect while it would only have corroborated the moral of my poem supposing that there is one  but i was fettered by the poverty of my own imagination and do manus lectoribus  ibid  third minors  the order of the third minors of st francis of assisi was in invention of the comprehensive mind of that truly great man by which worldlings were enabled to participate in the spiritual advantages of the franciscan rule and discipline without neglect or suspension of their civic and family duties  but it was an institution too enlightened for its age and family and civic ties were destined for a far nobler consecration  the order was persecuted and all but exterminated by the jealousy of the regular monks not it seems without papal connivance  within a few years after its foundation it numbered amongst its members the noblest knights and ladies of christendom st louis of france among the number  p 149  lest he fall  cf fleury eccl annals in anno 1233 doctor conrad of

the others who did not appear conrad gave the cross to those who would take up arms against them  at which these supposed heretics were so irritated that on his return they lay in wait for him near marpurg and killed him with brother gerard of the order of minors a holy man  conrad was accused of precipitation in his judgments and of having burned trop legerement under pretext of heresy many

famous contest of the minnesingers on the wartburg  here is dietrichs account  there was in those days in the landgraves court six knights nobles etc etc cantilenarum confectores summi songwrights of the highest excellence either one of them or klingsohr himself was the author of the nibelungenlied and the heldenbuch  now there dwelt then in the parts of hungary in the land which is called the seven castles a certain rich nobleman worth 3000 marks a year a philosopher practised from his youth in secular literature but nevertheless learned in the sciences of necromancy and astronomy  this master klingsohr was sent for by the prince to judge between the songs of these knights aforesaid  who before he was introduced to the landgrave sitting one night in eisenach in the court of his lodging looked very earnestly upon the stars and being asked if he had perceived any secrets know that this night is born a daughter to the king of hungary who shall be called elizabeth and shall be a saint and shall be given to wife to the son of this prince in the fame of whose sanctity all the earth shall exult and be exalted  seehe who by balaam the wizard foretold the mystery of his own incarnation himself foretold by this wizard the name and birth of his forechosen handmaid elizabeth  a comparison of which basnage says that he cannot deny it to be intolerable  i am not bound to explain all strange stories but considering who and whence klingsohr was and the fact that the treaty of espousals took place two months afterwards adhuc sugens ubera desponsata est it is not impossible that king andrew and his sage vassal may have had some previous conversation on the destination of the unborn princess  p 151  a robe  cf lib ii section 9 for this story on which dietrich observes thus did her heavenly father clothe his lily elizabeth as solomon in all his glory could not do  p 152  the incarnate son  this story is told i think by surias and has been introduced with an illustration by a german artist of the highest note into a modern prose biography of this saint  i have omitted much more of the same kind  ibid  sainthoods palm  cf lib viii sections 7 8 9  while to declare the merits of his handmaid elizabeth in the place where her body rested almighty god was thus multiplying the badges of her virtues ie miracles two altars were built in her praise in that

preacher commanded all who had received any grace of healing from the merits of elizabeth to appear next day before the archbishop and faithfully prove their assertions by witnesses    then the most holy father pope gregory the ninth having made diligent examination of the miracles transmitted to him trusting at the same time to mature and prudent counsels and the holy spirits providence above
