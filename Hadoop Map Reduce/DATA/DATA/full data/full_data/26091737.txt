    my visit to niagara      the antique ring      graves and goblins    my visit to niagara  never did a pilgrim approach niagara with deeper enthusiasm than mine i had lingered away from it and wandered to other scenes because my treasury of anticipated enjoyments comprising all the wonders of the world had nothing else so magnificent and i was loath to exchange the pleasures of hope for those of memory so soon  at length the day came the stagecoach with a frenchman and myself on the back seat had already left lewiston and in less than an hour would set us down in manchester  i began to listen for the roar of the cataract and trembled with a sensation like dread as the moment drew nigh when its voice of ages must roll for the first time on my ear  the french gentleman stretched himself from the window and expressed loud admiration while by a sudden impulse i threw myself back and closed my eyes  when the scene shut in i was glad to think that for me the whole burst of niagara was yet in futurity  we rolled on and entered the village of manchester bordering on the falls  i am quite ashamed of myself here  not that i ran like a madman to the falls and plunged into the thickest of the spraynever stopping to breathe till breathing was impossible not that i committed this or any other suitable extravagance  on the contrary i alighted with perfect decency and composure gave my cloak to the black waiter pointed out my baggage and inquired not the nearest way to the cataract but about the dinnerhour  the interval was spent in arranging my dress  within the last fifteen minutes my mind had grown strangely benumbed and my spirits apathetic with a slight depression not decided enough to be termed sadness  my enthusiasm was in a deathlike slumber  without aspiring to immortality as he did i could have imitated that english traveller who turned back from the point where he first heard the thunder of niagara after crossing the ocean to behold it  many a western trader by the by has performed a similar act of heroism with more heroic simplicity deeming it no such wonderful feat to dine at the hotel and resume his route to buffalo or lewiston while the cataract was roaring unseen  such has often been my apathy when objects long sought and earnestly desired were placed within my reach  after dinnerat which an unwonted and perverse epicurism detained me longer than usuali lighted a cigar and paced the piazza minutely attentive to the aspect and business of a very ordinary village  finally with reluctant step and the feeling of an intruder i walked towards goat island  at the tollhouse there were further excuses for delaying the inevitable moment  my signature was required in a huge ledger containing similar records innumerable many of which i read  the skin of a great sturgeon and other fishes beasts and reptiles a collection of minerals such as lie in heaps near the falls some indian moccasins and other trifles made of deerskin and embroidered with beads several newspapers from montreal new york and bostonall attracted me in turn  out of a number of twisted sticks the manufacture of a tuscarora indian i selected one of curled maple curiously convoluted and adorned with the carved images of a snake and a fish  using this as my pilgrims staff i crossed the bridge  above and below me were the rapids a river of impetuous snow with here and there a dark rock amid its whiteness resisting all the physical fury as any cold spirit did the moral influences of the scene  on reaching goat island which separates the two great segments of the falls i chose the righthand path and followed it to the edge of the american cascade  there while the falling sheet was yet invisible i saw the vapor that never vanishes and the eternal rainbow of niagara  it was an afternoon of glorious sunshine without a cloud save those of the cataracts  i gained an insulated rock and beheld a broad sheet of brilliant and unbroken foam not shooting in a curved line from the top of the precipice but falling headlong down from height to depth  a narrow stream diverged from the main branch and hurried over the crag by a channel of its own leaving a little pineclad island and a streak of precipice between itself and the larger sheet  below arose the mist on which was painted a dazzling sunbow with two concentric shadowsone almost as perfect as the original brightness and the other drawn faintly round the broken edge of the cloud  still i  had not half seen niagara  following the verge of the island the path led me to the horseshoe where the real broad st lawrence rushing along on a level with its banks pours its whole breadth over a concave line of precipice and thence pursues its course between lofty crags towards ontario  a sort of bridge two or three feet wide stretches out along the edge of the descending sheet and hangs upon the rising mist as if that were the foundation of the frail structure here i stationed myself in the blast of wind which the rushing river bore along with it  the bridge was tremulous beneath me and marked the tremor of the solid earth  i looked along the whitening rapids and endeavored to distinguish a mass of water far above the falls to follow it to their verge and go down with it in fancy to the abyss of clouds and storm  casting my eyes across the river and every side i took in the whole scene at a glance and tried to comprehend it in one vast idea  after an hour thus spent i left the bridge and by a staircase winding almost interminably round a post descended to the base of the precipice  from that point my path lay over slippery stones and among great fragments of the cliff to the edge of the cataract where the wind at once enveloped me in spray and perhaps dashed the rainbow round me  were my long desires fulfilled  and had i seen niagara  o that i had never heard of niagara till i beheld it  blessed were the wanderers of old who heard its deep roar sounding through the woods as the summons to an unknown wonder and approached its awful brink in all the freshness of native feeling  had its own mysterious voice been the first to warn me of its existence then indeed i might have knelt down and worshipped  but i had come thither haunted with a vision of foam and fury and dizzy cliffs and an ocean tumbling down out of the skya scene in short which nature had too much good taste and calm simplicity to realize  my mind had struggled to adapt these false conceptions to the reality and finding the effort vain a wretched sense of disappointment weighed me down  i climbed the precipice and threw myself on the earth feeling that i was unworthy to look at the great falls and careless about beholding them again  all that night as there has been and will be for ages past and to come a rushing sound was heard as if a great tempest were sweeping through the air  it mingled with my dreams and made them full of storm and whirlwind  whenever i awoke and heard this dread sound in the air and the windows rattling as with a mighty blast i could not rest again till looking forth i saw how bright the stars were and that every leaf in the garden was motionless  never was a summer night more calm to the eye nor a gale of autumn louder to the ear  the rushing sound proceeds from the rapids and the rattling of the casements is but an effect of the vibration of the whole house shaken by the jar of the cataract the noise of the rapids draws the attention from the true voice of niagara which is a dull muffed thunder resounding between the cliffs i spent a wakeful hour at midnight in distinguishing its reverberations and rejoiced to find that my former awe and enthusiasm were reviving  gradually and after much contemplation i came to know by my own feelings that niagara is indeed a wonder of the world and not the less wonderful because time and thought must be employed in comprehending it  casting aside all preconceived notions and preparation to be direstruck or delighted the beholder must stand beside it in the simplicity of his heart suffering the mighty scene to work its own impression  night after night i dreamed of it and was gladdened every morning by the consciousness of a growing capacity to enjoy it  yet i will not pretend to the allabsorbing enthusiasm of some more fortunate spectators nor deny that very trifling causes would draw my eyes and thoughts from the cataract  the last day that i was to spend at niagara before my departure for the far west i sat upon the table rock  this celebrated station did not now as of old project fifty feet beyond the line of the precipice but was shattered by the fall of an immense fragment which lay distant on the shore below  still on the utmost verge of the rock with my feet hanging over it i felt as if suspended in the open air  never before had my mind been in such perfect unison with the scene  there were intervals when i was conscious of nothing but the great river rolling calmly into the abyss rather descending than precipitating itself and acquiring tenfold majesty from its unhurried motion  it came like the march of destiny  it was not taken by surprise but seemed to have anticipated in all its course through the broad lakes that it must pour their collected waters down this height  the perfect foam of the river after its descent and the evervarying shapes of mist rising up to become clouds in the sky would be the very picture of confusion were it merely transient like the rage of a tempest  but when the beholder has stood awhile and perceives no lull in the storm and considers that the vapor and the foam are as everlasting as the rocks which produce them all this turmoil assumes a sort of calmness  it soothes while it awes the mind  leaning over the cliff i saw the guide conducting two adventurers behind the falls  it was pleasant from that high seat in the sunshine to observe them struggling against the eternal storm of the lower regions with heads bent down now faltering now pressing forward and finally swallowed up in their victory  after their disappearance a blast rushed out with an old hat which it had swept from one of their heads  the rock to which they were directing their unseen course is marked at a fearful distance on the exterior of the sheet by a jet of foam  the attempt to reach it appears both poetical and perilous to a lookeron but may be accomplished without much more difficulty or hazard than in stemming a violent northeaster  in a few moments forth came the children of the mist  dripping and breathless they crept along the base of the cliff ascended to the guides cottage and received i presume a certificate of their achievement with three verses of sublime poetry on the back  my contemplations were often interrupted by strangers who came down from forsyths to take their first view of the falls  a short ruddy middleaged gentleman fresh from old england peeped over the rock and evinced his approbation by a broad grin  his spouse a very robust lady afforded a sweet example of maternal solicitude being so intent on the safety of her little boy that she did not even glance at niagara as for the child he gave himself wholly to the enjoyment of a stick of candy  another traveller a native american and no rare character among us produced a volume of captain halls tour and labored earnestly to adjust niagara to the captains description departing at last without one new idea or sensation of his own  the next comer was provided not with a printed book but with a blank sheet of foolscap from top to bottom of which by means of an everpointed pencil the cataract was made to thunder  in a little talk which we had together he awarded his approbation to the general view but censured the position of goat island observing that it should have been thrown farther to the right so as to widen the american falls and contract those of the horseshoe  next appeared two traders of michigan who declared that upon the whole the sight was worth looking at there certainly was an immense waterpower here but that after all they would go twice as far to see the noble stoneworks of lockport where the grand canal is locked down a descent of sixty feet  they were succeeded by a young fellow in a homespun cotton dress with a staff in his hand and a pack over his shoulders  he advanced close to the edge of the rock where his attention at first wavering among the different components of the scene finally became fixed in the angle of the horse shoe falls which is indeed the central point of interest  his whole soul seemed to go forth and be transported thither till the staff slipped from his relaxed grasp and falling downdowndownstruck upon the fragment of the table rock  in this manner i spent some hours watching the varied impression made by the cataract on those who disturbed me and returning to unwearied contemplation when left alone  at length my time came to depart there is a grassy footpath through the woods along the summit of the bank to a point whence a causeway hewn in the side of the precipice goes winding down to the ferry about half a mile below the table rock the sun was near setting when i emerged from the shadow of the trees and began the descent  the indirectness of my downward road continually changed the point of view and showed me in rich and repeated succession now the whitening rapids and majestic leap of the main river which appeared more deeply massive as the light departed now the lovelier picture yet still sublime of goat island with its rocks and grove and the lesser falls tumbling over the right bank of the st lawrence like a tributary stream now the long vista of the river as it eddied and whirled between the cliffs to pass through ontario toward the sea and everywhere to be wondered at for this one unrivalled scene  the golden sunshine tinged the sheet of the american cascade and painted on its heaving spray the broken semicircle of a rainbow heavens own beauty crowning earths sublimity  my steps were slow and i paused long at every turn of the descent as one lingers and pauses who discerns a brighter and brightening excellence in what he must soon behold no more  the solitude of the old wilderness now reigned over the whole vicinity of the falls  my enjoyment became the more rapturous because no poet shared it nor wretch devoid of poetry profaned it but the spot so famous through the world was all my own       the antique ring  yes indeed the gem is as bright as a star and curiously set said clara pembertou examining an antique ring which her betrothed lover had just presented to her with a very pretty speech  it needs only one thing to make it perfect  and what is that asked mr edward caryl secretly anxious for the credit of his gift  a modern setting perhaps  o no  that would destroy the charm at once replied clara  it needs nothing but a story  i long to know how many times it has been the pledge of faith between two lovers and whether the vows of which it was the symbol were always kept or often broken  not that i should be too scrupulous about facts  if you happen to be unacquainted with its authentic history so much the better  may it not have sparkled upon a queens finger  or who knows but it is the very ring which posthumus received from imogen  in short you must kindle your imagination at the lustre of this diamond and make a legend for it  now such a taskand doubtless clara knew itwas the most acceptable that could have been imposed on edward caryl  he was one of that multitude of young gentlemenlimbs or rather twigs of the lawwhose names appear in gilt letters on the front of tudors buildings and other places in the vicinity of the court house which seem to be the haunt of the gentler as well as the severer muses  edward in the dearth of clients was accustomed to employ his much leisure in assisting the growth of american literature to which good cause he had contributed not a few quires of the finest letterpaper containing some thought some fancy some depth of feeling together with a young writers abundance of conceits  sonnets stanzas of tennysonian sweetness tales imbued with german mysticism versions from jean paul criticisms of the old english poets and essays smacking of dialistic philosophy were among his multifarious productions  the editors of the fashionable periodicals were familiar with his autograph and inscribed his name in those brilliant beadrolls of inkstained celebrity which illustrate the first page of their covers  nor did fame withhold her laurel  hillard had included him among the lights of the new england metropolis in his boston book bryant had found room for some of his stanzas in the selections from american poetry and mr griswold in his recent assemblage of the sons and daughters of song had introduced edward caryl into the inner court of the temple among his fourscore choicest bards  there was a prospect indeed of his assuming a still higher and more independent position  interviews had been held with ticknor and a correspondence with the harpers respecting a proposed volume chiefly to consist of mr caryls fugitive pieces in the magazines but to be accompanied with a poem of some length never before published  not improbably the public may yet be gratified with this collection  meanwhile we sum up our sketch of edward caryl by pronouncing him though somewhat of a carpet knight in literature yet no unfavorable specimen of a generation of rising writers whose spirit is such that we may reasonably expect creditable attempts from all and good and beautiful results from some  and it will be observed edward was the very man to write pretty legends at a ladys instance for an oldfashioned diamond ring  he took the jewel in his hand and turned it so as to catch its scintillating radiance as if hoping in accordance with claras suggestion to light up his fancy with that starlike gleam  shall it be a ballada tale in verse he inquired  enchanted rings often glisten in old english poetry i think something may be done with the subject but it is fitter for rhyme than prose  no no said miss pemberton we will have no more rhyme than just enough for a posy to the ring  you must tell the legend in simple prose and when it is finished i will make a little party to hear it read  the young gentleman promised obedience and going to his pillow with his head full of the familiar spirits that used to be worn in rings watches and swordhilts he had the good fortune to possess himself of an available idea in a dream  connecting this with what he himself chanced to know of the rings real history his task was done  clara pemberton invited a select few of her friends all holding the stanchest faith in edwards genius and therefore the most genial auditors if not altogether the fairest critics that a writer could possibly desire blessed be woman for her faculty of admiration and especially for her tendency to admire with her heart when man at most grants merely a cold approval with his mind  drawing his chair beneath the blaze of a solar lamp edward caryl untied a roll of glossy paper and began as follows   the legend  after the deathwarrant had been read to the earl of essex and on the evening before his appointed execution the countess of shrewsbury paid his lordship a visit and found him as it appeared toying childishly with a ring  the diamond that enriched it glittered like a little star but with a singular tinge of red  the gloomy prisonchamber in the tower with its deep and narrow windows piercing the walls of stone was now all that the earl possessed of worldly prospect so that there was the less wonder that he should look steadfastly into the gem and moralize upon earths deceitful splendor as men in darkness and ruin seldom fail to do  but the shrewd observations of the countessan artful and unprincipled womanthe pretended friend of essex but who had come to glut her revenge for a deed of scorn which he himself had forgottenher keen eye detected a deeper interest attached to this jewel  even while expressing his gratitude for her remembrance of a ruined favorite and condemned criminal the earls glance reverted to the ring as if all that remained of time and its affairs were collected within that small golden circlet  my dear lord observed the countess there is surely some matter of great moment wherewith this ring is connected since it so absorbs your mind  a token it may be of some fair ladys lovealas poor lady once richest in possessing such a heart  would you that the jewel be returned to her  the queen the queen  it was her majestys own gift replied the earl still gazing into the depths of the gem  she took it from her finger and told me with a smile that it was an heirloom from her tudor ancestors and had once been the property of merlin the british wizard who gave it to the lady of his love  his art had made this diamond the abidingplace of a spirit which though of fiendish nature was bound to work only good so long as the ring was an unviolated pledge of love and faith both with the giver and receiver  but should love prove false and faith be broken then the evil spirit would work his own devilish will until the ring were purified by becoming the medium of some good and holy act and again the pledge of faithful love the gem soon lost its virtue for the wizard was murdered by the very lady to whom he gave it  an idle legend said the countess  it is so answered essex with a melancholy smile  yet the queens favor of which this ring was the symbol has proved my ruin  when death is nigh men converse with dreams and shadows  i have been gazing into the diamond and fancyingbut you will laugh at methat i might catch a glimpse of the evil spirit there  do you observe this red glowdusky too amid all the brightness  it is the token of his presence and even now methinks it grows redder and duskier like an angry sunset  nevertheless the earls manner testified how slight was his credence in the enchanted properties of the ring  but there is a kind of playfulness that comes in moments of despair when the reality of misfortune if entirely felt would crush the soul at once  he now for a brief space was lost in thought while the countess contemplated him with malignant satisfaction  this ring he resumed in another tone alone remains of all that my royal mistresss favor lavished upon her servant  my fortune once shone as brightly as the gem  and now such a darkness has fallen around me methinks it would be no marvel if its gleamthe sole light of my prisonhousewere to be forthwith extinguished inasmuch as my last earthly hope depends upon it  how say you my lord  asked the countess of shrewsbury  the stone is bright but there should be strange magic in it if it can keep your hopes alive at this sad hour  alas these iron bars and ramparts of the tower are unlike to yield to such a spell  essex raised his head involuntarily for there was something in the countesss tone that disturbed him although he could not suspect that an enemy had intruded upon the sacred privacy of a prisoners dungeon to exult over so dark a ruin of such once brilliant fortunes  he looked her in the face but saw nothing to awaken his distrust  it would have required a keener eye than even cecils to read the secret of a countenance which had been worn so long in the false light of a court that it was now little better than a mask telling any story save the true one  the condemned nobleman again bent over the ring and proceeded  it once had power in itthis bright gemthe magic that appertains to the talisman of a great queens favor  she bade me if hereafter i should fall into her disgracehow deep soever and whatever might be the crimeto convey this jewel to her sight and it should plead for me  doubtless with her piercing judgment she had even then detected the rashness of my nature and foreboded some such deed as has now brought destruction upon my bead  and knowing too her own hereditary rigor she designed it may be that the memory of gentler and kindlier hours should soften her heart in my behalf when my need should be the greatest  i have doubtedi have distrustedyet who can tell even now what happy influence this ring might have  you have delayed full long to show the ring and plead her majestys gracious promise remarked the countessyour state being what it is  true replied the earl but for my honors sake i was loath to entreat the queens mercy while i might hope for life at least from the justice of the laws  if on a trial by my peers i had been acquitted of meditating violence against her sacred life then would i have fallen at her feet and presenting the jewel have prayed no other favor than that my love and zeal should be put to the severest test but nowit were confessing too muchit were cringing too lowto beg the miserable gift of life on no other score than the tenderness which her majesty deems one to have forfeited  yet it is your only hope said the countess  and besides continued essex pursuing his own reflections of what avail will be this token of womanly feeling when on the other hand are arrayed the allprevailing motives of state policy and the artifices and intrigues of courtiers to consummate my downfall  will cecil or raleigh suffer her heart to act for itself even if the spirit of her father were not in her  it is in vain to hope it  but still essex gazed at the ring with an absorbed attention that proved how much hope his sanguine temperament had concentrated here when there was none else for him in the wide world save what lay in the compass of that hoop of gold  the spark of brightness within the diamond which gleamed like an intenser than earthly fire was the memorial of his dazzling career  it had not paled with the waning sunshine of his mistresss favor on the contrary in spite of its remarkable tinge of dusky red he fancied that it never shone so brightly  the glow of festal torchesthe blaze of perfumed lampsbonfires that had been kindled for him when he was the darling of the peoplethe splendor of the royal court where he had been the peculiar starall seemed to have collected their moral or material glory into the gem and to burn with a radiance caught from the future as well as gathered from the past  that radiance might break forth again bursting from the diamond into which it was now narrowed it might been first upon the gloomy walls of the towerthen wider wider widertill all england and the seas around her cliffs should be gladdened with the light  it was such an ecstasy as often ensues after long depression and has been supposed to precede the circumstances of darkest fate that may befall mortal man  the earl pressed the ring to his heart as if it were indeed a talisman the habitation of a spirit as the queen had playfully assured himbut a spirit of happier influences than her legend spake of  o could i but make my way to her footstool  cried he waving his hand aloft while he paced the stone pavement of his prisonchamber with an impetuous step  i might kneel down indeed a ruined man condemned to the block but how should i rise again  once more the favorite of elizabethenglands proudest noblewith such prospects as ambition never aimed at  why have i tarried so long in this weary dungeon  the ring has power to set me free  the palace wants me  ho jailer unbar the door  but then occurred the recollection of the impossibility of obtaining an interview with his fatally estranged mistress and testing the influence over her affections which he still flattered himself with possessing could he step beyond the limits of his prison the world would be all sunshine but here was only gloom and death  alas said he slowly and sadly letting his head fall upon his hands i die for the lack of one blessed word  the countess of shrewsbury herself forgotten amid the earls gorgeous visions had watched him with an aspect that could have betrayed nothing to the most suspicious observer unless that it was too calm for humanity while witnessing the flutterings as it were of a generous heart in the deathagony  she now approached him  my good lord she said what mean you to do  nothingmy deeds are done replied he despondingly yet had a fallen favorite any friends i would entreat one of them to lay this ring at her majestys feet albeit with little hope save that hereafter it might remind her that poor essex once far too highly favored was at last too severely dealt with  i will be that friend said the countess  there is no time to be lost  trust this precious ring with me  this very night the queens eye shall rest upon it nor shall the efficacy of my poor words be wanting to strengthen the impression which it will doubtless make  the earls first impulse was to hold out the ring  but looking at the countess as she bent forward to receive it he fancied that the red glow of the gem tinged all her face and gave it an ominous expression many passages of past times recurred to his memory  a preternatural insight perchance caught from approaching death threw its momentary gleam as from a meteor all round his position  countess he said i know not wherefore i hesitate being in a plight so desperate and having so little choice of friends  but have you looked into your own heart  can you perform this office with the truththe earnestnesstimezeal even to tears and agony of spiritwherewith the holy gift of human life should be pleaded for  woe be unto you should you undertake this task and deal towards me otherwise than with utmost faith  for your own souls sake and as you would have peace at your deathhour consider well in what spirit you receive this ring  the countess did not shrink  my lordmy good lord she exclaimed wrong not a womans heart by these suspicious  you might choose another messenger but who save a lady of her bedchamber can obtain access to the queen at this untimely hour  it is for your lifefor your lifeelse i would not renew my offer  take the ring said the earl  believe that it shall be in the queens hands before the lapse of another hour replied the countess as she received this sacred trust of life and death  tomorrow morning look for the result of my intercession  she departed  again the earls hopes rose high  dreams visited his slumber not of the sabledecked scaffold in the toweryard but of canopies of state obsequious courtiers pomp splendor the smile of the once more gracious queen and a light beaming from the magic gem which illuminated his whole future  history records how foully the countess of shrewsbury betrayed the trust which essex in his utmost need confided to her  she kept the ring and stood in the presence of elizabeth that night without one attempt to soften her stern hereditary temper in behalf of the former favorite  the next day the earls noble head rolled upon the scaffold on her deathbed tortured at last with a sense of the dreadful guilt which she had taken upon her soul the wicked countess sent for elizabeth revealed the story of the ring and besought forgiveness for her treachery  but the queen still obdurate even while remorse for past obduracy was tugging at her heartstrings shook the dying woman in her bed as if struggling with death for the privilege of wreaking her revenge and spite  the spirit of the countess passed away to undergo the justice or receive the mercy of a higher tribunal and tradition says that the fatal ring was found upon her breast where it had imprinted a dark red circle resembling the effect of the intensest heat  the attendants who prepared the body for burial shuddered whispering one to another that the ring must have derived its heat from the glow of infernal fire  they left it on her breast in the coffin and it went with that guilty woman to the tomb  many years afterward when the church that contained the monuments of the shrewsbury family was desecrated by cromwells soldiers they broke open the ancestral vaults and stole whatever was valuable from the noble personages who reposed there  merlins antique ring passed into the possession of a stout sergeant of the ironsides who thus became subject to the influences of the evil spirit that still kept his abode within the gems enchanted depths  the sergeant was soon slain in battle thus transmitting the ring though without any legal form of testament to a gay cavalier who forthwith pawned it and expended the money in liquor which speedily brought him to the grave  we next catch the sparkle of the magic diamond at various epochs of the merry reign of charles the second  but its sinister fortune still attended it  from whatever hand this ring of portent came and whatever finger it encircled ever it was the pledge of deceit between man and man or man and woman of faithless vows and unhallowed passion and whether to lords and ladies or to villagemaidsfor sometimes it found its way so lowstill it brought nothing but sorrow and disgrace  no purifying deed was done to drive the fiend from his bright home in this little star  again we hear of it at a later period when sir robert walpole bestowed the ring among far richer jewels on the lady of a british legislator whose political honor he wished to undermine  many a dismal and unhappy tale might be wrought out of its other adventures  all this while its ominous tinge of dusky red had been deepening and darkening until if laid upon white paper it cast the mingled hue of night and blood strangely illuminated with scintillating light in a circle round about  but this peculiarity only made it the more valuable  alas the fatal ring  when shall its dark secret be discovered and the doom of ill inherited from one possessor to another be finally revoked  the legend now crosses the atlantic and comes down to our own immediate time  in a certain church of our city not many evenings ago there was a contribution for a charitable object  a fervid preacher had poured out his whole soul in a rich and tender discourse which had at least excited the tears and perhaps the more effectual sympathy of a numerous audience  while the choristers sang sweetly and the organ poured forth its melodious thunder the deacons passed up and down the aisles and along the galleries presenting their mahogany boxes in which each person deposited whatever sum he deemed it safe to lend to the lord in aid of human wretchedness  charity became audiblechink chink chinkas it fell drop by drop into the common receptacle there was a huma stirthe subdued bustle of people putting their hands into their pockets while ever and anon a vagrant coin fell upon the floor and rolled away with long reverberation into some inscrutable corner  at length all having been favored with an opportunity to be generous the two deacons placed their boxes on the communiontable and thence at the conclusion of the services removed them into the vestry  here these good old gentlemen sat down together to reckon the accumulated treasure  fie fie brother tilton said deacon trott peeping into deacon tiltons box what a heap of copper you have picked up  really for an old man you must have had a heavy job to lug it along  copper copper copper  do people expect to get admittance into heaven at the price of a few coppers  dont wrong them brother answered deacon tilton a simple and kindly old man  copper may do more for one person than gold will for another  in the galleries where i present my box we must not expect such a harvest as you gather among the gentry in the broad aisle and all over the floor of the church  my people are chiefly poor mechanics and laborers sailors seamstresses and servantmaids with a most uncomfortable intermixture of roguish schoolboys  well well said deacon trott but there is a great deal brother tilton in the method of presenting a contributionbox  it is a knack that comes by nature or not at all  they now proceeded to sum up the avails of the evening beginning with the receipts of deacon trott  in good sooth that worthy personage had reaped an abundant harvest in which he prided himself no less apparently than if every dollar had been contributed from his own individual pocket  had the good deacon been meditating a jaunt to texas the treasures of the mahogany box might have sent him on his way rejoicing  there were banknotes mostly it is true of the smallest denominations in the givers pocketbook yet making a goodly average upon the whole  the most splendid contribution was a check for a hundred dollars bearing the name of a distinguished merchant whose liberality was duly celebrated in the newspapers of the next day  no less than seven halfeagles together with an english sovereign glittered amidst an indiscriminate heap of silver the box being polluted with nothing of the copper kind except a single bright new cent wherewith a little boy had performed his first charitable act  very well very well indeed said deacon trott selfapprovingly a handsome evenings work  and now brother tilton lets see whether you can match it  here was a sad contrast  they poured forth deacon tiltons treasure upon the table and it really seemed as if the whole copper coinage of the country together with an amazing quantity of shopkeepers tokens and english and irish halfpence mostly of base metal had been congregated into the box  there was a very substantial pencilcase and the semblance of a shilling but he latter proved to be made of tin and the former of germansilver  a gilded brass button was doing duty as a gold coin and a folded shopbill had assumed the character of a banknote  but deacon tiltons feelings were much revived by the aspect of another banknote new and crisp adorned with beautiful engravings and stamped with the indubitable word twenty in large black letters  alas it was a counterfeit  in short the poor old deacon was no less unfortunate than those who trade with fairies and whose gains are sure to be transformed into dried leaves pebbles and other valuables of that kind  i believe the evil one is in the box said he with some vexation  well done deacon tilton cried his brother trott with a hearty laugh  you ought to have a statue in copper  never mind brother replied the good deacon recovering his temper ill bestow ten dollars from my own pocket and may heavens blessing go along with it  but look  what do you call this  under the copper mountain which it had cost them so much toil to remove lay an antique ring  it was enriched with a diamond which so soon as it caught the light began to twinkle and glimmer emitting the whitest and purest lustre that could possibly be conceivedit was as brilliant as if some magician had condensed the brightest star in heaven into a compass fit to be set in a ring for a ladys delicate finger  how is this said deacon trott examining it carefully in the expectation of finding it as worthless as the rest of his colleagues treasure  why upon my word this seems to be a real diamond and of the purest water  whence could it have come  really i cannot tell quoth deacon tilton for my spectacles were so misty that all faces looked alike  but now i remember there was a flash of light came from the box at one moment but it seemed a dusky red instead of a pure white like the sparkle of this gem  well the ring will make up for the copper but i wish the giver had thrown its history into the box along with it  it has been our good luck to recover a portion of that history  after transmitting misfortune from one possessor to another ever since the days of british merlin the identical ring which queen elizabeth gave to the earl of essex was finally thrown into the contributionbox of a new england church  the two deacons deposited it in the glass case of a fashionable jeweller of whom it was purchased by the humble rehearser of this legend in the hope that it may be allowed to sparkle on a fair ladys finger  purified from the foul fiend so long its inhabitant by a deed of unostentatious charity and now made the symbol of faithful and devoted love the gentle bosom of its new possessor need fear no sorrow from its influence  very prettybeautifulhow originalhow sweetly writtenwhat naturewhat imaginationwhat powerwhat pathoswhat exquisite humorwere the exclamations of edward caryls kind and generous auditors at the conclusion of the legend  it is a pretty tale said miss pemberton who conscious that her praise was to that of all others as a diamond to a pebble was therefore the less liberal in awarding it  it is really a pretty tale and very proper for any of the annuals  but edward your moral does not satisfy me  what thought did you embody in the ring  o clara this is too bad replied edward with a halfreproachful smile  you know that i can never separate the idea from the symbol in which it manifests itself  however we may suppose the gem to be the human heart and the evil spirit to be falsehood which in one guise or another is the fiend that causes all the sorrow and trouble in the world  i beseech you to let this suffice  it shall said clara kindly  and believe me whatever the world may say of the story i prize it far above the diamond which enkindled your imagination       graves and goblins  now talk we of graves and goblins  fit themesstart not gentle readerfit for a ghost like me  yes though an earthclogged fancy is laboring with these conceptions and an earthly hand will write them down for mortal eyes to read still their essence flows from as airy a ghost as ever basked in the pale starlight at twelve oclock  judge them not by the gross and heavy form in which they now appear  they may be gross indeed with the earthly pollution contracted from the brain through which they pass and heavy with the burden of mortal language that crushes all the finer intelligences of the soul  this is no fault of mine  but should aught of ethereal spirit be perceptible yet scarcely so glimmering along the dull train of wordsshould a faint perfume breathe from the mass of claythen gentle reader thank the ghost who thus embodies himself for your sake  will you believe me if i say that all true and noble thoughts and elevated imaginations are but partly the offspring of the intellect which seems to produce them sprites that were poets once and are now all poetry hover round the dreaming bard and become his inspiration buried statesmen lend their wisdom gathered on earth and mellowed in the grave to the historian and when the preacher rises nearest to the level of his mighty subject it is because the prophets of old days have communed with him  who has not been conscious of mysteries within his mind mysteries of truth and reality which will not wear the chains of language  mortal then the dead were with you  and thus shall the earthdulled soul whom i inspire be conscious of a misty brightness among his thoughts and strive to make it gleam upon the pagebut all in vain  poor author how will he despise what he can grasp for the sake of the dim glory that eludes him  so talk we of graves and goblins  but what have ghosts to do with graves  mortal man wearing the dust which shall require a sepulchre might deem it more a home and restingplace than a spirit can whose earthly clod has returned to earth  thus philosophers have reasoned yet wiser they who adhere to the ancient sentiment that a phantom haunts and hallows the marble tomb or grassy hillock where its material form was laid  till purified from each stain of clay till the passions of the living world are all forgotten till it have less brotherhood with the wayfarers of earth than with spirits that never wore mortalitythe ghost must linger round the grave  o it is a long and dreary watch to some of us  even in early childhood i had selected a sweet spot of shade and glimmering sunshine for my grave  it was no burialground but a secluded nook of virgin earth where i used to sit whole summer afternoons dreaming about life and death  my fancy ripened prematurely and taught me secrets which i could not otherwise have known  i pictured the coming yearsthey never came to me indeed but i pictured them like life and made this spot the scene of all that should be brightest in youth manhood and old age  there in a little while it would be time for me to breathe the bashful and burning vows of firstlove thither after gathering fame abroad i would return to enjoy the loud plaudit of the world a vast but unobtrusive sound like the booming of a distant sea and thither at the faroff close of life an aged man would come to dream as the boy was dreaming and be as happy in the past as lie was in futurity  finally when all should be finished in that spot so hallowed in that soil so impregnated with the most precious of my bliss there was to be my grave  methought it would be the sweetest grave that ever a mortal frame reposed in or an ethereal spirit haunted  there too in future times drawn thither by the spell which i had breathed around the place boyhood would sport and dream and youth would love and manhood would enjoy and age would dream again and my ghost would watch but never frighten them  alas the vanity of mortal projects even when they centre in the grave  i died in my first youth before i had been a lover at a distance also from the grave which fancy had dug for me and they buried me in the thronged cemetery of a town where my marble slab stands unnoticed amid a hundred others  and there are coffins on each side of mine  alas poor ghost will the reader say  yet i am a happy ghost enough and disposed to be contented with my grave if the sexton will but let it be my own and bring no other dead man to dispute my title  earth has left few stains upon me and it will be but a short time that i need haunt the place  it is good to die in early youth  had i lived out threescore years and ten or half of them my spirit would have been so earthincrusted that centuries might not have purified it for a better home than the dark precincts of the grave  meantime there is good choice of company amongst us  from twilight till near sunrise we are gliding to and fro some in the graveyard others miles away and would we speak with any friend we do but knock against his tombstone and pronounce the name engraved on it in an instant there the shadow stands  some are ghosts of considerable antiquity  there is an old man hereabout he never had a tombstone and is often puzzled to distinguish his own grave but hereabouts he haunts and long is doomed to haunt he was a miser in his lifetime and buried a strong box of illgotten gold almost fresh from the mint in the coinage of william and mary scarcely was it safe when the sexton buried the old man and his secret with him  i could point out the place where the treasure lies it was at the bottom of the misers garden but a paved thoroughfare now passes beside the spot and the cornerstone of a markethouse presses right down upon it  had the workmen dug six inches deeper they would have found the hoard  now thither must this poor old miser go whether in starlight moonshine or pitch darkness and brood above his worthless treasure recalling all the petty crimes by which he gained it  not a coin must he fail to reckon in his memory nor forget a pennyworth of the sin that made up the sum though his agony is such as if the pieces of gold redhot were stamped into his naked soul  often while he is in torment there he hears the steps of living men who love the dross of earth as well as he did  may they never groan over their miserable wealth like him  night after night for above a hundred years hath he done this penance and still must he do it till the iron box be brought to light and each separate coin be cleansed by grateful tears of a widow or an orphan  my spirit sighs for his long vigil at the corner of the markethouse  there are ghosts whom i tremble to meet and cannot think of without a shudder  one has the guilt of blood upon him  the soul which he thrust untimely forth has long since been summoned from our gloomy graveyard and dwells among the stars of heaven too far and too high for even the recollection of mortal anguish to ascend thither  not so the murderers ghost  it is his doom to spend all the hours of darkness in the spot which he stained with innocent blood and to feel the hot streamhot as when it first gushed upon his handincorporating itself with his spiritual substance  thus his horrible crime is ever fresh within him two other wretches are condemned to walk arm in arm  they were guilty lovers in their lives and still in death must wear the guise of love though hatred and loathing have become their very nature and existence the pollution of their mutual sin remains with them and makes their souls sick continually  o that i might forget all the dark shadows which haunt about these graves  this passing thought of them has left a stain and will weigh me down among dust and sorrow beyond the time that my own transgressions would have kept me here there is one shade among us whose high nature it is good to meditate upon  he lived a patriot and is a patriot still  posterity has forgotten him  the simple slab of red freestone that bore his name was broken long ago and is now covered by the gradual accumulation of the soil  a tuft of thistles is his only monument this upright spirit came to his grave after a lengthened life with so little stain of earth that he might almost immediately have trodden the pathway of the sky  but his strong love of country chained him down to share its vicissitudes of weal or woe  with such deep yearning in his soul he was unfit for heaven that noblest virtue has the effect of sin and keeps his pure and lofty spirit in a penance which may not terminate till america be again a wilderness  not that there is no joy for the dead patriot  can he fail to experience it while be contemplates the mighty and increasing power of the land which be protected in its infancy  no there is much to gladden him  but sometimes i dread to meet him as he returns from the bedchambers of rulers and politicians after diving into their secret motives and searching out their aims  he looks round him with a stern and awful sadness and vanishes into his neglected grave  let nothing sordid or selfish defile your deeds or thoughts ye great men of the day lest ye grieve the noble dead  few ghosts take such an endearing interest as this even in their own private affairs  it made me rather sad at first to find how soon the flame of love expires amid the chill damps of the tomb so much the sooner the more fiercely it may have burned  forget your dead mistress youth  she has already forgotten you  maiden cease to weep for your buried lover  he will know nothing of your tears nor value them if he did  yet it were blasphemy to say that true love is other than immortal  it is an earthly passion of which i speak mingled with little that is spiritual and must therefore perish with the perishing clay  when souls have loved there is no falsehood or forgetfulness maternal affection too is strong as adamant  there are mothers here among us who might have been in heaven fifty years ago if they could forbear to cherish earthly joy and sorrow reflected from the bosoms of their children  husbands and wives have a comfortable gift of oblivion especially when secure of the faith of their living halves  jealousy it is true will play the devil with a ghost driving him to the bedside of secondary wedlock there to scowl unseen and gibber inaudible remonstrances  dead wives however jealous in their lifetime seldom feel this posthumous torment so acutely  many many things that appear most important while we walk the busy street lose all their interest the moment we are borne into the quiet graveyard which borders it  for my own part my spirit had not become so mixed up with earthly existence as to be now held in an unnatural combination or tortured much with retrospective cares  i still love my parents and a younger sister who remain among the living and often grieve me by their patient sorrow for the dead  each separate tear of theirs is an added weight upon my soul and lengthens my stay among the graves  as to other matters it exceedingly rejoices me that my summons came before i had time to write a projected poem which was highly imaginative in conception and could not have failed to give me a triumphant rank in the choir of our native bards  nothing is so much to be deprecated as posthumous renown  it keeps the immortal spirit from the proper bliss of his celestial state and causes him to feed upon the impure breath of mortal man till sometimes he forgets that there are starry realms above him  few poetsinfatuated that they aresoar upward while the least whisper of their name is heard on earth  on sabbath evenings my sisters sit by the fireside between our father and mother and repeat some hymns of mine which they have often heard from my own lips ere the tremulous voice left them forever  little do they think those dear ones that the dead stands listening in the glimmer of the firelight and is almost gifted with a visible shape by the fond intensity of their remembrance  now shall the reader know a grief of the poor ghost that speaks to him a grief but not a helpless one  since i have dwelt among the graves they bore the corpse of a young maiden hither and laid her in the old ancestral vault which is hollowed in the side of a grassy bank  it has a door of stone with rusty iron hinges and above it a rude sculpture of the family arms and inscriptions of all their names who have been buried there including sire and son mother and daughter of an ancient colonial race  all of her lineage had gone before and when the young maiden followed the portal was closed forever  the night after her burial when the other ghosts were flitting about their graves forth came the pale virgins shadow with the rest but knew not whither to go nor whom to haunt so lonesome had she been on earth  she stood by the ancient sepulchre looking upward to the bright stars as if she would even then begin her flight  her sadness made me sad  that night and the next i stood near her in the moonshine but dared not speak because she seemed purer than all the ghosts and fitter to converse with angels than with men  but the third bright eve still gazing upward to the glory of the heavens she sighed and said when will my mother come for me  her low sweet voice emboldened me to speak and she was kind and gentle though so pure and answered me again  from that time always at the ghostly hour i sought the old tomb of her fathers and either found her standing by the door or knocked and she appeared  blessed creature that she was her chaste spirit hallowed mine and imparted such a celestial buoyancy that i longed to grasp her hand and flyupward aloft aloft  i thought too that she only lingered here till my earthlier soul should be purified for heaven  one night when the stars threw down the light that shadows love i stole forth to the accustomed spot and knocked with my airy fingers at her door  she answered not  again i knocked and breathed her name  where was she  at once the truth fell on my miserable spirit and crushed it to the earth among dead mens bones and mouldering dust groaning in cold and desolate agony  her penance was over  she had taken her trackless flight and had found a home in the purest radiance of the upper stars leaving me to knock at the stone portal of the darksome sepulchre  but i knowi know that angels hurried her away or surely she would have whispered ere she fled  she is gone  how could the grave imprison that unspotted one  but her pure ethereal spirit will not quite forget me nor soar too high in bliss till i ascend to join her  soon soon be that hour  i am weary of the earthdamps they burden me they choke me  already i can float in the moonshine the faint starlight will almost bear up my footsteps the perfume of flowers which grosser spirits love is now too earthly a luxury for me  grave  grave thou art not my home  i must flit a little longer in thy night gloom and then be gonefar from the dust of the living and the deadfar from the corruption that is around me but no more within  a few times i have visited the chamber of one who walks obscure and lonely on his mortal pilgrimage  he will leave not many living friends when he goes to join the dead where his thoughts often stray and he might better be  i steal into his sleep and play my part among the figures of his dreams  i glide through the moonlight of his waking fancy and whisper conceptions which with a strange thrill of fear he writes down as his own  i stand beside him now at midnight telling these dreamy truths with a voice so dreamlike that he mistakes them for fictions of a brain too prone to such  yet he glances behind him and shivers while the lamp burns pale  farewell dreamerwaking or sleeping  your brightest dreams are fled your mind grows too hard and cold for a spiritual guest to enter you are earthly too and have all the sins of earth  the ghost will visit you no more  but where is the maiden holy and pure though wearing a form of clay that would have me bend over her pillow at midnight and leave a blessing there  with a silent invocation let her summon me  shrink not maiden when i come  in life i was a highsouled youth meditative yet seldom sad full of chaste fancies and stainless from all grosser sin  and now ill death i bring no loathsome smell of the grave nor ghostly terrorsbut gentle and soothing and sweetly pensive influences  perhaps just fluttering for the skies my visit may hallow the wellsprings of thy thought and make thee heavenly here on earth  then shall pure dreams and holy meditations bless thy life nor thy sainted spirit linger round the grave but seek the upper stars and meet me there
