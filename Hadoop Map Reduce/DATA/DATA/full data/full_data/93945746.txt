93945746	my doggie and i by rm ballantyne    chapter one  explains itself  i possess a doggienot a dog observe but a doggie  if he had been a dog i would not have presumed to intrude him on your notice  a dog is all very well in his wayone of the noblest of animals i admit and preeminently fitted to be the companion of man for he has an affectionate nature which man demands and a forgiving disposition which man needsbut a dog with all his noble qualities is not to be compared to a doggie  my doggie is unquestionably the most charming and in every way delightful doggie that ever was born  my sister has a baby about which she raves in somewhat similar terms but of course that is ridiculous for her baby differs in no particular from ordinary babies except perhaps in the matter of violent weeping of which it is fond whereas my doggie is unique a perfectly beautiful and singular specimen ofof well i wont say what because my friends usually laugh at me when i say it and i dont like to be laughed at  freely admit that you dont at once perceive the finer qualities either mental or physical of my doggie partly owing to the circumstance that he is shapeless and hairy  the former quality is not prepossessing while the latter tends to veil the amiable expression of his countenance and the lustre of his speaking eyes  but as you come to know him he grows upon you your feelings are touched your affections stirred and your love is finally evoked  as he resembles a doormat or rather a scrap of very ragged doormat and has an amiable spirit i have called him dumps  i should not be surprised if you did not perceive any connection here  you are not the first who has failed to see it i never saw it myself  when i first met dumps he was scurrying towards me along a sequestered country lane  it was in the dog days  dust lay thick on the road the creatures legs were remarkably short though active and his hair being long he swept up the dust in clouds as he ran  he was yelping and i observed that one or two stones appeared to be racing with or after him  the voice of an angry man also seemed to chase him but the owner of the voice was at the moment concealed by a turn in the lane which was bordered by high stonewalls  hydrophobia of course flashed into my mind  i grasped my stick and drew close to the wall  the hairy whirlwind if i may so call it came wildly on but instead of passing me or snapping at my legs as i had expected it stopped and crawled towards me in a piteous supplicating manner that at once disarmed me  if the creature had lain still i should have been unable to distinguish its head from its tail but as one end of him whined and the other wagged i had no difficulty  stooping down with caution i patted the end that whined whereupon the end that wagged became violently demonstrative  just then the owner of the voice came round the corner  he was a big rough fellow in ragged garments and armed with a thick stick which he seemed about to fling at the little dog when i checked him with a shout  youd better not my man unless you want your own head broken  you see i am a pretty wellsized man myself and as i felt confidence in my strength my stick and the goodness of my cause i was bold  what dyou mean by illtreating the little dog  i demanded sternly as i stepped up to the man  a cove may do as he likes with his own maynt he answered the man with a sulky scowl  a cove may do nothing of the sort said i indignantly for cruelty to dumb animals always has the effect of inclining me to fight though i am naturally of a peaceable disposition  there is an act of parliament i continued which goes by the honoured name of martin and if you venture to infringe that act ill have you taken up and prosecuted  while i was speaking i observed a peculiar leer on the mans face which i could not account for  he appeared however to have been affected by my threats for he ceased to scowl and assumed a deferential air as he replied vell sir it do seem raither ard that a cove should be blowed up for kindness  kindness  i exclaimed in surprise  ay kindness sir  that there hanimal loves me it do like a brother an the love is mootooal  veve lived together nowoff an onfor the matter o six months  vell i gits employment in a factory about fifteen miles from here in which no dogs is allowed  in coorse i cant throw up my sitivation sir can i  neither can my doggie give up his master wot hes so fond of so im obleeged to leave im in charge of a friend with stric orders to keep im locked up till im fairly gone  vell off i goes but he manages to escape an runs arter me now wot can a feller do but drive im ome with sticks an stones though it do go to my eart to do it but if he goes to the factory hes sure to be shot or scragged or drownded or somethink so you see sir its out o pure kindness im a peltin of im  confess that i felt somewhat doubtful of the truth of this story but in order to prevent any expression of my face betraying me i stooped and patted the dog while the man spoke  it received my attentions with evident delight  a thought suddenly flashed on me  will you sell your little dog  i asked  vy sir he replied with some hesitation i dont quite like to do that  hes such a pure breed andand hes so fond o me  but have you not told me that you are obliged to part with him  i thought the man looked puzzled for a moment but only for a moment turning to me with a bland smile he said ah sir i thats just where it is  i am obleeged to part with him but i aint obleeged to sell him  if i ony part with im my friend keeps im for me and we may meet again but if i sell im hes gone for ever  dont you see howsever if you wants im wery bad ill do it on one consideration  and that is  that youll be good to im  i began to think i had misjudged the man  whats his name  i asked  again for one moment there was that strange puzzled look in the mans face but it passed and he turned with another of his bland smiles  his name sir  ah his name  he aint got no name sir  no name  i exclaimed in surprise  no sir i object to givin dogs names on principle  its too much like treatin them as if they wos christians and you know they couldnt be christians if they wanted to ever so much  besides wotever name you gives em there must be so many other dogs with the same name that you stand a chance o the wrong dog comin to e ven you calls  thats a strange reason  how then do you call him to you  vy wen i wants im i shouts hi or hallo or i vistles  indeed said i somewhat amused by the humour of the fellow and what do you ask for him  fi pun ten an hes dirt cheap at that was the quick reply  come come my man you know the dog is not worth that  not worth it sir he replied with an injured look i tell you hes cheap at that  look at his breedin and then think of his affectionate natur  is the affections to count for nuffin  admitted that the affections were worth money though it was generally understood that they could not be purchased but still objected to the price until the man said in a confidential tone  vell come sir since you do express such a deal o love for im and promise to be so good to im ill make a sacrifice and let you ave im for three pun tencome  gave in and walked off with my purchase leaping joyfully at my heels  the man chuckled a good deal after receiving the money but i took no notice of that at the time though i thought a good deal about it afterwards  ah little did i think as dumps and i walked home that day of the depth of the attachment that was to spring up between us the varied experiences of life we were destined to have together and the important influence he was to exercise on my career  forgot to mention that my name is mellonjohn mellon  dumps knows my name as well as he knows his own  on reaching home dumps displayed an evidence of good breeding which convinced me that he could not have spent all his puppyhood in company with the man from whom i had bought him  he wiped his feet on the doormat with great vigour before entering my house and also refused to pass in until i led the way  now dumps said i seating myself on the sofa in my solitary room i was a bachelor at the timea medical student just on the point of completing my course come here and let us have a talk  to my surprise the doggie came promptly forward sat down on his hindlegs and looked up into my face  i was touched by this display of ready confidence  a confiding nature has always been to me powerfully attractive whether in child cat or dog  i brushed the shaggy hair from his face in order to see his eyes  they were moist and intensely black  so was the point of his nose  you seem to be an affectionate doggie dumps  a portion of hairscarce worthy the name of tailwagged as i spoke and he attempted to lick my fingers but i prevented this by patting his head  i have an unconquerable aversion to licking  perhaps having received more than an average allowance in another sense at school may account for my dislike to iteven from a dog  now dumps i continued you and i are to be good friends  ive bought youfor a pretty large sum too let me tell youfrom a man who i am quite sure treated you ill and i intend to show you what good treatment is but there are two things i mean to insist on and it is well that we should understand each other at the outset of our united career  you must never bark at my friendsnot even at my enemieswhen they come to see me and you must not beg at meals  dyou understand  the way in which that shaggy creature cocked its ears and turned its head from side to side slowly and gazed with its lustrous eyes while i was speaking went far to convince me it really did understand what i said  of course it only wagged its rear tuft of hair in reply and whimpered slightly  refer to its rear tuft advisedly because at a short distance my doggie when in repose resembled an elongated and shapeless mass but when roused by a call or otherwise three tufts of hair instantly sprang uptwo at one end and one at the other endindicating his ears and tail  it was only by these signs that i could ascertain at any time his exact position  i was about to continue my remarks to dumps when the door opened and my landlady appeared bearing the dinner tray  oh  i beg parding sir she said drawing back i didnt ear your voice sir till the door was open an i thought you was alone but i can come back a  come in mrs miff  there is nobody here but my little dogone that i have just bought a rather shaggy terrierwhat do you think of him  do e bite sir inquired mrs miff in some anxiety as she passed round the table at a respectful distance from dumps  i think not  he seems an amiable creature said i patting his head do you ever bite dumps  well sir i never feel quite easy rejoined mrs miff in a doubtful tone as she laid my cloth with as it were one eye ever on the alert you never knows wen these airy creatures is goin to fly at you  if you could see their heyes you might ave a guess what they was a thinkin of an then it is so orkard not knowin wich end of the airy bundle is the bitin end you cant help bein nervish a little  having finished laying the cloth mrs miff backed out of the room after the manner of attendants on royalty overturning two chairs with her skirts as she went and showing her full front to the enemy  but the enemy gave no sign good or bad  all the tufts were down flat and he stood motionless while mrs miff retreated  dumps what do you think of mrs miff  the doggie ran to me at once and we engaged in a little further conversation until my landlady returned with the viands  to my surprise dumps at once walked sedately to the hearthrug and lay down thereon with his chin on his pawsat least i judged so from the attitude for i could see neither chin nor paws  this act i regarded as another evidence of good breeding  he was not a beggar and therefore could not have spent his childhood with the man from whom i had bought him  i wish you could speak dumps said i laying down my knife and fork when about half finished and looking towards the hearthrug  one end of him rose a little the other end wagged gently but as i made no further remark both ends subsided  now dumps said i finishing my meal with a draught of water which is my favourite beverage you must not suppose that you have got a greedy master though i dont allow begging  there sir is your corner where you shall always have the remnants of my dinnercome  the dog did not move until i said come  then with a quick rush he made for the plate and very soon cleared it  well you have been well trained said i regarding him with interest such conduct is neither the result of instinct nor accident and sure am i the more i think of it that the sulky fellow who sold you to me was not your tutor but as you cant speak i shall never find out your history so dumps ill dismiss the subject  saying this i sat down to the newspaper with which i invariably solaced myself for half an hour after dinner before going out on my afternoon rounds  this was the manner in which my doggie and i began our acquaintance and i have been thus particular in recounting the details because they bear in a special manner on some of the most important events of my life  being as already mentioned a medical student and having almost completed my course of study i had undertaken to visit in one of the poorest districts in londonin the neighbourhood of whitechapel partly for the purpose of gaining experience in my profession and partly for the sake of carrying the word of lifethe knowledge of the saviour into some of the many homes where moral as well as physical disease is rife  leanings and inclinations are inherited not less than bodily peculiarities  my father had a particular tenderness for poor old women of the lowest class  so have i  when i see a bowed aged wrinkled whitehaired feeble woman in rags and dirt a gush of tender pity almost irresistibly inclines me to go and pat her head sit down beside her comfort her and give her money  it matters not what her antecedents may have been  worthy or unworthy there she stands now with age helplessness and a hopeless temporal future pleading more eloquently in her behalf than could the tongue of man or angel  true the same plea is equally applicable to poor old men but reader i write not at present of principles so much as of feelings  my weakness is old women  accordingly on my professional visiting listi had at that time a considerable number of these  one of them who was uncommonly small unusually miserable and pathetically feeble lay heavy on my spirit just then  she had a remarkably bad cold at the time which betrayed itself chiefly in a frequent but feeble sneeze  as i rose to go out and looked at my doggiewho was or seemed to be asleep on the ruga sudden thought occurred to me  that poor old creature i muttered is very lonely in her garret a little dog might comfort her  perhapsbut no  dumps you are too lively for her too bouncing  she would require something feeble and affectionate like herself  come ill think of that  so my doggie you shall keep watch here until i return    chapter two  introduces a young hero  the day had become very sultry by the time i went out to visit my patients  the sky was overcast with dark thunderous clouds and as there seemed every chance of a heavy shower i returned to my lodgings for an umbrella  oh mr mellon exclaimed my landlady as i entered the lobby was there ever a greater blessinoh  why whats the matter mrs miff  oh sir that orrid little dog as you brought as gone mad  is that the blessing you refer to mrs miff  no sir but your comin back is for the creetur as bin rampagin round the room an yellin like a thing possessed by demons  im so glad youve come  feeling sure that the little dog unaccustomed perhaps to be left alone in a strange place was merely anxious to be free i at once went to my roomdoor and opened it  dumps bounced out and danced joyfully round me  mrs miff fled in deadly silence to her own bedroom where she locked and bolted herself in  dumps said i with a laugh i shall have to take you with me at the risk of losing you  perhaps the memory of the feed ive given you and the hope of another may keep you by me  come we shall see  my doggie behaved much better than i had anticipated  he did indeed stop at several butchers shops during our walk and looked inquiringly in  he also evinced a desire to enter into conversation with one or two other sociable dogs but the briefest chirp or whistle brought him at once obediently to my heel just as if he had known and obeyed me all his life  when we reached the poorer parts of the city i observed that the freeandeasy swagger and the jaunty hopping of each hindleg alternately gave place to a sedate walk and a wary turn of the head which suggested keen suspicious glances of the unseen eyes  ah thought i evidently he has suffered hardships and bad treatment in places like this  i stooped and patted his head  he drew closer to me as if seeking protection  just then a low grumbling of thunder was heard and soon after the rain came down so heavily that the umbrella forming an insufficient protection dumps and i sought shelter in the mouth of an alley  the plump was shortlived and the little knots of people who had sought shelter along with us melted quickly away  my doggies aspect was not improved by this shower  it had caused his hairy coat to cling to his form producing a drownedrat aspect which was not becoming but a short run and some vigorous shakes soon restored his rotundity  in a few minutes thereafter we reached a narrow square or court at the end of a very dirty locality in one corner of which was a low publichouse  through the halfopen swingdoor could be seen the usual melancholy crowd of unhappy creatures who had either already come under the full influence and curse of strong drink or were far on the road to ruin  it was a sight with which i had become so familiar that sad though it was i scarce gave it a thought in passing  my mind was occupied with the poor old woman i was about to visit and i would have taken no further notice of the grogshop in question if the door had not opened violently and a dirty ragged streetboy or waif apparently about eight or nine years of age rushed out with a wild cry that may be described as a compound cheerandyell  he came out in such blind haste that he ran his ragged head with great violence against my side and almost overturned me  hallo youngster  i exclaimed sternly  hallo oldster he replied in a tone of the most insolent indignation wot ever do you mean by runnin agin my ead like that haint you got no genteel boys in the westend to butt agin that you come all the way to vitechapel to butt agin me  ive a good mind to and you over to the pleece  come you owes me a copper for that  the ineffable insolence of this waif took me quite by surprise  he spoke with extreme volubility and assumed the commanding air of a man of sixfeetfour though only a boy of fourfeetsix  i observed however that he kept at a sufficient distance to make sure of escaping in the event of my trying to seize him  come said i with a smile i think you rather owe me a copper for giving me such a punch in the ribs  vell i dont mind lookin at it in that light he replied returning my smile  i vill give you a copper ony i haint got change  you wouldnt mind comin into this ere grogshop while i git change would you  or if youll lend me a sixpence ill go in and git it for you  no said i putting my fingers into my waistcoat pocket but here is a sixpence for you which you may keep and never mind the change if youll walk along the streets with me a bit  the urchin held out his dirty hand and i put the coin into it  he smiled tossed the sixpence caught it deftly and transferred it to his right trousers pocket  vell you are a rum un  but i say all square  no dodges  honour bright  no dodges  honour bright i replied  come along  at this point my attention was attracted by a sudden change in the behaviour of dumps  he went cautiously towards the boy and snuffed as him for a moment  i say is he wicious he asked backing a little  i think not but  i was checked in my speech by the little dog uttering a whine of delight and suddenly dancing round the boy wagging its tail violently and indeed wriggling its whole shapeless body with joy as some dogs are wont to do when they meet with an old friend unexpectedly  why he seems to know you said i in surprise  vell he do seem to ave ad the honour of my acquaintance someow returned the boy whose tone of banter quickly passed away  what dee call im  dumps said i  that wont do  has he a vite spot on the bridge of is nose asked the boy earnestly  i really cannot tell  it is not long  here punch come here called the boy interrupting  at the name of punch my doggie became so demonstrative in his affections that he all but leaped into the boys arms whined lovingly and licked his dirty face all over  the wery dog said the boy after looking at his nose only growed so big that his own mother wouldnt know imvy where ave you bin all this long while punch  dyou mean to say that you know the dog and that his name is punch  vell you are green  wouldnt any cove with half an eye see that the dog knows me an so in course i must know him  an ven i called im punch didnt he answerhey  i was obliged to admit the truth of these remarks  after the first ebullition of joy at the meeting was over we went along the street together  then the dog is yours said i as we went along  no he aint mine  he was mine onceven he was a pup but i sold im to a young lady fora wery small sum  for how much  i asked  for five bob  yesony five bob  i axed vun pound but the young lady was so pleasant an pritty that i come down to ten bob  then she said she was poorand to tell ee the plain truth she looked like it an she wanted the pup so bad that i come down to five  and who was this young lady  blowd if i knows  she went off wi my punch an i never sawd em more  then you dont know what induced her to sell punch to a low fellowbut of course you know nothing about that said i in a musing tone as i thought of the strange manner in which this portion of my doggies history had come to light but i was recalled from my reverie by the contemptuous tones of my little companions voice as he said  but i do know something about that  oh indeed  i thought you said you never saw the young lady again  no more i did  neither did i ever see punch again till today but i know for certain that my young lady never sold no dog wotsomedever to no low feller as ever walked in shoe leather or out of it  ah i see said i slowly you mean  yes out with it thats just wot i do meanthat the low feller prigged the pup from her an i ony vish as i ad a grip of his ugly nose and id draw it out from his uglier face i would like the small end of a telescope and then shut it up flat againso flat that youd never know hed had no nose at all  my little sharpwitted companion then willingly gave me an account of all he knew about the early history of my doggie  the story was not long but it began so to speak at the beginning  punch or dumps as i continued to call him had been born in a dry waterbutt which stood in a back yard near the thames  this yard was or had been used for putting away lumber  it was a queer place said my little companion looking up in my face with a droll expressiona sort o place that when once you had gone into it you was sure to wish you hadnt  talk o the blues sir i do assure you that wen i used to go into that yard of a night it gave me the blackanblues it did  there was a mouldiness an a soppiness about it that beat the katticombs all to sticks  it looked like a place that some rubbish had bin flung into in the days before adam an eve was born an ad been forgotten teetotally from that time to this  oh it was awful  used to make my marrow screw up into lumps wen i was used to go there  but why did you go there at all if you disliked it so much  i asked  vy because i adnt got no better place to go to  i was used to sleep there  i slep in the selfsame waterbutt where punch was born thats ow i come to scrape acquaintance with im  id bin away from ome in the country for a weeks slidin  a weeks what  slidin  dont you know what sliding on the ice is  ohyes  are you very fund of that  i should think i waswen my boots are good enough to stick on but they aint always that and then ive got to slide under difficulties sometimes im out o boots an shoes altogether in vich case slidins impossible but i can look on and slide in spirit vich is better than nuffin  but as i was sayin wen you ad the bad manners to interrupt me i ad bin away from ome for a week  excuse my interrupting you again but where is your home may i ask  you may ask but it ud puzzle me to answer for i aint got no ome unless i may say that london is my ome  i come an go where i pleases so longs i dont worrit nobody  i sleep where i like if the bobbies dont get their eyes on me wen im agoin to bed an i heat wotever comes in my way if it aint too tough  in winter i sleeps in a lodgin ouse wen i can but as it costs thrippence a night i finds it too expensive an usually prefers a railway arch or a corner in covent garden market under a cart or a barrow or inside of a empty sugarbarrelanywhere so longs im let alone but what with the rain the wind the cold and the bobbies i may be said to sleep under difficulties  vell as i was agoin to say wen  excuse me once morewhat is your name said i  haint got no name  no name  come you are joking  what is your fathers name  haint got no fathernever ad as i knows on nor mother neither nor brother nor sister nor aunt nor wifenot even a motherinlaw  im a unit in creation i isas i once heerd a schoolboard buffer say wen he was luggin me along to school but he was too green that buffer was for a schoolboarder  i gave im the slip at the corner of watling street an theyve never bin able to cotch me since  but you must be known by some name said i  what do your companions call you  they call me bad names as a rule  some o the least offensive among em are monkeyface screwnose cheeks squeaker roundeyes and slidder  i prefers the last myself an ginerally answers to it  but as i was agoin to say id bin away for a veek an wen i comed ome  to which part of home for london is a wide word you know i said  now sir if you go for to interrupt me like that ill ave to charge a bob for this here valk i couldnt stand it for sixpence  come slidder dont be greedy  vell sir if you got as many kicks as i do and as few hapence praps youd be greedy too  perhaps i should my boy said i in a gentle tone  but come i will give you an extra sixpence if we get along well  lets have the rest of your story i wont interrupt again  it aint my story its punchs story returned the waif as he stooped to pat the gratified doggie  vell wen i comd ome it was lateish and i was tired besides bein ungry so i goes right off to my waterbutt intendin to go to bed as usual but no sooner did i put my head in than out came a most awful growl  the butt lay on its side and i backed out double quick just in time for a most orriblelookin terrier dog rushed at me  bein used to dogs i wasnt took by surprise but fetched it a clip with one o my feet in its ribs that sent it staggerin to the palin o the yard  it found a hole bolted through scurried up the lane yellin and i never sawd it more  this was punchs mother  on goin into the butt afterwards i found three dead pups and one alive so i pitched the dead ones away an shoved the live one into the breast of my coat where he slep till mornin  at first i ad a mind to drown the pup but it looked so comfortable an playful an was such a queer critter that i called him punch an became a father to im  i got him bones an other bits o grub an kep im in the waterbutt for three veeks  then he began to make a noise ven i left him so bein sure the bobbies would rout im out at last i took im an sold im to the first pleasant lady that seemed to fancy im  well slidder said i as we turned down into the meanlooking alley where mrs willis my little old woman dwelt i am greatly interested in what you have told me about my little dog and i am interested still more in what you have told me about yourself  now i want you to do me a favour  i wish you to go with me to visit an old woman and after that to walk home with mepart of the way at least  the boy whose pinched hungersmitten face had an expression of almost supernatural intelligence on it bestowed on me a quick earnest glance  no dodges  honour bright  you aint a schoolboard buffer he asked  no dodges  honour bright i replied with a smile  vell then heave ahead an ill foller  we passed quickly down to the lower end of the alley which seemed to lose itself in a wretched court that appeared as if it intended to slip into the riveran intention which if carried out would have vastly improved its sanitary condition  here in a somewhat dark corner of the court i entered an open door ascended a flight of stairs and gained a second landing  at the farthest extremity of the passage i stopped at a door and knocked  several of the other doors of the passage opened and various heads were thrust out while inquisitive eyes surveyed me and my companion  a short survey seemed to suffice for the doors were soon shut one after another with a bang but the door at which i knocked did not open  lifting the latch i entered and observed that mrs willis was seated by the window looking wistfully out  being rather deaf she had not heard my knock  come in i whispered to little slidder sit down on this stool near the door and keep quiet until i speak to you  so saying i advanced to the window  the view was not interesting  it consisted of the side of a house about three feet distant down which ran a waterspout or drainpipe which slightly relieved the dead look of the bricks  from one pane of the window it was possible by squeezing your cheek against it to obtain a perspective view of chimneypots  by a stretch of the neck upwards you could see more chimney pots  by a stretch of imagination you could see cats quarrelling around themor anything else you pleased  sitting down on a rickety chair beside the little old woman i touched her gently on the shoulder  she had come to know my touch by that time i think for she looked round with a bright little smile    chapter three  treats of an old heroine  it was pleasant yet sad to observe the smile with which old mrs willis greeted mepleasant because it proved that she was rejoiced to see me sad because it was not quite in keeping with the careworn old face whose set wrinkles it deranged  i knew you would come  you never miss the day she said both words and tone showing that she had fallen from a much higher position in the social scale  it costs me little to visit you once a week dear mrs willis i replied and it gives me great pleasure besides i am bound by the laws of the society which grants your annuity to call personally and pay it  i only wish it were a larger sum  large enough more than i deserve said the old woman in a low tone as she gazed somewhat vacantly at the dead wall opposite and let her eyes slowly descend the spout  the view was not calculated to distract or dissipate the mind  the bricks were so much alike that the eye naturally sought and reposed on or followed the salient feature  having descended the spout as far as the windowsill permitted the eyes of mrs willis slowly reascended as far as possible and then turned with a meek expression to my face more than i deserve she repeated and almost as much as i require it is very kind of the society to give it and of you to bring it  may god bless you both  ah doctor  im often puzzled byeh  whats that  the sudden question anxiously asked was accompanied by a feeble attempt to gather her poor garments close round her feet as dumps sniffed at her skirts and agitated his ridiculous tail  its only my dog grannyi had of late adopted this term of endearment a very quiet wellbehaved creature i assure you that seems too amiable to bite  why he appears to have a tendency to claim acquaintance with everybody  i do believe he knows you  no no he doesnt  put him out pray put him out said the old woman in alarm  grieved that i had unintentionally roused her fear i opened the door and called dumps  my doggie rose with his three indicators erect and expectant  go out sir and lie down  the indicators slowly drooped and dumps crawled past in abject humility  shutting the door i returned  i hope you dont dislike little boys as well as little dogs granny because i have brought one to wait for me here  you wont mind his sitting at the door until i go  no no said mrs willis quickly i like little boyswhenwhen theyre good she added after a pause  say im one o the good sort sir suggested slidder in a hoarse whisper  of course it aint true but wot o that if it relieves her mind  taking no notice of this remark i again sat down beside my old woman  what were you going to say about being puzzled granny  puzzled doctor did i say i was puzzled  yes but pray dont call me doctor  im not quite fledged yet you know  call me mellon or john  well you were saying  oh i remember  i was only going to say that ive been puzzled a good deal of late by that text in which david says i have never seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread  now my father and mother were both good christians and although i cannot claim to be a good one myself i do claim to be a poor follower of jesus  yet here am i  she paused  well granny said i are you forsaken  nay john god forbid that i should say so but am i not a beggar  ah pride pride you are hard to kill  are you a beggar  i asked in a tone of surprise  when did you beg last granny  is not a recipient of charity a beggar  no i replied stoutly he is not  a solicitor of charity is a beggar but a recipient thereof is not  in your case it was i who was the beggar  do you not remember when i found you first without a crust in the house how i had to beg and entreat you to allow me to put your name on this charity and how you persistently refused until at last i did it without your consent and how eventually you gave in only when i charged you with pride  you are not forsaken granny and you are not a beggar  brayvo doctor you have er there came in a soft whisper from the door  for a moment i felt tempted to turn the boy out as i had turned out the dog but seeing that my old woman had not overheard the remark i took no notice of it  you have put the matter in a new light john said mrs willis slowly as her eyes once more sought the spout  you often put things in new lights and there does seem some truth in what you say  it did hurt my pride at first but im gettin used to it now  besides continued the old lady with a deep sigh that trouble and everything else is swallowed up in the great sorrow of my life  ah you refer to your granddaughter i suppose said i in a tone of profound sympathy  you have never told me about her dear granny  if it is not too painful a subject to speak of i should like to hear about her  when did she die  die exclaimed mrs willis with a burst of energy that surprised meshe did not die  she left me many many months ago it seems like years now  my edie went out one afternoon to walk like a beautiful sunbeam as she always was andandshe never came back  never came back  i echoed in surprise  nonever  i was not able to walk then any more than now else i would have ranged london all round day and night for my darling  as it was a kind city missionary made inquiries at all the policeoffices and everywhere else he could think of but no clew could be gained as to what had become of her  at last he got wearied out and gave it up  no wonder he had never seen edie and could not love her as i did  once he thought he had discovered her  the body of a poor girl had been found in the river which he thought answered to her description  i thought so too when he told me what she was like and at once concluded she had tumbled in by accident and been drownedfor you see my edie was good and pure and true  she could not have committed suicide unless her mind had become deranged and there was nothing that i knew of to bring about that  they got me with much trouble into a cab and drove me to the place  ah the poor thingshe was fair and sweet to look upon with her curling brown hair and a smile still on the parted lips as if she had welcomed death but she was not my edie  for months and months after that i waited and waited feeling sure that she would come then i was forced to leave my lodging  the landlord wanted it himself i begged that he would let me remain but he would not  he was a hardhearted dissipated man  i took another lodging but it was a long way off and left my name and new address at the old one  my heart sank after that andand ive no hope nowno hope  my darling must have met with an accident in this terrible city  she must have been killed and will never come back to me  the poor creature uttered a low wail and put a handkerchief to her old eyes  but bless the lord she added in a more cheerful tone i will go to hersoon  for some minutes i knew not what to say in reply by way of comforting my poor old friend  the case seemed indeed so hopeless  i could only press her hand  but my nature is naturally buoyant and ready to hope against hope even when distress assails myself  do not say there is no hope granny said i at last making an effort to be cheerful  you know that with god all things are possible  it may be that this missionary did not go the right way to work in his search however good his intentions might have been  i confess i cannot imagine how it is possible that any girl should disappear in this way unless she had deliberately gone off with some one  no john my edie would not have left me thus of her own free will said the old woman with a look of assurance which showed that her mind was immovably fixed as to that point  well then i continued loving you as you say she did and being incapable of leaving you deliberately and without a word of explanation it follows thatthat  i stopped for at this point no plausible reason for the girls disappearance suggested itself  it follows that she must have been killed said the old woman in a low broken tone  no granny i will not admit thatcome cheer up i will do my best to make inquiries about her and as i have had considerable experience in making investigations among the poor of london perhaps i may fall on some clew  she would be sure to have made inquiries would she not at your old lodging if she had felt disposed to return  felt disposed repeated mrs willis with a strange laugh  if she could return you mean  wellif she could said i  no doubt she would but soon after i left my old lodging the landlord fled the country and other people came to the house who were troubled by my sending so often to inquire  then my money was all expended and i had to quit my second lodging and came here which is far far from the old lodging and now i have no one to send  have you any friends in london  i asked  no  we had come from york to try to find teaching for my darling for we could get none in our native town and we had not been long enough in london to make new friends whenwhenshe went away  my dear ann and willie her mother and father died last year and now we have no near relations in the world  shall i read to you granny said i feeling that no words of mine could do much to comfort one in so sad a case  she readily assented  i was in the habit of reading and praying with her during these visits  i turned without any definite intention of doing so to the words come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest  i cannot tell why but i paused here instead of reading on or commenting on the words  the old woman looked earnestly at me  these words she said have been in my mind all yesterday and the day before  i have been greatly comforted by them because he is faithful who has promised  pray over them john dont read any more  i knelt by the poor womans chair she could not kneel with me in body though she did in spirit i doubt not  i had quite forgotten slidder but on rising observed that he had followed my example and gone down on his knees  were you praying with us slidder  i asked after we left mrs willis and were walking up the alley followed by dumps  dun know sir ive never heard nor seen nuffin o this sort before in coorse ive heard the missionaries sometimes ahollerin about the streets but i never worrited myself about them  i say doctor thats a rum go about that gal edieaint it  ive quite took a fancy to that gal now though i aint seen her  dye think shes bin drownded  i scarce know what to think  her disappearance so suddenly does seem very strange  i fear i fear much thathowever its of no use guessing  i shall at once set about making inquiries  ha so shall i said the little waif with a look of determination on his small face that amused me greatly for shes a good gal is edieif she aint drownded  why boy how can you know whether the girl is good or bad  how can i know he echoed with a glance of almost superhuman wisdom in coorse i know by the powers of obserwation  that old gal mrs willis is a good old thingas good as gold  vell a good mother is always cocksure to ave a good darterspecially ven shes a only darterso the mother o edie bein good edie herself must be good dont you see  anythink as belonged to mrs willis cant help bein good  im glad you took me to see her doctor for ive made up my mind to take that old ooman up as the bobbies say wen theyre wexed with avin nuffin to do xcept strut about the streets like turkeycocks ill take er up and do for er i will  on questioning him further i found that this ragged and homeless little waif had indeed been touched by mrs williss sad story and drawn towards her by her soft gentle natureso different from what he had hitherto met with in his wanderingsand that he was resolved to offer her his gratuitous services as a messageboy and general servant without requiring either food or lodging in return  but mrs willis may object to such a dirty ragged fellow coming about her said i  aint there no pumps in london stoopid said slidder with a look of pity no soap  true i replied with a laugh but youd require needles and thread and cloth in addition to make yourself respectable  nothink of the sort i can beg or borrer or steal coats and pants you know  ah slidder said i in a kind but serious tone doubtless you can but begging or borrowing are not likely to succeed and stealing is wrong  dyou think so returned the boy with a look of innocent surprise dont you think now that in a good cause a cove might    take wot isnt hisn   an risk his bein sent to prisn  i replied emphatically that i did not think so that wrong could never be made right by any means and that the commencement of a course of even disinterested kindness on such principles would be sure to end ill  vell then ill reconsider my decision as the maginstrates ought to say but never do  thats right  and now we must part slidder i said stopping  here is the second sixpence i promised you also my card and address  will you come and see me at my own house the day after tomorrow at eight in the morning  i will replied the boy with decision but i say all fair an aboveboard  no schoolboardin nor nuffin o that sorthey honour bright  honour bright  i replied holding out my hand which he grasped and shook quite heartily  we had both taken two or three steps in opposite directions when as if under the same impulse we looked back at each other and in so doing became aware of the fact that dumps stood between us on the pavement in a state of extreme indecision or mental confusion  hallo  i say weve bin an forgot punch exclaimed the boy  dumps said i come along  punch said he come here good dog  my doggie looked first at one then at the other  the two indicators in front rose and fell while the one behind wagged and drooped in a state of obvious uncertainty  wont you sell im back said slidder returning  ill work it out in messages or anythink else  but what of the bobbies  i asked  ah true i forgot the bobbies  id ony be able to keep im for a week praps not so long afore theyd nab himgo punch go you dont know ven youre vell off  the tone in which this was uttered settled the point and turned the wavering balance of the creatures affections in my favour  with all the indicators extremely pendulous and its hairy coat hanging in a species of limp humility my doggie followed me home but i observed that as we went along he ever and anon turned a wistful glance in the direction in which the ragged waif had disappeared    chapter four  in which dumps finds another old friend  one morning a considerable time after the events narrated in the last chapter i sat on the sofa waiting for breakfast and engaged in an interesting conversation with dumps  the only difference in our mode of communication was that dumps talked with his eyes i with my tongue  from what i have already said about my doggie it will be understood that his eyeswhich were brown and speaking eyeslay behind such a forest of hair that it was only by clearing the dense masses away that i could obtain a full view of his liquid orbs  i am not sure that his ears were much less expressive than his eyes  their variety of motion coupled with their rate of action served greatly to develop the full meaning of what his eyes said  mrs miff seems to have forgotten us this morning dumps i remarked pulling out my watch  one ear cocked forward the other turned back towards the door and a white gleam under the hair indicating that the eyes turned in the same direction said as plainly as there was any occasion for  no not quite forgotten us  i hear her coming now  ha so she is  now you shall have a feed  both ears elevated to the full extent obviously meant hurrah while a certain motion of his body appeared to imply that in consequence of his sedentary position he was vainly attempting to wag the sofa  if you please sir said my landlady laying the breakfast tray on the table theres a shoeblack in the kitchen says he wants to see you  ah young slidder i fancy  well send him up  he says hes ad his breakfast an will wait till you have done sir  very considerate  send him up nevertheless  in a few minutes my protege stood before me hat in hand looking in the trim costume of the brigade quite a different being from the ragged creature i had met with in whitechapel  dumps instantly assaulted him with loving demonstrations  how spruce you look my boy  thanks to you sir replied slidder with a familiar nod they do say im lookin up  i hope you like the work  have you had breakfast  would a roll do you any good  thankee im primed for the day  i came over sir to say that granny seems to me to be out o sorts  since ive been allowed to sleep on the rug inside her door ive noticed that she aint so lively as she used to was  shivers a deal wen it aint cold groans now an then an whimpers a good deal  it strikes me nowthough i aint a reglar sawbonesthat theres suthin wrong with her inards  ill finish breakfast quickly and go over with you to see her said i  dont need to urry sir returned slidder she aint wery badnot much wuss than ornaryony ive bin too anxious about herpoor old thing  ill vait below till youre readycome along punch an jine yer old pal in the kitchen till the noo uns ready  after breakfast we three hurried out and wended our way eastward  as the morning was unusually fine i diverged towards one of the more fashionable localities to deliver a note with which i had been charged young slidders spirits were high and for a considerable time he entertained me with a good deal of the eastend gossip  among other things he told me of the great work that was being done there by dr barnardo and others of similar spirit in rescuing waifs like himself from their wretched condition  though some on us dont think it so wretched arter all he continued theres the slogger now he wont go into the ome on no consideration says he wouldnt give a empty sugarbarrel for all the omes in london  but then the sloggers a lazy muff  he dont want to workthats about it  hed sooner starve than work  by consikence he steals more or less an finds a ome in the stone jug pretty frequent  as to his taste for a sugarbarrel i aint so sure that i dont agree with im  its big you knowplenty of room to move wich it aint so with a flourbarrel  an then the smell  oh youve no notion  wy thats wuth the price of a nights lodgin itself to say nothin o the chance of a knothole or a crack full o sugar that the former tenants has failed to diskiver  while the waif was commenting thus enthusiastically on the bliss of lodging in a sugarbarrel we were surprised to see dumps who chanced to be trotting on in front come to a sudden pause and gaze at a lady who was in the act of ringing the doorbell of an adjoining house  the door was opened by a footman and the lady was in the act of entering when dumps gave vent to a series of sounds made up of a whine a bark and a yelp  at the same moment his tail all but twirled him off his legs as he rushed wildly up the stairs and began to dance round the lady in mad excitement  the lady backed against the door in alarm  the footman anxious apparently about his calves seized an umbrella and made a wild assault on the dog and i was confusedly conscious of slidder exclaiming why if that aint my young lady as i sprang up the steps to the rescue  down dumps you rascal down  i exclaimed seizing him by the brass collar with which i had invested himpardon the rudeness of my dog madam i said looking up i never saw him act in this way before  it is quite unaccountable  not quite so unaccountable as you think interrupted slidder who stood looking calmly on with his hands in his pockets and a grin on his faceits your own dog miss  what do you mean boy said the lady a gaze of surprise chasing away the look of alarm which had covered her pretty face  i mean xactly what i says miss  the dogs your own i sold it to you long ago for five bob  the girlfor she was little more than sixteenturned with a startled doubting look to the dog  if you dont blieve it miss look at the vite spot on the bridge of is nose said slidder with a selfsatisfied nod to the lady and a supremely insolent wink to the footman  pompey exclaimed the girl holding out a pair of the prettiest little gloved hands imaginable  my doggie broke from my grasp with a shriek of joy and sprang into her arms  she buried her face in his shaggy neck and absolutely hugged him  i stood aghast  the footman smiled in an imbecile manner  youd better not squeeze quite so hard miss or hell bust remarked the waif  recovering herself and dropping the dog somewhat hurriedly she turned to me with a flushed face and said  excuse me sir this unexpected meeting with my dog  your dog  i involuntarily exclaimed while a sense of unmerited loss began to creep over me  well the dog was mine once at all eventsthough i doubt not it is rightfully yours now said the young lady with a smile that at once disarmed me  it was stolen from me a few months after i had bought it from this boy who seems strangely altered since then  im glad however to see that the short time i had the dog was sufficient to prevent its forgetting me  but perhaps she added in a sad tone it would have been better if it had forgotten me  my mind was made up  no madam said i with decision it is well that the dog has not forgotten you  i would have been surprised indeed if it had  it is yours  i could not think of robbing you of it  iiam going to visit a sick woman and cannot delay forgive me if i ask permission to leave the dog with you until i return in the afternoon to hand it formally over and bid it farewell  this was said half in jest yet i felt very much in earnest for the thought of parting from my doggie even to such a fair mistress cost me no small amount of painmuch to my surprise for i had not imagined it possible that i could have formed so strong an attachment to a dumb animal in so short a time  but you see being a bachelor of an unsocial spirit my doggie and i had been thrown much together in the evenings and had made the most of our time  the young lady half laughed and hesitatingly thanked me as she went into the house followed by dumps alias punch alias pompey who never so much as cast one parting glance on me as i turned to leave  a shout caused me to turn again and look back  i beheld an infant rolling down the drawingroom stairs like a small alpine boulder  a little girl was vainly attempting to arrest the infant and three boys of various sizes came bounding towards the young lady with shouts of welcome  in the midst of the din my doggie uttered a cry of pain the babel of childrens voices was hushed by a bass growl and the street door closed with a bang  yell that is a rum go exclaimed my little companion as we walked slowly away  dont it seem to you now as if it wor all a dream  it does indeed i replied half inclined to laugh yet with a feeling of sadness at my heart for i knew that my doggie and i were parted for ever  even if the young lady should insist on my keeping the dog i felt that i could not agree to do so  no  i had committed myself and the thing was done for it was clear that with the mutual affection existing between the lady and the dog they would not willingly consent to be partedit would be cruelty even to suggest a separation  pshaw thought i why should the loss of a miserable doga mere mass of shapeless hairaffect me so much  pooh  i will brush the subject away  so i brushed it away but back it came again in spite of all my brushing and insisted on remaining to trouble me  short though our friendship had been it had i found become very warm and strong  i recalled a good many pleasant evenings when seated alone in my room with a favourite author i had read and tickled dumps under the chin and behind the ears to such an extent that i had thoroughly gained his heart and as love begets love i had been drawn insensibly yet powerfully towards him  in short dumps and i understood each other  while i was meditating on these things my companion who had walked along in silence suddenly said  you neednt take on so sir about punch  how dyou know im taking on so  cause you look so awful solemncholy  an theres no occasion to do so  you can get the critter back again  i fear not slidder for i have already given it to the young lady and you have seen how fond she is of it and the dog evidently likes her better than it likes me  yell i aint surprised at that  it ony proves it to be a dog of good taste but you can get it back for all that  how so  i asked much amused by the decision and selfsufficiency of the boys manner  vy youve ony got to go and marry the young lady wen of course all her property becomes yours punch included dont you see  true slidder it had not occurred to me in that light said i laughing heartily as much at the cool and quiet insolence of the waifs manner as at his suggestion  but then you see there are difficulties in the way  young ladies who dwell in fine mansions are not fond of marrying penniless doctors  pooh replied the urchin that as nuffin to do with it  youve ony got to set up in a ouse close alongside with a big gold mortar over the door an a oneoss broom an youll ave er in six months or eight if shes got contrairy parents  then youll want a tiger of course to old the oss an i knows a smart young feller whose name begins with a s as would just suit  so you see youve nothing to do but to go in an win  the precocious waif looked up in my face with such an expression of satisfaction as he finished this audacious speech that i could not help gazing at him in blank amazement  what i should have replied i know not for we arrived just then at the abode of old mrs willis  the poor old lady was suffering from a severe attack of influenza which coupled with age and the depression caused by her heavy sorrow had reduced her physical powers in an alarming degree  it was obvious that she urgently required good food and careful nursing  i never before felt so keenly my lack of money  my means barely sufficed to keep myself educational expenses being heavy  i was a shy man too and had never made friendsat least among the richto whom i could apply on occasions like this  dear granny i said you would get along nicely if you would consent to go to a hospital  never said the old lady in a tone of decision that surprised me  i assure you granny that you would be much better cared for and fed there than you can be here and it would not be necessary to give up your room  i would look after it until you are better  still the old lady shook her head which was shaking badly enough from age as it was  going to the corner cupboard in which mrs willis kept her little store of food and physic i stood there pondering what i should do  please sir said slidder sidling up to me if you wants muttonchops or steaks or port wine or anythink o that sort just say the word and ill get em  you boyhow  vy aint the shops full of em  id go an help myself spite of all the bobbies that valks in blue  oh slidder said i really grieved for i saw by his earnest face that he meant it would you go and steal after all i have said to you about that sin  vell sir i wouldnt prig for myselfindeed i wouldntbut id do it to make the old ooman better  that would not change stealing into a virtue  no my boy we must try to hit on some other way of providing for her wants  the lord will provide said mrs willis from the bed  she had overheard us  i hastened to her side  yes granny he will provide  meanwhile he has given me enough money to spare a little for your immediate wants  i will send some things which your kind neighbour mrs jones will cook for you  ill give her directions as i pass her door  slidder will go home with me and fetch you the medicines you require  now try to sleep till mrs jones comes with the food  you must not speak to me  it will make you worse  i only want to ask john have you anyany news about  no not yet granny but dont be cast down  if you can trust god for food surely you can trust him for protection not only to yourself but to edie  remember the words commit thy way unto the lord and he will bring it to pass  thank you john replied the old woman as she sank back on her pillow with a little sigh  after leaving mrs willis i was detained so long with some of my patients that it was late before i could turn my steps westward  the night was very cold with a keen december wind blowing and heavy black clouds driving across the dark sky  it was after midnight as i drew near the neighbourhood of the house in which i had left dumps so hurriedly that morning  in my haste i had neglected to ask the name of the young lady with whom i had left him or to note the number of the house but i recollected its position and resolved to go round by it for the purpose of ascertaining the name on the door    chapter five  conspiracy and villainy innocence and tragedy  in one of the dirtiest of the dirty and disreputable dens of london a man and a boy sat on that same dark december night engaged in earnest conversation  their seats were stools their table was an empty flourbarrel their apartment a cellar  a farthing candle stood awry in the neck of a pint bottle  a brokenlipped jug of ginandwater hot and two cracked teacups stood between them  the damp of the place was drawn out rather than abated by a small fire which burned in a rusty grate over which they sought to warm their hands as they conversed  the man was palpably a scoundrel  not less so was the boy  slogger said the man in a growling voice we must do it this wery night  vell brassey im game replied the slogger draining his cup with a defiant air  if it hadnt bin for that old ooman as was caretaker all last summer continued the man as he pricked a refractory tobaccopipe wed ave found the job more difficult but you see she went and lost the key o the back door and the doctor he ad to get another  so i goes an gets round the old ooman an pumps her about the lost key an at last i finds itdye see  but returned the slogger with a knowing frown seems to me as how youd never get two keys into one lockeh  the noo un wouldnt let the old un in would it  ah thats where it is replied mr brassey with a leer as he raised his cup to his large ugly mouth and chuckled  you see the doctors wife shes summat timmersome an looks arter the lockin up every night herselfwery partikler  then she as all the keys up into her own bedroom o nightsso you see in consikence of her uncommon care she keeps all the locks clear for you and me to work upon  the slogger was so overcome by this instance of the result of excessive caution that he laughed heartily for some minutes and had to apply for relief to the hot ginandwater  ow ever did you come for to find that hout asked the boy  servants replied the man  ha exclaimed the boy with a wink which would have been knowing if the spirits had not by that time rendered it ridiculous  yes you see continued the elder ruffian blowing a heavy cloud of smoke like a cannon shot from his lips servants is wariable in character  some is good an some is bad  i mostly take up wi the bad uns  theres one in the doctors ouse as is a prime favourite with me an knows all about the locks she does  but theres a noo an unexpected difficulty sprung up in the way this wery mornin  wots that demanded the slogger with the air of a man prepared to defy all difficulties  theyve bin an got a doga little dog too the very wust kind for kickin up a row  owever it aint the fust time you an i ave met an conkered such a difficulty  youll take a bit of cats meat in your pocket you know  hall right exclaimed the young housebreaker with a reckless toss of his shaggy head as he laid his hand on the jug but the elder scoundrel laid his stronger hand upon it  come slogger no more o that  youve ad too much already  you wont be fit for dooty if you take more  its wery ard on a cove growled the lad sulkily  brassey looked narrowly into his face then took up the forbidden jug and himself drained it after which he rose grasped the boy by his collar and forced him struggling towards a sink full of dirty water into which he thrust his head and shook it about roughly for a second or two  there thatll sober you said the man releasing the boy and sending him into the middle of the room with a kick  now dont let your monkey rise slogger  its all for your good  ill be back in alf an hour  see that you have the tools ready  so saying the man left the cellar and the boy who was much exasperated though decidedly sobered by his treatment proceeded to dry himself with a jacktowel and make preparations for the intended burglary  the house in regard to which such interesting preparations were being made was buried at the hour i write of in profound repose  as its fate and its family have something to do with my tale i shall describe it somewhat particularly  in the basement there was an offshoot or scullery which communicated with the kitchen  this scullery had been set apart that day as the bedroom of my little dog  of course i knew nothing of this and what i am about to relate at that time  i learned it all afterwards  dumps lay sound asleep on a flannel bed made by loving hands in the bottom of a soapbox  it lay under the shadow of a beercaskthe servants beera fresh caskwhich having arrived late that evening had not been relegated to the cellar  the only other individual who slept on the basement was the footman  that worthy being elderly and feeble though bold as a lion had been doomed to the lower regions by his mistress as a sure protection against burglars  he went to bed nightly with a poker and a pistol so disposed that he could clutch them both while in the act of springing from bed  this arrangement was made not to relieve his own fears but by order of his mistress with whom he could hold communication at night without rising by means of a speakingtube  johnhe chanced to bear my own namehad been so long subject to night alarms partly from cats careering in the back yard and his mistress demanding to know through the tube if he heard them partly also from frequent ringing of the nightbell by persons who urgently wanted dr mctougall that he had become callous in his nervous system and did much of his nightwork as a semisomnambulist  the rooms on the first floor above consisting of the diningroom library and consultingroom etcetera were left as usual tenantless and dark at night  on the drawingroom floor mrs mctougall lay in her comfortable bed sound asleep and dreamless  the poor lady had spent the first part of that night in considerable fear because of the restlessness of dumps in his new and strange bedroomher husband being absent because of a sudden call to a country patient  the speakingtube had been pretty well worked and john had been lively in consequence though patientbut at last the drowsy god had calmed the good lady into a state of oblivion  on the floor above besides various bedrooms there were the night nursery and the schoolroom  in one of the bedrooms slumbered the young lady who had robbed me of my doggie  in the nursery were four cribs and a cradle  dr mctougalls family had come in what i may style annual progression  six years had he been married and each year had contributed another annual to the army  the children were now ranged round the walls with mathematical precisionone two three four and five  the doctor liked them all to be together and the nursery being unusually large permitted of this arrangement  a tall powerful sunnytempered woman of uncertain age officered the army by day and guarded it by night  jack and harry and job and jenny occupied the cribs dolly the cradle  each of these creatures had been transfixed by sleep in the very midst of some desperate enterprise during the earlier watches of that night and all had fallen down in more or less degage and reckless attitudes  here a fat fist doubled there a fatter leg protruded elsewhere a spread eagle was represented with the bedclothes in a heap on its stomach or a complex knot was displayed made up of legs sheets blankets and arms  subsequently the tall but faithful guardian had gone round disentangled the knot reduced the spread eagle and straightened them all out  they now lay stiff and motionless as mummies roseate as the morn deceptively innocent with eyes tight shut and mouths wide open save in the case of dolly whose natural appetite could only be appeased by the nightly sucking of two of her own fingers  in the attics three domestics slumbered in peace  still higher a belated cat reposed in the lee of a chimneystack  it was a restful scene which none but a heartless monster could have ventured to disturb  even brassey and the slogger had no intention of disturbing iton the contrary it was their earnest hope that they might accomplish their designs on the doctors plate with as little disturbance as possible  their motto was a paraphrase get the plate quietly if you can but get the plate  in the midst of the universal stillness when no sound was heard save the sighing of the nightwind or the solemn creaking of an unsuccessful smokecurer there came a voice of alarm down the tube  john do you hear burglars  oh dear no mum i dont  im convinced i hear them at the back of the house tubed mrs mctougall  indeed it aint mum tubed john in reply  its ony that little dog as comed this morning and aint got used to its noo ome yet  its awhinin mum thats wot it is  oh do get up john and put a light beside him perhaps hes afraid of the dark  very well mum said john obedient but savage  he arose upset the poker and pistol with a hideous clatter which was luckily too remote to smite horror into the heart of mrs mctougall and groped his way into the servants hall  lighting a paraffin lamp he went to the scullery using very unfair and harsh language towards my innocent dog  pompey you brutethe footman had already learned his namehold your noise  there  he set the lamp on the head of the beer cask and returned to bed  it is believed that poor perplexed dumps viewed the midnight apparition with silent surprise and wagged his tail being friendly then gazed at the lamp after the apparition had retired until obliged to give the subject up like a difficult conundrum and finally went to sleep perchance to dreamof dogs or me  it was while dumps was thus engaged that brassey and the slogger walked up to the front of the house and surveyed it in silence for a few minutes  they also took particular observations of both ends of the street  all serene said brassey now you go round to the back and use your key quietly  give im the bit o meat quick  he wont give tongue arter e smells it and one or two barks wont alarm the ouse  so get along slogger  wen youve got him snug with a rope round is neck an is head in the flannel bag just caterwaul an ill come round bless the cats theyre a great help to gentlemen in our procession  thus admonished the slogger chuckled and melted into the darkness while brassey mingled himself with the shadow of a pillar  the keylost by the caretaker and found by the burglarfitted into the empty lock even more perfectly than that which mrs mctougall had conveyed to her mantelpiece some hours before  it was well oiled too and went round in the wards of the lock without giving a chirp so that the bolt flew back with one solitary shot  the report however was loud  it caused dumps to return from dogland and raise his head with a decided growl  nobody heard the growl except the slogger who stood perfectly still for nearly a minute with his hand on the doorhandle  then he opened the door slowly and softlyso slowly and softly that an alarmbell attached to it did not ring  a sharp bow wow wow however greeted him as he entered but he was prompt  a small piece of meat fell directly under the nose of dumps as he stood bristling in front of his box and let me add when dumps bristled it was a sight to behold  good doggood dooog said the slogger in his softest and most insinuating tone  dumps reduced his bark to a growl  the footman heard both bark and growl but attributing them to the influence of cats turned on his other side and listenednot for burglars innocent man but for the tube  it was silent  evidently tired nature was in mrs mctougalls case lulled by the sweet restorer  forthwith john betook himself again to the land of nod  have another bit said the slogger in quite a friendly way after the first bit had been devoured  my too trusting favourite wagged his tail and innocently accepted the bribe  it was good cats meat  dumps liked it  the enormous supper with which he had lain down was by that time nearly assimilated and appetite had begun to revive  going down on his knee the young burglar held out a third morsel of temptation in his hand  dumps meekly advanced and took the meat  it was a sad illustration of the ease with which even a dog descends from bad to worse  while he was engaged with it the slogger gently patted his head  suddenly dumps found his muzzle grasped and held tight in a powerful hand  he tried to bark and yell but could produce nothing better than a scarcely audible whine  his sides were at the same instant grasped by a pair of powerful knees while a rope was twisted round his neck and the process of strangulation began  but strangulation was not the sloggers intention  he had been carefully warned not to kill  mind now you dont screw im up too tight brassey had said when giving the boy his instructions before starting  dogs is vurth munny just old im tight and quiet till you get the flannel bag on is head and then stand by till ive sacked the swag  accordingly having effected the bagging of the dogs head the young burglar went to the door holding dumps tight in his arms and uttered a pretty loud and lifelike caterwaul  brassey heard it emerged from the shade of his pillar and was soon beside his comrade  when dumps smelt and heard the newcomer he redoubled his efforts to free his head and yell but the slogger was too much for him  few words were wasted on this occasion  the couple understood their work  brassey took up the lamp  wery considerate of em to ave a light all ready for us he muttered as he lowered the flame a little and glided into the kitchen leaving the slogger on guard in the scullery  here he found a variety of gins and snares carefully placed for himand such as heby strict orders of mrs mctougall  besides a swingbell on the window shuttersimilar to that which had done so little service on the scullery doorthere was a coalscuttle with the kitchen tongs balanced against it and a tin sloppail in company with the kitchen shovel and a wateringpan whichthe poker being already engaged to johnwas balanced on its own rose and handle all ready to fail with a touch  these outworks being echelloned along the floor rendered it impossible for an intruder to cross the kitchen in the dark without overturning one or more of them thanks to the lamp brassey steered his way carefully and with a grim smile  at john waterss door he paused and listened  johns nose revealed his condition  gliding up the stairs on shoeless feet the burglar entered the diningroom picked the locks of the sideboard with marvellous celerity unfolded a canvas bag and placed therein whatever valuables he could lay hands on  proceeding next to the drawingroom floor he began to examine and appropriate the articles of vertu that appeared to him most valuable  not being a perfect judge of such matters mr brassey was naturally puzzled with some of them  one in particular caused him to regard it with frowning attention for nearly a minute before he came to the conclusion that it was vurth munny  he placed the lamp on the small table near the window from which he had lifted the ornament in question and sat down on a crimson chair with gilded legs to examine it more critically  meanwhile the slogger left in the dark with the still fitfully struggling dumps employed his leisure in running over some of the salient events of his past career and in trying to ascertain by the very faint light that came from a distant streetlamp what was the nature of his immediate surroundings  his nose told him that the cask at his elbow was beer  his exploring right hand told him that the tap was in it  his native intelligence suggested a tumbler on the head of the cask and the exploring hand proved the idea to be correct  brassey was wery ard on me tonight he thought  id like to have a swig  but dumps was sadly in the way  to remove his left hand even for an instant from the dogs muzzle was not to be thought of  in this dilemma he resolved to tie up the said muzzle and the legs also even at the risk of causing death  it would not take more than a minute to draw a tumblerful and any dog worth a straw could hold his wind for a minute he would try  he did try and was yet in the act of drawing the beer when my doggie burst his bonds by a frantic effort to be free  probably the hairy nature of his little body had rendered a firm bond impossible at all events he suddenly found his legs loose  another effort more frantic than before set free the muzzle and then there arose on the still night air a yell so shrill so loud so indescribably horrible that its conception must be left entirely to the readers imagination  at the same instant dumps scurried into the kitchen  the scuttle and tongs went down the sloppail and shovel followed suit also the wateringpan into which latter dumps went head foremost as it fell and from its interior another yell issued with such resonant power that the first yell was a mere chirp by contrast  the slogger fled from the scene like an evil spirit while john waters sprang up and grasped the pistol and poker  the effect on brassey in the drawingroom cannot be conceived much less described  he shot as it were out of the crimsongilded chair and overturned the lamp which burst on the floor  being half full of paraffin oil it instantly set fire to the gauze windowcurtains  the burglar made straight for the stairs  john waters observing the light dashed up the same and the two met face to face on the landing breathing hate and glaring defiance    chapter six  relates a stirring innocent  now it was at this critical moment that i chanced to come upon the scene  i had just ascertained from the brass plate on the door that dr mctougall dwelt there and was thinking what an ugly unromantic name that was for a pretty girl as i descended the steps when dumpss first yell broke upon my astonished ears  i recognised the voice at once though i must confess that the second yell from the interior of the wateringpan perplexed me not a little but the hideous clatter with which it was associated and the sudden bursting out of flames in the drawingroom drove all thoughts of dumps instantly away  my first impulse was to rush to the nearest firestation but a wild shouting in the lobby of the house arrested me  i rang the bell violently  at the same moment i heard the report of a pistol and a savage curse as a bullet came crashing through the door and went close past my head  then i heard a blow followed by a groan  this was succeeded by female shrieks overhead and the violent undoing of the bolts locks and chains of the front door  thought is quick  burglary flashed into my mind  a villainouslooking fellow leaped out as the door flew open  i recognised him instantly as the man who had sold dumps to me  i put my foot in front of him  he went over it with a wild pitch and descended the steps on his nose  i was about to leap on him when a policeman came tearing round the corner just in time to receive the stunned brassey with open arms as he rose and staggered forward  just so  dont give way too much to your feelings  ill take care of you my poor unfortunate fellow said the policeman as a brother in blue came to his assistance  already one of those ubiquitous creatures a streetboy had flown to the firestation on the wings of hope and joy and an engine came careering round the corner as i turned to rush up the stairs which were already filled with smoke  i dashed in the first door i came to  a lady partially clothed stood there pale as death and motionless  quick madam descend the house is on fire  i gasped in sharp sentences as i seized her  where is youryour she looked young sister  i cried as she resisted my efforts to lead her out  ive no sister she shrieked  your daughter then  quick direct me  oh my darling she cried wringing her hands  where  i shouted in desperation for the smoke was thickening  upstairs she screamed and rushed out intending evidently to go up  i caught her round the waist and forced her down the stairs thrust her into the arms of an ascending fireman and then ran up again taking three steps at a time  the cry of a child attracted me  i made for a door opposite and burst it open  the scene that presented itself was striking  out of four cribs and a cradle arose five cones of bedclothes with a pretty little curly head surmounting each cone and ten eyes blazing with amazement  a tall nurse stood erect in the middle of the floor with outstretched arms glaring  instantly i grasped a cone in each arm and bore it from the room blinded with smoke i ran like a thunderbolt into the arms of a gigantic fireman  take it easy sir  youll do far more work if you keep cool  straight on to front room  fireescapes there by this time  i understood and darted into a front room through the window of which the head of the fireescape entered at the same moment sending glass in splinters all over us  it was immediately drawn back a little enabling me to throw up the windowsash and thrust the two children into the arms of another fireman whose head suddenly emerged from the smoke that rose from the windows below  i could see that the fire was roaring out into the street and lighting up hundreds of faces below while the steady clank of engines told that the brigade was busily at work fighting the flames  but i had no time to look or think  indeed i felt as if i had no power of volition properly my own but that i acted under the strong impulse of another spirit within me  darting back towards the nursery i met the first fireman dragging with his right hand the tall nurse who seemed unreasonably to struggle against him while in his left arm he carried two of the children and the baby by its nightdress in his teeth  i saw at a glance that he had emptied the nursery and turned to search for another door  during the whole of this scenewhich passed in a few minutesa feeling of desperate anxiety possessed me as to the fate of the young lady to whom i had given up my doggie  i felt persuaded she slept on the same floor with the children and groped about the passage in search of another door  by this time the smoke was so dense that i was all but suffocated  a minute or two more and it would be too late i could not see  suddenly i felt a door and kicked it open  the black smoke entered with me but it was still clear enough inside for me to perceive the form of a girl lying on the floor  it was she  miss mctougall  i shouted endeavouring to rouse her but she had fainted  not a moment now to lose  a lurid tongue of flame came up the staircase  i rolled a blanket round the girlhead and all  she was very light  in the excitement of the moment i raised her as if she had been a child and darted back towards the passage but the few moments i had lost almost cost us our lives  i knew that to breathe the dense smoke would be certain suffocation and went through it holding my breath like a diver  i felt as if the hot flames were playing round my head and smelt the singeing of my own hair  another moment and i had reached the window where the grim but welcome head of the escape still rested  with a desperate bound i went head first into the shoot taking my precious bundle along with me  a fireman chanced to be going down the shoot at the time carefully piloting one of the maids who had been rescued from the attics and checking his speed with outspread legs  against him i canonned with tremendous force and sent him and his charge in a heap to the bottom  this was fortunate for the pace at which i must have otherwise come down would have probably broken my neck  as it was i felt so stunned that i nearly lost consciousness  still i retained my senses sufficiently to observe a stout elderly little man in full evening dress with his coat slit up behind to his neck his face halfblackened and his shaggy hair flying wildly in all directions chiefly upwards  amid wild cheering from the crowd i confusedly heard the conversation that followed  theyre all accounted for now sir said a policeman who supported me  the elderly gentleman had leaped forward with an exclamation of earnest thankfulness and unrolled the blanket  not hurt  no thank god  lift her carefully now  to the same houseand who are you he added turning and looking full at me as i leaned in a dazed condition on the firemans shoulder  i heard the question and saw the speaker but could not reply  this is the genleman as saved two o the childn an the young lady said the tall fireman whom i recognised as the one into whose bosom i had plunged on the upper floor  ay an hes the genleman said another fireman who shoved your missus sir into my arms wen she was bent on runnin upstairs  is this so said the little gentleman stepping forward and grasping my hand  still i could not speak  i felt as if the whole affair were a dream and looked on and listened with a vacant smile  just at that moment a long melancholy wail rose above the roaring of the fire and clanking of the engines  the cry restored me at once  dumps my doggie  i exclaimed and bursting through the crowd rushed towards the now furiouslyburning house but strong hands restrained me  what dog is it asked the elderly gentleman  a man drenched blackened and bloodstained whom i had not before observed here said  a noo dog sir dumps by name come to us this wery day  we putt im in the scullery for the night  again i made a desperate effort to return to the burning house but was restrained as before  all right sir whispered a fireman in a confidential tone i know the scullery  the fire aint got down there yet  your dog can only have bin damaged by water as yet  ill save im sir never fear  he went off with a quiet little nod that did much to comfort me meanwhile the elderly gentleman sought to induce me to leave the place and obtain refreshment in the house of a friendly neighbour who had taken in his family  you need rest my dear sir he said come i must take you in hand you have rendered me a service which i can never repay  what obstinate  do you know that i am a doctor sir and must be obeyed  i smiled but refused to move until the fate of dumps was ascertained  presently the fireman returned with my doggie in his arms  poor dumps  he was a pitiable sight  tons of hot water had been pouring on his devoted head and his shaggy shapeless coat was so plastered to his long little body that he looked more like a drowned weazel than a terrier  he was trembling violently and whined piteously as they gave him to me nevertheless he attempted to wag his tail and lick my hands  in both attempts he failed  his tail was too wet to wagbut it wriggled  hed have saved himself sir said the man who brought him only there was a rope round his neck which had caught on a coalscuttle and held him  hes not hurt sir though he do seem as if some one had bin tryin to choke him  my poor doggie said i fondling him  he wont want washin for some time to come observed one of the bystanders  there was a laugh at this  come now the dog is safe you have no reason for refusing to go with me said the elderly gentleman who i now understood was the master of the burning house  as we walked away he asked my name and profession and i thought he smiled with peculiar satisfaction when i said i was a student of medicine  oh indeed he said wellwe shall see  but here we are  this is the house of my good friend dobson  city mancapital fellow like all city menahem  he has put his house at my disposal at this very trying period of my existence  but are you sure dr mctougall that all the household is saved  i asked becoming more thoroughly awake to the tremendous reality of the scene through which i had just passed  sure my good fellow dyou think id be talking thus quietly to you if i were not sure  yes thanks to you and the firemen under god theres not a hair of their heads injured  are youi beg pardonare you quite sure  have you seen miss mctougall since she  miss mctougall exclaimed the doctor with a laugh  dyou mean my little jenny by that dignified title  well of course i did not know her name and she is not very large but i brought her down the shoot with such violence that  an explosion of laughter from the doctor stopped me as i entered a large library the powerful lights of which at first dazzled me  here dobson let me introduce you to the man who has saved my whole family and who has mistaken miss blythe for my jennywhy sir he continued turning to me the bundle you brought down so unceremoniously is only my governess  ah  id give twenty thousand pounds down on the spot if she were only my daughter  my jenny will be a lucky woman if she grows up to be like her  i congratulate you mr mellon said the city man shaking me warmly by the hand  you have acted with admirable promptitudewhich is most important at a fireand they tell me that the header you took into the escape with miss blythe in your arms was the finest acrobatic feat that has been seen off the stage  i say dobson where have you stowed my wife and the children  i want to introduce him to them  in the diningroom returned the city man  you see i thought it would be more agreeable that they should be all together until their nerves are calmed so i had mattresses blankets etcetera brought down  being a bachelor as you know i could do nothing more than place the wardrobes of my domestics at the disposal of the ladies  the things are not indeed a very good fit butthis way mr mellon  the city man who was tall and handsome ushered his guests into what he styled his hospital and there ranged in a row along the wall were five shakedowns with a child on each  seldom have i beheld a finer sight than the sparkling lustre of their ten still glaring eyes  two pleasant young domestics were engaged in feeding the smaller ones with jam and pudding  we arrange the words advisedly because the jam was out of all proportion too much for the pudding  the elder children were feeding themselves with the same materials and in the same relative proportions  mrs mctougall in a blue cotton gown with white spots which belonged to the housemaid reclined on a sofa she was deadly pale and the expression of horror was not quite removed from her countenance  beside her administering restoratives sat miss blythe in a chintz dress belonging to the cook which was ridiculously too large for her she was dishevelled and flushed and looked so pleasantly anxious about mrs mctougall that i almost forgave her having robbed me of my doggie  miss blythe your deliverer cried the little doctor who seemed to delight in blowing my trumpet with the loudest possible blast my dear your preserver  i bowed in some confusion and stammered something incoherently  mrs mctougall said something else languidly and miss blythe rose and held out her hand with a pleasant smile  well if this isnt one of the very jolliest larks i ever had exclaimed master harry from his corner between two enormous spoonfuls  hah exclaimed master jack  he could say no more  he was too busy  we all laughed and much to my relief general attention was turned to the little ones  you young scampsthe lark will cost me some thousands of pounds said the doctor  never mind papa  just go to the bank and theyll give you as much as you want  more pooding demanded master job  the pleasantfaced domestic hesitated  oh give it him  act the banker on this occasion and give him as much as he wants said the doctor  good papa exclaimed the overjoyed jenny how i wis we had a house on fire every night  even dolly crowed with delight at this as if she really appreciated the idea and continued her own supper with increased fervour  thus did that remarkable family spend the small hours of that morning while their home was being burned to ashes    chapter seven  my circumstances begin to brighten  robin said old mrs willis from her bed in the wheeziest of voices  whos robin granny demanded young slidder in some surprise looking over his shoulder as he stooped at the fire to stir a pan of gruel  you are robin returned the old lady following up the remark with a feeble sneeze  i cant stand slidder  it is such an ugly name besides you ought to have a christian name child  dont you like robin  the boy chuckled a little as he stirred the gruel  vell i aint had it long enough to ave made up my mind on the pint but you may call me wot you please granny slong as you dont swear ill answer to robin or bobin or dobin or nobin or floginno by the way i wont answer to flogin  i dont like that  but why call me robin  ah sighed the old woman because i once had a dear little son so named  he died when he was about your age and your kindly ways are so like his that  hallo granny interrupted slidder standing up with a look of intense surprise are you took bad  no  why  cause you said suthin about my ways that looks suspicious  did i robin  i didnt mean to  but as i was saying id like to call you robin because it reminds me of my little darling who is now in heaven  ah  robin was so gentle and loving and tender and true and kind  he was a good boy  a wheezing which culminated in another feeble sneeze here silenced the poor old thing  for some minutes after that slidder devoted himself to vigorous stirring of the gruel and to repressed laughter which latter made him very red in the face and caused his shoulders to heave convulsively  at last he sought relief in occasional mutterings  ony think he said quoting mrs williss words in a scarcely audible whisper so gentle an lovin an tender an true an kindan sitch a good boy tooan my kindly ways is like his are they  well well mrs w its quite clear that a loonatic asylum must be your native ome arter this  what are you muttering about robin  nuffin partikler granny  ony suthin about your futur prospecs the gruels ready i think  will you ave it now or vait till you get it  thereeven in your little touches of humour youre so like him said the old woman with a mingled smile and sneeze as she slowly rose to a sitting posture making a cone of the bedclothes with her knees on which she laid her thin hands  come now old ooman said slidder seriously if you go on jokin like that youll make me larf and spill your gruelpraps let it fall bash on the floor  there  dont let it tumble off your knees now id adwise you to lower em for the time bein  heres the spoon it aint as bright as i could wish but you cant expect much of pewter an the napkinthats your sort an the bit of breadwhich it isnt too much for a ealthy happetite  now then granny go in and win  so like murmured the old woman as she gazed in slidders face and it is so good of you to give up your play and come to look after a helpless old creature like me  yes it is wery good of me assented the boy with an air of profound gravity i was used to sleep under a damp archway or in a wet cask now i slumbers in a ouse by a fire under a blankit  vunce on a time i got wittles anyowsometimes didnt get em at all now i ave em riglar as well as good an ot  in wot poets call the days gone byan nights too let me tell youi wos kicked an cuffed by everybody an unted to death by bobbies  now imlet alone eavenly conditionlet alone sometimes even complimented with such pleasant greetings as go it ginger or does your mother know youre out  oh yes granny  i made great sacrifices i did wen i come ere to look arter you  mrs willis smiled sneezed and began her gruel  slidder who looked at her with deep interest was called away by a knock at the door opening it he beheld a tall footman with a parcel in his hand  does a mrs willis live here he asked  no replied slidder a mrs willis dont live here but the mrs willisthe ony one vurth speakin ofdoes  ah replied the man with a smilefor he was an amiable footmanand i suppose you are young slidder  i am mister slidder sir  and i would ave you remember said the urchin with dignity that every englishmans ouse is his castle and that neither imperence nor flunkies as a right to enter  indeed exclaimed the man with affected surprise then im afraid this castle cant be a strong one or it aint well guarded for imperence got into it somehow when you entered  good good returned the boy with the air of a connoisseur thats worthy of the east end  you should ave bin one of usnow then old sixfoot wots your business  to deliver this parcel  and it over then  but i am also to see mrs willis and ask how she is  walk in then an wipe your feet  we aint got a doormat today its acomin like christmas but you may use the boards in the meantime  the footman turned out to be a pleasant gossipy man and soon won the hearts of old mrs willis and her young guardian  he had been sent he said by a dr mctougall with a parcel containing wine tea sugar rice and a few other articles of food and with a message that the doctor would call and see mrs willis that afternoon  deary me thats very kind said the old woman but i wonder why he sent such things to me and who told him i was in want of em  it was a young gentleman who rescued most of the doctors family from a fire last night  his name i believe is mellon  wot  doctor john mellon exclaimed slidder with widening eyes  whether hes john or doctor i cannot tell  all i know is that hes mister mellon and hes bin rather knocked up bybut bless me i forgot i was to say nothing about thethe fire till dr mctougall had seen you  how stoopid of me but things will slip out  he stopped abruptly and placed his brown paper parcel on the bed  now i say look here mister sixfoot or wotevers your name said slidder with intense eagerness  its of no use your tyin up the mouth o the bag now  the cats got out an cant be got in again by no manner o means  just make a clean breast of it an tell it all out like a mantheres a good feller  if you dont ill tell dr mctougall that you gave me an the old lady a full true an partikler account o the whole affair from the fust bustin out o the flames an the calling o the ingines to the last crash o the fallin roof and the roastin alive of the ousehold cat  i will as sure as youre a sixfoot flunkey  thus adjured and threatened the gossipy footman made a clean breast of it  he told them how that i had acted like a hero at the fire and then after giving in minute detail an account of all that the reader already knows he went on to say that the whole family except dr mctougall was laid up with colds that the governess was in a high fever that the maidservants having been rescued on the shoulders of firemen from the attics were completely broken down in their nerves and that i had received an injury to my right leg which although i had said nothing about it on the night of the fire had become so much worse in the morning that i could scarcely walk across the room  in these circumstances he added dr mctougall had agreed to visit my poor people for me until i should recover  you see continued the footman i only heard a little of their conversation  dr mctougall was saying when i come into the room well mr mellon he said you must of necessity remain where you are and you could not let me tell you be in better quarters  i will look after your patients till you are able to go about againwhich wont be long i hopeand ill make a particular note of your old woman and send her some wine and things immediately  i suppose he meant you maam added the footman but having to leave the room again owing to some of the children howling for jam and pudding i heard no more  having thus delivered himself of his tale and parcel the tall footman took his leave with many expressions of goodwill  now granny remarked young slidder as he untied the parcel and spread its contents on the small deal table ive got a wague suspicion that the ouse wich as gone to hashes is the wery ouse in wich dr mellon put his little dog last night  cause why  aint it the same identical street an the same side o the street and about the same part o the street  an didnt both him and me forgit to ask the name o the people o the ouse or to look at the numberso took up was we with partin from punch  wot more natral than for him to go round on is way back to look at the ousesupposin he was too late to call then didnt that sixfooter say a terrier dog was reskooed from the lower premises  to be sure theres many a terrier dog in london but then didnt he likewise say that the govness o the family is a pretty gal  wot more likely than that shes my young lady  all that you see granny is what the magistrates would call presumptuous evidence but ill go and inquire for myself this wery evenin wen youre all settled an comfrable an wen ive got mrs jones to look arter you  that evening accordingly when robin slidderas i shall now call him was away making his inquiries dr mctougall called on mrs willis  she was very weak and low at the time  the memory of her lost edie had been heavy upon her and she felt strangely disinclined to talk  the kindly doctor did not disturb her more than was sufficient to fully investigate her case  when about to depart he took mrs jones into the passage  now my good woman he said i hope you will see the instructions you heard me give to mrs willis carried out  she is very low but with good food and careful nursing may do well  can you give her much of your time  la sir yes  im a lone woman sir with nothin to do but take care of myself an im that fond of mrs willisshes like my own mother  very good  and what of this boy who has come to live with her  dyou think he is steadyto be depended on  indeed i do sir replied mrs jones with much earnestness  though he did come from nowheres in partiklar an dont blong to nobody hes a good boy is little slidder and a better nurse youll not find in all the hospitals  i wish i had found him at home  will you give him this card and tell him to call on me tomorrow morning between eight and nine  let him ask particularly for medr mctougall  im not in my own house but in a friends at present i was burnt out of my house last night  oh sir exclaimed mrs jones with a shocked expression  yes accidents will happen you know to the most careful among us mrs jones said the little doctor with a smile as he drew on his gloves  good evening  take care of your patient now im much interested in her casebecause of the young doctor who visits her sometimes  dr mellon exclaimed the woman  yes  you know him  know him  i should think i do  he has great consideration for the poor  ah he is a gentleman is mr mellon  he is more than a gentleman mrs jones said the little doctor with a kindly nod as he turned and hurried away  it may perhaps seem to savour of vanity and egotism my recording this conversation but i do it chiefly for the purpose of showing how much of hearty gratitude there is for mere trifles among the poor for the woman who was thus complimentary to me never received a farthing of money from my hands and i am not aware of having ever taken any notice of her except now and then wishing her a respectful goodevening and making a few inquiries as to her health  that night dr mctougall came to me on returning from his rounds to report upon my district  i was in bed at the time and suffering considerable pain from my bruised and swollen limb  dumps was lying at my feetdried refreshed and none the worse for his adventures  i may mention that i occupied a comfortable room in the house of the city man who insisted on my staying with him until i should be quite able to walk to my lodgings  as dr mctougall had taken my district a brief note to mrs miff my landlady relieved my mind of all anxieties professional and domestic so that my doggie and i could enjoy ourselves as well as the swollen leg would permit  my dear young friend said the little doctor as he entered your patients are all going on admirably and as i mean to send my assistant to them regularly you may make your mind quite easy  ive seen your old woman too and she is charming  i dont wonder you lost your heart to her  your young protege however was absentthe scampbut he had provided a good nurse to take his place in the person of mrs jones  i know herwell said i she is a capital nurse  little slidder has i am told been here in your absence but unfortunately the maid who opened the door to him would not let him see me as i happened to be asleep at the time  however hell be sure to call again  but you have not told me yet how miss blythe is  well ive not had time to tell you replied the doctor with a smile im sorry to say she is rather feverish the excitement and exposure to the night air were a severe trial to her for although she is naturally strong it is not long since she recovered from a severe illness  nothing however surprises me so much as the way in which my dear wife has come through it all  it seems to have given her quite a turn in the right direction  why she used to be as timid as a mouse now she scoffs at burglars  after what occurred last night she says she will fear nothing under the sun  isnt it odd  as for the children im afraid the event has roused all that is wild and savage in their natures  they were kicking up a horrible shindy when i passed the diningroomthe hospital as dobson calls itso i opened the door and peeped in  there they were all standing up on their beds shouting fire fire pleece pleeceengines escapes  come quiiick  silence  i shouted  oh papa they screamed in delight what do you think weve had for supper  well what  pudding and jampudding and jamnearly all jam  then they burst again into a chorus of yells for engines and fireescapes while little dollys voice rang high above the rest pudding and damall dampleece pleece fire and feeves as i shut the door  but now a word in your ear before i leave you for the night  perhaps it may not surprise you to be told that i have an extensive practice after getting into a new house which i must do immediately i shall want an assistant who may in course of time perhaps become a partner dyou understand  are you open to a proposal  my dear sir said i your kindness is very great but you know that i am not yet  yes yes i know all about that  i merely wish to inject an idea into your brain and leave it there to fructify  go to sleep now my dear young fellow and let me wish you agreeable dreams  with a warm squeeze of the hand and a pleasant nod my new friend said goodnight and left me to my meditations    chapter eight  little slidder resists temptation successfully and i become enslaved  pompey said i one afternoon while reclining on the sofa in dobsons drawingroom my leg being not yet sufficiently restored to admit of my going outpompey ive got news for you  to my surprise my doggie would not answer to that name at all when i used it though he did so when it was used by miss blythe  dumps  i said in a somewhat injured tone  ears and tail at once replied  come now punch i said rather sternly ill call you what i pleasepunch dumps or pompeybecause you are my dog still at least as long as your mistress and i live under the same roof so sir if you take the dumps when i call you pompey ill punch your head for you  evidently the dog thought this a very flat jest for he paid no attention to it whatever  now dumps come here and lets be friends  who do you think is coming to stay with usto stay altogether  youll never guess  your old friend and first master little slidder no less  think of that  dumps wagged his tail vigorously whether at the news or because of pleasure at my brushing the hair off his soft brown eyes and looking into them i cannot tell  yes i continued its quite true  this fire will apparently be the making of little slidder as well as you and me for we are all going to live and work together  isnt that nice  evidently dr mctougall is a trump and so is his friend dobson who puts this fine mansion at his disposal until another home can be got ready for us  i was interrupted at this point by an uproarious burst of laughter from the doctor himself who had entered by the open door unobserved by me i joined in the laugh against myself but blushed nevertheless for man does not like as a rule to be caught talking earnestly either to himself or to a dumb creature  why mellon he said sitting down beside me and patting my dog i imagined from your tones as i entered that you were having some serious conversation with my wife  no mrs mctougall has not yet returned from her drive  i was merely having a chat with dumps  i had of late in my lodgings got into a way of thinking aloud as it were while talking to my dog  i suppose it was with an unconscious desire to break the silence of my room  no doubt no doubt replied the doctor with a touch of sympathy in his tone  you must have been rather lonely in that attic of yours and yet do you know i sometimes sigh for the quiet of such an attic perhaps when youve been some months under the same roof with these miniature thunderstorms jack harry job jenny and dolly youll long to go back to the attic  a tremendous thump on the floor overhead followed by a wild uproar sent the doctor upstairsthree steps at a stride  i sat prudently still till he returned which he did in a few minutes laughing  what dyou think it was he cried panting  only my dolly tumbling off the chest of drawers  my babes have many pleasant little games among others cutting off the heads of dreadful traitors is a great favourite  they roll up a sheet into a ball for the head  then each of them is led in turn to the scaffold which is the top of a chest of drawers  one holds the ball against the criminals shoulders another cuts it off with a wooden knife a basket receives it below then one of them takes it out and holding it aloft shouts behold the head of a traitor  it seems that four criminals had been safely decapitated and dolly was being led to the fatal block when she slipped her foot and fell to the ground overturning harry and a chair in her descent  that was all  not hurt i hope  oh no  they never get hurtseriously hurt i mean  as to blackandblue shins scratches cuts and bumps they may be said to exist in a perpetually maimed condition  strange said i musingly that they should like to play at such a disagreeable subject  disagreeable exclaimed my friend pooh thats nothing  you should see them playing at the horrors of the inquisition  my poor wife sometimes shudders at the idea that we have been gifted with five monsters of cruelty but any one can see with half an eye that it is a fine sense of the propriety of retributive justice that influences them  any one who chooses to go and look at the five innocent faces when they are asleep said i laughing can see with a quarter of an eye that you and mrs mctougall are to be congratulated on the nature of your little ones  of course we are my dear fellow returned the doctor with enthusiasm butto change the subjecthas little slidder been here today  not that i know of  ah there he is said the doctor as at that instant the doorbell rang there is insolence in the very tone of his ring  he has pulled the visitors bell too and there goes the knocker  of all the imps that walk a london streetboy is the sentence was cut short by the opening of the door and the entrance of my little protege  he had evidently got himself up for the occasion for his shoeblack uniform had been well brushed his hands and face severely washed and his hair plastered well down with soapandwater  come in slidderthats your name isnt it said the doctor  it is sirrobin slidder at your sarvice replied the urchin giving me a familiar nod  ope your leg aint so cranky as it wos sir gittin all square eh  i repressed a smile with difficulty as i repliedit is much better thank you  attend to what dr mctougall has to say to you  hall serene he replied looking with cool urbanity in the doctors face fire away  youre a shoeblack i see said the doctor  thats my purfession  do you like it  vell wen its dirty weather with lots o mud an coppers goin i does  wen its all sunshine an starwation i doesnt  my friend mr mellon tells me that youre a very good boy  little slidder looked at me with a solemn reproachful air  oh what a wopper he said  we both laughed at this  come slidder said i you must learn to treat us with more respect else i shall have to change my opinion of you  wery good sir thats your business not mine  i wos inwited here an here i am  now wot ave you got to say to methats the pint  can you read and write resumed the doctor  cernly not replied the boy with the air of one who had been insulted wot dyou take me for  dyou think im a genius as can read an write without avin bin taught or dyou think im a monster as wos born readin an writin  ive ad no school to go to nor nobody to putt me there  i thought the school board looked after such as you  so they does sir but ive been too many for the schoolboarders  then its your own fault that youve not been taught said the doctor somewhat severely  not at all returned the urchin with quiet assurance  its the dooty o the schoolboarders to ketch me an they cant ketch me thats not my fault  its my superiority  my friend looked at the little creature before him with much surprise after a few seconds contemplation and thought he continuedwell slidder as my friend here says you are a good sort of boy i am bound to believe him though appearances are somewhat against you  now i am in want of a smart boy at present to attend to the halldoor show patients into my consultingroom run messagesin short make himself generally useful about the house  how would such a situation suit you  wy doctor said the boy ignoring the question how could any boy attend on your alldoor wen its burnt to hashes  we will manage to have another door replied dr mctougall with a forbearing smile meanwhile you could practise on the door of this housebut that is not answering my question boy  how would you like the place  youd have light work a good salary pleasant society below stairs and a blue uniform  in short id make a pageinbuttons of you  wot about the wittles demanded this remarkable boy  of course youd fare as well as the other servants returned the doctor rather testily for his opinion of my little friend was rapidly falling i could see that to my regret  now give me an answer at once he continued sharply  would you like to come  not by no manner of means replied slidder promptly  we both looked at him in amazement  why slidder you stupid fellow said i what possesses you to refuse so good an offer  dr mellon he replied turning on me with a flush of unwonted earnestness dyou think id be so shabby so low so mean as to go an forsake granny willis for all the light work an good salaries and pleasant society an blueuniformswithbuttons in london  whod make er gruel  whod polish er shoes every mornin till you could see to shave in em though she dont never put em on  whod make er bed an light er fires an fetch er odd bits o coal  an whod read the noos to er an  why slidder interrupted dr mctougall you said just now that you could not read  no more i can sir but i takes in a old newspaper to er every morning an sets myself down by the fire with it before me an pretends to read  i inwents the noos as i goes along an you should see that old ladys face an the way er eyes opens wen im a tapin off the murders an the ighway robberies an the burglaries an the fires at ome an the wars an earthquakes an other scrimmages abroad  it do cheer er up most wonderful  of course i stick in any hodd bits o real noos i appens to git hold of but i aint partickler  apparently not said the doctor laughing  well i see its of no use tempting you to forsake your present positionindeed i would not wish you to leave it  some day i may find means to have old mrs willis taken better care of and thenwell we shall see  meanwhile i respect your feelings  goodbye and give my regards to granny  say ill be over to see her soon  stay said i as the boy turned to leave you never told me that one of your names was robin  cause it wasnt wen i saw you last i only got it a few days ago  indeed  from whom  from granny willis  she gave me the name an i likes it an mean to stick by itgood arternoon genlemen  ta ta punch  at the word my doggie bounced from under my hand and began to leap joyfully round the boy  i say said robin pausing at the door and looking back shes all right i ope  gittin better  who do you mean  wy the guvness in coursemy young lady  oh yes  i am happy to say she is better said the doctor much amused by the anxious look of the face which had hitherto been the quintessence of cool selfpossession  but she has had a great shake and will have to be sent to the country for change of air when we can venture to move her  i confess that i was much surprised but not a little gratified by the very decided manner in which slidder avowed his determination to stand fast by the poor old woman in whom i had been led to take so strong an interest  hitherto i had felt some uncertainty as to how far i could depend on the boys affection for mrs willis and his steadiness of purpose now i felt quite sure of him  dr mctougall felt as i did in the matter and so did his friend the city man  i had half expected that dobson would have laughed at us for what he sometimes styled our softness because he had so much to do with sharpers and sharp practice but i was mistaken  he quite agreed with us in our opinion of my little waif and spoke admiringly of those who sought through evil and good report to rescue our city arabs from destruction  and dobson did more than speak he gave liberally out of his ample fortune to the good cause  that evening just after the gas was lighted while i was lying on the sofa thinking of these things and toying with dumpss ears the door opened and mrs mctougall entered with miss blythe leaning on her arm it was the first time she had come down to the drawingroom since her illness  she was thin and pale but to my mind more beautiful than ever for her brown eyes seemed to grow larger and more lustrous as they beamed upon me  i leaped up sending an agonising shoot of pain through my leg and hastened to meet her  dumps as if jealous of me sprang wildly on before and danced round his mistress in a whirlwind of delight  i am so glad to see you miss blythe i stammered i had feared the consequences of that terrible nightthat rude descent  youyouare better i  thank you very much better she replied with a sweet smile and how shall i ever express my debt of gratitude to you mr mellon  she extended her delicate hand  i grasped it she shook mine heartily  that shake fixed my fate  no doubt it was the simple and natural expression of a grateful heart for a really important service but i cared nothing about that  she blushed as i looked at her and stooped to pat the jealous and impatient dumps  sit here darling on this easychair said mrs mctougall you know the doctor allows you only half an houror an hour at mosttonight you may be up longer tomorrow  there and you are not to speak much remembermr mellon you must address yourself to me  lilly is only allowed to listen  yes as you truly said mr mellon continued the good lady who was somewhat garrulous her descent was rough and indeed so was mine oh  i shall never forget that rough monster into whose arms you thrust me that awful night but he was a brave and strong monster too  he just gathered me up like a bundle of clothes and went crashing down the blazing stair through fire and smokeand through bricks and mortar too it seemed to me from the noise and shocks  but we came out safe thank god and i had not a scratch though i noticed that my monsters hair and beard were on fire and his face was cut and bleeding  i cant think how he carried me so safely  ah the firemen have a knack of doing that sort of thing said i speaking to mrs mctougall but looking at lilly blythe  so i have heard  the brave noble men said lilly speaking to mrs mctougall but looking at me  i know not what we conversed about during the remainder of that hour whether i talked sense or nonsense i cannot tell  the only thing i am quite sure of is that i talked incessantly enthusiastically to mrs mctougall but kept my eyes fixed on lilly blythe all the time and i know that lilly blushed a good deal and bent her pretty head frequently over her darling pompey and fondled him to his hearts content  that night my leg violently resented the treatment it had received when i slept i dreamed that i was on the rack and that miss blythe strange to say was the chief tormentor while dumps quietly looked on and laughedyes deliberately laughedat my sufferings    chapter nine  on the scent but puzzled  it was a considerable time after the fire before my leg permitted me to resume my studies and my duties among the poor  meanwhile i had become a regularlyestablished inmate of mr dobsons house and was halfjocularly styled dr mctougalls assistant  i confess that i had some hesitation at first in accepting such generous hospitality but feeling that i could not help myself till my leg should recover i became reconciled to it  then as time advanced the doctorwho was an experimental chemist as well as a jackofalltradesfound me so useful to him in his laboratory that i felt i was really earning my board and lodging  meanwhile lilly blythe had been sent to visit an aunt of dr mctougalls in kent for the benefit of her health  this was well  i felt it to be so  i knew that her presence would have a disturbing influence on my studies which were by that time nearly completed  i felt also that it was madness in me to fall in love with a girl whom i could not hope to marry for years even if she were willing to have me at all which i very much doubted  i therefore resolved to put the subject away from me and devote myself heartily to my profession in the spirit of that word which tells us that whatsoever our hands find to do we should do it with our might  success attended my efforts  i passed all my examinations with credit and became not only a fixture in the doctors family but as he earnestly assured me a very great help to him  of course i did not mention the state of my feelings towards lilly blythe to any onenot being in the habit of having confidantsexcept indeed to dumps  in the snug little room just over the front door which had been given to me as a study i was wont to pour out many of my secret thoughts to my doggie as he sat before me with cocked ears and demonstrative tail  youve been the making of me dumps said i one evening not long after i had reached the first round of the ladder of my profession  it was you who introduced me to lilly blythe and through her to dr mctougall and you may be sure i shall never forget that  nay you must not be too demonstrative  when your mistress left you under my care she said halfjocularly no doubt that i was not to steal your heart from her  wasnt that absurd eh  as if any heart could be stolen from her  of course i cannot regain your heart dumps and i will not even attempt ithonour bright as robin slidder says  by the way that reminds me that i promised to go down to see old mrs willis this very night so ill leave you to the tender mercies of the little mctougalls  as i walked down the strand my last remark to dumps recurred to me and i could not help smiling as i thought of the tender mercies to which i had referred  the reader already knows that the juvenile mctougalls were somewhat bloodthirsty in their notions of play  when dumps was introduced to their nurseryby that time transferred from dobsons diningroom to an upper floorthey at once adopted him with open arms dumps seemed to be willing and fortunately turned out to be a dog of exceptionally goodnature  he was also tough  no amount of squeezing bruising pulling of the ears or tail or falling upon him either accidentally or on purpose could induce him to bite  he did indeed yell hideously at times when much hurt and he snarled barked yelped growled and showed his teeth continually but it was all in play for he was dearly fond of romps  fortunately the tall nurse had been born without nerves  she was wont to sit serene in a corner darning innumerable socks while a tornado was going on around her  dumps became a sort of continual sacrifice on all occasions when a criminal was to be decapitated a burglar hanged or a martyr burned dumps was the victim and many a time was he rescued from impending and real death by the watchful nurse who was too well aware of the innocent ignorance of her ferocious charges to leave dumps entirely to their tender mercies  on reaching mrs williss little dwelling i found young slidder officiating at the teatable  i could not resist watching him a moment through a crack in the door before entering  now then said he ere you are  set to work old sneezer with a will  the boy had got into a facetious way of calling mrs willis by any term of endearment that suggested itself at the moment which would have been highly improper and disrespectful if it had not been the outflow of pure affection  the crack in the door was not large enough to permit of my seeing mrs willis herself as she sat in her accustomed window with the spoutandchimneypot view  i could only see the withered old hand held tremblingly out for the smoking cup of tea which the boy handed to her with a benignant smile and i could hear the soft voice saythank you robindear boyso like  i tell you what it is granny returned slidder with a frown ill give you up an and you over to the pleece if you go on comparin me to other people in that waynow then ave some muffins  theyre all ot and soaked in butter old gummy just the wery thing for your teeth fire away now  wots the use o me an dr mctougall fetchin you nice things if you wont eat em  but i will eat em robin thankfully  that aint the way old ooman returned the boy helping himself largely to the viands which he so freely dispensed its not thankfully but heartily you ought to eat em  both robin both  not at all granny  we asked a blessin fust now didnt we  vell then wot weve to do next is to go in and win heartily  arter that its time enough to be thankful  what a boy it is responded mrs willis  i saw the withered old hand disappear with a muffin in it in the direction of the old mouth and at this point i entered  the wery man i wanted to see exclaimed slidder jumping up with what i thought unusual animation even for him  come along doctor just in time for grub  mrs w haint eat up all the muffins yet  fresh cup an saucer clean plate ditto knife no need for a fork now then sit down  accepting this hearty invitation i was soon busy with a muffin while mrs willis gave a slow elaborate and graphic account of the sayings and doings of master slidder which account i need hardly say was much in his favour and i am bound to add that he listened to it with pleased solemnity  now then old flatterer wen youve quite done praps youll tell the doctor that i wants a veeks leave of absence an then praps youll listen to what him an mes got to say on that pint  just keep a stuffin of yourself with muffins an dont speak  the old lady nodded pleasantly and began to eat with apparently renewed appetite while i turned in some surprise  a weeks leave of absence said i  just soa veeks leave of absencefurlow if you prefers to call it so  the truth is i wants a oliday wery bad  granny says so an i thinks shes right  dyou think my constitootions made o brass or castiron or bellmetal that i should be able to york on an on for ever black black blackin boots an shoes without a oliday  wy lawyers merchants bankerseven doctorsneeds a oliday now an then ow much more shoeblacks  well said i with a laugh there is no reason why shoeblacks should not require and desire a holiday as much as other people only its unusualbecause they cannot afford it i suppose  ah thats just were the shoe pinchesas a old genleman shouted to me tother day with a whack of his umbreller wen i scrubbed is corns too hard  right you are old stumps says i but youll have to pay tuppence farden hextra for that there whack or be took up for assault an battery  dyou know that genleman larfed he did like a iaena an paid the tuppence down like a man  i let im off the farden in consideration that he adnt got one an i had no changevell to return to the pintvich was wot the old toper remarked to his wife every nightive bin savin up of late  saving up have you  yes them penny banks as done it  wy it aint a wirtue to be savin nowadays or good or that sort o thing  what between city missionaries an sundayschools an penny banks an cheap wittles and grannies like this here old sneezer its hardly possible for a young feller to go wrong even if he was to try  yes ive bin an saved enough to give me a veeks oliday so im goin to ave my oliday in the north  my ealth requires it  saying this young slidder began to eat another muffin with a degree of zest that seemed to give the lie direct to his assertion so that i could not refrain from observing that he did not seem to be particularly ill  aint i though he remarked elongating his round rosy face as much as possible  thats cause you judge too much by appearances  it aint my body thats wrongits my spirit  thats wots the matter with me  if you only saw the inside o my mind youd be astonished  i thoroughly believe you said i laughing  and do you really advise him to go granny  yes my dear i do replied mrs willis in her sweet though feeble tones  youve no idea how hes been slaving and working about me  i have strongly advised him to go and you know good mrs jones will take his place  shes as kind to me as a daughter  the mention of the word daughter set the poor creature meditating on her great loss  she sighed deeply and turned her poor old eyes on me with a yearning inquiring look  i was accustomed to the look by this time and having no good news to give her had latterly got into a way of taking no notice of it  that night however my heart felt so sore for her that i could not refrain from speaking  ah dear granny said i laying my hand gently on her wrist would that i had any news to give you but i have noneat least not at present  but you must not despair  i have failed up to this time it is true although my inquiries have been frequent and carefully conducted but you know such a search takes a long time andand london is a large place  the unfinished muffin dropped from the old womans hand and she turned with a deep sigh to the window where the blank prospect was a not inapt reflection of her own blank despair  never more she said never more  hope thou in god for thou shalt yet praise him who is the health of thy countenance and thy god was all that i could say in reply  then i turned to the boy who sat with his eyes cast down as if in deep thought and engaged him in conversation on other subjects by way of diverting the old womans mind from the painful theme  when i rose to go slidder said he would call mrs jones to mount guard and give me a convoy home  no sooner were we in the street than he seized my hand and in a voice of unusual earnestness said  ive got on er tracks  whose tracks  what do you mean  on edies to be sureedie willis  talking eagerly and fast as we walked along little slidder told me how he had first been put on the scent by his old friend and fellowwaif the slogger  that juvenile burglar chancing to meet with slidder entertained him with a relation of some of his adventures  among others he mentioned having many months before been out one afternoon with a certain mr brassey rambling about the streets with an eye to any chance business that might turn up when they observed a young and very pretty girl looking in at various shop windows  she was obviously a lady but her dress showed that she was very poor  her manner and colour seemed to imply that she was fresh from the country  the two thieves at once resolved to fleece her  brassey advised the slogger to come the soft dodge over her and entice her if possible into a neighbouring court  the slogger agreeing immediately ran and placed himself on a doorstep which the girl was about to pass  then he covered his face with his hands and began to groan dismally while mr brassey with native politeness retired from the scene  the girl having an unsuspicious nature and a tender heart believed the tale of woe which the boy unfolded and went with him to see his poor mother who had just fallen down in a fit and was dying at that moment for want of physic and some one to attend to her  she suggested indeed that the slogger should run to the nearest chemist but the slogger said it would be of no use and might be too late  would she just run round an see her  the girl acted on the spur of the moment  in her exuberant sympathy she hurried down an alley round a corner under an archway and walked straight into the lions den  there mr brassey the lion promptly introduced himself and requested the loan of her purse and watch  the poor girl at once understood her position and turned to fly but a powerful hand on her arm prevented her  then she tried to shriek but a powerful hand on her mouth prevented that also  then she fainted  not wishing to be found in an awkward position mr brassey and the slogger searched her pockets hastily and finding nothing therein retired precipitately from the scene taking her little dog with them  as they did so the young girl recovered sprang wildly up and rushing back through the court and alley dashed into the main thoroughfare  the two thieves saw her attempt to cross saw a cabhorse knock her down saw a crowd rush to the spot and then saw no more owing to pressing engagements requiring their immediate presence elsewhere  therethats wot the slogger told me said little slidder with flushed cheeks and excited looks an i made him give me an exact description o the gal which was a facsimilar o the pictur painted o miss edie willis by her own grandmotheras like as two black cats  this is interesting very interesting my boy said i stopping and looking at the pavement but i fear that it leaves us no clew with which to prosecute the search  of course it dont rejoined robin with one of his knowing looks but do you think id go an aggrawate myself about the thing if i adnt more to say than that  well what more have you to say  just this that ever since my talk wi the slogger ive bin making wery partikler inquiries at all the chemists and hospitals round about where he said the accident happened an ive diskivered one hospital where i appens to know the porter an i got him to inwestigate an he found there was a case of a young gal run over on the wery day this happened she got feverish he says an didnt know what she was sayin for months an nobody come to inquire arter her an when she began to git well she sent to vitechapel to inquire for er grandmother but er grandmother was gone nobody knowed where  then the young gal got wuss then she got better and then she left sayin shed go back to er old ome in york for she was sure the old lady must have returned there so thats the reason wy im goin to recruit my ealth in the north dye see  but before i go wouldnt it be better that you should make some inwestigations at the hospital  i heartily agreed to this and went without delay to the hospital where however no new light was thrown on the subject  on the contrary i found what slidder had neglected to ascertain that the name of the girl in question was not edie willis but eva bright a circumstance which troubled me much and inclined me to believe that we had got on a false scent but when i reflected on the other circumstances of the case i still felt hopeful  the day of edies disappearance tallied exactly with the date of the robbing of the girl by brassey and the slogger  her personal appearance too as described by the slogger corresponded exactly with the description given of her granddaughter by mrs willis and above all the sending of a messenger from the hospital by the girl to inquire for her grandmother mrs willis were proofs too strong to be set aside by the mystery of the name  in these circumstances i also resolved to take a holiday and join robin slidder in his trip to york    chapter ten  a disappointment an accident and a perplexing return  but the trip to york produced no fruit  some of the tradespeople did indeed remember old mrs willis and her granddaughter but had neither seen nor heard of them since they left  they knew very little about them personally and nothing whatever of their previous history as they had stayed only a short time in the town and had been remarkably shy and uncommunicativethe result it was thought of their having come down in life  much disappointed slidder and i returned to london  it is fortunate that we did not tell granny the object of our trip so that she will be spared the disappointment that we have met with said i as the train neared the metropolis  my companion made no reply he had evidently taken the matter much to heart  we were passing rapidly through the gradually thickening groups of streets and houses which besprinkle the circumference of the great city and sat gazing contemplatively on back yards chimney cans unfinished suburban residences pieces of waste ground back windows internal domestic arrangements etcetera as they flew past in rapid succession  robin said i breaking silence again and using the name which had by that time grown familiar have you made up your mind yet about taking service with dr mctougall  now that we have got mrs jones engaged and paid to look after granny she will be able to get on pretty well without you and you shall have time to run over and see her frequently  hm  i dont quite see my way returned the boy with a solemn look you see sir if it was a pageinbuttons i was to be to attend on my young lady the guvness i might take it into consideration but to go into buttons an blue merely to open a door an do the purlite to wisitors an mix up things with bad smells by way of a changewhy dee see the prospec aint temptin  besides i hate blue  the buttons is all well enough but blue reminds me so of the bobbies that i dont think i could surwive it longindeed i dont  robin said i reproachfully im grieved at your indifference to friendship  ow so sir  have you not mentioned merely your objections and the disadvantages without once weighing against them the advantages  vich is  which are said i being under the same roof with me and with punch to say nothing of your young lady  ah to be sure  vell but i did think of all that only dont you see ill come to be under the same roof with you all in course o time wen youve got spliced an set up for  slidder said i sternly and losing patience under the boys presumption you must never again dare to speak of such a thing  you know very well that it is quite out of the question andandyoull get into a careless way of referring to such a possibility among servants or  no honour bright exclaimed slidder with for the first time a somewhat abashed look in his face i wouldnt for the wealth of the injies say a word to nobody wotsomever  its only atween ourselves that i wenturs to  well well enough said i dont in future venture to do it even between ourselves if you care to retain my friendship  now  robin i added as the train slowed of course youll not let a hint of our reason for going north pass your lips to poor granny or any one and give her the old message that ill be along to see her soon  it was pleasant to return to such a hearty reception as i met with from the doctors family  although my absence had been but for a few days the children came crowding and clinging round me declaring that it seemed like weeks since i left them  the doctor himself was as usual exuberant and his wife extremely kind  miss blythe i found had not yet returned and was not expected for some time  but the reception accorded me by the doctor and his family was as nothing to the wild welcome lavished upon me by dumps  that loving creature came more nearly to the burstingpoint than i had ever seen him before  his spirit was obviously much too large for his body  he was romping with the mctougall baby when i entered  the instant he heard my voice in the hall he uttered a squealalmost a yellof delight and came down the two flights of stairs in a wriggling heap his legs taking comparatively little part in the movement  his paws when first applied to the waxcloth of the nursery floor slipped as if on ice without communicating motion  on the stairs his ears tail head hair heart and tongue conspired to convulse him  only when he had fairly reached me did the hindlegs do their duty as he bounced and wriggled high into air  powers of description are futile vision alone is of any avail in such a case  are dogs mortal  is such overflowing wealth of affection extinguished at death  pshaw thought i the man who thinks so shows that he is utterly void of the merest rudiments of common sense  i did not mention the object of my visit to york to the doctor or his wife  indeed that natural shyness and reticence which i have found it impossible to shake offexcept when writing to you good readerwould in any case have prevented my communicating much of my private affairs to them but particularly in a case like this which seemed to be assuming the aspect of a wildly romantic hunt after a lost young girl more like the plot of a sensational novel than an occurrence in everyday life  it may be remarked here that the doctor had indeed understood from mrs willis that she had somehow lost a granddaughter but being rather fussy in his desires and efforts to comfort people in distress he had failed to rouse the sympathy which would have drawn out details from the old woman  i therefore merely gave him to understand that the business which had called me to the north of england had been unsuccessful and then changed the subject  meanwhile dumps returned to the nursery to resume the game of romps which i had interrupted  after a general scrimmage in which the five chips of the elder mctougall had joined without regard to any concerted plan dolly suddenly shouted top  what are we to stop for demanded harry whose powers of selfrestraint were not strong  want a est said dolly sitting down on a stool with a resolute plump  rest quick then and lets go on again said harry throwing himself into a small chair while job and jenny sprawled on an ottoman in the window  seeing that her troops appeared to be exhausted and that a period of repose had set in the tall nurse thought this a fitting opportunity to retire for a short recreative talk with the servants in the kitchen  now be good childn she said in passing out and dont urt poor little dumps  oh no chorused the five while with faces of intense and real solemnity they assured nurse that they would not hurt dumps for the world  well be so dood remarked dolly as the door closedand she really meant it  whatll we do to him now asked harry whose patience was exhausted  tut off hims head cried dolly clapping her fat little hands  no burn him for a witch said jenny  oh no vell skeese him flat till hes busted suggested job  but jenny thought that would be too cruel and harry said it would be too tame  it must not be supposed that these and several other appalling tortures were meant to be really attempted  as job afterwards said it was only play  oh  ill tell you what well do said jack who was considerably in advance of the others in regard to education well turn him into joan of arc  whats joan of arc asked job  it isnt a whatits a who cried jack laughing  is it like noahs ark inquired dolly  no no its a lady who lived in france an thought she was sent to deliver her country fromfromi dont know all what an put on mens cloes an armour an went out to battle an was burnt  bunt shouted dolly with sparkling eyes oh what funwere goin to bun you pompey  they called him by lilly blythes name  dumps who sat in a confused heap in a corner panting seemed regardless of the fate that awaited him  but where shall we find armour said harry  i know exclaimed job going to the fireplace and seizing the lid of a saucepan which stood on the hearth near enough to the tall fender to be within reach heres somethin  capitala breastplate  just the thing cried jack seizing it and whistling to dumps  and heres a firstrate helmet said harry producing a toy drum with the heads out  the strong contrast between my doggies conditions of grigginess and humiliation has already been referred to  aware that something unusual was pending he crawled towards jack with every hair trailing in lowly submission  poor joan of arc might have had a happier fate if she had been influenced by a similar spirit  now sir stand up on your hindlegs  the already welltrained and obedient creature obeyed  there he said tying the lid to his hairy bosom and there he continued thrusting the drum on his meek head which it fitted exactly now madame joan come awaythe fagots are ready  with harrys aid and to the ineffable joy of jenny job and dolly the little dog was carefully bound to the leg of a small table and bits of broken toysof which there were heapswere piled round it for fagots  dont be cuel said dolly tenderly  oh no we wont be cruel said jack who was really anxious to accomplish the whole execution without giving pain to the victim  the better to arrange some of the fastenings he clambered on the table dolly always anxious to observe what was being done attempted to do the same  jenny trying to prevent her pulled at her skirts and among them they pulled the table over on themselves  it fell with a dire crash  of course there were cries and shouts from the children but these were overtopped and quickly silenced by the hideous yellings of dumps  full many a time had the poor dog given yelp and yell in that nursery when accidentally hurt and as often had it wagged its forgiving tail and licked the patting hands of sympathy but now the yells were loud and continuous the patting hands were snapped at and dumps refused to be comforted  his piercing cries reached my study  i sprang upstairs and dashed into the nursery where the eccentric five were standing in a group with looks of selfcondemning horror in their ten round eyes and almost equally expressive round mouths  the reason was soon discoveredpoor dumps had got a hindleg broken  having ascertained the fact alleviated the pain as well as i could and bandaged the limb i laid my doggie tenderly in the toy bed belonging to jennys largest doll which was quickly and heartily given up for the occasion the dispossessed doll being callously laid on a shelf in the meantime  it was really quite interesting to observe the effect of this accident on the tenderhearted five  they wept over dumps most genuine tears they begged his pardonimplored his forgivenessin the most earnest tones and touching terms  they took turn about in watching by his sickbed  they held lint and lotion with superhuman solemnity while i dressed his wounded limb and they fed him with the most tender solicitude  in short they came out quite in a new and sympathetic light and soon began to play at sicknursing with each other  this involved a good deal of pretended sickness and for a long time after that it was no uncommon thing for visitors to the nursery to find three of the five down with measles whoopingcough or fever while the fourth acted doctor and the fifth nurse  the event however gave them a lesson in gentleness to dumb animals which they never afterwards forgot and which some of my boy readers would do well to remember  with a laudable effort to improve the occasion mrs mctougall carefully printed in huge letters and elaborately illuminated the sentence be kind to doggie and hung it up in the nursery  thereupon cardboard pencils paints and scissors were in immediate demand and soon after there appeared on the walls in hideously bad but highly ornamental letters the words be kind to cattie  this was followed by be kind to polly which instantly suggested be kind to dolly  and so by one means or another the lesson of kindness was driven home  soon after this event dr mctougall moved into a new house in the same street i became regularly established as his partner and robin slidder entered on his duties as page in buttons  it is right to observe here that in deference to his prejudices the material of his garments was not blue but dark grey  it was distinctly arranged however that robin was to go home as he called it to be with mrs willis at nights  on no other condition would he agree to enter the doctors service and i found on talking over the subject with mrs willis herself that she had become so fond of the boy that it would have been sheer cruelty to part them  in short it was a case of mutual love at first sight  no two individuals seemed more unlikely to draw together than the meek gentle old lady and the dashing harumscarum boy  yet so it was  my dearshe always spoke to me now as if i had been her sonthis waif as people would call him has clearly been sent to me as a comfort in the midst of all but overwhelming sorrow and i believe too that i have been sent to draw the dear boy to jesus  you should hear what long and pleasant talks we have about him and the bible and the better land sometimes  indeed  i am glad to hear you say so granny and also surprised because although i believe the boy to be well disposed i have seldom been able to get him to open his lips to me on religious subjects  ah but he opens his dear lips to me doctor and reads to me many a long chapter out of the blessed word  reads  can he read  ay can henot so badly considering that i only began to teach him two or three months ago  but he knew his letters when we began and could spell out a few words  hes very quick you see and a dear boy  soon afterwards we made this arrangement with robin more convenient for all parties by bringing mrs willis over to a better lodging in one of the small back streets not far from the doctors new residence  i now began to devote much of my time to the study of chemistry not only because it suited dr mctougall that i should do so but because i had conceived a great liking for that science and entertained some thoughts of devoting myself to it almost exclusively  in the various experiments connected therewith i was most ably and i may add delightedly assisted by robin slidder  i was also greatly amused by and induced to philosophise not a little on the peculiar cast of the boys mind  the pleasure obviously afforded to him by the uncertainty as to results in experiments was very great  the probability of a miscarriage created in him intense interesti will not say hope  the ignorance of what was coming kept him in a constant flutter of subdued excitement and the astounding results even sometimes to myself of some of my combinations kept him in a perpetual simmer of expectation  but after long observation i have come to the deliberate conclusion that nothing whatever gave robin such ineffable joy as an explosion  a crash a burst a general reduction of anything to instantaneous and elemental ruin was so dear to him that i verily believe he would have taken his chance and stood by if i had proposed to blow the roof off dr mctougalls mansion  nay i almost think that if that remarkable waif had been set on a bombshell and blown to atoms he would have retired from this life in a state of supreme satisfaction  while my mind was thus agreeably concentrated on the pursuit of science it received a rude but pleasing yet particularly distracting shock by the return of lilly blythe  the extent to which this governess was worshipped by the whole household was wonderfulalmost idolatrous need i say that i joined in the worship and that dumps and robin followed suit  i think not  and yetthere was something strange something peculiar something unaccountable about miss blythes manner which i could by no means understand    chapter eleven  relates generally to the doings and sayings of robin slidder  my dear said mrs mctougall one evening to the doctor since that little boy slidder came to stay with us things have become worse and worse in fact the house is almost unbearable  my dear responded dr mctougall you amaze me surely the boy has not dared to be rudeinsolent to you  oh no its not that but he must really be forbidden to enter the nursery  our darlings you know were dreadful enough before he came but since then they have become absolute maniacs  you dont mean to say that the little rascal has been teaching them bad words or manners i hope returned the doctor with a frown  dear me no papa dont get angry answered the anxious ladyfar from it  on the contrary i really believe that our darlings have greatly improved his language and manners by their example but robins exuberant spirits are far too much for them  it is like putting fire to gunpowder and they are so fond of him  thats the difficulty  the boy does not presume i must say that for him and he is very respectful to nurse but the children are constantly asking him to come and play with them which he seems quite pleased to do and then his mind is so eccentric so inventive  the new games he devises are very ingenious but so exceedingly dangerous and destructive that it is absolutely necessary to check him and i want you to do it dear  i must know something about the nature of the mischief before i can check it said the doctor  oh its indescribable returned the lady the smell that he makes in the nursery with his chemical experiments is awful and then poor pompey or dumps or whatever they call himfor they seem very undecided about his namehas not the life ofi was going to saya dog with them  only last night when you were out the ridiculous boy proposed the storming of an ogres castle  nurse was downstairs at the time or it could never have happened  well of course robin was the ogre darling dolly was a princess whom he had stolen away jack was a prince who was to deliver her and the others were the princes retainers  a castle was built in one corner of all the tables and chairs in the room piled on each other with one particular chair so ingeniously arranged that the pulling of it out would bring the castle in ruins to the ground  the plan of attack as far as i could make out was that the prince should ring our dinnerbell at the castle gates and fiercely demand admittance the demand to be followed by a burst from the trumpets drums and gongs of his soldiers  the ogre seated on the castle top with the princess after a few preliminary yells and howls was to say in a gruff voice that he was too much engaged just then with his dinnerthat three roast babies were being dished  when they were disposed of the princess would be killed and served up as a sort of light pudding after which he would open the castle gate  a horrible smell was to be created at this point to represent the roasting of the babies  this was to be the signal for a burst of indignation from the prince and his troops who were to make a furious assault on the door one of our largest teatraysand after a little the prince was to pull away the particular chair and rush back with his men to avoid the falling ruin while the ogre and princess were to find shelter under the nursery table and then when the fall was over they were to be found dead among the ruins  i am not sure whether the princess was to be revived or she was to have a grand funeral but the play never got that length  i was sitting here listening to the various sounds overhead wondering what they could be about when i heard a loud ringingthat was the castle bell  it was soon followed by a burst of toy trumpets and drums  a most disgusting smell began to permeate the house at the same time for it seems that the ogre set fire to his chemicals too soon  then i heard roaring and yelling which really alarmed meit was so gruff  when it stopped there was a woeful howlthat was the burst of indignation  the assault came off next and as the shouting of the troops was mingled with the hammering of the large teatray the ringing of the dinnerbell and the beating of the gong you may fancy what the noise was  in the midst of it there was a hideous crash accompanied by screams of alarm that were too genuine to be mistaken  i rushed up and found the furniture lying scattered over the room with darling dolly in the midst the others standing in solemn silence around and robin slidder sitting on the ground ruefully rubbing his head  the truth was that the particular chair had been pulled away before the proper time and the castle had come down in ruins while the ogre and princess were still on the top of it  fortunately robin saved dolly at the expense of his own head and shoulder by throwing his arms round her and falling undermost but it was a narrow escape and you really must put a stop to such reckless ongoings  the doctor promised to do so  i have to send robin a message this forenoon and will administer a rebuke before sending him he said but it was plain from the smile on the doctors face that the rebuke would not be severe  robin he said with much solemnity when the culprit stood before him take this bottle of medicine to mr williams you knowthe old placeand say i want to know how he is and that i will call tomorrow afternoon  yes sir said the boy taking the bottle with an unusually subdued air  and robinstop continued the doctor  i am told that the children were visited by an ogre last night  yes sir answered the boy with an uncertain glance at his questioners grave face  well robin you know where that ogre lives  just call and tell him from me that if he or any of his relations ever come here again ill cause them to undergo extraction of the spinal marrow dyou understand  at first little slidder felt inclined to laugh but the doctors face was so unusually stern that he thought better of it and went away much impressed  now robin slidder was no loiterer on his errands nevertheless he did not deem it a breach of fidelity to cast an occasional glance into a pictureshop window or to pause a few seconds now and then to chaff a facetious cabby or make a politely sarcastic remark to a bobby  his connection with what he termed igh life had softened him down considerably and given a certain degree of polish to his wit but it had in no degree repressed his exuberant spirits  the distance he had to go being considerable he travelled the latter part of the way by omnibus  chancing to be in a meditative frame of mind that day he climbed to the roof of the bus and sat down with his hands thrust deep into his pockets and his eyes deep into futurity whether he saw much there i cannot tell but after wandering for some time in that unknown region his eyes returned to surrounding things and among other objects alighted on the bus conductor whose head was within a few inches of his toe  it was the head of the slogger  that eccentric individual having sprung up in a few months from the condition of a big boy to that of an exceedingly young man had obtained a situation as conductor to a bus  he was so busy with his fares when robin mounted the bus that he failed to observe him until the moment when the latter returned from futurity  their eyes met simultaneously and opened to such an extent that if size had counted for numbers they might have done for four boys  hallo buttons was the sloggers exclamation  hallo slogger was that of robin  well now this is a pleasure whod a thought it said the conductor reaching up his hand  is that for your fare or a shake slogger demanded robin  a shake of course old feller replied the other as robin grasped the proffered handbut i say he added in a lower key theres no slogger now in this ere world hes dead an buried long ago  my name is villum bowlsno connection wotever with slogger  oh no we never mention imbut i say wen did you go into the genteel line eh slidder  robinrobin is my name now villum bowls  ive changed it since we met last though i haint cut old friends like you  robin an slidder ave been united an a pretty pair they make dont they  middlin  old on till i get that ancient stout party shoved in looks like as if he was a goin in the opposite direction but it dont matter so long as we can get im innow then sir mind the step all right  i say slidrobin i mean  vell slogvillum i mean why dont you say wot you mean eh  ow dyou like grey tights an buttons said the slogger with a bland smile  soso replied robin with a careless air the grey is sober enoughquite suitable to my characteran i confess im fond o the buttons  theres enough of em to form a goodish overcoat amost said the slogger with a critical grin but i should ave thought em not sufficiently waterproof in wet weather  vell they aint much use for that slogeh villum but you should see the dazzling display they makes in sunshine  wy you can see me half a mile off wen i chance to be walking in regent street or drivin in the park  but i value them chiefly because of the frequent and pleasant talks they get me with the ladies  you dont mean for to say robin that the ladies ever holds you by the buttonoles  no i dont but i holds them wi the buttons  this is the way of it  wen i chance to see a wery pretty ladynot one o your beauties you know i dont care a dump for them stuckup creatures but one o your sweet amiable sort with souls above buttons an faces one likes to look at and to kiss wen youve a right to vell wen i sees one o these i brushes up again er an ooks on with my buttons to some of er togs  if she takes it ill looks cross and alf inclined to use strong language i makes a umble apology an gets undone as fast as possible but if she larfs and says stoopid boy wy dont you look before you or suthin o that sort i just ooks on another tag to another button wen were a fumblin at the first one and so goes on till we get to be quite sociable over iti might almost say confidential  once or twice ive been the victim of misjudgment and got a heavy slap on the face from angelic hands that ought to ave known better but on the ole im willin to take my chance  not a bad notion remarked the slogger especially for a pretty little chap like you robin  right you are replied the other but you neednt try on the dodge yourself for it would never pay with a big ugly grampus like you villum  having thus run into a pleasant little chat the two waifs proceeded to compare notes in the course of which comparison the slogger gave an outline of his recent history  he had been engaged in several successful burglaries but had been caught in the act of pocketpicking for which offence he had spent some weeks in prison  while there a visitor had spoken to him very earnestly and advised him to try an honest life as being to say the least of it easier work than thieving  he had made the attempt  through the influence of the same prisonvisitor he had obtained a situation from which he had been advanced to the responsible position which he then held  and dyou know robin said the slogger i find that honesty pays pretty well and i means to stick to it  an i suppose said robin if it didnt pay pretty well youd cut it  of course i would returned the slogger with a look of surprise wots the use o stickin to a thing that dont pay  vell if thems your principles you aint got much to old on by my tulip said robin  an wot principles may you old on by my turnip asked the slogger  it would puzzle me rather to tell that returned robin specially talkin down to the level of my own toes on the top of a bus but ill tell you what villum if youll come to number 6 grovelly street shadwell square just back of hoboy crescent were my master lives on sunday next at seven in the evenin youll hear an see somethin asll open your eyes  ah a meetinouse said the slogger with a slight smile of contempt  musicalls and publics is meetinouses aint they  ah but they aint prayermeetin ouses rejoined the slogger  not so sure o that villum  theres a deal o prayer in such places sometimes an its well for the wisitors that their prayers aint always answered  but our meetinouse is for more than prayera deal more and theres my young missusa real angelcomes in and olds forth there every sunday evening to young fellers like you an me you just come an judge for yourself  no thankee returned the slogger  as he spoke a lady with a lapdog made powerful demonstrations with her umbrella  the bus stopped and the conductor attended to his duties while robin who really felt a strong desire to bring his old comrade under an influence which he knew was working a wonderful change in himself sat meditating sadly on the obstinacy of human nature  i say robin said the slogger on resuming his perch dyou know ive found traces o that young gal as you took such a interest in as runned away from the old ooman an was robbed by brassey an me  you dont mean that exclaimed robin eagerly  yes i do  shes in london i believe but i cant exactly say where i heard of her through salyou know sal who angs out at the vest end o potters lane  i expect to see sal in alf an hour so if youre comin back this way ill be at the black bull by two oclock and tell you all i can pump out of er  ill be there sharp said robin promptly an now pull up for i must take to my legs here  but i say robin if we do find that gal you wont split on me eh you wont tell er who i am or where i is  you wont wictimise your old friend  dyou take me for a informer demanded robin with an offended look  hall right cried the slogger giving the signal to drive on  robin sped quickly away executed his mission and returned to the black bull in a state of considerable excitement and strong hope  slidder was doomed to disappointment  he reached the black bull at two oclock precisely  vell my fair one he said addressing a waitingmaid who met him in the passage its good for sore eyes to see the likes o you in cloudy weather  dyou appen to know a young man of the name of sli mean villum bowls  yes i do mr imprence answered the girl  you couldnt introdooce me to him could you miss sunshine  no i couldnt because he isnt here and wont likely be back for two hours  this reply took all the humour out of robins tone and manner  he resolved however to wait for half an hour and went out to saunter in front of the hotel  half an hour passed then another then another and the boy was fain to leave the spot in despair  poor slidders temperament was sanguine  slight encouragement raised his hopes very high  failure depressed him proportionally and woefully low but to do him justice he never sorrowed long  in the present instance he left the black bull grinding his teeth  then he took to clanking his heels as he walked along in a way that drew forth the comments of several streetboys to whom in a spirit of liberality he returned considerably more than he received  then he began to mutter between his teeth his private opinion as to faithless persons in general and faithless villum alias the slogger in particular whose character he painted to himself in extremely sombre colours  after that a heavy thundershower having fallen and drenched him he walked recklessly and violently through every puddle in his path  this seemed to relieve his spirit for when he reached hoboy crescent he had recovered much of his wonted equanimity  the slogger was not however so faithless as his old friend imagined he had been at the black bull before two oclock but had been sent off by his employer with a note to a house at a considerable distance in such urgent haste that he had not time even to think of leaving a message for his friend  in these circumstances he resolved to clear his character by paying a visit on the following sunday to number 6 grovelly street shadwell square    chapter twelve  begins with love hope and joy and ends peculiarly  it may not perhaps surprise the reader to learn that after lilly blythes return to town i did not prosecute my studies with as much enthusiasm as before  in fact i divided my attentions pretty equally between lilly and chemistry  now i am not prone to become sentimentally talkative about my own affairs but as courtship and love and that sort of thing are undoubted and important elements in the chemistry of human affairs and as they influenced me and those around me to some extent i cannot avoid making reference to them but i promise the reader to do so only as far as appears necessary for the elucidation of my story  first then although i knew that my prospects of success as a partner of dr mctougall were most encouraging i felt that it would be foolish to think of marriage until my position was well established and my income adequate  i therefore strove with all my might to check the flow of my thoughts towards miss blythe  as well might i have striven to restrain the flow of niagara  true love cannot be stemmed  in my case however the proverb was utterly falsified for my true love did run smooth  more than that it ran fastvery fast indeed so much so that i was carried as it were on the summit of a rushing floodtide into the placid harbour of engagement  the anchorage in that harbour is with many people uncertain  with lilly and me it was not so  the groundtackle was good it had caught hold of a rock and held on  it happened thus  after many weeks of struggling on my part to keep out of miss blythes way and to prevent the state of my feelings from being observed by herstruggles which i afterwards found to my confusion had been quite obvious to heri found myself standing alone one sunday afternoon in the doctors drawingroom meditating on the joys of childhood as exemplified by thunderous blows on the floor above and piercing shouts of laughter  the children had been to church and were working off the steam accumulated there  suddenly there was a dead silence which i knew to be the result of a meal  the meal was i may add the union of a late dinner with an early tea  it was characteristic of sundays in the mctougall nursery  the thought of this union turned my mind into another channel  just then miss blythe entered  she looked so radiant that i forgot myself forgot my former struggles my good resolutionseverything except herselfand proposed on the spot  i was rejectedof course  more than that i was stunned  hope had told me many flattering tales  indeed i had felt so sure from many little symptoms that lilly had a strong regard for meto say the leastthat i was overwhelmed not only by my rejection but by the thought of my foolish selfassurance  i dont wonder that you look upon me as a presumptuous vain contemptible fellow said i in the bitterness of my soul  but i do not regard you in that light said lilly with a faint smile and then hesitatingly she looked down at the carpet  in what light do you regard me miss blythe said i recovering a little hope and speaking vehemently  really dr mellon you take me by surprise your mannerso abrupt so  oh never mind manner dear miss blythe said i seizing her hand and forcibly detaining it  you are the soul of truth tell me is there any hope for mecan you care for me  dr mellon she said drawing her hand firmly away i cannot should not reply  you do not know all thethe circumstances of my lifemy poverty my solitary condition in the worldmymy  miss blythe i exclaimed in desperation if you were as poor as a achurch rat as solitary asasadam before the advent of eve i would count it my chief joy and  hallo  mellon hi  i say where are you shouted the voice of the doctor at that moment from below stairs  heres dumps been in the laboratory and capsized some of the chemicals  coming sir  i shouted then tenderly though hurriedly to miss blythe you will let me resume this subject at  hallo look sharp from below  yes yes ill be down directlydear miss blythe if you only knew  why the dogs burning all overhelp me roared the doctor  miss blythe blushed and laughed  how could she help it  i hastily kissed her hand and fled from the room  that was the whole affair  there was not enough strictly speaking to form a ground of hope but somehow i knew that it was all right  in the laboratory i found dumps smoking and the doctor pouring water from the tap on his dishevelled body  he was not hurt and little damage was done but as i sat in my room talking to him that evening i could not help reproaching him with having been the means of breaking off one of the most important interviews of my life  however dumps i continued your good services far outweigh your wicked deeds and whatever you may do in the future i will never forget that you were the means of introducing me to that angel lilly blythe  the angel in question went that sunday evening at seven oclock as was her wont to a bible class which she had started for the instruction of some of the poor neglected boys and lads who idled about in the dreary back streets of our aristocratic neighbourhood  the boys had become so fond of her that they were eager to attend and usually assembled round the door of the classroom before the hour  my protege robin slidder was of course one of her warmest adherents he was standing that night apart from the other boys contemplating the proceedings of two combative sparrows which quarrelled over a crumb of bread on the pavement and had just come to the conclusion that men and sparrows had some qualities in common when he was attracted by a low whistle and looking up beheld the slogger peeping round a neighbouring corner  hallo  slogvillum i mean how are you  come along  vell i am glad to see you for dyou know arter you failed me that day at the black bull i have bin givin you a pretty bad character an callin you no end o bad names  is that what your angel teaches you robin  vell not exactly but youll hear wot she teaches for yourself tonight i ope  come im right glad to see you villum  what was it that prevented you that day eh  when the slogger had explained and cleared his character robin asked him eagerly if he had ascertained anything further about the girl whom he and brassey had robbed  of course i have said the slogger and its a curious suckumstance that er place of abodeso sally saysis in the vest end not wery far from here  she gave me the street and the name but wasnt quite sure of the number  vell come along lets hear all about it said robin impatiently  wy wots all your urry returned the slogger slowly i aint goin away till ive heerd wot your angels got to say you know  besides i must go arter your meetings over an watch the ouse till i see the gal an make sure that its her for sally may have bin mistook you know  you dont know her name do you asked robin it wasnt edie willis now was it  ow should i know er name answered the slogger  dyou think i stopped to inquire wen i elped to relieve er of er propity  ah i suppose not  vell i suppose youve no objection to my goin to watch along wi you  none wotsomever ony remember if it do turn out to be er you wont betray me  honour bright  she may be revengeful you know an might ave me took up if she got old of me  robin slidder faithfully and earnestly pledged himself  while he was speaking there was a general movement among the lads and boys towards the classroom for miss blythe was seen coming towards them  the two friends moved with the rest  just as he was about to enter the door robin missed his companion and looking back saw him bending down and holding his sides as if in pain  wots wrong now he inquired returning to him  oh  im took so bad said the slogger looking very red and rubbing himself a old complaint as i thought i was cured of  oh dear youll ave to excuge me robin  ill go an take a turn an come in if i gits better  if not ill meet you round the corner arter its over  so saying the slogger turning round walked quickly away and his little friend entered the classroom in a state of mind pendulating between disgust and despair for he had no expectation of seeing the slippery slogger again that night  when the meeting was over miss blythe returned home  i saw her enter the library  no one else was there i knew  the gas had not yet been lighted and only a faint flicker from the fire illumined the room unable to bear the state of uncertainty under which my mind still laboured i resolved to make assurance doubly sure or quit the house and englandfor ever  i spare the reader the details  suffice it to say that after much entreaty i got her to admit that she loved me but she refused to accept me until she had told me her whole history  then im sure of you now said i in triumph for be your history what it may ill never give you up dearest lilly  dont call me lilly she said in a low quiet tone it is only a pet name which the little ones here gave me on my first coming to them call me edith  i will said i with enthusiasm a far more beautiful name  ill  hallo hi  mellon are you there  for the second time that day dr mctougall interrupted me but i was proof against annoyance now  yes i am here i shouted running downstairs  surely dumps is not burning himself againeh  oh no returned my friend with a laughonly a telegram  however its important enough to require prompt attention  the gordons in bingley manoryou know themtelegraph me to run down immediately old lady ill  now it unfortunately happens that i have an engagement this evening which positively cannot be put off so i must send you besides i know well enough what it is  theyre easily alarmed and im convinced it is just the old story  however the summons must be obeyed  you will go for me  the train starts in half an hour  you will have plenty of time to catch it if you make haste  youll have to stay all night  no return train till tomorrow being an outoftheway place  there off with you  put the telegram in your pocket for the address  so saying the doctor put on his hat and left the house  summoning robin slidder i bade him pack a few things into my travellingbag while i wrote a note  when he had finished he told me of his interview with the slogger  i was greatly interested and asked if he had gone to see his friend after the meeting  no sir i didnt  i meant to but miss blythe wanted me to walk ome with er it was so dark an wen i went back he had gone  pity robina great pity said i hastily strapping up my bag but no doubt hell come here again to see younow dont forget to take over that parcel of tea and sugar etcetera to mrs willis  go as soon as you can  saying this i left the house  the new residence of the old woman being now so near to hoboy crescent the parcel was soon delivered and robin officiated at the opening of it also at the preparing and consuming of some of its contents  of course he chatted vigorously as was his wont but was particularly careful to make not the most distant allusion to the slogger or his reports being anxious not to arouse her hopes until he should have some evidence that they were on a true scent  indeed he was so fearful of letting slip some word or remark on the subject and thereby awakening suspicion and giving needless pain that he abstained from all reference to the meeting of that evening and launched out instead into wonderful and puzzling theological speculations of which he was very fond  meanwhile i was carried swiftly into the country  the lamp in my carriage was too dim to permit of reading i therefore wrapped myself in my rug and indulged in pleasant meditations  it was past midnight when i arrived at the station for bingley manor where i found a gig awaiting me  a sharp drive of half an hour and i was at the mansion door  dr mctougall was right  there was little the matter with old mrs gordon but the family were nervous and richhence my visit  i did what was necessary for the patient comforted the rest by my presence had a sound nights rest an early breakfast a pleasant drive in the fresh frosty air and a brief wait of five minutes when the punctual train came up  there is something inexpressibly delightful in a ride on a sharp frosty morning in an express train  i have always felt a wild bounding sensation of joy in rapid motion  the pace at which we went that morning was exceptionally charming  had i known that the enginedriver was intoxicated perhaps it might not have been quite so exhilarating but i did not know that  i sat comfortably in my corner thinking of edith and gazing with placid benignity at the frosted trees and bushes which sparkled in the red wintry sun  yes it was a glorious ride  i never had a better  the part of the country through which we passed was lovely  one can always gaze comfortably at the distant landscape from a railway carriage however great the speed  as for the immediate foreground it reminded me of a racehouses trees farms towns villages hamlets horses sheep cattle poultry hayricks brickfields were among the competitors in that race  they rushed in mad confusion to the rear  i exulted in the pace  not so a stout elderly gentleman in the opposite corner who evidently disliked itso true is it that one mans meat is anothers poison  there is no reason to fear sir said i with a smile by way of reassuring him  this is a most excellently managed lineone never hears of accidents on it  too fast just now anyhow returned the elderly gentleman testily  just then the whistle was heard sounding violently  that is a sign of safety said i shows that they are on the alert  a severe application of the brakes caused me to stop abruptly and the elderly man to seize the arms of his seat with a convulsive grasp  suddenly there was a mighty crash  the sensations in my mind that followed were suggestive of cannons rockets bombs fireworks serpents shootingstars and tumbling debris  thenall was dark and silent as the grave    chapter thirteen  a wonderful discovery  slowly recovering consciousness i found myself lying on the floor of a waitingroom with a gentleman bending over me  instantly recollecting what had occurred i endeavoured to start up but was obliged to fall back again  you must lie quiet sir said the gentleman  youre not much hurt we will send you on if you choose by the train that is expected in a few minutes  is the elderly gentleman safe  i asked eagerly  which elderly gentleman  there were several in the train but none are injured i believe though some are much shaken  nobody has been killed  it has been quite a miraculous escape  mercifulcall it merciful my dear sir said i looking upwards and thanking god with all my heart for sparing my life  two days after that i lay on the drawingroom sofa in hoboy crescent mr and mrs mctougall had gone out  so had the children the forenoon being fine  edith had remained at home for reasons which she did not see fit to divulge  she sat beside me with one of her hands in mine it was all arranged between us by that time  edith said i after a short pause in our conversation i have long wanted to tell you about a dear little old lady with whom robin slidder and i have had much to do  shes one of my poor patients whom i have not mentioned to you before but ive heard something about her lately which makes me wish to ask your adviceperhaps your aidin a rather curious search which ive been engaged in for a long time past  i will go for my work john and you shall tell me all about it she replied rising  i shall be five or ten minutes in preparing it  can you wait patiently  well ill try though of course it will be like a separation of five or ten years but dumps and i will solace each other in your absence by the way touch the bell as you pass  i should like to see robin not having had a talk with him since the accident  when robin appeared i asked him if he had seen the slogger  no sir i avent replied robin with a somewhat cross look  that there slogger has played me false these two times  leastwise though he couldnt elp it the fust time hes got to clear isself about the second  you know where the slogger lives dont you  i asked  oh yes but its a long long way off an i durstnt go without leave an since you was blowed up i the train ive scarce ad a word with the doctorhes bin that busy through avin your patients on is ands as well as is own  well robin i give you leave to go  be off within this very hour and see that you bring me back some good news  now that we have reason to believe the poor girl is in london perhaps near us i cannot rest until we find heror prove the scent to have been a false one  away with you  as the boy went out edith came back with her work basket  ive been thinking said i as she sat down on a stool beside me that before beginning my story it would be well that you should unburden your dear little heart of that family secret of yours which you thought at first was a sufficient bar to our union  but before you begin let me solemnly assure you that your revelations whatever they are will utterly fail to move me  though you should declare yourself to be the daughter of a thief a costermonger or a chimpanzee monkey though you should profess yourself to have been a charwoman a foundling a billingsgate fishwoman or a female mountebankmy feelings and resolves will remain the same  sufficient for me to know that you are you and that you are minethere go on  truly then if such be your feelings there is no need of my going on or even beginning she replied with a smile and yet with a touch of sadness in her tone which made me grasp her hand  ah edith  i did not mean to hurt you by my jesting and yet the spirit of what i say is trueabsolutely true  you did not hurt me john you merely brought to my remembrance my great sorrow and  your great sorrow  i exclaimed in surprise gazing at her smooth young face  yes my great sorrow and i was going to add my loss  but you shall hear  i have no family mystery to unfold  all that i wished you to know on that head was that i am without family altogether  all are dead  i have no relation on earthnot one  she said this with such deep pathos while tears filled her eyes that i could not have uttered a word of comfort to save my life  and she continued i am absolutely penniless  these two points at first made me repel youat least until i had explained them to you now that you look upon them as such trifles i need say no more  but the loss to which i have referred is i fear irreparable  you wont think me selfish or tiresome if i go back to an early period of my history  selfish tiresome  i repeated oh edith  well then many years ago my father and mother lived by the seashore not far from yarmouth  they were poor  my father gave lessons in french my mother taught music  but they earned sufficient to support themselves and my grandmother and me in comfort  we were a very happy family for we all loved god and tried to follow in the footsteps of jesus  i gave them indeed a great deal of trouble at first but he overcame my stubborn heart at last and then there was nothing to mar the happiness of our lives  but sickness came  my father died  my mother tried to struggle on for a time but could not earn enough i tried to help her by teaching but had myself need of being taught  at last we changed our residence in hopes of getting more remunerative employment but in this we failed  then my mother fell sick and died  she stopped at this point  oh edith this makes you doubly dear said i drawing her nearer to me  in a few minutes she continued  being left alone now with my grandmother i resolved to go to london and try to find employment in the great city  we had not been long here and i had not yet obtained employment when an extraordinary event occurred which has ever since embittered my life  i went out for a walk one day and was robbed  how strange  i exclaimed half rising from the sofa  what a curious coincidence  what  how  what do you mean she asked looking at me in surprise  never mind just now  when i come to tell you my story you will understand  there is a robbery of a young girl in it toogo on  well then as i said i was robbed by a man and a boy  i had dear little pompey with me at the time and that is the way i came to lose him  but the terrible thing was that an accident befell me just after i was robbed and i never saw my darling grandmother again  coincidence  i exclaimed starting up as a sudden thought was forced upon my mind and my heart began to beat violently this is more than a coincidence and yetit cannot bepooh impossible ridiculous  my mind is wandering  i sank back somewhat exhausted for i had been considerably weakened by my accident  edith was greatly alarmed at my words and looks and blamed herself for having talked too much to me in my comparatively weak condition  no you have not talked too much to me  you cannot do that dear edie i said  it was now her turn to look bewildered  edie she echoed  whywhy do you call me edie  i covered my eyes with my hand that she might not see their expression  there can be no doubt now i thought but why that name of blythe then aloud  it is a pretty contraction for edith is it not  dont you like it  like it  yes  oh how much  butbut  well edie i said laying powerful restraint on myself and looking her calmly in the face you must bear with me tonight  you know that weakness sometimes causes men to act unaccountably  forgive me for interrupting you  i wont do it again as the naughty boys saygo on dear with your story  i once more covered my eyes with my hand as if to shade them from the light and listened though i could scarcely conceal my agitation  the name of edie she continued is that by which my darling granny always called me and it sounded so familiaryet so strangecoming from your lips  but after all it is a natural abbreviation  well as i said an accident befell me  i had burst away from the thieves in a state of wild horror and was attempting to rush across a crowded thoroughfare when a cab knocked me down  i felt a sharp pang of pain heard a loud shout and then all was dark  on recovering i found myself lying in one of the beds of a hospital my collarbone had been broken and i was very feverishscarcely understood where i was and felt a dull sense of oppression on my brain they spoke to me and asked my name  i dont remember distinctly how i pronounced it but i recollect being somewhat amused at their misunderstanding what i said and calling me miss eva bright  i felt too ill to correct them at the time and afterwards became so accustomed to evafor i was a very long time therethat i did not think it worth while to correct the mistake  this was very foolish and unfortunate for long afterwards when i began to get well enough to think coherently and sent them to let granny know where i was they of course went with the name of eva bright  it was very stupid no doubt but i was so weak and listless after my long and severe illness that this never once occurred to me  as it turned out however there would have been no difference in the result for my darling had left her lodging and gone no one knew where  this terrible news brought on a relapse and for many weeks i believe my life hung on a thread  but that thread was in the hand of god and i had no fear  what is the name edie of the grandmother you have lost  i asked in a low tremulous voice  willisbutwhy do you start so  now i am quite sure you have been more severely hurt than you imagine and that my talking so much is not good for you  noedieno  go on i said firmly  i have little more to tell she continued  dear dr mctougall had attended me in the hospital and took a fancy to me  when i was well enough to leave he took me home to be governess to his children  but my situation has been an absolute sinecure as yet for he says i am not strong enough to work and wont let me do anything  it was not till after i had left the hospital that i told my kind friend the mistake that had been made about my name and about my lost grandmother  he has been very kind about that and assisted me greatly at first in my search for her  but there are so manyso many people of the name of willis in londonold ladies too  we called together on so many that he got tired of it at last  of course i wrote to various people at york and to the place where we had lived before going there but nothing came of it and nowmy hopes have long ago died outthat is to say almostbut i still continue to make inquiries  she paused here for some time and i did not move or speak being so stunned by my discovery that i knew not what to say and feared to reveal the truth to edith too suddenly  then i knew by the gentle way in which she moved that she thought i had fallen asleep  i was glad of this and remained quietly thinking  there was no doubt now in my mind that edie blythe was this lost granddaughter of old mrs willis but the name still remained an insoluble mystery  edie said i abruptly is your name blythe  of course it is she said in startled surprise why should you doubt it  i dont doubt it said i but im sorely puzzled  why is it not willis  why exclaimed edie with a little laugh because i am the daughter of granny williss daughternot of her son  my fathers name was blythe  the simplicity of this explanation and my gross stupidity in quietly assuming from the beginning as a matter of course that the lost edies name was the same as her grandmothers burst upon me in its full force the delusion had been naturally perpetuated by mrs willis never speaking of her lost darling except by her christian name  for a few seconds i was silent then i exploded in almost an hysterical fit of laughter in the midst of which i was interrupted by the sudden entrance of my doggie who had returned from a walk with robin and began to gambol round his mistress as if he had not seen her for years  oh sir  i say  ive diskivered all about  little slidder had rushed excitedly into the room but stopped abruptly on observing miss blythe who was looking from him to me with intense surprise  before another word could be said a servant entered  please miss blythe doctor mctougall wishes to see you in his study  she left us at once  now robin said i with emphasis sit down on that chair opposite me and lets hear all about it  the excited boy obeyed and dumps leaping on another chair beside him sat down to listen with ears erect as if he knew what was coming  oh sir you neversuch a go began robin rubbing his hands together slowly as he spoke  the slogger he twigged er at once  youll open your eyes so wide that youll never git em shut again wen you hears no i never did see such a lark  edies found  ive seen her  she aint the queenoh no nor yet one o the queens dartersby no means nor yet a duchessoh dear no though shes like one  who dye think she is  but youll never guess  ill try said i with a quiet smile for i had subdued myself by that time  try away thenwho  miss edith blythe  on hearing this little slidders eyes began to open and glisten till they outshone his own buttons  whyhoweverdid you come to guess it gasped the boy on recovering himself  i did not guess it i found it out  do you suppose that nobody can find out things except sloggers and pages in buttons  oh sir do tell entreated the boy  i did tell and after we had each told all that we knew we mentally hugged ourselves and grew so facetious over it that we began to address dumps personally to that intelligent creatures intense satisfaction  now robin said i we must break this very cautiously to the old lady and miss blythe  oh in coursewery cautiously assented the urchin with inconceivable earnestness  well then off you go and fetch my greatcoat  well go visit mrs willis at once  at vunce echoed robin as he ran out of the room with blazing cheeks and sparkling eyes  lilly said dr mctougall as edith entered his consultingroom  im just off to see a patient who is very ill and there is another who is not quite so ill but who also wants to see me  ill send you to the latter as my female assistant if you will go  her complaint is chiefly mental  in fact she needs comfort more than physic and i know of no one who is comparable to you in that line  can you go  certainly with pleasure  ill go at once  her name said the doctor is willisby the way that reminds me of your loss dear girl he continued in a lower tone as he gently took her hand but i would not again arouse your hopes  you know how many old women of this name we have seen without finding her  yes i know too well returned poor edith while the tears gathered in her eyes  i have long ago given up all hope  but notwithstanding her statement edith had not quite given way to despair  in spite of herself her heart fluttered a little as she sped on this mission to the abode of another old mrs willis    chapter fourteen  the last  when robin and i reached the abode of our old friendin a state let me add of almost irrepressible excitementwe found her seated in the old armchair by the window gazing sadly out on the prospect  it was not now the prospect of red brick and waterspout with a remote distance of chimneycans and cats which had crushed the old ladys spirit in other daysby no means  there was a picturesque little court with an old pump in the centre to awaken the fancy and frequent visits from more or less diabolical streetboys to excite the imagination  beyond that there was the mews in which a lively scene of variance between horses and men was enacted from morning till nighta scene which derived much additional charm from the fact that mrs willis being shortsighted formed fearfully incorrect estimates of men and beasts and things in general  well granny how are you said i seating myself on a stool beside her and thinking how i should begin  pretty griggyeh inquired little slidder  ah there you are my dear boys said the old lady who had latterly got to look upon me and my protege as brothers  you are always sure to come whoever fails me  has any one failed you today granny  i asked  yes dr mctougall has she replied as petulantly as it was possible for her to speak  ive been feeling very low and weak today and sent for him but i suppose he thinks its only imagination  well well perhaps it is she added after a pause and with a little sigh  im very foolish no doubt  no granny said i youre not foolishcontrariwise wery much the reverse interrupted slidderand im glad that i chanced to come in because perhaps i may be able to prescribe for you as well as he  better dear boy betterthats it cheer up from slidderand it always does me a world of good to see your handsome face  well granny said i with a flutter at my heart as i looked up at her thin careworn face and began to break the ice with caution ive comeitheres a little piece ofof  now then dig in the spurs doctor an go at itneck or nuffin murmured my impatient companion  what are you saying robin asked mrs willis with a slightly anxious look  theres nothing wrong i hope  no no nothing wrong granny said i hastening to the point very much the reverse  butbutyou heard of my accident of course  i said suddenly losing heart and beating about the bush  stuck again murmured slidder in a tone of disgust  yes yes i heard of it  you dont mean to say that youre getting worse said the old lady with increasing anxiety  oh no  im bettermuch better  indeed i dont think i ever felt so well in my life and ive just heard a piece of good news which im quite sure will make you very gladvery glad indeed  go it sir  another burst like that and youll be clear out o the wood murmured slidder  in fact said i as a sudden thought struck im going to be married  whew you never told me that exclaimed slidder with widening eyes  will you be quiet robin said i rather sternly how can i get over this very difficult matter if you go on interrupting me so  mums the word returned the boy folding his hands and assuming a look of ridiculous solemnity  at that moment we heard a noise of pattering feet on the landing outside  the door which had not been properly closed burst open and my doggie came into the room all of a heap  after a brief moment lost in apparently searching for his hindlegs he began to dance and frisk about the room as if all his limbs were whalebone and his spirit quicksilver  oh theres that dog again  put it out put it out cried mrs willis gathering her old skirts around her feet  get out dumps how dare you come here sir without leave  i gave him leave said a sweet voice in the passage  next moment a sweeter face was smiling upon me as edith entered the room  there was a feeble cry at the window  i observed that the sweet smile vanished and a deadly pallor overspread ediths face while her eyes gazed with eager surprise at the old lady for a few seconds  mrs willis sat with answering gaze and outstretched arms  edie  granny was all that either could gasp but there was no need for morethe lost ones were mutually found  with an indescribable cry of joy edith sprang forward fell on her knees and enfolded granny in her arms  ere you are doctor whispered robin touching me on the elbow and presenting a tumbler of water  how  what  shell need it doctor  i knows her well an its the ony thing as does her good wen shes took bad  slidder was right  the shock of joy was almost too much for the old lady  she leaned heavily on her granddaughters neck and if i had not caught her both must have fallen to the ground  we lifted her gently into bed and in a few minutes she recovered  for some time she lay perfectly still  edith reclining on the lowly couch rested her fair young cheek on the withered old one  presently mrs willis moved and edith sat up  john said the former to me looking at the latter this is my edie thanks be to the lord  yes granny i know it and shes my edie too  a surprised and troubled look came on her old face  she evidently was pained to think that i could jest at such a moment  i hastened to relieve her  it is the plain and happy truth that i tell you granny  edith is engaged to marry meis it not so  i turned towards the dear girl who silently put one of her hands in mine  old mrs willis spoke no word but i could see that her soul was full of joy  i chanced to glance at robin and observed that that waif had retired to the window and was absolutely wiping his eyes while dumps sat observant in the middle of the room evidently much surprised at but not much pleased with the sudden calm which had succeeded the outburst  come robin said i rising i think that you and i will leave them goodbye granny and edie i shall soon see you again  i paused at the door and looked back  come dumps come  my doggie wagged his scrumpy tail cocked his expressive ears and glanced from me to his mistress but did not rise  pompey prefers to remain with me said edie let him stay  punch is a wise dog observed robin as we descended the stairs together but you dont ought to let your spirits go down sir he added with a profoundly sagacious glance cause of course he cant elp isself now  hell ave to stick to you wotever appensan to me too  i understood the meaning of his last words and could not help smiling at the presumptuous certainty with which he assumed that he was going to follow my fortunes  is it needful to say that when i mentioned what had occurred to dr mctougall that amiable little man opened his eyes to their widest  you young dog he exclaimed was it grateful in you to repay all my kindness by robbing me in this sly manner of my governessnay i may say of my daughter for i have long ago considered her such and adopted her in my heart  it was not done slily i assure you said i indeed i fought against the catastrophe with all my mightbut ii could not help it at last it came upon me as it were unexpectedlytook me by surprise  humph ejaculated the doctor  besides i added you can scarcely call it robbery for are not you and i united as partners so that instead of robbing you i have in reality created another bond of union between you and edie  hm said the doctor  moreover i continued it happens most opportunely just now that the house opposite this one is to let  it is a much smaller and lowerrented house than this and admirably suited for a very small family so that if i secure it we will scarcely i may say have to quit your roof  ah to be sure returned the doctor falling in with my humour we will have the pleasure of overlooking and criticising each other and our respective households  we may sit at the windows and converse across the street in fine weather or flatten our noses on the glass and make faces at each other when the weather is bad  besides we can have a tunnel cut under the street and thus have subterranean communication at any time of the day or nightand what a charming place that would be for the children to romp in  of course we would require to have it made of bricks or castiron to prevent the rats connecting it with the sewers but  a breeze of pattering feet overhead induced the doctor to pause  it increased to a gale on the staircase to a tempest in the lobby  the door was burst open and jack and harry and job and jenny and dolly with blazing cheeks and eyes tumbled tumultuously into the room  oh papa screamed harry lillys been out an found her mother  no its notits her ganmuver shrieked dolly  yes an dr mellons going to marry her cried jenny  whothe grandmother asked the doctor with a surprised look  nolilly they all cried with a shout of laughter which jack checked by stoutly asserting that it was her greatgrandmother that lilly had found  this drew an emphatic no its not from job and a firmly reiterated assertion that it was only her ganmuver from dolly  but robin said so cried jack  no he didnt said job  yes he did cried harry  robin said shes found er ganmuver said dolly  ill go an ask him cried jenny and turning round she rushed out of the room  the others faced about as one child and the tempest swept back into the lobby moderated to a gale on the staircase and was reduced to a breezeafterwards to a temporary calmoverhead  before it burst forth again the doctor and i had put on our hats and left the house  from that date forward for many weeks the number of lost grandmothers that were found in the mctougall nursery surpasses belief  they were discovered in all sorts of places and in all imaginable circumstances under beds tables upturned baths and basinstands in closets trunks and cupboards and always in a condition of woeful weakness and melancholy destitution  the part of grandmother was invariably assigned to dolly because although the youngest of the group that little creature possessed a power of acting and of selfcontrol which none of the others could equal  at first they were careful to keep as close to the original event as possible but after a time thirsting for variety they became lax and the grandmothers were found not only by granddaughters but by daughters and cousins and nieces and nephews but the play never varied in the points of extreme poverty and woe because dolly refused with invincible determination to change or modify her part  after a time they varied the performance with a wedding in which innumerable dr mellons were united to endless lilly blythes but after the real wedding took place and the cake had been utterly consumed they returned to their first lovelost and found as they termed it or the ganmuvers play  so in course of time the house over the way was actually taken and furnished  edie was installed therein as empress i as her devoted slavewhen not otherwise engaged  and to say truth even when i was otherwise engaged i always managed to leave my heart at home anatomists may perhaps be puzzled by this statement  if solet them be puzzled  ganmuver was also installed as queendowager in a suite of apartments consisting of one room and a closet  it was not in dr mctougalls nursery alone that the game of lost and found was played  in a little schoolroom not far distant from our abode that game was played by edieassisted by robin slidder and myselfwith considerable success  robin crossed the street to mecame over as it werewith edith the conqueror and our doggie and afterwards became a most valuable ally in searching for drawing forth tempting out and gathering in the lost he and i sought for them in some of the lowest slums of london  robins knowledge of their haunts and ways and his persuasive voice had influence where none but himselfor some one like himcould have made any impression  we tempted them to our little hall with occasional feasts in which buns oranges raisins gingerbread and tea played prominent parts and when we had gathered them in edith came to them like an angel of light and preached to them the gospel of jesus at once by example tone look and word  among others who came to our little social meetings was the slogger that unpunished criminal not only launched with apparently heart and soul into the good cause but he was the means of inducing many others to come and when in after years his old comrade mr brassey returned from his enforced residence in foreign parts the slogger sought for and found him and stuck to him with the pertinacity of his bulldog nature until he fairly brought him in  thus that good work went on with us  thus it is going on at the present time in many many parts of our favoured land and thus it will go on with gods blessing until his people shall all be gathered into the fold of the good shepherduntil that day when the puzzlements and bewilderments of this incomprehensible life shall be cleared up when we shall be enabled to understand why man has been so long permitted to dwell in the midst of conflicting good and evil and why he has been required to live on earth by faith and not by sight trusting in the unquestionable goodness and wisdom of him who is our life and our light  in all our work whether temporal or spiritual we had the help and powerful sympathy of our friend dr mctougall and his family also of his friend dobson the city man who was a strong man in more ways than one and a zealous champion of righteousnessor rightness as he was fond of calling it in contradistinction to wrongness  i meant to let fall the curtain at this point but something which i cannot explain induces me to keep it up a few minutes longer in order to tell you that the little mctougalls grew up to be splendid men and women that dear old granny is still alive and well insomuch that she bids fair to become a serene centenarian that my sweet edie is now fair fat and forty that i am grey and hearty that dumps is greyer and so fat as well as stiff that he wags his ridiculous tail with the utmost difficulty that brassey and the slogger have gone into partnership in the greengrocery line round the corner and that robin slidder is no longer a boy but has become a man and a butler  he is still in our service and declares that he will never leave it  my firm conviction is that he will keep his word as long as he can  so now amiable reader with regret and the best of wishes we make our final bowwowand    bid you goodbye   my doggie and i  the end
