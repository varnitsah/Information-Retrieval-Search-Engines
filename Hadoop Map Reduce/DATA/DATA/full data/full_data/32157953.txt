32157953	the waif woman   by robert louis stevenson  london chatto  windus 1916  first edition october 1916 second edition october 1916  this unpublished story preserved among mrs stevensons papers is mentioned by mr balfour in his life of stevenson  writing of the fables which stevenson began before he had left england and attacked again and from time to time added to their number in 1893 mr balfour says the reference to odin fable xvii perhaps is due to his reading of the sagas which led him to attempt a tale in the same style called the waif woman     the waif woman a cuefrom a saga   this is a tale of iceland the isle of stories and of a thing that befell in the year of the coming there of christianity  in the spring of that year a ship sailed from the south isles to traffic and fell becalmed inside snowfellness  the winds had speeded her she was the first comer of the year and the fishers drew alongside to hear the news of the south and eager folk put out in boats to see the merchandise and make prices  from the doors of the hall on frodis water the house folk saw the ship becalmed and the boats about her coming and going and the merchants from the ship could see the smoke go up and the men and women trooping to their meals in the hall  the goodman of that house was called finnward keelfarer and his wife aud the lightminded and they had a son eyolf a likely boy and a daughter asdis a slip of a maid  finnward was welltodo in his affairs he kept open house and had good friends  but aud his wife was not so much considered her mind was set on trifles on bright clothing and the admiration of men and the envy of women and it was thought she was not always so circumspect in her bearing as she might have been but nothing to hurt  on the evening of the second day men came to the house from sea  they told of the merchandise in the ship which was well enough and to be had at easy rates and of a waif woman that sailed in her no one could tell why and had chests of clothes beyond comparison fine coloured stuffs finely woven the best that ever came into that island and gewgaws for a queen  at the hearing of that auds eyes began to glisten  she went early to bed and the day was not yet red before she was on the beach had a boat launched and was pulling to the ship  by the way she looked closely at all boats but there was no woman in any and at that she was better pleased for she had no fear of the men  when they came to the ship boats were there already and the merchants and the shore folk sat and jested and chaffered in the stern  but in the fore part of the ship the woman sat alone and looked before her sourly at the sea  they called her thorgunna  she was as tall as a man and high in flesh a buxom wife to look at  her hair was of the dark red time had not changed it  her face was dark the cheeks full and the brow smooth  some of the merchants told that she was sixty years of age and others laughed and said she was but forty but they spoke of her in whispers for they seemed to think that she was ill to deal with and not more than ordinary canny  aud went to where she sat and made her welcome to iceland  thorgunna did the honours of the ship  so for a while they carried it on praising and watching each other in the way of women  but aud was a little vessel to contain a great longing and presently the cry of her heart came out of her  the folk say says she you have the finest womens things that ever came to iceland and as she spoke her eyes grew big  it would be strange if i had not quoth thorgunna  queens have no finer  so aud begged that she might see them  thorgunna looked on her askance  truly said she the things are for no use but to be shown  so she fetched a chest and opened it  here was a cloak of the rare scarlet laid upon with silver beautiful beyond belief hard by was a silver brooch of basket work that was wrought as fine as any shell and was as broad as the face of the full moon and aud saw the clothes lying folded in the chest of all the colours of the day and fire and precious gems and her heart burned with envy  so because she had so huge a mind to buy she began to make light of the merchandise  they are good enough things says she though i have better in my chest at home  it is a good enough cloak and i am in need of a new cloak  at that she fingered the scarlet and the touch of the fine stuff went to her mind like singing  come says she if it were only for your civility in showing it what will you have for your cloak  woman said thorgunna i am no merchant  and she closed the chest and locked it like one angry  then aud fell to protesting and caressing her  that was auds practice for she thought if she hugged and kissed a person none could say her nay next she went to flattery said she knew the things were too noble for the like of herthey were made for a stately beautiful woman like thorgunna and at that she kissed her again and thorgunna seemed a little pleased  and now aud pled poverty and begged for the cloak in a gift and now she vaunted the wealth of her goodman and offered ounces and ounces of fine silver the price of three mens lives  thorgunna smiled but it was a grim smile and still she shook her head  at last aud wrought herself into extremity and wept  i would give my soul for it she cried  fool said thorgunna  but there have been fools before you  and a little after she said this let us be done with beseeching  the things are mine  i was a fool to show you them but where is their use unless we show them  mine they are and mine they shall be till i die  i have paid for them dear enough said she  aud saw it was of no avail so she dried her tears and asked thorgunna about her voyage and made believe to listen while she plotted in her little mind  thorgunna she asked presently do you count kin with any folk in iceland  i count kin with none replied thorgunna  my kin is of the greatest but i have not been always lucky so i say the less  so that you have no house to pass the time in till the ship return cries aud  dear thorgunna you must come and live with us  my goodman is rich his hand and his house are open and i will cherish you like a daughter  at that thorgunna smiled on the one side but her soul laughed within her at the womans shallowness  i will pay her for that word daughter she thought and she smiled again  i will live with you gladly says she for your house has a good name and i have seen the smoke of your kitchen from the ship  but one thing you shall understand  i make no presents i give nothing where i gonot a rag and not an ounce  where i stay i work for my upkeep and as i am strong as a man and hardy as an ox they that have had the keeping of me were the better pleased  it was a hard job for aud to keep her countenance for she was like to have wept  and yet she felt it would be unseemly to eat her invitation and like a shallow woman and one that had always led her husband by the nose she told herself she would find some means to cajole thorgunna and come by her purpose after all  so she put a good face on the thing had thorgunna into the boat her and her two great chests and brought her home with her to the hall by the beach  all the way in she made much of the wife and when they were arrived gave her a locked bedplace in the hall where was a bed a table and a stool and space for the two chests  this shall be yours while you stay here said aud  and she attended on her guest  now thorgunna opened the second chest and took out her beddingsheets of english linen the like of it never seen a cover of quilted silk and curtains of purple wrought with silver  at the sight of these aud was like one distracted greed blinded her mind the cry rose strong in her throat it must out  what will you sell your bedding for she cried and her cheeks were hot  thorgunna looked upon her with a dusky countenance  truly you are a courteous hostess said she but i will not sleep on straw for your amusement  at that auds two ears grew hot as her cheeks and she took thorgunna at her word and left her from that time in peace  the woman was as good as her spoken word  inside the house and out she wrought like three and all that she put her hand to was well done  when she milked the cows yielded beyond custom when she made hay it was always dry weather when she took her turn at the cooking the folk licked their spoons  her manners when she pleased were outside imitation like one that had sat with kings in their high buildings  it seemed she was pious too and the day never passed but she was in the church there praying  the rest was not so well  she was of few words and never one about her kin and fortunes  gloom sat on her brow and she was ill to cross  behind her back they gave her the name of the waif woman or the wind wife to her face it must always be thorgunna  and if any of the young men called her mother she would speak no more that day but sit apart in the hall and mutter with her lips  this is a queer piece of goods that we have gotten says finnward keelfarer i wish we get no harm by her  but the good wifes pleasure must be done said he which was his common word  when she was at work thorgunna wore the rudest of plain clothes though ever clean as a cat but at night in the hall she was more dainty for she loved to be admired  no doubt she made herself look well and many thought she was a comely woman still and to those she was always favourable and full of pleasant speech  but the more that some pleased her it was thought by good judges that they pleased aud the less  when midsummer was past a company of young men upon a journey came to the house by frodis water  that was always a great day for aud when there were gallants at table and what made this day the greater alf of the fells was in the company and she thought alf fancied her  so be sure aud wore her best  but when thorgunna came from the bedplace she was arrayed like any queen and the broad brooch was in her bosom  all night in the hall these women strove with each other and the little maid asdis looked on and was ashamed and knew not why  but thorgunna pleased beyond all she told of strange things that had befallen in the world when she pleased she had the cue to laughter she sang and her voice was full and her songs new in that island and whenever she turned the eyes shone in her face and the brooch glittered at her bosom  so that the young men forgot the word of the merchants as to the womans age and their looks followed her all night  aud was sick with envy  sleep fled her her husband slept but she sat upright beside him in the bed and gnawed her fingers  now she began to hate thorgunna and the glittering of the great brooch stood before her in the dark  sure she thought it must be the glamour of that brooch  she is not so fair as i she is as old as the dead in the hillside and as for her wit and her songs it is little i think of them  up she got at that took a light from the embers and came to her guests bedplace  the door was locked but aud had a masterkey and could go in  inside the chests were open and in the top of one the light of her taper shone upon the glittering of the brooch  as a dog snatches food she snatched it and turned to the bed  thorgunna lay on her side it was to be thought she slept but she talked the while to herself and her lips moved  it seemed her years returned to her in slumber for her face was grey and her brow knotted and the open eyes of her stared in the eyes of aud  the heart of the foolish woman died in her bosom but her greed was the stronger and she fled with that which she had stolen  when she was back in bed the word of thorgunna came to her mind that these things were for no use but to be shown  here she had the brooch and the shame of it and might not wear it  so all night she quaked with the fear of discovery and wept tears of rage that she should have sinned in vain  day came and aud must rise but she went about the house like a crazy woman  she saw the eyes of asdis rest on her strangely and at that she beat the maid  she scolded the house folk and by her way of it nothing was done aright  first she was loving to her husband and made much of him thinking to be on his good side when trouble came  then she took a better way picked a feud with him and railed on the poor man till his ears rang so that he might be in the wrong beforehand  the brooch she hid without in the side of a hayrick  all this while thorgunna lay in the bedplace which was not her way for by custom she was early astir  at last she came forth and there was that in her face that made all the house look one at the other and the heart of aud to be straitened  never a word the guest spoke not a bite she swallowed and they saw the strong shudderings take and shake her in her place  yet a little and still without speech back she went into her badplace and the door was shut  that is a sick wife said finnward her weird has come on her  and at that the heart of aud was lifted up with hope  all day thorgunna lay on her bed and the next day sent for finnward  finnward keelfarer said she my trouble is come upon me and i am at the end of my days  he made the customary talk  i have had my good things now my hour is come and let suffice quoth she  i did not send for you to hear your prating  finnward knew not what to answer for he saw her soul was dark  i sent for you on needful matters she began again  i die hereiin this black house in a bleak island far from all decency and proper ways of man and now my treasure must be left  small pleasure have i had of it and leave it with the less cried she  good woman as the saying is needs must says finnward for he was nettled with that speech  for that i called you quoth thorgunna  in these two chests are much wealth and things greatly to be desired  i wish my body to be laid in skalaholt in the new church where i trust to hear the masspriests singing over my head so long as time endures  to that church i will you to give what is sufficient leaving your conscience judge of it  my scarlet cloak with the silver i will to that poor fool your wife  she longed for it so bitterly i may not even now deny her  give her the brooch as well  i warn you of her i was such as she only wiser i warn you the ground she stands upon is water and whoso trusts her leans on rottenness  i hate her and i pity her  when she comes to lie where i lie  there she broke off  the rest of my goods i leave to your black eyed maid young asdis for her slim body and clean mind  only the things of my bed you shall see burned  it is well said finnward  it may be well quoth she if you obey  my life has been a wonder to all and a fear to many  while i lived none thwarted me and prospered see to it that none thwart me after i am dead  it stands upon your safety  it stands upon my honour quoth finnward and i have the name of an honourable man  you have the name of a weak one says thorgunna  look to it look to it finnward  your house shall rue it else  the rooftree of my house is my word said finnward  and that is a true saying says the woman  see to it then  the speech of thorgunna is ended  with that she turned her face against the wall and finnward left her  the same night in the small hours of the clock thorgunna passed  it was a wild night for summer and the wind sang about the eaves and clouds covered the moon when the dark woman wended  from that day to this no man has learned her story or her peoples name but be sure the one was stormy and the other great  she had come to that isle a waif woman on a ship thence she flitted and no more remained of her but her heavy chests and her big body  in the morning the house women streaked and dressed the corpse  then came finnward and carried the sheets and curtains from the house and caused build a fire upon the sands  but aud had an eye on her mans doings  and what is this that you are at said she  so he told her  burn the good sheets she cried  and where would i be with my two hands  no troth said aud not so long as your wife is above ground  good wife said finnward this is beyond your province  here is my word pledged and the woman dead i pledged it to  so much the more am i bound  let me be doing as i must goodwife  tillyvalley says she and a fiddlesticks end goodman  you may know well about fishing and be good at shearing sheep for what i know but you are little of a judge of damask sheets  and the best word i can say is just this she says laying hold of one end of the goods that if ye are made up to burn the plenishing you must burn your wife along with it  i trust it will not go so hard says finnward and i beg you not to speak so loud and let the house folk hear you  let them speak low that are ashamed cries aud  i speak only in reason  you are to consider that the woman died in my house says finnward and this was her last behest  in truth goodwife if i were to fail it is a thing that would stick long in my throat and would give us an ill name with the neighbours  and you are to consider says she that i am your true wife and worth all the witches ever burnt and loving her old husbandhere she put her arms about his neck  and you are to consider that what you wish to do is to destroy fine stuff such as we have no means of replacing and that she bade you do it singly to spite me for i sought to buy this bedding from her while she was alive at her own price and that she hated me because i was young and handsome  that is a true word that she hated you for she said so herself before she wended says finnward  so that here is an old faggot that hated me and she dead as a bucket says aud and here is a young wife that loves you dear and is alive forbyand at that she kissed himand the point is which are you to do the will of  the mans weakness caught him hard and he faltered  i fear some hurt will come of it said he  there she cut in and bade the lads tread out the fire and the lasses roll the bedstuff up and carry it within  my dear says he my honourthis is against my honour  but she took his arm under hers and caressed his hand and kissed his knuckles and led him down the bay  bubblebubblebubble says she imitating him like a baby though she was none so young  bubblebubble and a silly old man  we must bury the troll wife and here is trouble enough and a vengeance  horses will sweat for it before she comes to skalaholt tis my belief she was a man in a womans habit  and so now have done good man and let us get her waked and buried which is more than she deserves or her old duds are like to pay for  and when that is ended we can consult upon the rest  so finnward was but too well pleased to put it off  the next day they set forth early for skalaholt across the heaths  it was heavy weather and grey overhead the horses sweated and neighed and the men went silent for it was nowhere in their minds that the dead wife was canny  only aud talked by the way like a silly seagull piping on a cliff and the rest held their peace  the sun went down before they were across whitewater and the black night fell on them this side of netherness  at netherness they beat upon the door  the goodman was not abed nor any of his folk but sat in the hall talking and to them finnward made clear his business  i will never deny you a roof said the goodman of netherness  but i have no food ready and if you cannot be doing without meat you must een fare farther  they laid the body in a shed made fast their horses and came into the house and the door was closed again  so there they sat about the lights and there was little said for they were none so well pleased with their reception  presently in the place where the food was kept began a clattering of dishes and it fell to a bondman of the house to go and see what made the clatter  he was no sooner gone than he was back again and told it was a big buxom woman high in flesh and naked as she was born setting meats upon a dresser  finnward grew pale as the dawn he got to his feet and the rest rose with him and all the party of the funeral came to the butterydoor  and the dead thorgunna took no heed of their coming but went on setting forth meats and seemed to talk with herself as she did so and she was naked to the buff  great fear fell upon them the marrow of their back grew cold  not one word they spoke neither good nor bad but back into the hall and down upon their bended knees and to their prayers  now in the name of god what ails you cried the goodman of netherness  and when they had told him shame fell upon him for his churlishness  the dead wife reproves me said the honest man  and he blessed himself and his house and caused spread the tables and they all ate of the meats that the dead wife laid out  this was the first walking of thorgunna and it is thought by good judges it would have been the last as well if men had been more wise  the next day they came to skalaholt and there was the body buried and the next after they set out for home  finnwards heart was heavy and his mind divided  he feared the dead wife and the living he feared dishonour and he feared dispeace and his will was like a seagull in the wind  now he cleared his throat and made as if to speak and at that aud cocked her eye and looked at the goodman mocking and his voice died unborn  at the last shame gave him courage  aud said he yon was a most uncanny thing at netherness  no doubt said aud  i have never had it in my mind said he that yon woman was the thing she should be  i dare say not said aud  i never thought so either  it stands beyond question she was more than canny says finnward shaking his head  no manner of doubt but what she was ancient of mind  she was getting pretty old in body too says aud  wife says he it comes in upon me strongly this is no kind of woman to disobey above all being dead and her walking  i think wife we must even do as she commanded  now what is ever your word says she riding up close and setting her hand upon his shoulder  the goodwifes pleasure must be done is not that my finnward  the good god knows i grudge you nothing cried finnward  but my blood runs cold upon this business  worse will come of it he cried worse will flow from it  what is this todo cries aud  here is an old brimstone hag that should have been stoned with stones and hated me besides  vainly she tried to frighten me when she was living shall she frighten me now when she is dead and rotten  i trow not  think shame to your beard goodman are these a mans shoes i see you shaking in when your wife rides by your bridlehand as bold as nails  ay ay quoth finnward  but there goes a byword in the country little wit little fear  at this aud began to be concerned for he was usually easier to lead  so now she tried the other method on the man  is that your word cried she  i kiss the hands of ye  if i have not wit enough i can rid you of my company  wit is it he seeks she cried the old broomstick that we buried yesterday had wit for you  so she rode on ahead and looked not the road that he was on  poor finnward followed on his horse but the light of the day was gone out for his wife was like his life to him  he went six miles and was true to his heart but the seventh was not half through when he rode up to her  is it to be the goodwifes pleasure she asked  aud you shall have your way says he god grant there come no ill of it  so she made much of him and his heart was comforted  when they came to the house aud had the two chests to her own bedplace and gloated all night on what she found  finnward looked on and trouble darkened his mind  wife says he at last you will not forget these things belong to asdis  at that she barked upon him like a dog  am i a thief she cried  the brat shall have them in her turn when she grows up  would you have me give her them now to turn her minxs head with  so the weak man went his way out of the house in sorrow and fell to his affairs  those that wrought with him that day observed that now he would labour and toil like a man furious and now would sit and stare like one stupid for in truth he judged the business would end ill  for a while there was no more done and no more said  aud cherished her treasures by herself and none was the wiser except finnward  only the cloak she sometimes wore for that was hers by the will of the dead wife but the others she let lie because she knew she had them foully and she feared finnward somewhat and thorgunna much  at last husband and wife were bound to bed one night and he was the first stripped and got in  what sheets are these he screamed as his legs touched them for these were smooth as water but the sheets of iceland were like sacking  clean sheets i suppose says aud but her hand quavered as she wound her hair  woman cried finnward these are the bedsheets of thorgunnathese are the sheets she died in do not lie to me  at that aud turned and looked at him  well says she they have been washed  finnward lay down again in the bed between thorgunnas sheets and groaned never a word more he said for now he knew he was a coward and a man dishonoured  presently his wife came beside him and they lay still but neither slept  it might be twelve in the night when aud felt finnward shudder so strong that the bed shook  what ails you said she  i know not he said  it is a chill like the chill of death  my soul is sick with it  his voice fell low  it was so thorgunna sickened said he  and he arose and walked in the hall in the dark till it came morning  early in the morning he went forth to the seafishing with four lads  aud was troubled at heart and watched him from the door and even as he went down the beach she saw him shaken with thorgunnas shudder  it was a rough day the sea was wild the boat laboured exceedingly and it may be that finnwards mind was troubled with his sickness  certain it is that they struck and their boat was burst upon a skerry under snowfellness the four lads were spilled into the sea and the sea broke and buried them but finnward was cast upon the skerry and clambered up and sat there all day long god knows his thoughts  the sun was halfway down when a shepherd went by on the cliffs about his business and spied a man in the midst of the breach of the loud seas upon a pinnacle of reef  he hailed him and the man turned and hailed again  there was in that cove so great a clashing of the seas and so shrill a cry of seafowl that the herd might hear the voice and nor the words  but the name thorgunna came to him and he saw the face of finnward keelfarer like the face of an old man  lively ran the herd to finnwards house and when his tale was told there eyolf the boy was lively to out a boat and hasten to his fathers aid  by the strength of hands they drove the keel against the seas and with skill and courage eyolf won upon the skerry and climbed up there sat his father dead and this was the first vengeance of thorgunna against broken faith  it was a sore job to get the corpse on board and a sorer yet to bring it home before the rolling seas  but the lad eyolf was a lad of promise and the lads that pulled for him were sturdy men  so the breakfaiths body was got home and waked and buried on the hill  aud was a good widow and wept much for she liked finnward well enough  yet a bird sang in her ears that now she might marry a young man  little fear that she might have her choice of them she thought with all thorgunnas fine things and her heart was cheered  now when the corpse was laid in the hill asdis came where aud sat solitary in hall and stood by her awhile without speech  well child says aud and again well and then keep us holy if you have anything to say out with it  so the maid came so much nearer mother says she i wish you would not wear these things that were thorgunnas  aha cries aud  this is what it is  you begin early brat  and who has been poisoning your mind  your fool of a father i suppose  and then she stopped and went all scarlet  who told you they were yours she asked again taking it all the higher for her stumble  when you are grown then you shall have your share and not a day before  these things are not for babies  the child looked at her and was amazed  i do not wish them she said i wish they might be burned  upon my word what next cried aud  and why should they be burned  i know my father tried to burn these things said asdis and he named thorgunnas name upon the skerry ere he died  and o mother i doubt they have brought ill luck  but the more aud was terrified the more she would make light of it  then the girl put her hand upon her mothers  i fear they are ill come by said she  the blood sprang in auds face  and who made you a judge upon your mother that bore you cried she  kinswoman said asdis looking down i saw you with the brooch  what do you mean  when  where did you see me cried the mother  here in the hall said asdis looking on the floor the night you stole it  at that aud let out a cry  then she heaved up her hand to strike the child  you little spy she cried  then she covered her face and wept and rocked herself  what can you know she cried  how can you understand that are a baby not so long weaned  he couldyour father could the dear good man dead and gone  he could understand and pity he was good to me  now he has left me alone with heartless children asdis she cried have you no nature in your blood  you do not know what i have done and suffered for them  i have doneoh and i could have done anything  and there is your father dead  and after all you ask me not to use them  no woman in iceland has the like  and you wish me to destroy them  not if the dead should rise she cried  no no and she stopped her ears not if the dead should rise and let that end it  so she ran into her bedplace and clapped at the door and left the child amazed  but for all aud spoke with so much passion it was noticed that for long she left the things unused  only she would be locked somewhile daily in her bedplace where she pored on them and secretly wore them for her pleasure  now winter was at hand the days grew short and the nights long and under the golden face of morning the isle would stand silver with frost word came from holyfell to frodis water of a company of young men upon a journey that night they supped at holyfell the next it would be at frodis water and alf of the fells was there and thongbrand ketilson and hall the fair  aud went early to her bedplace and there she pored upon these fineries till her heart was melted with selflove  there was a kirtle of a mingled colour and the blue shot into the green and the green lightened from the blue as the colours play in the ocean between deeps and shallows she thought she could endure to live no longer and not wear it  there was a bracelet of an ell long wrought like a serpent and with fiery jewels for the eyes she saw it shine on her white arm and her head grew dizzy with desire  ah she thought never were fine lendings better met with a fair wearer  and she closed her eyelids and she thought she saw herself among the company and the mens eyes go after her admiring  with that she considered that she must soon marry one of them and wondered which and she thought alf was perhaps the best or hall the fair but was not certain and then she remembered finnward keelfarer in his cairn upon the hill and was concerned  well he was a good husband to me she thought and i was a good wife to him  but that is an old song now  so she turned again to handling the stuffs and jewels  at last she got to bed in the smooth sheets and lay and fancied how she would look and admired herself and saw others admire her and told herself stories till her heart grew warm and she chuckled to herself between the sheets  so she shook awhile with laughter and then the mirth abated but not the shaking and a grue took hold upon her flesh and the cold of the grave upon her belly and the terror of death upon her soul  with that a voice was in her ear it was so thorgunna sickened  thrice in the night the chill and the terror took her and thrice it passed away and when she rose on the morrow death had breathed upon her countenance  she saw the house folk and her children gaze upon her well she knew why she knew her day was come and the last of her days and her last hour was at her back and it was so in her soul that she scarce minded  all was lost all was past mending she would carry on until she fell  so she went as usual and hurried the feast for the young men and railed upon her house folk but her feet stumbled and her voice was strange in her own ears and the eyes of the folk fled before her  at times too the chill took her and the fear along with it and she must sit down and the teeth beat together in her head and the stool tottered on the floor at these times she thought she was passing and the voice of thorgunna sounded in her ear the things are for no use but to be shown it said aud aud have you shown them once  no not once  and at the sting of the thought her courage and strength would revive and she would rise again and move about her business  now the hour drew near and aud went to her bedplace and did on the bravest of her finery and came forth to greet her guests  was never woman in iceland robed as she was  the words of greeting were yet between her lips when the shuddering fell upon her strong as labour and a horror as deep as hell  her face was changed amidst her finery and the faces of her guests were changed as they beheld her fear puckered their brows fear drew back their feet and she took her doom from the looks of them and fled to her bedplace  there she flung herself on the wifes coverlet and turned her face against the wall  that was the end of all the words of aud and in the small hours on the clock her spirit wended  asdis had come to and fro seeing if she might help where was no help possible of man or woman  it was light in the bedplace when the maid returned for a taper stood upon a chest  there lay aud in her fine clothes and there by her side on the bed the big dead wife thorgunna squatted on her hams  no sound was heard but it seemed by the movement of her mouth as if thorgunna sang and she waved her arms as if to singing  god be good to us cried asdis she is dead  dead said the dead wife  is the weird passed cried asdis  when the sin is done the weird is dreed said thorgunna and with that she was not  but the next day eyolf
