40631557	the beast in the jungle   chapter i   what determined the speech that startled him in the course of their encounter scarcely matters being probably but some words spoken by himself quite without intentionspoken as they lingered and slowly moved together after their renewal of acquaintance  he had been conveyed by friends an hour or two before to the house at which she was staying the party of visitors at the other house of whom he was one and thanks to whom it was his theory as always that he was lost in the crowd had been invited over to luncheon  there had been after luncheon much dispersal all in the interest of the original motive a view of weatherend itself and the fine things intrinsic features pictures heirlooms treasures of all the arts that made the place almost famous and the great rooms were so numerous that guests could wander at their will hang back from the principal group and in cases where they took such matters with the last seriousness give themselves up to mysterious appreciations and measurements  there were persons to be observed singly or in couples bending toward objects in outoftheway corners with their hands on their knees and their heads nodding quite as with the emphasis of an excited sense of smell  when they were two they either mingled their sounds of ecstasy or melted into silences of even deeper import so that there were aspects of the occasion that gave it for marcher much the air of the look round previous to a sale highly advertised that excites or quenches as may be the dream of acquisition  the dream of acquisition at weatherend would have had to be wild indeed and john marcher found himself among such suggestions disconcerted almost equally by the presence of those who knew too much and by that of those who knew nothing  the great rooms caused so much poetry and history to press upon him that he needed some straying apart to feel in a proper relation with them though this impulse was not as happened like the gloating of some of his companions to be compared to the movements of a dog sniffing a cupboard  it had an issue promptly enough in a direction that was not to have been calculated  it led briefly in the course of the october afternoon to his closer meeting with may bartram whose face a reminder yet not quite a remembrance as they sat much separated at a very long table had begun merely by troubling him rather pleasantly  it affected him as the sequel of something of which he had lost the beginning  he knew it and for the time quite welcomed it as a continuation but didnt know what it continued which was an interest or an amusement the greater as he was also somehow awareyet without a direct sign from herthat the young woman herself hadnt lost the thread  she hadnt lost it but she wouldnt give it back to him he saw without some putting forth of his hand for it and he not only saw that but saw several things more things odd enough in the light of the fact that at the moment some accident of grouping brought them face to face he was still merely fumbling with the idea that any contact between them in the past would have had no importance  if it had had no importance he scarcely knew why his actual impression of her should so seem to have so much the answer to which however was that in such a life as they all appeared to be leading for the moment one could but take things as they came  he was satisfied without in the least being able to say why that this young lady might roughly have ranked in the house as a poor relation satisfied also that she was not there on a brief visit but was more or less a part of the establishmentalmost a working a remunerated part  didnt she enjoy at periods a protection that she paid for by helping among other services to show the place and explain it deal with the tiresome people answer questions about the dates of the building the styles of the furniture the authorship of the pictures the favourite haunts of the ghost  it wasnt that she looked as if you could have given her shillingsit was impossible to look less so  yet when she finally drifted toward him distinctly handsome though ever so much olderolder than when he had seen her beforeit might have been as an effect of her guessing that he had within the couple of hours devoted more imagination to her than to all the others put together and had thereby penetrated to a kind of truth that the others were too stupid for  she was there on harder terms than any one she was there as a consequence of things suffered one way and another in the interval of years and she remembered him very much as she was rememberedonly a good deal better  by the time they at last thus came to speech they were alone in one of the roomsremarkable for a fine portrait over the chimneyplaceout of which their friends had passed and the charm of it was that even before they had spoken they had practically arranged with each other to stay behind for talk  the charm happily was in other things toopartly in there being scarce a spot at weatherend without something to stay behind for  it was in the way the autumn day looked into the high windows as it waned the way the red light breaking at the close from under a low sombre sky reached out in a long shaft and played over old wainscots old tapestry old gold old colour  it was most of all perhaps in the way she came to him as if since she had been turned on to deal with the simpler sort he might should he choose to keep the whole thing down just take her mild attention for a part of her general business  as soon as he heard her voice however the gap was filled up and the missing link supplied the slight irony he divined in her attitude lost its advantage  he almost jumped at it to get there before her  i met you years and years ago in rome  i remember all about it  she confessed to disappointmentshe had been so sure he didnt and to prove how well he did he began to pour forth the particular recollections that popped up as he called for them  her face and her voice all at his service now worked the miraclethe impression operating like the torch of a lamplighter who touches into flame one by one a long row of gasjets marcher flattered himself the illumination was brilliant yet he was really still more pleased on her showing him with amusement that in his haste to make everything right he had got most things rather wrong  it hadnt been at romeit had been at naples and it hadnt been eight years beforeit had been more nearly ten  she hadnt been either with her uncle and aunt but with her mother and brother in addition to which it was not with the pembles he had been but with the boyers coming down in their company from romea point on which she insisted a little to his confusion and as to which she had her evidence in hand  the boyers she had known but didnt know the pembles though she had heard of them and it was the people he was with who had made them acquainted the incident of the thunderstorm that had raged round them with such violence as to drive them for refuge into an excavationthis incident had not occurred at the palace of the caesars but at pompeii on an occasion when they had been present there at an important find  he accepted her amendments he enjoyed her corrections though the moral of them was she pointed out that he really didnt remember the least thing about her and he only felt it as a drawback that when all was made strictly historic there didnt appear much of anything left  they lingered together still she neglecting her officefor from the moment he was so clever she had no proper right to himand both neglecting the house just waiting as to see if a memory or two more wouldnt again breathe on them  it hadnt taken them many minutes after all to put down on the table like the cards of a pack those that constituted their respective hands only what came out was that the pack was unfortunately not perfectthat the past invoked invited encouraged could give them naturally no more than it had  it had made them anciently meether at twenty him at twentyfive but nothing was so strange they seemed to say to each other as that while so occupied it hadnt done a little more for them  they looked at each other as with the feeling of an occasion missed the present would have been so much better if the other in the far distance in the foreign land hadnt been so stupidly meagre  there werent apparently all counted more than a dozen little old things that had succeeded in coming to pass between them trivialities of youth simplicities of freshness stupidities of ignorance small possible germs but too deeply buriedtoo deeply didnt it seem to sprout after so many years  marcher could only feel he ought to have rendered her some servicesaved her from a capsized boat in the bay or at least recovered her dressingbag filched from her cab in the streets of naples by a lazzarone with a stiletto  or it would have been nice if he could have been taken with fever all alone at his hotel and she could have come to look after him to write to his people to drive him out in convalescence  then they would be in possession of the something or other that their actual show seemed to lack  it yet somehow presented itself this show as too good to be spoiled so that they were reduced for a few minutes more to wondering a little helplessly whysince they seemed to know a certain number of the same peopletheir reunion had been so long averted  they didnt use that name for it but their delay from minute to minute to join the others was a kind of confession that they didnt quite want it to be a failure  their attempted supposition of reasons for their not having met but showed how little they knew of each other  there came in fact a moment when marcher felt a positive pang  it was vain to pretend she was an old friend for all the communities were wanting in spite of which it was as an old friend that he saw she would have suited him  he had new ones enoughwas surrounded with them for instance on the stage of the other house as a new one he probably wouldnt have so much as noticed her  he would have liked to invent something get her to makebelieve with him that some passage of a romantic or critical kind had originally occurred  he was really almost reaching out in imaginationas against timefor something that would do and saying to himself that if it didnt come this sketch of a fresh start would show for quite awkwardly bungled  they would separate and now for no second or no third chance  they would have tried and not succeeded  then it was just at the turn as he afterwards made it out to himself that everything else failing she herself decided to take up the case and as it were save the situation  he felt as soon as she spoke that she had been consciously keeping back what she said and hoping to get on without it a scruple in her that immensely touched him when by the end of three or four minutes more he was able to measure it  what she brought out at any rate quite cleared the air and supplied the linkthe link it was so odd he should frivolously have managed to lose  you know you told me something ive never forgotten and that again and again has made me think of you since it was that tremendously hot day when we went to sorrento across the bay for the breeze  what i allude to was what you said to me on the way back as we sat under the awning of the boat enjoying the cool  have you forgotten  he had forgotten and was even more surprised than ashamed  but the great thing was that he saw in this no vulgar reminder of any sweet speech  the vanity of women had long memories but she was making no claim on him of a compliment or a mistake  with another woman a totally different one he might have feared the recall possibly even some imbecile offer  so in having to say that he had indeed forgotten he was conscious rather of a loss than of a gain he already saw an interest in the matter of her mention  i try to thinkbut i give it up  yet i remember the sorrento day  im not very sure you do may bartram after a moment said and im not very sure i ought to want you to  its dreadful to bring a person back at any time to what he was ten years before  if youve lived away from it she smiled so much the better  ah if you havent why should i he asked  lived away you mean from what i myself was  from what i was  i was of course an ass marcher went on but i would rather know from you just the sort of ass i was thanfrom the moment you have something in your mindnot know anything  still however she hesitated  but if youve completely ceased to be that sort  why i can then all the more bear to know  besides perhaps i havent  perhaps  yet if you havent she added i should suppose youd remember  not indeed that i in the least connect with my impression the invidious name you use  if i had only thought you foolish she explained the thing i speak of wouldnt so have remained with me  it was about yourself  she waited as if it might come to him but as only meeting her eyes in wonder he gave no sign she burnt her ships  has it ever happened  then it was that while he continued to stare a light broke for him and the blood slowly came to his face which began to burn with recognition  do you mean i told you  but he faltered lest what came to him shouldnt be right lest he should only give himself away  it was something about yourself that it was natural one shouldnt forgetthat is if one remembered you at all  thats why i ask you she smiled if the thing you then spoke of has ever come to pass  oh then he saw but he was lost in wonder and found himself embarrassed this he also saw made her sorry for him as if her allusion had been a mistake  it took him but a moment however to feel it hadnt been much as it had been a surprise  after the first little shock of it her knowledge on the contrary began even if rather strangely to taste sweet to him  she was the only other person in the world then who would have it and she had had it all these years while the fact of his having so breathed his secret had unaccountably faded from him  no wonder they couldnt have met as if nothing had happened  i judge he finally said that i know what you mean  only i had strangely enough lost any sense of having taken you so far into my confidence  is it because youve taken so many others as well  ive taken nobody  not a creature since then  so that im the only person who knows  the only person in the world  well she quickly replied i myself have never spoken  ive never never repeated of you what you told me  she looked at him so that he perfectly believed her  their eyes met over it in such a way that he was without a doubt  and i never will  she spoke with an earnestness that as if almost excessive put him at ease about her possible derision  somehow the whole question was a new luxury to himthat is from the moment she was in possession  if she didnt take the sarcastic view she clearly took the sympathetic and that was what he had had in all the long time from no one whomsoever  what he felt was that he couldnt at present have begun to tell her and yet could profit perhaps exquisitely by the accident of having done so of old  please dont then  were just right as it is  oh i am she laughed if you are  to which she added then you do still feel in the same way  it was impossible he shouldnt take to himself that she was really interested though it all kept coming as a perfect surprise  he had thought of himself so long as abominably alone and lo he wasnt alone a bit  he hadnt been it appeared for an hoursince those moments on the sorrento boat  it was she who had been he seemed to see as he looked at hershe who had been made so by the graceless fact of his lapse of fidelity  to tell her what he had told herwhat had it been but to ask something of her something that she had given in her charity without his having by a remembrance by a return of the spirit failing another encounter so much as thanked her  what he had asked of her had been simply at first not to laugh at him  she had beautifully not done so for ten years and she was not doing so now  so he had endless gratitude to make up  only for that he must see just how he had figured to her  what exactly was the account i gave  of the way you did feel  well it was very simple  you said you had had from your earliest time as the deepest thing within you the sense of being kept for something rare and strange possibly prodigious and terrible that was sooner or later to happen to you that you had in your bones the foreboding and the conviction of and that would perhaps overwhelm you  do you call that very simple john marcher asked  she thought a moment  it was perhaps because i seemed as you spoke to understand it  you do understand it he eagerly asked  again she kept her kind eyes on him  you still have the belief  oh he exclaimed helplessly  there was too much to say  whatever its to be she clearly made out it hasnt yet come  he shook his head in complete surrender now  it hasnt yet come  only you know it isnt anything im to do to achieve in the world to be distinguished or admired for  im not such an ass as that  it would be much better no doubt if i were  its to be something youre merely to suffer  well say to wait forto have to meet to face to see suddenly break out in my life possibly destroying all further consciousness possibly annihilating me possibly on the other hand only altering everything striking at the root of all my world and leaving me to the consequences however they shape themselves  she took this in but the light in her eyes continued for him not to be that of mockery  isnt what you describe perhaps but the expectationor at any rate the sense of danger familiar to so many peopleof falling in love  john marcher thought  did you ask me that before  noi wasnt so freeandeasy then  but its what strikes me now  of course he said after a moment it strikes you  of course it strikes me  of course whats in store for me may be no more than that the only thing is he went on that i think if it had been that i should by this time know  do you mean because youve been in love  and then as he but looked at her in silence youve been in love and it hasnt meant such a cataclysm hasnt proved the great affair  here i am you see  it hasnt been overwhelming  then it hasnt been love said may bartram  well i at least thought it was  i took it for thative taken it till now  it was agreeable it was delightful it was miserable he explained  but it wasnt strange  it wasnt what my affairs to be  you want something all to yourselfsomething that nobody else knows or has known  it isnt a question of what i wantgod knows i dont want anything its only a question of the apprehension that haunts methat i live with day by day  he said this so lucidly and consistently that he could see it further impose itself  if she hadnt been interested before shed have been interested now  is it a sense of coming violence  evidently now too again he liked to talk of it  i dont think of it aswhen it does comenecessarily violent  i only think of it as natural and as of course above all unmistakeable  i think of it simply as the thing  the thing will of itself appear natural  then how will it appear strange  marcher bethought himself  it wontto me  to whom then  well he replied smiling at last say to you  oh then im to be present  why you are presentsince you know  i see  she turned it over  but i mean at the catastrophe  at this for a minute their lightness gave way to their gravity it was as if the long look they exchanged held them together  it will only depend on yourselfif youll watch with me  are you afraid she asked  dont leave me now he went on  are you afraid she repeated  do you think me simply out of my mind he pursued instead of answering do i merely strike you as a harmless lunatic  no said may bartram  i understand you  i believe you  you mean you feel how my obsessionpoor old thingmay correspond to some possible reality  to some possible reality  then you will watch with me  she hesitated then for the third time put her question  are you afraid  did i tell you i wasat naples  no you said nothing about it  then i dont know  and i should like to know said john marcher youll tell me yourself whether you think so  if youll watch with me youll see  very good then  they had been moving by this time across the room and at the door before passing out they paused as for the full windup of their understanding  ill watch with you said may bartram     chapter ii   the fact that she knewknew and yet neither chaffed him nor betrayed himhad in a short time begun to constitute between them a goodly bond which became more marked when within the year that followed their afternoon at weatherend the opportunities for meeting multiplied  the event that thus promoted these occasions was the death of the ancient lady her greataunt under whose wing since losing her mother she had to such an extent found shelter and who though but the widowed mother of the new successor to the property had succeededthanks to a high tone and a high temperin not forfeiting the supreme position at the great house  the deposition of this personage arrived but with her death which followed by many changes made in particular a difference for the young woman in whom marchers expert attention had recognised from the first a dependent with a pride that might ache though it didnt bristle  nothing for a long time had made him easier than the thought that the aching must have been much soothed by miss bartrams now finding herself able to set up a small home in london  she had acquired property to an amount that made that luxury just possible under her aunts extremely complicated will and when the whole matter began to be straightened out which indeed took time she let him know that the happy issue was at last in view  he had seen her again before that day both because she had more than once accompanied the ancient lady to town and because he had paid another visit to the friends who so conveniently made of weatherend one of the charms of their own hospitality  these friends had taken him back there he had achieved there again with miss bartram some quiet detachment and he had in london succeeded in persuading her to more than one brief absence from her aunt  they went together on these latter occasions to the national gallery and the south kensington museum where among vivid reminders they talked of italy at largenot now attempting to recover as at first the taste of their youth and their ignorance  that recovery the first day at weatherend had served its purpose well had given them quite enough so that they were to marchers sense no longer hovering about the headwaters of their stream but had felt their boat pushed sharply off and down the current  they were literally afloat together for our gentleman this was marked quite as marked as that the fortunate cause of it was just the buried treasure of her knowledge  he had with his own hands dug up this little hoard brought to lightthat is to within reach of the dim day constituted by their discretions and privaciesthe object of value the hidingplace of which he had after putting it into the ground himself so strangely so long forgotten  the rare luck of his having again just stumbled on the spot made him indifferent to any other question he would doubtless have devoted more time to the odd accident of his lapse of memory if he hadnt been moved to devote so much to the sweetness the comfort as he felt for the future that this accident itself had helped to keep fresh  it had never entered into his plan that any one should know and mainly for the reason that it wasnt in him to tell any one that would have been impossible for nothing but the amusement of a cold world would have waited on it  since however a mysterious fate had opened his mouth betimes in spite of him he would count that a compensation and profit by it to the utmost  that the right person should know tempered the asperity of his secret more even than his shyness had permitted him to imagine and may bartram was clearly right becausewell because there she was  her knowledge simply settled it he would have been sure enough by this time had she been wrong  there was that in his situation no doubt that disposed him too much to see her as a mere confidant taking all her light for him from the factthe fact onlyof her interest in his predicament from her mercy sympathy seriousness her consent not to regard him as the funniest of the funny aware in fine that her price for him was just in her giving him this constant sense of his being admirably spared he was careful to remember that she had also a life of her own with things that might happen to her things that in friendship one should likewise take account of something fairly remarkable came to pass with him for that matter in this connexionsomething represented by a certain passage of his consciousness in the suddenest way from one extreme to the other  he had thought himself so long as nobody knew the most disinterested person in the world carrying his concentrated burden his perpetual suspense ever so quietly holding his tongue about it giving others no glimpse of it nor of its effect upon his life asking of them no allowance and only making on his side all those that were asked  he hadnt disturbed people with the queerness of their having to know a haunted man though he had had moments of rather special temptation on hearing them say they were forsooth unsettled  if they were as unsettled as he washe who had never been settled for an hour in his lifethey would know what it meant  yet it wasnt all the same for him to make them and he listened to them civilly enough  this was why he had such goodthough possibly such rather colourlessmanners this was why above all he could regard himself in a greedy world as decentlyas in fact perhaps even a little sublimelyunselfish  our point is accordingly that he valued this character quite sufficiently to measure his present danger of letting it lapse against which he promised himself to be much on his guard  he was quite ready none the less to be selfish just a little since surely no more charming occasion for it had come to him  just a little in a word was just as much as miss bartram taking one day with another would let him  he never would be in the least coercive and would keep well before him the lines on which consideration for herthe very highestought to proceed  he would thoroughly establish the heads under which her affairs her requirements her peculiaritieshe went so far as to give them the latitude of that namewould come into their intercourse  all this naturally was a sign of how much he took the intercourse itself for granted  there was nothing more to be done about that  it simply existed had sprung into being with her first penetrating question to him in the autumn light there at weatherend  the real form it should have taken on the basis that stood out large was the form of their marrying  but the devil in this was that the very basis itself put marrying out of the question  his conviction his apprehension his obsession in short wasnt a privilege he could invite a woman to share and that consequence of it was precisely what was the matter with him  something or other lay in wait for him amid the twists and the turns of the months and the years like a crouching beast in the jungle  it signified little whether the crouching beast were destined to slay him or to be slain  the definite point was the inevitable spring of the creature and the definite lesson from that was that a man of feeling didnt cause himself to be accompanied by a lady on a tigerhunt  such was the image under which he had ended by figuring his life  they had at first none the less in the scattered hours spent together made no allusion to that view of it which was a sign he was handsomely alert to give that he didnt expect that he in fact didnt care always to be talking about it  such a feature in ones outlook was really like a hump on ones back  the difference it made every minute of the day existed quite independently of discussion  one discussed of course like a hunchback for there was always if nothing else the hunchback face  that remained and she was watching him but people watched best as a general thing in silence so that such would be predominantly the manner of their vigil  yet he didnt want at the same time to be tense and solemn tense and solemn was what he imagined he too much showed for with other people  the thing to be with the one person who knew was easy and naturalto make the reference rather than be seeming to avoid it to avoid it rather than be seeming to make it and to keep it in any case familiar facetious even rather than pedantic and portentous  some such consideration as the latter was doubtless in his mind for instance when he wrote pleasantly to miss bartram that perhaps the great thing he had so long felt as in the lap of the gods was no more than this circumstance which touched him so nearly of her acquiring a house in london  it was the first allusion they had yet again made needing any other hitherto so little but when she replied after having given him the news that she was by no means satisfied with such a trifle as the climax to so special a suspense she almost set him wondering if she hadnt even a larger conception of singularity for him than he had for himself  he was at all events destined to become aware little by little as time went by that she was all the while looking at his life judging it measuring it in the light of the thing she knew which grew to be at last with the consecration of the years never mentioned between them save as the real truth about him  that had always been his own form of reference to it but she adopted the form so quietly that looking back at the end of a period he knew there was no moment at which it was traceable that she had as he might say got inside his idea or exchanged the attitude of beautifully indulging for that of still more beautifully believing him  it was always open to him to accuse her of seeing him but as the most harmless of maniacs and this in the long runsince it covered so much groundwas his easiest description of their friendship  he had a screw loose for her but she liked him in spite of it and was practically against the rest of the world his kind wise keeper unremunerated but fairly amused and in the absence of other near ties not disreputably occupied  the rest of the world of course thought him queer but she she only knew how and above all why queer which was precisely what enabled her to dispose the concealing veil in the right folds  she took his gaiety from himsince it had to pass with them for gaietyas she took everything else but she certainly so far justified by her unerring touch his finer sense of the degree to which he had ended by convincing her  she at least never spoke of the secret of his life except as the real truth about you and she had in fact a wonderful way of making it seem as such the secret of her own life too  that was in fine how he so constantly felt her as allowing for him he couldnt on the whole call it anything else  he allowed for himself but she exactly allowed still more partly because better placed for a sight of the matter she traced his unhappy perversion through reaches of its course into which he could scarce follow it  he knew how he felt but besides knowing that she knew how he looked as well he knew each of the things of importance he was insidiously kept from doing but she could add up the amount they made understand how much with a lighter weight on his spirit he might have done and thereby establish how clever as he was he fell short above all she was in the secret of the difference between the forms he went throughthose of his little office under government those of caring for his modest patrimony for his library for his garden in the country for the people in london whose invitations he accepted and repaidand the detachment that reigned beneath them and that made of all behaviour all that could in the least be called behaviour a long act of dissimulation  what it had come to was that he wore a mask painted with the social simper out of the eyeholes of which there looked eyes of an expression not in the least matching the other features  this the stupid world even after years had never more than half discovered  it was only may bartram who had and she achieved by an art indescribable the feat of at onceor perhaps it was only alternatelymeeting the eyes from in front and mingling her own vision as from over his shoulder with their peep through the apertures  so while they grew older together she did watch with him and so she let this association give shape and colour to her own existence  beneath her forms as well detachment had learned to sit and behaviour had become for her in the social sense a false account of herself  there was but one account of her that would have been true all the while and that she could give straight to nobody least of all to john marcher  her whole attitude was a virtual statement but the perception of that only seemed called to take its place for him as one of the many things necessarily crowded out of his consciousness  if she had moreover like himself to make sacrifices to their real truth it was to be granted that her compensation might have affected her as more prompt and more natural  they had long periods in this london time during which when they were together a stranger might have listened to them without in the least pricking up his ears on the other hand the real truth was equally liable at any moment to rise to the surface and the auditor would then have wondered indeed what they were talking about  they had from an early hour made up their mind that society was luckily unintelligent and the margin allowed them by this had fairly become one of their commonplaces  yet there were still moments when the situation turned almost freshusually under the effect of some expression drawn from herself  her expressions doubtless repeated themselves but her intervals were generous  what saves us you know is that we answer so completely to so usual an appearance that of the man and woman whose friendship has become such a daily habitor almostas to be at last indispensable  that for instance was a remark she had frequently enough had occasion to make though she had given it at different times different developments  what we are especially concerned with is the turn it happened to take from her one afternoon when he had come to see her in honour of her birthday  this anniversary had fallen on a sunday at a season of thick fog and general outward gloom but he had brought her his customary offering having known her now long enough to have established a hundred small traditions  it was one of his proofs to himself the present he made her on her birthday that he hadnt sunk into real selfishness  it was mostly nothing more than a small trinket but it was always fine of its kind and he was regularly careful to pay for it more than he thought he could afford  our habit saves you at least dont you see because it makes you after all for the vulgar indistinguishable from other men  whats the most inveterate mark of men in general  why the capacity to spend endless time with dull womento spend it i wont say without being bored but without minding that they are without being driven off at a tangent by it which comes to the same thing  im your dull woman a part of the daily bread for which you pray at church  that covers your tracks more than anything  and what covers yours asked marcher whom his dull woman could mostly to this extent amuse  i see of course what you mean by your saving me in this way and that so far as other people are concernedive seen it all along  only what is it that saves you  i often think you know of that  she looked as if she sometimes thought of that too but rather in a different way  where other people you mean are concerned  well youre really so in with me you knowas a sort of result of my being so in with yourself  i mean of my having such an immense regard for you being so tremendously mindful of all youve done for me  i sometimes ask myself if its quite fair  fair i mean to have so involved andsince one may say itinterested you  i almost feel as if you hadnt really had time to do anything else  anything else but be interested she asked  ah what else does one ever want to be  if ive been watching with you as we long ago agreed i was to do watchings always in itself an absorption  oh certainly john marcher said if you hadnt had your curiosity only doesnt it sometimes come to you as time goes on that your curiosity isnt being particularly repaid  may bartram had a pause  do you ask that by any chance because you feel at all that yours isnt  i mean because you have to wait so long  oh he understood what she meant  for the thing to happen that never does happen  for the beast to jump out  no im just where i was about it  it isnt a matter as to which i can choose i can decide for a change  it isnt one as to which there can be a change  its in the lap of the gods  ones in the hands of ones lawthere one is  as to the form the law will take the way it will operate thats its own affair  yes miss bartram replied of course ones fates coming of course it has come in its own form and its own way all the while  only you know the form and the way in your case were to have beenwell something so exceptional and as one may say so particularly your own  something in this made him look at her with suspicion  you say were to have been as if in your heart you had begun to doubt  oh she vaguely protested  as if you believed he went on that nothing will now take place  she shook her head slowly but rather inscrutably  youre far from my thought  he continued to look at her  what then is the matter with you  well she said after another wait the matter with me is simply that im more sure than ever my curiosity as you call it will be but too well repaid  they were frankly grave now he had got up from his seat had turned once more about the little drawingroom to which year after year he brought his inevitable topic in which he had as he might have said tasted their intimate community with every sauce where every object was as familiar to him as the things of his own house and the very carpets were worn with his fitful walk very much as the desks in old countinghouses are worn by the elbows of generations of clerks  the generations of his nervous moods had been at work there and the place was the written history of his whole middle life  under the impression of what his friend had just said he knew himself for some reason more aware of these things which made him after a moment stop again before her  is it possibly that youve grown afraid  afraid  he thought as she repeated the word that his question had made her a little change colour so that lest he should have touched on a truth he explained very kindly you remember that that was what you asked me long agothat first day at weatherend  oh yes and you told me you didnt knowthat i was to see for myself weve said little about it since even in so long a time  precisely marcher interposedquite as if it were too delicate a matter for us to make free with  quite as if we might find on pressure that i am afraid  for then he said we shouldnt should we quite know what to do  she had for the time no answer to this question  there have been days when i thought you were  only of course she added there have been days when we have thought almost anything  everything  oh marcher softly groaned as with a gasp half spent at the face more uncovered just then than it had been for a long while of the imagination always with them  it had always had its incalculable moments of glaring out quite as with the very eyes of the very beast and used as he was to them they could still draw from him the tribute of a sigh that rose from the depths of his being  all they had thought first and last rolled over him the past seemed to have been reduced to mere barren speculation  this in fact was what the place had just struck him as so full ofthe simplification of everything but the state of suspense  that remained only by seeming to hang in the void surrounding it  even his original fear if fear it as had been had lost itself in the desert  i judge however he continued that you see im not afraid now  what i see as i make it out is that youve achieved something almost unprecedented in the way of getting used to danger  living with it so long and so closely youve lost your sense of it you know its there but youre indifferent and you cease even as of old to have to whistle in the dark  considering what the danger is may bartram wound up im bound to say i dont think your attitude could well be surpassed  john marcher faintly smiled  its heroic  certainlycall it that  it was what he would have liked indeed to call it  i am then a man of courage  thats what you were to show me  he still however wondered  but doesnt the man of courage know what hes afraid ofor not afraid of  i dont know that you see  i dont focus it  i cant name it  i only know im exposed  yes but exposedhow shall i sayso directly  so intimately  thats surely enough  enough to make you feel thenas what we may call the end and the upshot of our watchthat im not afraid  youre not afraid  but it isnt she said the end of our watch  that is it isnt the end of yours  youve everything still to see  then why havent you he asked  he had had all along today the sense of her keeping something back and he still had it  as this was his first impression of that it quite made a date  the case was the more marked as she didnt at first answer which in turn made him go on  you know something i dont  then his voice for that of a man of courage trembled a little  you know whats to happen  her silence with the face she showed was almost a confessionit made him sure  you know and youre afraid to tell me  its so bad that youre afraid ill find out  all this might be true for she did look as if unexpectedly to her he had crossed some mystic line that she had secretly drawn round her  yet she might after all not have worried and the real climax was that he himself at all events neednt  youll never find out     chapter iii   it was all to have made none the less as i have said a date which came out in the fact that again and again even after long intervals other things that passed between them were in relation to this hour but the character of recalls and results  its immediate effect had been indeed rather to lighten insistencealmost to provoke a reaction as if their topic had dropped by its own weight and as if moreover for that matter marcher had been visited by one of his occasional warnings against egotism  he had kept up he felt and very decently on the whole his consciousness of the importance of not being selfish and it was true that he had never sinned in that direction without promptly enough trying to press the scales the other way  he often repaired his fault the season permitting by inviting his friend to accompany him to the opera and it not infrequently thus happened that to show he didnt wish her to have but one sort of food for her mind he was the cause of her appearing there with him a dozen nights in the month  it even happened that seeing her home at such times he occasionally went in with her to finish as he called it the evening and the better to make his point sat down to the frugal but always careful little supper that awaited his pleasure  his point was made he thought by his not eternally insisting with her on himself made for instance at such hours when it befell that her piano at hand and each of them familiar with it they went over passages of the opera together  it chanced to be on one of these occasions however that he reminded her of her not having answered a certain question he had put to her during the talk that had taken place between them on her last birthday  what is it that saves yousaved her he meant from that appearance of variation from the usual human type  if he had practically escaped remark as she pretended by doing in the most important particular what most men dofind the answer to life in patching up an alliance of a sort with a woman no better than himselfhow had she escaped it and how could the alliance such as it was since they must suppose it had been more or less noticed have failed to make her rather positively talked about  i never said may bartram replied that it hadnt made me a good deal talked about  ah well then youre not saved  it hasnt been a question for me  if youve had your woman ive had she said my man  and you mean that makes you all right  oh it was always as if there were so much to say  i dont know why it shouldnt make mehumanly which is what were speaking ofas right as it makes you  i see marcher returned  humanly no doubt as showing that youre living for something  not that is just for me and my secret  may bartram smiled  i dont pretend it exactly shows that im not living for you  its my intimacy with you thats in question  he laughed as he saw what she meant  yes but since as you say im only so far as people make out ordinary yourearent you no more than ordinary either  you help me to pass for a man like another  so if i am as i understand you youre not compromised  is that it  she had another of her waits but she spoke clearly enough  thats it its all that concerns meto help you to pass for a man like another  he was careful to acknowledge the remark handsomely  how kind how beautiful you are to me  how shall i ever repay you  she had her last grave pause as if there might be a choice of ways  but she chose  by going on as you are  it was into this going on as he was that they relapsed and really for so long a time that the day inevitably came for a further sounding of their depths  these depths constantly bridged over by a structure firm enough in spite of its lightness and of its occasional oscillation in the somewhat vertiginous air invited on occasion in the interest of their nerves a dropping of the plummet and a measurement of the abyss  a difference had been made moreover once for all by the fact that she had all the while not appeared to feel the need of rebutting his charge of an idea within her that she didnt dare to expressa charge uttered just before one of the fullest of their later discussions ended  it had come up for him then that she knew something and that what she knew was badtoo bad to tell him  when he had spoken of it as visibly so bad that she was afraid he might find it out her reply had left the matter too equivocal to be let alone and yet for marchers special sensibility almost too formidable again to touch  he circled about it at a distance that alternately narrowed and widened and that still wasnt much affected by the consciousness in him that there was nothing she could know after all any better than he did  she had no source of knowledge he hadnt equallyexcept of course that she might have finer nerves  that was what women had where they were interested they made out things where people were concerned that the people often couldnt have made out for themselves  their nerves their sensibility their imagination were conductors and revealers and the beauty of may bartram was in particular that she had given herself so to his case  he felt in these days what oddly enough he had never felt before the growth of a dread of losing her by some catastrophesome catastrophe that yet wouldnt at all be the catastrophe partly because she had almost of a sudden begun to strike him as more useful to him than ever yet and partly by reason of an appearance of uncertainty in her health coincident and equally new  it was characteristic of the inner detachment he had hitherto so successfully cultivated and to which our whole account of him is a reference it was characteristic that his complications such as they were had never yet seemed so as at this crisis to thicken about him even to the point of making him ask himself if he were by any chance of a truth within sight or sound within touch or reach within the immediate jurisdiction of the thing that waited  when the day came as come it had to that his friend confessed to him her fear of a deep disorder in her blood he felt somehow the shadow of a change and the chill of a shock  he immediately began to imagine aggravations and disasters and above all to think of her peril as the direct menace for himself of personal privation  this indeed gave him one of those partial recoveries of equanimity that were agreeable to himit showed him that what was still first in his mind was the loss she herself might suffer  what if she should have to die before knowing before seeing  it would have been brutal in the early stages of her trouble to put that question to her but it had immediately sounded for him to his own concern and the possibility was what most made him sorry for her  if she did know moreover in the sense of her having had somewhat should he thinkmystical irresistible light this would make the matter not better but worse inasmuch as her original adoption of his own curiosity had quite become the basis of her life  she had been living to see what would be to be seen and it would quite lacerate her to have to give up before the accomplishment of the vision  these reflexions as i say quickened his generosity yet make them as he might he saw himself with the lapse of the period more and more disconcerted  it lapsed for him with a strange steady sweep and the oddest oddity was that it gave him independently of the threat of much inconvenience almost the only positive surprise his career if career it could be called had yet offered him  she kept the house as she had never done he had to go to her to see hershe could meet him nowhere now though there was scarce a corner of their loved old london in which she hadnt in the past at one time or another done so and he found her always seated by her fire in the deep oldfashioned chair she was less and less able to leave  he had been struck one day after an absence exceeding his usual measure with her suddenly looking much older to him than he had ever thought of her being then he recognised that the suddenness was all on his sidehe had just simply and suddenly noticed she looked older because inevitably after so many years she was old or almost which was of course true in still greater measure of her companion  if she was old or almost john marcher assuredly was and yet it was her showing of the lesson not his own that brought the truth home to him  his surprises began here when once they had begun they multiplied they came rather with a rush it was as if in the oddest way in the world they had all been kept back sown in a thick cluster for the late afternoon of life the time at which for people in general the unexpected has died out  one of them was that he should have caught himselffor he had so donereally wondering if the great accident would take form now as nothing more than his being condemned to see this charming woman this admirable friend pass away from him  he had never so unreservedly qualified her as while confronted in thought with such a possibility in spite of which there was small doubt for him that as an answer to his long riddle the mere effacement of even so fine a feature of his situation would be an abject anticlimax  it would represent as connected with his past attitude a drop of dignity under the shadow of which his existence could only become the most grotesques of failures  he had been far from holding it a failurelong as he had waited for the appearance that was to make it a success  he had waited for quite another thing not for such a thing as that  the breath of his good faith came short however as he recognised how long he had waited or how long at least his companion had  that she at all events might be recorded as having waited in vainthis affected him sharply and all the more because of his at first having done little more than amuse himself with the idea  it grew more grave as the gravity of her condition grew and the state of mind it produced in him which he himself ended by watching as if it had been some definite disfigurement of his outer person may pass for another of his surprises  this conjoined itself still with another the really stupefying consciousness of a question that he would have allowed to shape itself had he dared  what did everything meanwhat that is did she mean she and her vain waiting and her probable death and the soundless admonition of it allunless that at this time of day it was simply it was overwhelmingly too late he had never at any stage of his queer consciousness admitted the whisper of such a correction he had never till within these last few months been so false to his conviction as not to hold that what was to come to him had time whether he struck himself as having it or not  that at last at last he certainly hadnt it to speak of or had it but in the scantiest measuresuch soon enough as things went with him became the inference with which his old obsession had to reckon and this it was not helped to do by the more and more confirmed appearance that the great vagueness casting the long shadow in which he had lived had to attest itself almost no margin left  since it was in time that he was to have met his fate so it was in time that his fate was to have acted and as he waked up to the sense of no longer being young which was exactly the sense of being stale just as that in turn was the sense of being weak he waked up to another matter beside  it all hung together they were subject he and the great vagueness to an equal and indivisible law when the possibilities themselves had accordingly turned stale when the secret of the gods had grown faint had perhaps even quite evaporated that and that only was failure  it wouldnt have been failure to be bankrupt dishonoured pilloried hanged it was failure not to be anything  and so in the dark valley into which his path had taken its unlookedfor twist he wondered not a little as he groped  he didnt care what awful crash might overtake him with what ignominy or what monstrosity he might yet he associatedsince he wasnt after all too utterly old to sufferif it would only be decently proportionate to the posture he had kept all his life in the threatened presence of it  he had but one desire leftthat he shouldnt have been sold     chapter iv   then it was that one afternoon while the spring of the year was young and new she met all in her own way his frankest betrayal of these alarms he had gone in late to see her but evening hadnt settled and she was presented to him in that long fresh light of waning april days which affects us often with a sadness sharper than the greyest hours of autumn the week had been warm the spring was supposed to have begun early and may bartram sat for the first time in the year without a fire a fact that to marchers sense gave the scene of which she formed part a smooth and ultimate look an air of knowing in its immaculate order and cold meaningless cheer that it would never see a fire again  her own aspecthe could scarce have said whyintensified this note  almost as white as wax with the marks and signs in her face as numerous and as fine as if they had been etched by a needle with soft white draperies relieved by a faded green scarf on the delicate tone of which the years had further refined she was the picture of a serene and exquisite but impenetrable sphinx whose head or indeed all whose person might have been powdered with silver  she was a sphinx yet with her white petals and green fronds she might have been a lily tooonly an artificial lily wonderfully imitated and constantly kept without dust or stain though not exempt from a slight droop and a complexity of faint creases under some clear glass bell  the perfection of household care of high polish and finish always reigned in her rooms but they now looked most as if everything had been wound up tucked in put away so that she might sit with folded hands and with nothing more to do  she was out of it to marchers vision her work was over she communicated with him as across some gulf or from some island of rest that she had already reached and it made him feel strangely abandoned  was itor rather wasnt itthat if for so long she had been watching with him the answer to their question must have swum into her ken and taken on its name so that her occupation was verily gone  he had as much as charged her with this in saying to her many months before that she even then knew something she was keeping from him  it was a point he had never since ventured to press vaguely fearing as he did that it might become a difference perhaps a disagreement between them  he had in this later time turned nervous which was what he in all the other years had never been and the oddity was that his nervousness should have waited till he had begun to doubt should have held off so long as he was sure  there was something it seemed to him that the wrong word would bring down on his head something that would so at least ease off his tension  but he wanted not to speak the wrong word that would make everything ugly  he wanted the knowledge he lacked to drop on him if drop it could by its own august weight  if she was to forsake him it was surely for her to take leave this was why he didnt directly ask her again what she knew but it was also why approaching the matter from another side he said to her in the course of his visit what do you regard as the very worst that at this time of day can happen to me  he had asked her that in the past often enough they had with the odd irregular rhythm of their intensities and avoidances exchanged ideas about it and then had seen the ideas washed away by cool intervals washed like figures traced in seasand  it had ever been the mark of their talk that the oldest allusions in it required but a little dismissal and reaction to come out again sounding for the hour as new she could thus at present meet his enquiry quite freshly and patiently oh yes ive repeatedly thought only it always seemed to me of old that i couldnt quite make up my mind  i thought of dreadful things between which it was difficult to choose and so must you have done  rather  i feel now as if i had scarce done anything else  i appear to myself to have spent my life in thinking of nothing but dreadful things a great many of them ive at different times named to you but there were others i couldnt name  they were too too dreadful  too too dreadfulsome of them  she looked at him a minute and there came to him as he met it an inconsequent sense that her eyes when one got their full clearness were still as beautiful as they had been in youth only beautiful with a strange cold lighta light that somehow was a part of the effect if it wasnt rather a part of the cause of the pale hard sweetness of the season and the hour  and yet she said at last there are horrors weve mentioned  it deepened the strangeness to see her as such a figure in such a picture talk of horrors but she was to do in a few minutes something stranger yetthough even of this he was to take the full measure but afterwardsand the note of it already trembled  it was for the matter of that one of the signs that her eyes were having again the high flicker of their prime  he had to admit however what she said  oh yes there were times when we did go far  he caught himself in the act of speaking as if it all were over  well he wished it were and the consummation depended for him clearly more and more on his friend  but she had now a soft smile  oh far  it was oddly ironic  do you mean youre prepared to go further  she was frail and ancient and charming as she continued to look at him yet it was rather as if she had lost the thread  do you consider that we went far  why i thought it the point you were just makingthat we had looked most things in the face  including each other  she still smiled  but youre quite right weve had together great imaginations often great fears but some of them have been unspoken  then the worstwe havent faced that  i could face it i believe if i knew what you think it  i feel he explained as if i had lost my power to conceive such things  and he wondered if he looked as blank as he sounded  its spent  then why do you assume she asked that mine isnt  because youve given me signs to the contrary  it isnt a question for you of conceiving imagining comparing  it isnt a question now of choosing  at last he came out with it  you know something i dont youve shown me that before  these last words had affected her he made out in a moment exceedingly and she spoke with firmness  ive shown you my dear nothing  he shook his head  you cant hide it  oh oh may bartram sounded over what she couldnt hide  it was almost a smothered groan  you admitted it months ago when i spoke of it to you as of something you were afraid i should find out  your answer was that i couldnt that i wouldnt and i dont pretend i have  but you had something therefore in mind and i see now how it must have been how it still is the possibility that of all possibilities has settled itself for you as the worst  this he went on is why i appeal to you  im only afraid of ignorance todayim not afraid of knowledge  and then as for a while she said nothing what makes me sure is that i see in your face and feel here in this air and amid these appearances that youre out of it youve done  youve had your experience  you leave me to my fate  well she listened motionless and white in her chair as on a decision to be made so that her manner was fairly an avowal though still with a small fine inner stiffness an imperfect surrender  it would be the worst she finally let herself say  i mean the thing ive never said  it hushed him a moment  more monstrous than all the monstrosities weve named  more monstrous  isnt that what you sufficiently express she asked in calling it the worst  marcher thought  assuredlyif you mean as i do something that includes all the loss and all the shame that are thinkable  it would if it should happen said may bartram  what were speaking of remember is only my idea  its your belief marcher returned  thats enough for me  i feel your beliefs are right  therefore if having this one you give me no more light on it you abandon me  no no she repeated  im with youdont you seestill  and as to make it more vivid to him she rose from her chaira movement she seldom risked in these daysand showed herself all draped and all soft in her fairness and slimness  i havent forsaken you  it was really in its effort against weakness a generous assurance and had the success of the impulse not happily been great it would have touched him to pain more than to pleasure  but the cold charm in her eyes had spread as she hovered before him to all the rest of her person so that it was for the minute almost a recovery of youth  he couldnt pity her for that he could only take her as she showedas capable even yet of helping him  it was as if at the same time her light might at any instant go out wherefore he must make the most of it there passed before him with intensity the three or four things he wanted most to know but the question that came of itself to his lips really covered the others  then tell me if i shall consciously suffer  she promptly shook her head  never  it confirmed the authority he imputed to her and it produced on him an extraordinary effect  well whats better than that  do you call that the worst  you think nothing is better she asked  she seemed to mean something so special that he again sharply wondered though still with the dawn of a prospect of relief  why not if one doesnt know  after which as their eyes over his question met in a silence the dawn deepened and something to his purpose came prodigiously out of her very face  his own as he took it in suddenly flushed to the forehead and he gasped with the force of a perception to which on the instant everything fitted  the sound of his gasp filled the air then he became articulate  i seeif i dont suffer  in her own look however was doubt  you see what  why what you meanwhat youve always meant  she again shook her head  what i mean isnt what ive always meant its different  its something new  she hung back from it a little  something new  its not what you think  i see what you think  his divination drew breath then only her correction might be wrong  it isnt that i am a blockhead he asked between faintness and grimness it isnt that its all a mistake  a mistake she pityingly echoed  that possibility for her he saw would be monstrous and if she guaranteed him the immunity from pain it would accordingly not be what she had in mind  oh no she declared its nothing of that sort  youve been right  yet he couldnt help asking himself if she werent thus pressed speaking but to save him  it seemed to him he should be most in a hole if his history should prove all a platitude  are you telling me the truth so that i shant have been a bigger idiot than i can bear to know i havent lived with a vain imagination in the most besotted illusion i havent waited but to see the door shut in my face  she shook her head again  however the case stands that isnt the truth  whatever the reality it is a reality  the door isnt shut the doors open said may bartram  then somethings to come  she waited once again always with her cold sweet eyes on him  its never too late  she had with her gliding step diminished the distance between them and she stood nearer to him close to him a minute as if still charged with the unspoken  her movement might have been for some finer emphasis of what she was at once hesitating and deciding to say  he had been standing by the chimneypiece fireless and sparely adorned a small perfect old french clock and two morsels of rosy dresden constituting all its furniture and her hand grasped the shelf while she kept him waiting grasped it a little as for support and encouragement she only kept him waiting however that is he only waited  it had become suddenly from her movement and attitude beautiful and vivid to him that she had something more to give him her wasted face delicately shone with itit glittered almost as with the white lustre of silver in her expression  she was right incontestably for what he saw in her face was the truth and strangely without consequence while their talk of it as dreadful was still in the air she appeared to present it as inordinately soft  this prompting bewilderment made him but gape the more gratefully for her revelation so that they continued for some minutes silent her face shining at him her contact imponderably pressing and his stare all kind but all expectant  the end none the less was that what he had expected failed to come to him  something else took place instead which seemed to consist at first in the mere closing of her eyes  she gave way at the same instant to a slow fine shudder and though he remained staringthough he stared in fact but the harderturned off and regained her chair  it was the end of what she had been intending but it left him thinking only of that  well you dont say  she had touched in her passage a bell near the chimney and had sunk back strangely pale  im afraid im too ill  too ill to tell me it sprang up sharp to him and almost to his lips the fear she might die without giving him light  he checked himself in time from so expressing his question but she answered as if she had heard the words  dont you knownow  now   she had spoken as if some difference had been made within the moment  but her maid quickly obedient to her bell was already with them  i know nothing  and he was afterwards to say to himself that he must have spoken with odious impatience such an impatience as to show that supremely disconcerted he washed his hands of the whole question  oh said may bartram  are you in pain he asked as the woman went to her  no said may bartram  her maid who had put an arm round her as if to take her to her room fixed on him eyes that appealingly contradicted her in spite of which however he showed once more his mystification  what then has happened  she was once more with her companions help on her feet and feeling withdrawal imposed on him he had blankly found his hat and gloves and had reached the door  yet he waited for her answer  what was to she said     chapter v   he came back the next day but she was then unable to see him and as it was literally the first time this had occurred in the long stretch of their acquaintance he turned away defeated and sore almost angryor feeling at least that such a break in their custom was really the beginning of the endand wandered alone with his thoughts especially with the one he was least able to keep down  she was dying and he would lose her she was dying and his life would end  he stopped in the park into which he had passed and stared before him at his recurrent doubt away from her the doubt pressed again in her presence he had believed her but as he felt his forlornness he threw himself into the explanation that nearest at hand had most of a miserable warmth for him and least of a cold torment  she had deceived him to save himto put him off with something in which he should be able to rest  what could the thing that was to happen to him be after all but just this thing that had began to happen  her dying her death his consequent solitudethat was what he had figured as the beast in the jungle that was what had been in the lap of the gods  he had had her word for it as he left herwhat else on earth could she have meant  it wasnt a thing of a monstrous order not a fate rare and distinguished not a stroke of fortune that overwhelmed and immortalised it had only the stamp of the common doom  but poor marcher at this hour judged the common doom sufficient  it would serve his turn and even as the consummation of infinite waiting he would bend his pride to accept it  he sat down on a bench in the twilight  he hadnt been a fool  something had been as she had said to come before he rose indeed it had quite struck him that the final fact really matched with the long avenue through which he had had to reach it  as sharing his suspense and as giving herself all giving her life to bring it to an end she had come with him every step of the way  he had lived by her aid and to leave her behind would be cruelly damnably to miss her  what could be more overwhelming than that  well he was to know within the week for though she kept him a while at bay left him restless and wretched during a series of days on each of which he asked about her only again to have to turn away she ended his trial by receiving him where she had always received him  yet she had been brought out at some hazard into the presence of so many of the things that were consciously vainly half their past and there was scant service left in the gentleness of her mere desire all too visible to check his obsession and wind up his long trouble  that was clearly what she wanted the one thing more for her own peace while she could still put out her hand  he was so affected by her state that once seated by her chair he was moved to let everything go it was she herself therefore who brought him back took up again before she dismissed him her last word of the other time  she showed how she wished to leave their business in order  im not sure you understood youve nothing to wait for more  it has come  oh how he looked at her  really  really  the thing that as you said was to  the thing that we began in our youth to watch for  face to face with her once more he believed her it was a claim to which he had so abjectly little to oppose  you mean that it has come as a positive definite occurrence with a name and a date  positive  definite  i dont know about the name but oh with a date  he found himself again too helplessly at sea  but come in the nightcome and passed me by  may bartram had her strange faint smile  oh no it hasnt passed you by  but if i havent been aware of it and it hasnt touched me  ah your not being aware of itand she seemed to hesitate an instant to deal with thisyour not being aware of it is the strangeness in the strangeness  its the wonder of the wonder  she spoke as with the softness almost of a sick child yet now at last at the end of all with the perfect straightness of a sibyl  she visibly knew that she knew and the effect on him was of something coordinate in its high character with the law that had ruled him  it was the true voice of the law so on her lips would the law itself have sounded  it has touched you she went on  it has done its office  it has made you all its own  so utterly without my knowing it  so utterly without your knowing it  his hand as he leaned to her was on the arm of her chair and dimly smiling always now she placed her own on it  its enough if i know it  oh he confusedly breathed as she herself of late so often had done  what i long ago said is true  youll never know now and i think you ought to be content  youve had it said may bartram  but had what  why what was to have marked you out  the proof of your law  it has acted  im too glad she then bravely added to have been able to see what its not  he continued to attach his eyes to her and with the sense that it was all beyond him and that she was too he would still have sharply challenged her hadnt he so felt it an abuse of her weakness to do more than take devoutly what she gave him take it hushed as to a revelation if he did speak it was out of the foreknowledge of his loneliness to come  if youre glad of what its not it might then have been worse  she turned her eyes away she looked straight before her with which after a moment well you know our fears  he wondered  its something then we never feared  on this slowly she turned to him  did we ever dream with all our dreams that we should sit and talk of it thus  he tried for a little to make out that they had but it was as if their dreams numberless enough were in solution in some thick cold mist through which thought lost itself  it might have been that we couldnt talk  wellshe did her best for himnot from this side  this you see she said is the other side  i think poor marcher returned that all sides are the same to me then however as she gently shook her head in correction we mightnt as it were have got across  to where we areno  were hereshe made her weak emphasis  and much good does it do us was her friends frank comment  it does us the good it can  it does us the good that it isnt here its past  its behind said may bartram  before but her voice dropped  he had got up not to tire her but it was hard to combat his yearning she after all told him nothing but that his light had failedwhich he knew well enough without her  before he blankly echoed  before you see it was always to come  that kept it present  oh i dont care what comes now  besides marcher added it seems to me i liked it better present as you say than i can like it absent with your absence  oh mineand her pale hands made light of it  with the absence of everything  he had a dreadful sense of standing there before her forso far as anything but this proved this bottomless drop was concernedthe last time of their life  it rested on him with a weight he felt he could scarce bear and this weight it apparently was that still pressed out what remained in him of speakable protest  i believe you but i cant begin to pretend i understand  nothing for me is past nothing will pass till i pass myself which i pray my stars may be as soon as possible  say however he added that ive eaten my cake as you contend to the last crumbhow can the thing ive never felt at all be the thing i was marked out to feel  she met him perhaps less directly but she met him unperturbed  you take your feelings for granted  you were to suffer your fate  that was not necessarily to know it  how in the worldwhen what is such knowledge but suffering  she looked up at him a while in silence  noyou dont understand  i suffer said john marcher  dont dont  how can i help at least that  dont may bartram repeated  she spoke it in a tone so special in spite of her weakness that he stared an instantstared as if some light hitherto hidden had shimmered across his vision  darkness again closed over it but the gleam had already become for him an idea  because i havent the right  dont knowwhen you neednt she mercifully urged  you needntfor we shouldnt  shouldnt  if he could but know what she meant  no its too much  too much he still asked but with a mystification that was the next moment of a sudden to give way  her words if they meant something affected him in this lightthe light also of her wasted faceas meaning all and the sense of what knowledge had been for herself came over him with a rush which broke through into a question  is it of that then youre dying  she but watched him gravely at first as to see with this where he was and she might have seen something or feared something that moved her sympathy  i would live for you stillif i could  her eyes closed for a little as if withdrawn into herself she were for a last time trying but i cant she said as she raised them again to take leave of him  she couldnt indeed as but too promptly and sharply appeared and he had no vision of her after this that was anything but darkness and doom  they had parted for ever in that strange talk access to her chamber of pain rigidly guarded was almost wholly forbidden him he was feeling now moreover in the face of doctors nurses the two or three relatives attracted doubtless by the presumption of what she had to leave how few were the rights as they were called in such cases that he had to put forward and how odd it might even seem that their intimacy shouldnt have given him more of them  the stupidest fourth cousin had more even though she had been nothing in such a persons life  she had been a feature of features in his for what else was it to have been so indispensable  strange beyond saying were the ways of existence baffling for him the anomaly of his lack as he felt it to be of producible claim  a woman might have been as it were everything to him and it might yet present him in no connexion that any one seemed held to recognise  if this was the case in these closing weeks it was the case more sharply on the occasion of the last offices rendered in the great grey london cemetery to what had been mortal to what had been precious in his friend  the concourse at her grave was not numerous but he saw himself treated as scarce more nearly concerned with it than if there had been a thousand others  he was in short from this moment face to face with the fact that he was to profit extraordinarily little by the interest may bartram had taken in him  he couldnt quite have said what he expected but he hadnt surely expected this approach to a double privation  not only had her interest failed him but he seemed to feel himself unattendedand for a reason he couldnt seizeby the distinction the dignity the propriety if nothing else of the man markedly bereaved  it was as if in the view of society he had not been markedly bereaved as if there still failed some sign or proof of it and as if none the less his character could never be affirmed nor the deficiency ever made up  there were moments as the weeks went by when he would have liked by some almost aggressive act to take his stand on the intimacy of his loss in order that it might be questioned and his retort to the relief of his spirit so recorded but the moments of an irritation more helpless followed fast on these the moments during which turning things over with a good conscience but with a bare horizon he found himself wondering if he oughtnt to have begun so to speak further back  he found himself wondering indeed at many things and this last speculation had others to keep it company  what could he have done after all in her lifetime without giving them both as it were away he couldnt have made known she was watching him for that would have published the superstition of the beast  this was what closed his mouth nownow that the jungle had been thrashed to vacancy and that the beast had stolen away  it sounded too foolish and too flat the difference for him in this particular the extinction in his life of the element of suspense was such as in fact to surprise him  he could scarce have said what the effect resembled the abrupt cessation the positive prohibition of music perhaps more than anything else in some place all adjusted and all accustomed to sonority and to attention  if he could at any rate have conceived lifting the veil from his image at some moment of the past what had he done after all if not lift it to her so to do this today to talk to people at large of the jungle cleared and confide to them that he now felt it as safe would have been not only to see them listen as to a goodwifes tale but really to hear himself tell one  what it presently came to in truth was that poor marcher waded through his beaten grass where no life stirred where no breath sounded where no evil eye seemed to gleam from a possible lair very much as if vaguely looking for the beast and still more as if acutely missing it  he walked about in an existence that had grown strangely more spacious and stopping fitfully in places where the undergrowth of life struck him as closer asked himself yearningly wondered secretly and sorely if it would have lurked here or there  it would have at all events sprung what was at least complete was his belief in the truth itself of the assurance given him  the change from his old sense to his new was absolute and final what was to happen had so absolutely and finally happened that he was as little able to know a fear for his future as to know a hope so absent in short was any question of anything still to come  he was to live entirely with the other question that of his unidentified past that of his having to see his fortune impenetrably muffled and masked  the torment of this vision became then his occupation he couldnt perhaps have consented to live but for the possibility of guessing  she had told him his friend not to guess she had forbidden him so far as he might to know and she had even in a sort denied the power in him to learn which were so many things precisely to deprive him of rest  it wasnt that he wanted he argued for fairness that anything past and done should repeat itself it was only that he shouldnt as an anticlimax have been taken sleeping so sound as not to be able to win back by an effort of thought the lost stuff of consciousness  he declared to himself at moments that he would either win it back or have done with consciousness for ever he made this idea his one motive in fine made it so much his passion that none other to compare with it seemed ever to have touched him  the lost stuff of consciousness became thus for him as a strayed or stolen child to an unappeasable father he hunted it up and down very much as if he were knocking at doors and enquiring of the police  this was the spirit in which inevitably he set himself to travel he started on a journey that was to be as long as he could make it it danced before him that as the other side of the globe couldnt possibly have less to say to him it might by a possibility of suggestion have more  before he quitted london however he made a pilgrimage to may bartrams grave took his way to it through the endless avenues of the grim suburban necropolis sought it out in the wilderness of tombs and though he had come but for the renewal of the act of farewell found himself when he had at last stood by it beguiled into long intensities  he stood for an hour powerless to turn away and yet powerless to penetrate the darkness of death fixing with his eyes her inscribed name and date beating his forehead against the fact of the secret they kept drawing his breath while he waited as if some sense would in pity of him rise from the stones  he kneeled on the stones however in vain they kept what they concealed and if the face of the tomb did become a face for him it was because her two names became a pair of eyes that didnt know him  he gave them a last long look but no palest light broke     chapter vi   he stayed away after this for a year he visited the depths of asia spending himself on scenes of romantic interest of superlative sanctity but what was present to him everywhere was that for a man who had known what he had known the world was vulgar and vain  the state of mind in which he had lived for so many years shone out to him in reflexion as a light that coloured and refined a light beside which the glow of the east was garish cheap and thin  the terrible truth was that he had lostwith everything elsea distinction as well the things he saw couldnt help being common when he had become common to look at them  he was simply now one of them himselfhe was in the dust without a peg for the sense of difference and there were hours when before the temples of gods and the sepulchres of kings his spirit turned for nobleness of association to the barely discriminated slab in the london suburb  that had become for him and more intensely with time and distance his one witness of a past glory  it was all that was left to him for proof or pride yet the past glories of pharaohs were nothing to him as he thought of it  small wonder then that he came back to it on the morrow of his return  he was drawn there this time as irresistibly as the other yet with a confidence almost that was doubtless the effect of the many months that had elapsed  he had lived in spite of himself into his change of feeling and in wandering over the earth had wandered as might be said from the circumference to the centre of his desert  he had settled to his safety and accepted perforce his extinction figuring to himself with some colour in the likeness of certain little old men he remembered to have seen of whom all meagre and wizened as they might look it was related that they had in their time fought twenty duels or been loved by ten princesses  they indeed had been wondrous for others while he was but wondrous for himself which however was exactly the cause of his haste to renew the wonder by getting back as he might put it into his own presence  that had quickened his steps and checked his delay  if his visit was prompt it was because he had been separated so long from the part of himself that alone he now valued  its accordingly not false to say that he reached his goal with a certain elation and stood there again with a certain assurance  the creature beneath the sod knew of his rare experience so that strangely now the place had lost for him its mere blankness of expression  it met him in mildnessnot as before in mockery it wore for him the air of conscious greeting that we find after absence in things that have closely belonged to us and which seem to confess of themselves to the connexion  the plot of ground the graven tablet the tended flowers affected him so as belonging to him that he resembled for the hour a contented landlord reviewing a piece of property  whatever had happenedwell had happened  he had not come back this time with the vanity of that question his former worrying what what now practically so spent  yet he would none the less never again so cut himself off from the spot he would come back to it every month for if he did nothing else by its aid he at least held up his head  it thus grew for him in the oddest way a positive resource he carried out his idea of periodical returns which took their place at last among the most inveterate of his habits  what it all amounted to oddly enough was that in his finally so simplified world this garden of death gave him the few square feet of earth on which he could still most live  it was as if being nothing anywhere else for any one nothing even for himself he were just everything here and if not for a crowd of witnesses or indeed for any witness but john marcher then by clear right of the register that he could scan like an open page  the open page was the tomb of his friend and there were the facts of the past there the truth of his life there the backward reaches in which he could lose himself  he did this from time to time with such effect that he seemed to wander through the old years with his hand in the arm of a companion who was in the most extraordinary manner his other his younger self and to wander which was more extraordinary yet round and round a third presencenot wandering she but stationary still whose eyes turning with his revolution never ceased to follow him and whose seat was his point so to speak of orientation  thus in short he settled to livefeeding all on the sense that he once had lived and dependent on it not alone for a support but for an identity  it sufficed him in its way for months and the year elapsed it would doubtless even have carried him further but for an accident superficially slight which moved him quite in another direction with a force beyond any of his impressions of egypt or of india  it was a thing of the merest chancethe turn as he afterwards felt of a hair though he was indeed to live to believe that if light hadnt come to him in this particular fashion it would still have come in another  he was to live to believe this i say though he was not to live i may not less definitely mention to do much else  we allow him at any rate the benefit of the conviction struggling up for him at the end that whatever might have happened or not happened he would have come round of himself to the light  the incident of an autumn day had put the match to the train laid from of old by his misery  with the light before him he knew that even of late his ache had only been smothered  it was strangely drugged but it throbbed at the touch it began to bleed  and the touch in the event was the face of a fellowmortal  this face one grey afternoon when the leaves were thick in the alleys looked into marchers own at the cemetery with an expression like the cut of a blade  he felt it that is so deep down that he winced at the steady thrust  the person who so mutely assaulted him was a figure he had noticed on reaching his own goal absorbed by a grave a short distance away a grave apparently fresh so that the emotion of the visitor would probably match it for frankness  this fact alone forbade further attention though during the time he stayed he remained vaguely conscious of his neighbour a middleaged man apparently in mourning whose bowed back among the clustered monuments and mortuary yews was constantly presented  marchers theory that these were elements in contact with which he himself revived had suffered on this occasion it may be granted a marked an excessive check  the autumn day was dire for him as none had recently been and he rested with a heaviness he had not yet known on the low stone table that bore may bartrams name  he rested without power to move as if some spring in him some spell vouchsafed had suddenly been broken for ever  if he could have done that moment as he wanted he would simply have stretched himself on the slab that was ready to take him treating it as a place prepared to receive his last sleep  what in all the wide world had he now to keep awake for  he stared before him with the question and it was then that as one of the cemetery walks passed near him he caught the shock of the face  his neighbour at the other grave had withdrawn as he himself with force enough in him would have done by now and was advancing along the path on his way to one of the gates  this brought him close and his pace was slow so thatand all the more as there was a kind of hunger in his lookthe two men were for a minute directly confronted  marcher knew him at once for one of the deeply strickena perception so sharp that nothing else in the picture comparatively lived neither his dress his age nor his presumable character and class nothing lived but the deep ravage of the features that he showed  he showed themthat was the point he was moved as he passed by some impulse that was either a signal for sympathy or more possibly a challenge to an opposed sorrow he might already have been aware of our friend might at some previous hour have noticed in him the smooth habit of the scene with which the state of his own senses so scantly consorted and might thereby have been stirred as by an overt discord  what marcher was at all events conscious of was in the first place that the image of scarred passion presented to him was conscious tooof something that profaned the air and in the second that roused startled shocked he was yet the next moment looking after it as it went with envy  the most extraordinary thing that had happened to himthough he had given that name to other matters as welltook place after his immediate vague stare as a consequence of this impression  the stranger passed but the raw glare of his grief remained making our friend wonder in pity what wrong what wound it expressed what injury not to be healed  what had the man had to make him by the loss of it so bleed and yet live  somethingand this reached him with a pangthat he john marcher hadnt the proof of which was precisely john marchers arid end  no passion had ever touched him for this was what passion meant he had survived and maundered and pined but where had been his deep ravage the extraordinary thing we speak of was the sudden rush of the result of this question  the sight that had just met his eyes named to him as in letters of quick flame something he had utterly insanely missed and what he had missed made these things a train of fire made them mark themselves in an anguish of inward throbs  he had seen outside of his life not learned it within the way a woman was mourned when she had been loved for herself such was the force of his conviction of the meaning of the strangers face which still flared for him as a smoky torch  it hadnt come to him the knowledge on the wings of experience it had brushed him jostled him upset him with the disrespect of chance the insolence of accident  now that the illumination had begun however it blazed to the zenith and what he presently stood there gazing at was the sounded void of his life  he gazed he drew breath in pain he turned in his dismay and turning he had before him in sharper incision than ever the open page of his story  the name on the table smote him as the passage of his neighbour had done and what it said to him full in the face was that she was what he had missed  this was the awful thought the answer to all the past the vision at the dread clearness of which he turned as cold as the stone beneath him  everything fell together confessed explained overwhelmed leaving him most of all stupefied at the blindness he had cherished  the fate he had been marked for he had met with a vengeancehe had emptied the cup to the lees he had been the man of his time the man to whom nothing on earth was to have happened  that was the rare strokethat was his visitation  so he saw it as we say in pale horror while the pieces fitted and fitted  so she had seen it while he didnt and so she served at this hour to drive the truth home  it was the truth vivid and monstrous that all the while he had waited the wait was itself his portion  this the companion of his vigil had at a given moment made out and she had then offered him the chance to baffle his doom  ones doom however was never baffled and on the day she told him his own had come down she had seen him but stupidly stare at the escape she offered him  the escape would have been to love her then then he would have lived she had livedwho could say now with what passionsince she had loved him for himself whereas he had never thought of her ah how it hugely glared at him but in the chill of his egotism and the light of her use  her spoken words came back to himthe chain stretched and stretched  the beast had lurked indeed and the beast at its hour had sprung it had sprung in that twilight of the cold april when pale ill wasted but all beautiful and perhaps even then recoverable she had risen from her chair to stand before him and let him imaginably guess  it had sprung as he didnt guess it had sprung as she hopelessly turned from him and the mark by the time he left her had fallen where it was to fall  he had justified his fear and achieved his fate he had failed with the last exactitude of all he was to fail of and a moan now rose to his lips as he remembered she had prayed he mightnt know this horror of wakingthis was knowledge knowledge under the breath of which the very tears in his eyes seemed to freeze  through them none the less he tried to fix it and hold it he kept it there before him so that he might feel the pain  that at least belated and bitter had something of the taste of life  but the bitterness suddenly sickened him and it was as if horribly he saw in the truth in the cruelty of his image what had been appointed and done  he saw the jungle of his life and saw the lurking beast then while he looked perceived it as by a stir of the air rise huge and hideous for the leap that was to settle him  his eyes darkenedit was close and instinctively turning in his hallucination to avoid it he flung himself face down on the tomb
