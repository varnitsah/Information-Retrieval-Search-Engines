burleydon had an income of two thousand a year could speak all the polite languages fluently was a powerful swordsman a good shot and could ride anything from an elephant to a clotheshorse i really think i have said enough to satisfy any feminine novelreader of bayswater or south kensington that i was a hero  my brothers wife however did not seem to incline to this belief  a more conceited selfsatisfied little cad i never met than you she said  why dont you try to do something instead of sneering at others who do  you never take anything seriouslyexcept yourself which isnt worth it  you are proud of your red hair and peaked nose just because you fondly believe that you got them from the prince of trulyruralania and are willing to think evil of your ancestress to satisfy your snobbish little soul  let me tell you sir that there was no more truth about that than there was in that silly talk of her partiality for her husbands redhaired gamekeeper in scotland  ah that makes you startdont it  but i have always observed that a mule is apt to remember only the horse side of his ancestry  whenever my pretty sisterinlaw talks in this way i always try to forget that she came of a family far inferior to our own the razorbills  indeed her peopleof the nonconformist stockreally had nothing but wealth and rectitude and i think my brother bob in his genuine love for her was willing to overlook the latter for the sake of the former  my pretty sisterinlaws interest in my affairs always made me believe that she secretly worshiped mealthough it was a fact as will be seen in the progress of this story that most women blushed on my addressing them  i used to say it was the reflection of my red hair on a transparent complexion which was rather neatwasnt it  and subtle but then i was always saying such subtle things  my dear rose i said laying down my egg spoon the egg spoon really had nothing to do with this speech but it imparted such a delightfully realistic flavor to the scene im not to blame if i resemble the shelpburgs  its your being so beastly proud of it that i object to she replied and for heavens sake try to be something and not merely resemble things  the fact is you resemble too muchyoure always resembling you resemble a man of fashion and youre not a wit and youre not a soldier a sportsman a heroand youre none of em  altogether youre not in the least convincing  now listen  theres a good chance for you to go as our attache with lord mumblepeg the new ambassador to cochin china  in all the novels you know attaches are always the confidants of grand duchesses and know more state secrets than their chiefs in real life i believe they are something like a city clerk with a leaning to private theatricals  say youll go  do  ill take a few months holiday first i replied and then i added in my gay dashing way if the place is openhang it if i dont go  good old bounder she said and dont think too much of that precious prince rupert  he was a bad lot  she blushed again at meas her husband entered  take roses advice rupert my boy he said and go  and that is how i came to go to trulyruralania  for i secretly resolved to take my holiday in traveling in that country and trying as dear lady burleydon put it really to be somebody instead of resembling anybody in particular  a precious lot she knew about it    chapter ii  in which my hair causes a lot of things  you go to trulyruralania from charing cross  in passing through paris we picked up mlle beljambe who was going to kohlslau the capital of trulyruralania to marry the grand duke michael who however as i was informed was in love with the princess flirtia she blushed on seeing mebut i was told afterwards declined being introduced to me on any account  however i thought nothing of this and went on to bock the next station to kohlslau  at the little inn in the forest i was informed i was just in time to see the coronation of the new king the next day  the landlady and her daughter were very communicative and after the fashion of the simple guileless stage peasant instantly informed me what everybody was doing and at once explained the situation  she told me that the grand duke michaelor black michael as he was calledhimself aspired to the throne as well as to the hand of the princess flirtia but was hated by the populace who preferred the young heir prince rupert because he had the hair and features of the dynasty of the shelpburgs which she added are singularly like your own  but is red hair so very peculiar here i asked  among the jewsyes sire  i mean yes sir she corrected herself you seldom see a redheaded jew  the jews i repeated in astonishment  of course you know the shelpburgs are descended directly from solomonand have indeed some of his matrimonial peculiarities she said blushing  i was amazedbut recalled myself  but why do they call the duke of kohlslau black michael i asked carelessly  because he is nearly black sir  you see when the great prince rupert went abroad in the old time he visited england scotland and africa  they say he married an african lady thereand that the duke is really more in the direct line of succession than prince rupert  but here the daughter showed me to my room  she blushed of course and apologized for not bringing a candle as she thought my hair was sufficiently illuminating  but she added with another blush i do so like it  i replied by giving her something of no valuea belgian nickel which wouldnt pass in bock as i had found to my cost  but my hair had evidently attracted attention from others for on my return to the guestroom a stranger approached me and in the purest and most precise germanthe court or olland hof speechaddressed me  have you the red hair of the fair king or the hair of your father  luckily i was able to reply with the same purity and precision i have both the hair of the fair king and my own  but i have not the hair of my father nor of black michael nor of the innkeeper nor the innkeepers wife  the red heir of the fair king would be a son  possibly this delicate mot on the approaching marriage of the king was lost in the translation for the stranger strode abruptly away i learned however that the king was actually then in bock at the castle a few miles distant in the woods  i resolved to stroll thither  it was a fine old mediaeval structure  but as the singular incidents i am about to relate combine the romantic and adventurous atmosphere of the middle ages with all the appliances of modern times i may briefly state that the castle was lit by electricity bad fireescapes on each of the turrets four lifts and was fitted up by one of the best west end establishments  the sanitary arrangements were excellent and the drainage of the most perfect order as i had reason to know personally later  i was so affected by the peaceful solitude that i lay down under a tree and presently fell asleep  i was awakened by the sound of voices and looking up beheld two men bending over me  one was a grizzled veteran and the other a younger dandyfied man both were dressed in shooting suits  never saw such a resemblance before in all my life said the elder man  pon my soul if the king hadnt got shaved yesterday because the princess flirtia said his beard tickled her id swear it was he  i could not help thinking how lucky it wasfor this narrativethat the king had shaved otherwise my story would have degenerated into a mere comedy of errors  opening my eyes i said boldly  now that you are satisfied who i resemble gentlemen perhaps you will tell me who you are  certainly said the elder curtly  i am spitza simple colonel of his majestys yet nevertheless the one man who runs this whole dynastyand this young gentleman is fritz my lieutenant and you are  my name is razorbillbrother to lord burleydon i replied calmly  good heavens another of the lot he muttered  then correcting himself he said brusquely any relation to that englishwoman who was so sweet on the old rupert centuries ago  here again i suppose my sisterinlaw would have had me knock down the foreign insulter of my english ancestressbut i colored to the roots of my hair and even fartherwith pleasure at this proof of my royal descent  and then a cheery voice was heard calling spitz and fritz through the woods  the king said spitz to fritz quickly  he must not see him  too late said fritz as a young man bounded lightly out of the bushes  i was thunderstruck  it was as if i had suddenly been confronted with a mirrorand beheld myself  of course he was not quite so goodlooking or so tall but he was still a colorable imitation i was delighted  nevertheless for a moment he did not seem to reciprocate my feeling he stared at me staggered back and passed his hand across his forehead  can it be he muttered thickly that ive got em agin yet i only hadshingle glash  but fritz quickly interposed  your majesty is all rightthough he added in a lower voice let this be a warning to you for tomorrow  this gentleman is mr razorbillyou know the old story of the razorbillsha ha  but the king did not laugh he extended his hand and said gently you are welcomemy cousin  indeed my sisterinlaw would have probably said thatdissipated though he washe was the only gentleman there  i have come to see the coronation your majesty i said  and you shall said the king heartily and shall go with us the show cant begin without useh spitz he added playfully poking the veteran in the ribs whatever michael may do  then he linked his arms in spitzs and mine  lets go to the hutand have some supper and fizz he said gayly  we went to the hut  we had supper  we ate and drank heavily  we danced madly around the table  nevertheless i thought that spitz and fritz were worried by the kings potations and spitz at last went so far as to remind his majesty that they were to start early in the morning for kohlslau  i noticed also that as the king drank his speech grew thicker and spitz and fritz exchanged glances  at last spitz said with stern significance  your majesty has not forgotten the test invariably submitted to the king at his coronation  shertenly not replied the king with his reckless laugh  the king mush be able to pronounshname of his countryintellillilgibly mush shay hic im king ofking oftootootoorallooralanyer he staggered laughed and fell under the table  he cannot say it gasped fritz and spitz in one voice  he is lost  unless said fritz suddenly pointing at me with a flash of intelligence he can personate him and say it  can you he turned to me brusquely  it was an awful moment  i had been drinking heavily too but i resolved to succeed  im king of troolyrooly i murmured but i could not master iti staggered and followed the king under the table  is there no one here roared spitz who can shave thish dynasty and shay tooral  no  it  i mean trularlooral but he too lurched hopelessly forward  no one can say toorallooral muttered fritz and grasping spitz in despair they both rolled under the table  how long we lay there heaven knows  i was awakened by spitz playing the garden hose on me  he was booted and spurred with fritz by his side  the king was lying on a bench saying feebly blesh you my chillen  by politely acceding to black michaels request to try our oneandsix sherry he has been brought to this condition said spitz bitterly  its a trick to keep him from being crowned  in this country if the king is crowned while drunk the kingdom instantly reverts to a villainno matter who  but in this case the villain is black michael  ha what say you lad  shall we frustrate the rascal by having you personate the king  i waswellintoxicated at the thought  but what would my sisterinlaw say  would shein her nonconformist conscienceconsider it strictly honorable  but i swept all scruples aside  a king was to be saved  i will go i said  let us on to kohlslauriding like the wind  we rode like the wind furiously madly  mounted on a wild dashing bayknown familiarly as the bay of biscay from its rough turbulencei easily kept the lead but our horses began to fail  suddenly spitz halted clapped his hand to his head and threw himself from his horse  fools he said we should have taken the train  it will get there an hour before we will  he pointed to a wayside station where the 715 excursion train for kohlslau was waiting  but how dreadfully unmediaevalwhat will the public say i began  bother the public he said gruffly  whos running this dynastyyou or i  come  with the assistance of fritz he tied up my face with a handkerchief to simulate toothache and then with a shout of defiance we three rushed madly into a closely packed thirdclass carriage  never shall i forget the perils the fatigue the hopes and fears of that mad journey  panting perspiring packed together with cheap trippers but exalted with the one hope of saving the king we at last staggered out on the kohlslau platform utterly exhausted  as we did so we heard a distant roar from the city fritz turned an ashen gray spitz a livid blue  are we too late he gasped as we madly fought our way into the street where shouts of the king  the king were rending the air  can it be black michael  but here the crowd parted and a procession preceded by outriders flashed into the square  and there seated in a carriage beside the most beautiful redhaired girl i had ever seen was the kingthe king whom we had left two hours ago dead drunk in the hut in the forest    chapters iii to xxii inclusive  in which things get mixed  we reeled against each other aghast  spitz recovered himself first we must fly he said hoarsely  if the king has discovered our trickwe are lost  but where shall we go i asked  back to the hut  we caught the next train to bock  an hour later we stood panting within the hut  its walls and ceiling were splashed with sinister red stains  blood i exclaimed joyfully  at last we have a real mediaeval adventure  its burgundy you fool growled spitz good burgundy wasted at this moment fritz appeared dragging in the hutkeeper  where is the king demanded spitz fiercely of the trembling peasant  he was carried away an hour ago by black michael and taken to the castle  and when did he leave the castle roared spitz  he never left the castle sir and alas i fear never will alive replied the man shuddering  we stared at each other  spitz bit his grizzled mustache  so he said bitterly black michael has simply anticipated us with the same game  we have been tricked  i knew it could not be the king whom they crowned  no he added quickly i see it allit was rupert of glasgow  who is rupert of glasgow i cried  oh i really cant go over all that family rot again grunted spitz tell him fritz  then taking me aside fritz delicately informed me that rupert of glasgowa young scotchmanclaimed equally with myself descent from the old rupert and that equally with myself he resembled the king that michael had got possession of him on his arrival in the country kept him closely guarded in the castle and had hid his resemblance in a black wig and false mustache that the young scotchman however seemed apparently devoted to michael and his plots and there was undoubtedly some secret understanding between them  that it was evidently michaels trick to have the pretender crowned and then by exposing the fraud and the condition of the real king excite the indignation of the duped people and seat himself on the throne but i burst out shall this baseborn pretender remain at kohlslau beside the beautiful princess flirtia let us to kohlslau at once and hurl him from the throne  one pretender is as good as another said spitz dryly  but leave him to me  tis the king we must protect and succor  as for that scotch springald before midnight i shall have him kidnaped brought back to his master in a close carriage and youyou shall take his place at kohlslau  i will i said enthusiastically drawing my sword but i have done nothing yet  please let me kill something  aye lad said spitz with a grim smile at my enthusiasm theres a sheep in your path  go out and cleave it to the saddle and bring the saddle home  my sisterinlaw might have thought me cruelbut i did it    chap xxiii and some other chaps  i know not how it was compassed but that night rupert of glasgow was left bound and gagged against the door of the castle and the nightbell pulled  and that night i was seated on the throne of the shelpburgs  as i gazed at the princess flirtia glowing in the characteristic beauty of the shelpburgs and admired her striking profile i murmured softly and half audibly her nose is as a tower that looketh toward damascus  she looked puzzled and knitted her pretty brows  is that poetry she asked  no i said promptly  its only part of a song of our great ancestor  as she blushed slightly i playfully flung around her fair neck the jeweled collar of the order of the shelpburgsthree golden spheres pendant quartered from the arms of lombardywith the ancient syric motto el ess dee  she toyed with it a moment and then said softly you have changed rupert  do ye no ken hoo  i looked at heras surprised at her dialect as at the imputation  you dont talk that way as you did  and you dont say it will be twelve oclock when you mean it is twelve oclock nor i will be going out when you mean i am  and you didnt say eh sirs or eh mon to any of the courtnor hoot awa nor any of those things  and she added with a divine little pout you havent told me i was sonsie or bonnie once  i could with difficulty restrain myself  rage indignation and jealousy filled my heart almost to bursting  i understood it all that rascally scotchman had made the most of his time and dared to get ahead of me  i did not mind being taken for the king but to be confounded with this infernal descendant of a gamekeeperwas too much yet with a superhuman effort i remained calmand even smiled  you are not well said the princess earnestly  i thought you were taking too much of the strasbourg pie at supper  and you are not going surelyso soon she added as i rose  i must go at once i said  i have forgotten some important business at bock  not boar hunting again she said poutingly  no im hunting a red dear i said with that playful subtlety which would make her take it as a personal compliment though i was only thinking of that impostor and longing to get at him as i bowed and withdrew  in another hour i was before black michaels castle at bock  these are lightning changes i knowand the sovereignty of trulyruralania was somewhat itinerantbut when a kingdom and a beautiful princess are at stake what are you to do  fritz had begged me to take him along but i arranged that he should come later and go up unostentatiously in the lift  i was going by way of the moat  i was to succor the king but i fear my real object was to get at rupert of glasgow  i had noticed the day before that a large outside drain pipe decreed by the bock county council ran from the moat to the third floor of the donjon keep  i surmised that the king was imprisoned on that floor examining the pipe closely i saw that it was really a pneumatic dispatch tube for secretly conveying letters and dispatches from the castle through the moat beyond the castle walls  its extraordinary size however gave me the horrible conviction that it was to be used to convey the dead body of the king to the moat  i grew cold with horrorbut i was determined  i crept up the pipe  as i expected it opened funnelwise into a room where the poor king was playing poker with black michael  it took me but a moment to dash through the window into the room push the king aside gag and bind black michael and lower him by a stout rope into the pipe he had destined for another  having him in my power i lowered him until i heard his body splash in the water in the lower part of the pipe  then i proceeded to draw him up again intending to question him in regard to rupert of glasgow but this was difficult as his saturated clothing made him fit the smooth pipe closely  at last i had him partly up when i was amazed at a rush of water from the pipe which flooded the room  i dropped him and pulled him up again with the same result  then in a flash i saw it all  his body acting like a piston in the pipe had converted it into a powerful pump  mad with joy i rapidly lowered and pulled him up again and again until the castle was floodedand the moat completely drained  i had created the diversion i wished the tenants of the castle were disorganized and bewildered in trying to escape from the deluge and the moat was accessible to my friends  placing the poor king on a table to be out of the water and tying up his head in my handkerchief to disguise him from michaels guards i drew my sword and plunged downstairs with the cataract in search of the miscreant rupert  i reached the drawbridge when i heard the sounds of tumult and was twice fired atonce as i have since learned by my friends under the impression that i was the escaping rupert of glasgow and once by black michaels myrmidons under the belief that i was the king  i was struck by the fact that these resemblances were confusing and unfortunate  at this moment however i caught sight of a kilted figure leaping from a lower window into the moat  some instinct impelled me to follow it  it rapidly crossed the moat and plunged into the forest with me in pursuit  i gained upon it suddenly it turned and i found myself again confronted with myselfand apparently the king  but that very resemblance made me recognize the scotch pretender rupert of glasgow  yet he would have been called a braw laddie and his handsome face showed a laughing good humor even while he opposed me claymore in hand  bide a wee maister rupert razorbill he said lightly lowering his sword before we slit ane anithers weasands  im no claimin any descent frae kings and im no acceptin any auld wifes clavers against my women forbears as ye are  im just paid gude honest siller by black michael for the using of ma face and figuresic time as his majesty is tae worse frae trink  and im commeesioned frae michael to ask ye what price ye would take to join me in performing these dutiesturn and turn aboot  eh laddiebut he would pay ye mair than that daft beggar spitz  rage and disgust overpowered me  and this is my answer i said rushing upon him  i have said earlier in these pages that i was a strong swordsman in point of fact i had carefully studied in the transpontine theatres that form of melodramatic mediaeval swordplay known as two up and two down  to my disgust however this wretched scotchman did not seem to understand it but in a twinkling sent my sword flying over my head before i could recover it he had mounted a horse ready saddled in the wood and shouting to me that he would take my compleements to the princess galloped away even then i would have pursued him afoot but hearing shouts behind me i turned as spitz and fritz rode up  has the king escaped to kohlslau asked fritz staring at me  no i said but rupert of glasgow  rupert of glasgow growled spitz  weve settled him  hes gagged and bound and is now on his way to the frontier in a close carriage  ruperton his way to the frontier i gasped  yes  two of my men found him disguised with a handkerchief over his face trying to escape from the castle  and while we were looking for the king whom we supposed was with you they have sent the rascally scotchman home  fool i gasped  rupert of glasgow has just left me  you have deported your own king  and overcome by my superhuman exertions i sank unconscious to the ground  when i came to i found myself in a wagon lit speeding beyond the trulyruralania frontier  on my berth was lying a missive with the seal of the shelpburgs  tearing it open i recognized the handwriting of the princess flirtia   my dear rupertowing to the confusion that arises from there being so many of you i have concluded to accept the hand of the duke michael i may not become a queen but i shall bring rest to my country and michael assures me in his playful manner that three of a kind even of the same color do not always win at poker  it will tranquilize you somewhat to know that the lord chancellor assures me that on examining the records of the dynasty he finds that my ancestor rupert never left his kingdom during his entire reign and that consequently your ancestress has been grossly maligned  i am sending typewritten copies of this to rupert of glasgow and the king  farewell  flirtia   once a year at christmastide i receive a simple foreign hamper via charing cross marked return empty  i take it in silence to my own room and there opening it i findunseen by any other eyes but my owna modest pate de foie gras of the kind i ate with the princess flirtia  i take out the pate replace the label and have the hamper reconveyed to charing cross     the stolen cigar case  by a con dle  i found hemlock jones in the old brook street lodgings musing before the fire  with the freedom of an old friend i at once threw myself in my usual familiar attitude at his feet and gently caressed his boot i was induced to do this for two reasons one that it enabled me to get a good look at his bent concentrated face and the other that it seemed to indicate my reverence for his superhuman insight  so absorbed was he even then in tracking some mysterious clue that he did not seem to notice me  but therein i was wrongas i always was in my attempt to understand that powerful intellect  it is raining he said without lifting his head  you have been out then i said quickly  no  but i see that your umbrella is wet and that your overcoat has drops of water on it  i sat aghast at his penetration  after a pause he said carelessly as if dismissing the subject besides i hear the rain on the window listen  i listened  i could scarcely credit my ears but there was the soft pattering of drops on the panes  it was evident there was no deceiving this man  have you been busy lately i asked changing the subject  what new problemgiven up by scotland yard as inscrutablehas occupied that gigantic intellect  he drew back his foot slightly and seemed to hesitate ere he returned it to its original position  then he answered wearily mere triflesnothing to speak of  the prince kupoli has been here to get my advice regarding the disappearance of certain rubies from the kremlin the rajah of pootibad after vainly beheading his entire bodyguard has been obliged to seek my assistance to recover a jeweled sword  the grand duchess of pretzelbrauntswig is desirous of discovering where her husband was on the night of february 14 and last nighthe lowered his voice slightlya lodger in this very house meeting me on the stairs wanted to know why they didnt answer his bell  i could not help smilinguntil i saw a frown gathering on his inscrutable forehead  pray remember he said coldly that it was through such an apparently trivial question that i found out why paul ferroll killed his wife and what happened to jones  i became dumb at once  he paused for a moment and then suddenly changing back to his usual pitiless analytical style he said when i say these are trifles they are so in comparison to an affair that is now before me  a crime has been committedand singularly enough against myself  you start he said  you wonder who would have dared to attempt it  so did i nevertheless it has been done  i have been robbed  you robbed  you hemlock jones the terror of peculators i gasped in amazement arising and gripping the table as i faced him  yes  listen  i would confess it to no other  but you who have followed my career who know my methods you for whom i have partly lifted the veil that conceals my plans from ordinary humanityyou who have for years rapturously accepted my confidences passionately admired my inductions and inferences placed yourself at my beck and call become my slave groveled at my feet given up your practice except those few unremunerative and rapidly decreasing patients to whom in moments of abstraction over my problems you have administered strychnine for quinine and arsenic for epsom salts you who have sacrificed anything and everybody to meyou i make my confidant  i arose and embraced him warmly yet he was already so engrossed in thought that at the same moment he mechanically placed his hand upon his watch chain as if to consult the time  sit down he said  have a cigar  i have given up cigar smoking i said  why he asked  i hesitated and perhaps colored  i had really given it up because with my diminished practice it was too expensive  i could afford only a pipe  i prefer a pipe i said laughingly but tell me of this robbery  what have you lost  he arose and planting himself before the fire with his hands under his coattails looked down upon me reflectively for a moment  do you remember the cigar case presented to me by the turkish ambassador for discovering the missing favorite of the grand vizier in the fifth chorus girl at the hilarity theatre  it was that one i mean the cigar case  it was incrusted with diamonds  and the largest one had been supplanted by paste i said  ah he said with a reflective smile you know that  you told me yourself  i remember considering it a proof of your extraordinary perception  but by jove you dont mean to say you have lost it  he was silent for a moment  no it has been stolen it is true but i shall still find it  and by myself alone  in your profession my dear fellow when a member is seriously ill he does not prescribe for himself but calls in a brother doctor  therein we differ  i shall take this matter in my own hands  and where could you find better i said enthusiastically  i should say the cigar case is as good as recovered already  i shall remind you of that again he said lightly  and now to show you my confidence in your judgment in spite of my determination to pursue this alone i am willing to listen to any suggestions from you  he drew a memorandum book from his pocket and with a grave smile took up his pencil  i could scarcely believe my senses  he the great hemlock jones accepting suggestions from a humble individual like myself  i kissed his hand reverently and began in a joyous tone  first i should advertise offering a reward i should give the same intimation in handbills distributed at the pubs and the pastrycooks  i should next visit the different pawnbrokers i should give notice at the police station  i should examine the servants  i should thoroughly search the house and my own pockets i speak relatively i added with a laugh  of course i mean your own  he gravely made an entry of these details  perhaps i added you have already done this  perhaps he returned enigmatically  now my dear friend he continued putting the notebook in his pocket and rising would you excuse me for a few moments  make yourself perfectly at home until i return there may be some things he added with a sweep of his hand toward his heterogeneously filled shelves that may interest you and while away the time  there are pipes and tobacco in that corner  then nodding to me with the same inscrutable face he left the room i was too well accustomed to his methods to think much of his unceremonious withdrawal and made no doubt he was off to investigate some clue which had suddenly occurred to his active intelligence  left to myself i cast a cursory glance over his shelves  there were a number of small glass jars containing earthy substances labeled pavement and road sweepings from the principal thoroughfares and suburbs of london with the subdirections for identifying foottracks  there were several other jars labeled fluff from omnibus and road car seats cocoanut fibre and rope strands from mattings in public places cigarette stumps and match ends from floor of palace theatre row a 1 to 50 everywhere were evidences of this wonderful mans system and perspicacity  i was thus engaged when i heard the slight creaking of a door and i looked up as a stranger entered  he was a roughlooking man with a shabby overcoat and a still more disreputable muffler around his throat and the lower part of his face  considerably annoyed at his intrusion i turned upon him rather sharply when with a mumbled growling apology for mistaking the room he shuffled out again and closed the door  i followed him quickly to the landing and saw that he disappeared down the stairs  with my mind full of the robbery the incident made a singular impression upon me  i knew my friends habit of hasty absences from his room in his moments of deep inspiration it was only too probable that with his powerful intellect and magnificent perceptive genius concentrated on one subject he should be careless of his own belongings and no doubt even forget to take the ordinary precaution of locking up his drawers  i tried one or two and found that i was right although for some reason i was unable to open one to its fullest extent  the handles were sticky as if some one had opened them with dirty fingers  knowing hemlocks fastidious cleanliness i resolved to inform him of this circumstance but i forgot it alas untilbut i am anticipating my story  his absence was strangely prolonged  i at last seated myself by the fire and lulled by warmth and the patter of the rain on the window i fell asleep  i may have dreamt for during my sleep i had a vague semiconsciousness as of hands being softly pressed on my pocketsno doubt induced by the story of the robbery  when i came fully to my senses i found hemlock jones sitting on the other side of the hearth his deeply concentrated gaze fixed on the fire  i found you so comfortably asleep that i could not bear to awaken you he said with a smile  i rubbed my eyes  and what news i asked  how have you succeeded  better than i expected he said and i think he added tapping his notebook i owe much to you  deeply gratified i awaited more  but in vain  i ought to have remembered that in his moods hemlock jones was reticence itself  i told him simply of the strange intrusion but he only laughed  later when i arose to go he looked at me playfully  if you were a married man he said i would advise you not to go home until you had brushed your sleeve  there are a few short brown sealskin hairs on the inner side of your forearm just where they would have adhered if your arm had encircled a sealskin coat with some pressure  for once you are at fault i said triumphantly the hair is my own as you will perceive i have just had it cut at the hairdressers and no doubt this arm projected beyond the apron  he frowned slightly yet nevertheless on my turning to go he embraced me warmlya rare exhibition in that man of ice  he even helped me on with my overcoat and pulled out and smoothed down the flaps of my pockets  he was particular too in fitting my arm in my overcoat sleeve shaking the sleeve down from the armhole to the cuff with his deft fingers  come again soon he said clapping me on the back  at any and all times i said enthusiastically i only ask ten minutes twice a day to eat a crust at my office and four hours sleep at night and the rest of my time is devoted to you always as you know  it is indeed he said with his impenetrable smile  nevertheless i did not find him at home when i next called  one afternoon when nearing my own home i met him in one of his favorite disguisesa long blue swallowtailed coat striped cotton trousers large turnover collar blacked face and white hat carrying a tambourine  of course to others the disguise was perfect although it was known to myself and i passed himaccording to an old understanding between uswithout the slightest recognition trusting to a later explanation  at another time as i was making a professional visit to the wife of a publican at the east end i saw him in the disguise of a brokendown artisan looking into the window of an adjacent pawnshop  i was delighted to see that he was evidently following my suggestions and in my joy i ventured to tip him a wink it was abstractedly returned  two days later i received a note appointing a meeting at his lodgings that night  that meeting alas was the one memorable occurrence of my life and the last meeting i ever had with hemlock jones  i will try to set it down calmly though my pulses still throb with the recollection of it  i found him standing before the fire with that look upon his face which i had seen only once or twice in our acquaintancea look which i may call an absolute concatenation of inductive and deductive ratiocinationfrom which all that was human tender or sympathetic was absolutely discharged  he was simply an icy algebraic symbol indeed his whole being was concentrated to that extent that his clothes fitted loosely and his head was absolutely so much reduced in size by his mental compression that his hat tipped back from his forehead and literally hung on his massive ears  after i had entered he locked the doors fastened the windows and even placed a chair before the chimney  as i watched these significant precautions with absorbing interest he suddenly drew a revolver and presenting it to my temple said in low icy tones  hand over that cigar case  even in my bewilderment my reply was truthful spontaneous and involuntary  i havent got it i said  he smiled bitterly and threw down his revolver  i expected that reply  then let me now confront you with something more awful more deadly more relentless and convincing than that mere lethal weaponthe damning inductive and deductive proofs of your guilt he drew from his pocket a roll of paper and a notebook  but surely i gasped you are joking  you could not for a moment believe  silence  sit down  i obeyed  you have condemned yourself he went on pitilessly  condemned yourself on my processesprocesses familiar to you applauded by you accepted by you for years  we will go back to the time when you first saw the cigar case  your expressions he said in cold deliberate tones consulting his paper were how beautiful  i wish it were mine  this was your first step in crimeand my first indication from i wish it were mine to i will have it mine and the mere detail how can i make it mine the advance was obvious  silence but as in my methods it was necessary that there should be an overwhelming inducement to the crime that unholy admiration of yours for the mere trinket itself was not enough  you are a smoker of cigars  but i burst out passionately i told you i had given up smoking cigars  fool he said coldly that is the second time you have committed yourself  of course you told me  what more natural than for you to blazon forth that prepared and unsolicited statement to prevent accusation  yet as i said before even that wretched attempt to cover up your tracks was not enough  i still had to find that overwhelming impelling motive necessary to affect a man like you that motive i found in the strongest of all impulseslove i suppose you would call it he added bitterly that night you called  you had brought the most conclusive proofs of it on your sleeve  but i almost screamed  silence he thundered  i know what you would say  you would say that even if you had embraced some young person in a sealskin coat what had that to do with the robbery  let me tell you then that that sealskin coat represented the quality and character of your fatal entanglement  you bartered your honor for itthat stolen cigar case was the purchaser of the sealskin coat  silence  having thoroughly established your motive i now proceed to the commission of the crime itself  ordinary people would have begun with thatwith an attempt to discover the whereabouts of the missing object  these are not my methods  so overpowering was his penetration that although i knew myself innocent i licked my lips with avidity to hear the further details of this lucid exposition of my crime  you committed that theft the night i showed you the cigar case and after i had carelessly thrown it in that drawer  you were sitting in that chair and i had arisen to take something from that shelf  in that instant you secured your booty without rising silence  do you remember when i helped you on with your overcoat the other night  i was particular about fitting your arm in while doing so i measured your arm with a spring tape measure from the shoulder to the cuff  a later visit to your tailor confirmed that measurement  it proved to be the exact distance between your chair and that drawer  i sat stunned  the rest are mere corroborative details  you were again tampering with the drawer when i discovered you doing so  do not start  the stranger that blundered into the room with a muffler onwas myself more i had placed a little soap on the drawer handles when i purposely left you alone  the soap was on your hand when i shook it at parting i softly felt your pockets when you were asleep for further developments  i embraced you when you leftthat i might feel if you had the cigar case or any other articles hidden on your body  this confirmed me in the belief that you had already disposed of it in the manner and for the purpose i have shown you  as i still believed you capable of remorse and confession i twice allowed you to see i was on your track once in the garb of an itinerant negro minstrel and the second time as a workman looking in the window of the pawnshop where you pledged your booty  but i burst out if you had asked the pawnbroker you would have seen how unjust  fool he hissed that was one of your suggestionsto search the pawnshops  do you suppose i followed any of your suggestions the suggestions of the thief  on the contrary they told me what to avoid  and i suppose i said bitterly you have not even searched your drawer  no he said calmly  i was for the first time really vexed  i went to the nearest drawer and pulled it out sharply  it stuck as it had before leaving a part of the drawer unopened  by working it however i discovered that it was impeded by some obstacle that had slipped to the upper part of the drawer and held it firmly fast  inserting my hand i pulled out the impeding object  it was the missing cigar case  i turned to him with a cry of joy  but i was appalled at his expression  a look of contempt was now added to his acute penetrating gaze  i have been mistaken he said slowly i had not allowed for your weakness and cowardice  i thought too highly of you even in your guilt  but i see now why you tampered with that drawer the other night  by some inexplicable meanspossibly another theftyou took the cigar case out of pawn and like a whipped hound restored it to me in this feeble clumsy fashion  you thought to deceive me hemlock jones more you thought to destroy my infallibility  go  i give you your liberty  i shall not summon the three policemen who wait in the adjoining roombut out of my sight forever  as i stood once more dazed and petrified he took me firmly by the ear and led me into the hall closing the door behind him  this reopened presently wide enough to permit him to thrust out my hat overcoat umbrella and overshoes and then closed against me forever  i never saw him again  i am bound to say however that thereafter my business increased i recovered much of my old practice and a few of my patients recovered also  i became rich  i had a brougham and a house in the west end  but i often wondered pondering on that wonderful mans penetration and insight if in some lapse of consciousness i had not really stolen his cigar case     golly and the christian  or  the minx and the manxman  by hll cne   book i  golly coyle was the only granddaughter of a vague and somewhat simple clergyman who existed with an aunt solely for gollys epistolary purposes  there was of course intermediate ancestrynotably a dead mother who was french and therefore responsible for any later naughtiness in gollybut they have no purpose here they lived in the isle of man  golly knew a good deal of man for even at the age of twelve she was in love with john galeonly son of lord gale who was connected with the tempests  gales however were frequent and remarkable along the coast so that it was not singular that one day she found john coming on on a headland where she was sitting  his dog had pointed her  its exceedingly impolite to point to anything you want said golly touched by this and overcome by a strange emotion john gale turned away and went to canada  slight as the incident was it showed that inborn chivalry to women that desire for the perfect life that intense eagerness to incarnate christianity in modern society which afterward distinguished him  golly loved him for all that she still remained a tomboy as she wasrobbing orchards mimicking tramps and policemen buttering the stairs and the steps of houses tying kettles to dogs tails and marching in a white jersey with the curates hat on through the streets of the village gol dern my skin said the dear old clergyman as he tried to emerge from a surplice which golly had stitched together what spirits the child do have  yet everybody loved her  and when john gale returned from canada and looked into her big blue eyes one day at church small wonder that he immediately went off again to paris and an extended continental sojourn with a serious leaning to theology  golly bore his absence meekly but characteristically got a boat disported like a duck in the water attempted to elope with a boy appropriately named drake but encountered a half gale at sea and a whole gale in john on a yacht who rescued them both  convinced now that there was but one way to escape from his fategollyjohn gale took holy orders and at once started for london  as he stood on the deck of the steamer he heard an imbecile chuckle in his ear  it was the simple old clergyman you are going to london to join the church john golly is going there too as hospital nurse  theres a pair of you he he  look after her john and protect her manx simplicity before john could recover himself golly was at his side executing the final steps of a cellardoor flap jig to the lighthearted refrain       we are a simple familywe arewe arewe are   and even as her pure young voice arose above the screams of the departure whistle she threw a double backsomersault on the quarterdeck cleverly alighting on the spikes of the wheel before the delighted captain  jingle my electric bells he said looking at the bright young thing but youre a regular minx  i beg your pardon interrupted john gale with a quick flush  i mean a regular manx said the captain hurriedly  a singular paleness crossed the deeply religious face of john  as the vessel rose on the waves he passed his hand hurriedly first across his brows and then over his highbuttoned clerical waistcoat that visible sign of a devoted ascetic life  then murmuring in his low deep voice brandy steward he disappeared below   book ii  glorious as were gollys spirits exquisitely simple her worldly ignorance and irresistible her powers of mimicry strangely enough they were considered out of place in st barabbas hospital  a lighthearted disposition to mistake a blister for a poultice that rare manx conscientiousness which made her give double doses to the patients as a compensation when she had omitted to give them a single one and the faculty of bursting into song at the bedside of a dying patient produced some liveliness not unmixed with perplexity among the hospital staff  it is true however that her performance of clogdancing during the nightwatches drew a larger and more persistent attendance of students and young surgeons than ever was seen before yet everybody loved her  even her patients if it amooses you miss to make me tyke the pills wots meant for the lydy in the next ward i aint complyning said an east end newsboy  when ye tyke off the style of the doctor wot wisits me miss and imitates his wyes lawd it does me as much good as his mixtures said a consumptive charwoman even thus old and young basked in the radiant youth of golly  she found time to write to her family   dear old pals  im here  jy suis bet your boots  while youre wondering what has become of the bright young thing the b y t is lookin out of the winder of st barabbas hospitaljust taking in all of dear roaring dirty london in one gulp  such a placelordy  ive been waiting three hours to see the crowd go by and they havent gone yet  such crowds such bussesall green and blue only a penny fare and you can ride on top if you want to think of that you dear old manx people  but therethe bell goes aringing for sarahtheyre calling for nurse  thats the worst of this job theyre always adyin just as youre getting interested in something else  tata  golly   then her dear old grandfather wrote   im wondering where my diddleums golly is  we all miss you so much deary though we dont miss so many little things as when you were here  my dear conscientious unselfish little girl  you dont say where john gale is  is he still protecting youheheyou giddy naughty thing  people wonder on the island why i let you go alone to londonthey forget your dear mother was a frenchwoman  if you see anything your dear old grandfather would likesend it on  granfer   later her aunt wrote   have you seen the queen yet and does she wear her crown at breakfast you might get over the area railing at buckingham palaceit would be nothing for a girl like you to doand see if you can find out   to these letters golly answered in her own lighthearted way   dear grankinsi havent seen john muchbut i think hes like the private secretary at the playhe dont like london  lordy thereive let it out  ive been to a theayter  nurse jinny jones and me scrouged into the pit one night without paying pertendin as we were in uniform we had come to take out a lydy that had fainted such larks and such a glorious theayter ill tell you another time tell aunty the queens always out when i call  but thats nothing everybody else is so affable and polite in london  gentlemenreal toffs they call emwhom you dont know from adamthink nothing of speaking to you in the street  why nurse jinny saysbut there another patients going off who by rights oughter have died only tomorrow  tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow as that barnstormer actor said  but theyre always calling for that giddy young thing  your golly   meantime john gale having abruptly left golly at the door of st barabbas hospital tactfully avoiding an unseemly altercation with the cabdriver regarding her exact fare pursued his way thoughtfully to the residence of his uncle the first lord of the admiralty  he found his lordship in his bathroom  he was leaning over the bathtub which was half full of water contemplating with some anxiety the model of a lineofbattle ship which was floating on it bottom upward  i dont think it can be quite rightdo you he said nervously grasping his nephews hand as he pointed to the capsized vessel yet they always do it  tell me he went on appealingly tell me as a professing christian and a perfect manis it quite right  i should think sir responded john gale with uncompromising truthfulness that the average vessel of commerce is not built in that way  yet said the first lord of the admiralty with a faroff look they all do it  and they dont steer  the larger they are and the more recent the model the less they steer  dear meyou ought to see em go round and round in that tub  then apparently recalling the probable purpose of johns visit he led the way into his dressingroom  so you are in london dear boy  is there any little thing you want  i have he continued absently fumbling in the drawers of his dressingtable a few curacies and a bishopric somewhere but with these blessed modelsi cant think where they are or what would you say to a nice chaplaincy in the navy with a becoming uniform on one of those thingummies  he pointed to the bathroom stay he continued as he passed his hand over his perplexed brows now i think of ityoure quite unorthodox dear me that wouldnt do you see drakehe paused as john gale startedi mean sir francis drake once suspended his chaplain for unorthodoxy according to froudes book  these admirals are dreadfully strict churchmen  no matter  come again some other time he added gently pushing his nephew downstairs and into the street and well see about it  with a sinking heart john turned his steps toward westminster  he would go and see golly perhaps he had not looked after her as he ought  suddenly a remembered voice in mimicking accents fell upon his ear with the quotation do you know  then in a hansom passing swiftly by him golly in hospital dress with flying ribbons appeared sitting between lord brownstone ewer and francis horatio nelson drake completely grown up  and from behind floated the inexpressibly sad refrain hi tiddli hi  this is how it happened  one morning jinny jones another hospital nurse had said to her have you any objection dear to seeing a friend of another gent a friend of mine  none in the least dear said golly  i want to see all that can be seen and do all that can be done in london and know the glory thereof  i only require that i shall be allowed to love john gale whenever he permits it which isnt often and that i may be permitted to write simple letters to my doting relations at the rate of twelve pages a day giving an accountmy own accountof my doings  there go on now  bring on your bears  they had visited the chambers which lord brownstone and drake occupied together and in girlish innocence had put on the gentlemens clothes and danced before them  then they all went to the theatre where gollys delightful simplicity and childish ignorance of the world had charmed them  everything to her was new strange and thrilling  she even leaned from the carriage windows to see the wheels go round she was surprised at the number of people in the theatre and insisted on knowing if it was church because they all sat there in their best clothes so quietly  she believed that the play was real and frequently from a stage box interrupted the acting with explanations she informed the heroine of the design of the villain waiting at the wings  and when the aged mother of the heroine was dying of starvation in a hovel and she threw a bag of bonbons on the stage with the vociferous declaration that lord brownstone had just given them to herbutlordyshe didnt want them they were obliged to lead her away closely followed by an usher and a policeman  to think she wrote to john gale that the audience only laughed and shouted and never offered to help  and yet look at the churches in london where they dare to preach the gospel  fired by this simple letter and alarmed by gollys simplicity john gale went to his clerical chief archdeacon luxury and demanded permission to preach next sunday  certainly said the archdeacon you shall take my curates place  i shall inform the congregation that you are the son of lord gale  they are very particular churchmenall society peopleand of course will be satisfied with the work of the lord especially he added with a polite smile when that work happens to bethe lord gales son accordingly the next sunday john gale occupied the pulpit of st swithin  but an unexpected event happened  his pentup eagerness to denounce the present methods of christianity his fullness of utterance defeated his purpose  he was overcome with a kind of pulpit fright  his ideas of time and place fled him  after beginning mr chairman in rising to propose the toast of our worthy archdeaconfellow manxmenthe present momentererthe proudest in myerlifedearly beloved gollyunaccustomed as i am to public speaking he abruptly delivered the benediction and sat down  the incident however provoked little attention  the congregation accustomed to sleep through the sermon awoke at the usual time and went home  only a single scotchwoman said to him in passing verra weel for a beginning laddie  but give it hotter to em next time  discomfited and bewildered he communed with himself gloomily  i cant marry golly  i cant talk  i hate society  whats to be done  i have it  ill go into a monastery  he went into a monastery in bishopsgate street reached by a threepenny bus  he gave out vaguely that he had got into something good in the city  society was satisfied  only golly suspected the truth  she wrote to her grandfather   i saw john gale the other day with a crowd following him in the strand  he had on only a kind of brown serge dressinggown tied around his waist by a rope and a hood on his head  i think his poor toetoes were in sandals and i dare say his legs were cold poor dear  however if he calls that protection of gollyi dont i might be run off at any momentfor all hed help  no matter if this court understands herself and she thinks she do golly can take care of herselfyou bet   nevertheless golly lost her place at the hospital through her heroic defense of her friend jinny jones who had been deceived by lord brownstone ewer  you would drive that poor girl into the street she said furiously to the chairman of the board throwing her cap and apron in their faces  youre a lot of rotten old hypocrites and im glad to get shut of you  not content with that she went to drake and demanded that he should make his friend lord brownstone marry jinny  sorryawfully sorrymy dear golly but hes engaged to a rich american girl who is to pay his debts but ill see that he does something handsome for jinny  and you my child what are you going to do without a situation he added with touching sympathy you see ive some vague idea of marrying you myself he concluded meditatively  thank you for nothing interrupted golly gayly but i can take care of myself and follow out my mission like john gale  theres a pair of you certainly said drake with a tinge of jealous bitterness  you bet its a pair that will take your two knaves you and your lord brownstone returned golly dropping a mock courtesy tata im going on the stage   book iii  she went first into a tobacconistsand sold cigarettes sometimes she suffered from actual want and ate fried fish  do you know how nice fried fish tastes in londonyou on the oilan she wrote gayly im getting on splendidly sos john gale i suppose though hes looking cadaverous from starving himself all round  tell aunty i havent seen the queen yet though after all i really believe she has not seen me  then after a severe struggle she succeeded in getting on the stage as a song and dance girl  she sang melodiously and danced divinely so remarkably that the ignorant public knowing her to be a manx girl and vaguely associating her with the symbol of the isle of man supposed she had three legs  she was the success of the season her cup of ambition was filled  it was slightly embittered by the news that her friend jinny jones had killed herself in the church at the wedding of her recreant lover and the american heiress  but the affair was scarcely alluded to by the society paperswho were naturally shocked at the bad taste of the deceased  and even golly forgot it allon the stage   book iv  meanwhile john gale or brother boreas as he was known in the monastery was submittingamong other rigorsto an exceptionally severe winter in bishopsgate street which seemed to have an arctic climate of its ownpossibly induced by the freezingout process of certain stock companies in its vicinity  you are miserable and eager to get out in the wicked world again my son said the delightful old superior as he sat by the only fire sipping a glass of mulled port when john came in from shoveling snow outside  i therefore merely to try you shall make you gatekeeper the keys of the monastery front door are under the doormat in my cell but i am a sound sleeper  he smiled seraphically and winked casually as he sipped his port we will call it if you pleasea penance  john threw himself in an agony of remorse and shame at the feet of the superior  it isnt of myself im thinking he confessed wildly but of that poor young man brother bones in the next cell to mine  he is a living skeleton has got only one lung and an atrophied brain  a night out might do him good  the father superior frowned  do you know who he is  no  his real name is jones  why do you start  you have heard it before  john had started thinking of jinny jones gollys deserted and selfimmolated friend  it is an uncommon name he stammeredfor a monastery i mean  he is or was an uncommon man said the superior gravely  but he added resignedly we cannot pick and choose our company here most of us have done something and have our own reasons for this retreat brother polygamus escaped here from the persecutions of his sixth wife even i continued the superior with a gentle smile putting his feet comfortably on the mantelpiece have had my little fling and the dear boys used to sayahembut this is mere worldly vanity  you alone my dear son he went on with slight severity seem to be wanting in some criminality orshall i saysome appropriate besetting sin to qualify you for this holy retreat  an absolutely gratuitous and blameless idiocy appears to be your only peculiarity and for this you must do penance  from this day henceforth i make you doorkeeper  go on with your shoveling at present and shut the door behind you theres a terrible draught in these corridors  for three days john gale underwent an agony of doubt and determination and it still snowed in bishopsgate street  on the fourth evening he went to brother bones  would you like to have an evening out  i would said brother bones  what would you do  i would go to see my remaining sister  his left eyelid trembled slowly in his cadaverous face  but if you should hear she was ruined like the other  what would you do  a shudder passed over the man  i have not got my little knife he said vacantly  true he had not  the brotherhood had no pocketsor rather only a corporate one which belonged to the superior  john gale lifted his eyes in sublime exaltation  you shall go out he said with decision muffle up until you are well out of bishopsgate street where it still snows  but how did you get the keys said brother bones  from under the father superiors doormat  but that was wrong brother  the mat bore the inscription salve which you know in latin means welcome returned john gale  it was logically a permission  the two men gazed at each other silently  a shudder passed over the two left eyelids of their wan spiritual faces  but i have no money said brother bones  nor have i  but here is a bus ticket and a free pass to the gaiety you will probably find golly somewhere about  tell her he said in a hollow voice that im getting on  i will said brother bones with a deep cough  the gate opened and he disappeared in the falling snow  the bloodhound kept by the monasteryone of the real bishopsgate breedbayed twice and licked its huge jaws in ghastly anticipation  i wonder said john gale as he resumed his shoveling if i have done exactly right candor compels me to admit that it is an open question   book v  early the next morning brother bones was brought home by policeman x his hat crushed his face haggard his voice husky and unintelligible he only said vaguely washertime  it is said john gale timidly in explanation to policeman x a case of spiritual exhaustion following a vigil  that warnt her name said policeman x sternly  but dont let this ere appen again  john gale turned to brother bones  then you saw hergolly  no said brother bones  why  what on earth have you been doing  dunno  found myself in stashunzis morning  thashall  then john gale sought the superior in an agony of remorse and confessed all  i am unfit to remain doorkeeper  remove me he groaned bitterly  the old man smiled gently  on the contrary i should have given you the keys myself  hereafter you can keep them  the ways of our brotherhood are mysteriousindeed you may think idioticbut we are not responsible for them  its all brother caines doingits all caine   book vi  nevertheless john gale left the monastery  the bishopsgate street winter does not suit me he briefly explained to the superior  i must go south or southwest  but he did neither  he saw golly who was living west  he upbraided her for going on the stage  she retorted whose life is the more artificial yours or mine  it is true that we are both imperfectly clothed she added glancing at a photograph of herself in a short skirt and not always in our right mindbut youve caught nothing but a cold  nevertheless i love you and you love me  then he begged her to go with him to the south seas and take the place of father damien among the colony of lepers  it is a beautiful place and inexpensive for we shall live only a few weeks  what do you say dearest  you know he added with a faint sad smile glancing at another photograph of herexecuting the high kickyoure quite a leaper yourself  but that night she received an offer of a new engagement  she wrote to john gale the south seas is rather an expensive trip to take simply to die  couldnt we do it as cheaply at home  or couldnt you prevail on your father superior to set up his monastery there  im afraid im not up to it  why dont you try the old oilan nearer home  theres lots of measles and diphtheria about there lately  when the heartbroken john gale received this epistle he also received a letter from his uncle the first lord of the admiralty i dont fancy this damien whim of yours  if youre really in earnest about killing yourself why not take a brief trial trip in one of our latest ironclads  its just as risky althoughas we are obliged to keep these things quiet in the officeyou will not of course get that publicity your noble soul craves  abandoned by all in his noble purposes john gale took the first steamer to the isle of man   book vii  but he did not remain there long  once back in that epistolary island he wrote interminable letters to golly  when they began to bore each other he returned to london and entered the salvation army  crowds flocked to hear him preach  he inveighed against society and wickedness as represented in his mind by golly and her friends and praised a perfect christianity represented by himself and his friends a panic of the same remarkable character as the bishopsgate street winter took possession of london  old moores zadkiels and mother shiptons prophecies were to be fulfilled at an early and fixed date with no postponement on account of weather  suddenly society john drake and antichrist generally combined by ousting him from his church and turning it into a musichall for golly  then john gale took his last and sublime resolve  his duty as a perfect christian was to kill golly  his logic was at once inscrutable perfect andjohn galish  with this sublime and lofty purpose he called upon golly  the heroic girl saw his purpose in his eyean eye at once black murderous and christianlike  for an instant she thought it was better to succumb at once and thus end this remarkable attachment suddenly through this chaos of spiritual religious ecstatic superegotistic whirl of confused thought darted a gleam of common ordinary horse sense  john gale saw it illumine her blue eyes and trembled  god in mercy  if it came to that  sit down john she said calmly  then in her sweet clear voice she said did it ever occur to you dearest that a more ridiculous unconvincing purposeless insane godforsaken idiot than you never existed  that you eclipse the wildest dreams of insanity  that you are a mental and moral whatisit  it has occurred to me he replied simply  i began life with vast asinine possibilities which fall to the lot of few men yet i cannot say that i have carried even them to a logical conclusion but you love you darling conceived in extravagance born to impossibility a challenge to credulity a problem to the intellect a missing word for all agesare you aware of any one as utterly unsympathetic unreal and untrue to nature as you are existing on the face of the earth or in the waters under the earth  you are right dearest there are none she returned with the same calm level voice  it is true that i have at times tried to do something real and womanly and not you know merely to complicate aaher voice falteredtheatrical situationbut i couldnt something impelled me otherwise  now you know why i became an actress but even there i fail  they are allowed reasoning power off the stagei have none at any time  i laugh in the wrong placei do the unnecessary extravagant thing  endowed by some strange power with extraordinary attributes i am supposed to make everybody love me but i donti satisfy nobody i convince none  i have no idea what will happen to me next  i am doomed toi know not what  and i he groaned bitterly i in some rare and lucid moments have had a glimpse of this too  we are in the hands of some inscrutable but awful power  tell me golly tell me darling who is it  again that gleam of common or ordinary horse sense came in her eye  i have found out who she whispered  i have found out who has created us and made us as puppets in his hands  is it the almighty he asked  no it isshe said with a burst of real laughterit isthe all caine  what our countryman the manxman  the only great novelist  the beloved of gladstone he gasped  yesand he intends to kill youand were only to be married at your deathbed  john gale arose with a look of stern determination  i have suffered much and idioticallybut i draw a line at this  i shall kick  golly clapped her hands joyfully  we will  and well chuck him  we will  they were choking with laughter  and go and get married in a natural simple way like anybody elseand tryto do our dutyto godto each otherand to our fellowbeingsand quit thisdamnednonsenseand infernal idiocy forever  amen   publishers notein that supreme work of my life the christian said the gifted novelist to a reporter in speaking of his methods i had endowed the characters of golly and john gale with such superhuman vitality and absolute reality thatas is well known in the experience of great writersthey became thinking beings and actually criticised my work and even interfered and rebelled to the point of altering my climax and the end  the present edition gives that ending which of course is the only real one    the adventures of john longbowe yeoman  being a modernantique realistic romance  compiled from several eminent sources  it seemeth but fair that i john longbowe should set down this account of such hap and adventure as hath befallen me without flourish vaporing or cozening of speech but as becometh one who not being a ready writer goeth straight to the matter in hand in few words  so though i offend some i shall yet convince all the which lieth closer to my purpose  thus it was in the year 1560 or 1650 or mayhap 1710for my memory is not what it hath been and i ever cared little for monkish calendars or such dryasdust matter being active as becometh one who hath to make his way in the worldyet i wot well it was after the great plague which i have great cause to remember lying at my cozens in wardour street london in that lamentable year eating of gilly flowers sulphur hartes tongue and many stynking herbes touching neither man nor mayd save with a great tongs steept in pitch wearing a fine maske of silk with a mouth piece of aromatic stuffby reason of which acts of hardihood and courage i was miraculously preserved  this much i shall say as to the time of these happenings and no more  i am a plain blunt manmayhap rude of speech should occasion warrantso let them who require the exactness of a scrivener or a pedagogue go elsewhere for their entertainment and be hanged to them  howbeit though no scholar i am not one of those who misuse the english speech and being foolishly led by the hasty custom of scriveners and printers to write the letters t and h joined together which resembleth a y do incontinently jump to the conclusion the the is pronounced yethe like of which i never heard in all england  and though this be little toward those great enterprises and happenings i shall presently shew i set it down for the behoof of such malapert wights as must needs gird at a man of spirit and actionand yet in sooth know not their own letters  so to my tale  there was a great frost when my lord bade me follow him to the water gate near our lodgings in the strand  when we reached it we were amazed to see that the thames was frozen over and many citizens disporting themselves on the icethe like of which no man had seen before  there were fires built thereon and many ships and barges were stuck hard and fast and my lord thought it vastly pretty that the people were walking under their bows and cabbin windows and climbing of their sides like mermen but i being a plain blunt man had no joy in such idlenesse deeming it better that in these times of pith and enterprise they should be more seemly employed  my lord because of one or two misadventures by reason of the slipperiness of the ice was fain to go by london bridge which we did my lord as suited his humor ruffling the staid citizens as he passed or peering under the hoods of their wives and daughtersas became a young gallant of the time  i being a plain blunt man assisted in no such folly but contented myself when they complayned to me with damning their souls for greasy interfering varlets  for i shall now make no scruple in declaring that my lord was the most noble earl of southampton being withheld from so saying before through very plainness and bluntness desiring as a simple yeoman to make no boast of serving a man of so high quality  we fared on over bankside to the globe playhouse where my lord bade me dismount and deliver a secret message to the chief playerwhich message was had he diligently perused and examined that he wot of and what said he thereof  which i did  thereupon he that was called the chief player did incontinently proceed to load mine arms and wallet with many and divers rolls of manuscripts in my lords own hand and bade me say unto him that there was a great frost over london but that if he were to perform those plays and masques publickly there would be a greater frost thereto wit in the globe playhouse  this i did deliver with the manuscripts to my lord who changed countenance mightily at the sight of them but could make nought of the message at which the lad who held the horses before the playhouseone will shakespearesplit with laughter  whereat my lord cursed him for a deerstealing coneycatching warwickshire lout and cuffed him soundly  i wot there will be those who remember that this will shakespeare afterwards became a player and did write playswhich were acceptable even to the queens majestys selfand i set this down not from vanity to shew i have held converse with such nor to give a seemingness and colour to my story but to shew what illjudged misinformed knaves were they who did afterwards attribute friendship between my lord and this will shakespeare even to the saying that he made sonnets to my lord  howbeit my lord was exceeding wroth and i to beguile him did propose that we should leave our horses and cargoes of manuscript behind and cross on the ice afoot which conceit pleased him mightily  in sooth it chanced well with what followed for hardly were we on the river when we saw a great crowd coming from westminster before a caravan of strange animals and savages in masks capering and capricolling dragging after them divers sledges quaintly fashioned like swannes in which were ladies attired as fairies and goddesses and such like heathen and wanton trumpery which i as a plain blunt man would have fallen to cursing had not my lord himself damned me under his breath to hold my peace for that he had recognized my lord of leicesters colours and that he made no doubt they were of the court as forsooth this did presently appear also that one of the ladies was her gracious majestys selfmasked to the general eye the better to enjoy these miscalled festivities  i say miscalled for though a loyal subject of her majesty and one who hath borne arms at tilbury fort in defence of her majesty it inflamed my choler as a plain and blunt man that her mightiness should so degrade her dignity  howbeit as a man who hath his way to make in the world i kept mine eyes well upon the anticks of the great while my lord joined the group of maskers and their follies  i recognized her majestys presence by her discourse in three languages to as many ambassadors that were presentthough i marked well that she had not forgotten her own tongue calling one of her ladies a sluttish wench nor her english spirit in cuffing my lord of essexs ears for some indecorumwhich as a plain man myself curt in speech and action did rejoice me greatly but i must relate one feat the like of which i never saw in england before or since  there was a dance of the maskers and in the midst of it her majesty asked the ambassador from spayne if he had seen the latest french dance  he replied that he had not  whereupon her most excellent majesty skipt back a pace and forward a pace and lifting her hoop delivered a kick at his excellencys hat which sent it flying the space of a good english ell above his head  howbeit so great was the acclamation that her majesty was graciously moved to repeat it to my lord of leicester but tripping back her high heels caught in her farthingale and she would have fallen on the ice but for that my lord with exceeding swiftness and dexterity whisked his cloak from his shoulder spreading it under her and so received her body in its folds on the ice without himself touching her majestys person  her majesty was greatly pleased at this and bade my lord buy another cloak at her cost though it swallowed an estate but my lord replyed after the lying fashion of the time that it was honour enough for him to be permitted to keep it after it had received her royal person  i know that this hap hath been partly related of another personthe shipman raleighbut i tell such as deny me that they lie in their teeth for i john longbowe have causemiserable cause enough i warrantto remember it and my lord can bear me out  for spite of his fair speeches when he was quit of the royal presence he threw me his wet and bedraggled cloak and bade me change it with him for mine own which was dry and warm  and it was this simple act which wrought the lamentable and cruel deed of which i was the victim for as i followed my lord thus apparelled across the ice i was suddenly set upon and seized a chokepear clapt into my mouth so that i could not cry aloud mine eyes bandaged mine elbows pinioned at my side in that fatall cloak like to a trussed fowl and so i was carried to where the ice was broken and thrust into a boat  thence i was conveyed in the same rude sort to a ship dragged up her smooth wet side and clapt under hatches  here i lay helpless as in a swoon  when i came to it was with a great trampling on the decks above and the washing of waves below and i made that the ship was movingbut where i knew not after a little space the hatch was lifted from where i lay the chokepear taken from my mouth but not the bandage from mine eyes so i could see nought around me  but i heard a strange voice say what coil is this  this is my lords cloak in sooth but not my lord that lieth in it  who is this fellow  at which i did naturally discover the great misprise of those varlets who had taken me for my dear lord whom i now damned in my heart for changing of the cloaks  howbeit when i had fetched my breath with difficulty being well nigh spent by reason of the gag i replyed that i was john longbowe my lords true yeoman as good a man as any as they should presently discover when they set me ashore  that i knew  softly friend said the voice thou knowest too much for the good of england and too little for thine own needs  thou shalt be sent where thou mayest forget the one and improve thy knowledge of the other  then as if turning to those about him for i could not see by reason of the blindfold he next said take him on your voyage and see that he escape not till ye are quit of england  and with that they clapt to the hatch again and i heard him cast off from the ships side there was i john longbowe an english yeomani who but that day had held converse with will shakespeare and been cognizant of the revels of her most christian majesty even to the spying of her garteri was kidnapped at the age of fortyfive or thereaboutfor i will not be certain of the yearand forced to sea for that my lord of southampton had provoked the jealousie and envy of divers other great nobles    chapters i to xx  i am forced to sea and to become a pirate  i suffer lamentably from sickness by reason of the bignesse of the waves  i commit many cruelties and bloodshed  but by the divine intercession i eventually throw the wicked captain overboard and am elected in his stead  i discover an island of treasure obtain possession thereof by a tricke and put the natives to the sword  i marvel much at those who deem it necessary in the setting down of their adventures to gloze over the whiles between with much matter of the country the peoples and even their own foolish reflections thereon hoping in this way to cozen the reader with a belief in their own truthfulness and encrease the extravagance of their deeds  i being a plain blunt man shall simply say for myself that for many days after being taken from the bilboes and made free of the deck i was grievously distempered by reason of the waves and so collapsed in the bowels that i could neither eat stand nor lie  being thus in great fear of death from which i was miraculously preserved i out of sheer gratitude to my maker did incontinently make oath and sign articles to be one of the crewwhich were buccaneers  i did this the more readily as we were to attack the ships of spayne only and through there being no state of warre at that time between england and that country it was wisely conceived that this conduct would provoke it and we should thus be forearmed as became a juste man in his quarrel for this we had the precious example of many great captains  we did therefore heave to and burn many shipsthe quality of those engagements i do not set forth not having a seamans use of ship speech and despising as a plain blunt man those who misuse it having it not  but this i do know that having some conceit of a shipmans ways and of pirates i did conceive at this time a pretty song for my comradoes whereof the words ran thus       yo ho when the dog watch bayeth loud        in the light of a midsea moon      and the dead eyes glare in the stiffening shroud        for that is the pirates noon      when the night mayres sit on the dead mans chest        where no mannes breath may come      then hey for a bottle of rum rum rum        and a passage to kingdom come   i take no credit to myself for the same except so far as it may shew a touch of my lord of southamptons mannerwe being intimatebut this i know that it was much acclaimed by the crew  indeed they observing that the captain was of a cruel nature would fain kill him and put me in his stead but i objecting to the shedding of precious blood in such behoof did prevent such a lamentable and inhuman action by stealthily throwing him by night from his cabbin window into the seawhere owing to the inconceivable distance of the ship from shore he was presently drowned  which untoward fate had a great effect upon my fortunes since burthening myself with his goods and effects i found in his chest a printed proclamation from an aged and infirm clergyman in the west of england covenanting that for the sum of two crowns he would send to whoso offered the chart of an island of great treasure in the spanish main whereof he had had confession from the lips of a dying parishioner and the amount gained thereby he would use for the restoration of his parish church  now i reading this was struck by a great remorse and admiration for our late captain for that it would seem that he was like myself a staunch upholder of the protestant faith and the church thereof as did appear by his possession of the chart for which he had no doubt paid the two good crowns  as an act of penance i resolved upon finding the same island by the aid of the chart and to that purpose sailed east many days and south and north and west as many other daysthe manner whereof and the latitude and longitude of which i shall not burden the reader with holding it as a plain blunt man mere padding and impertinence to fill out my narrative which helpeth not the general reader  so i say when we sighted the island which seemed to be swarming with savages i ordered the masts to be stripped save but for a single sail which hung sadly and distractedly and otherwise put the ship into the likeness of a forlorn wreck clapping the men save one or two under hatches this i did to prevent the shedding of precious blood knowing full well that the ignorant savages believing the ship in sore distress would swim off to her with provisions and fruit bearing no arms  which they did while we as fast as they clomb the sides despatched them at leisure without unseemly outcry or alarms  having thus disposed of the most adventurous we landed and took possession of the island finding thereon many kegs of carbuncles and rubies and pieces of eightthe treasure store of those lawless pirates who infest the seas having no colour of war or teaching of civilisation to atone for their horrid deeds  i discovered also by an omission in the chart that this was not the island wot of by the good and aged devonshire divineand so we eased our consciences of accounting for the treasure to him  we then sailed away arriving after many years absence at the port of bristol in merrie england where i took leave of the jolly roger that being the name of my ship it was a strange conceit of seamen in after years ever to call the device of my flagto wit a skull and bones made in the sign of a crossby the name my ship bore and if i have only corrected the misuse of history by lying knaves i shall be content with this writing  but alas such are the uncertainties of time i found my good lord of southampton dead and most of his friends beheaded and the blessed king james of scotlandif i mistake not for these also be the uncertainties of timeon the throne  in due time i married mistress marian straitways  i might have told more of trifling and how she fared poor wench in mine absence even to the following of me in another ship in a shipboys disguise and how i rescued her from a scheming pagan villain but as a plain blunt man i am no hand at the weaving of puling love tales and such trifling diversions for lovesick mayds and their puny gallantshaving only consideration for men and their deeds which i have here set down bluntly and even at mine advanced years am ready to maintain with the hand that set it down    danl borem  by e ns wtt   i  danl borem poured half of his second cup of tea abstractedly into his lap  guess youve got suthin on yer mind danl said his sister  morn likely ive got suthin on my pants returned danl with that exquisitely dry though somewhat protracted humor which at once thrilled and bored his acquaintances  butspeakin o that hoss trade  for goodness sake dont interrupted his sister wearily yer allus doin it  jest tell me about that young manthe new clerk ye think o gettin  well i telegraphed him to come over arter i got this letter from him he returned handing her a letter  read it out loud  but his sister having an experienced horror of prolixity glanced over it  far as i kin see he takes morn two hundred words to say youve got to take him on trust and sez it suthin in a style betwixt a business circular and them polite letter writers  i thought you allowed he was a tony feller  ef he does not brag much ye see i kin offer him small wages said danl with a wink  its kinder takin him at his own figger  and that mightnt pay  but ye dont think o bringin him here in this house  cept youre thinkin o tellin him that yarn o yours about the hoss trade to beguile the winter evenings  i told ye yed hev to pay yet to get folks to listen to it  wrong aginez youll see  wot ef i get a hundred thousand folks to pay me for tellin it  but speakin o this young feller i calkilated to send him to the turkey buzzard hotel and he looked at his sister with a shrewd yet humorous smile  what said his sister in alarm  the turkey buzzard  why hell be starved or pizoned  he wont stay there a week  ef hes pizoned to death he wont be able to demand any wages ef he leaves because he cant stand itits proof positive he couldnt stand me  ef hes only starved and made weak and miserable hell be easy to make terms with  it may seem hard what im sayin but what seems hard on the other feller always comes mighty easy to you  the thing is not to be the other feller  ye aint listenin  yet these remarks is shrewd and humorous and hez bin thought so by literary fellers  hm said his sister  whats that ye was jest sayin about folks bein willin to pay ye for tellin that hoss trade yarn o yours  thets only what one o them smart new york publishers allowed it was worth arter hearin me tell it said danl dryly  go way  you or him must be crazy  why it aint ez good as that story bout a man who had a balky hoss that could be made to go only by buildin a fire under him and arter the man sells that hoss and the secret and the man wot bought him tries it on the blamed hoss lies down over the fire and puts it out  ive allus allowed that the story ye hev to tell yourself is a blamed sight funnier than the one yere listenin to said danl put that down among my sayins will ye  but your story was never anythin more than one o them snippy things ye see in the papers drored out to no end by you  its only one o them funny paragraphs ye kin read in a minit in the papers that takes you an hour to tell  to her surprise danl only looked at his sister with complacency  that he said is jest what the new york publisher sez  the merrikan people sez he is ashamed o bein short and peart and funny it lacks dignity sez he it looks funny sez he but it aint deepseated nashnul literature sez he  them snips o funny stories and short dialogues in the comic papersthey make ye laff sez he but laffin isnt no sign o deep morril purpose sez he and it aint genteel and refined  abraham linkin with his pat anecdotes ruined our standin with dignified nashuns sez he we cultivated publishers is sick o hearin furrin nashuns roarin over funny merrikan stories were goin to show em that even ef we havent classes and titles and sich we kin be dull were workin the historical racket for all that its worthef we cant go back morn a hundred years or so we kin rake in a lord and a lady when we do and were gettin in some olefashioned spellin and methinkses and peradventures  were doin the religious bizness ez slick ez robert elsmere and we find lots o soul in folksand heaps o quaint morril characters sez he  sakes alive danl broke in his sister whats all that got to do with your yarn bout the hoss trade  everythin returned danl  for sez he mr borem sez he youre a quaint morril character  youve got protracted humor sez he  youve bin an hour tellin that yarn o yours  ef ye could spin it out to fill two chapters of a bookyer fortunes made  for youll show that a successful hoss trade involves the highest nashnul characteristics  that what common folk calls selfishness revenge mean lyin and lowdown moneygrubbin ambishun is really quaintness and will go in double harness with the bizness of a christian banker sez he  created goodness danl  youre designin ter  danl borem rose coughed expectorated carefully at the usual spot in the fender his general custom of indicating the conclusion of a subject or an interview and said dryly im thar   ii  to return to the writer of the letter whose career was momentarily cut off by the episode of the horse trade who if he had previously received a letter written by somebody else would have been an entirely different person and not in this novel at all john lummoxknown to his family as the perfect lummoxhad been two years in college but thought it rather fine of himselfa habit of thought in which he frequently indulgedto become a clerk but finally got tired of it and to his fathers relief went to europe for a couple of years returning with some knowledge of french and german and the cutting end of a german students blunted dueling sword  having as he felt thus equipped himself for the hero of an american good society novel he went on board a liner where there would naturally be susceptible young ladies one he thought he recognized as a girl with whom he used to play forfeits in the vulgar past of his boyhood  she sat at his table accompanied by another lady whose husband seemed to be a confirmed dyspeptic  his remarks struck lummox as peculiar  shall i begin dinner with pudding and cheese or take the ordinary soup first  i quite forget which i did last night he said anxiously to his wife  but mrs starling hesitated  tell me mary he said appealing to miss bike the young lady  i should begin with the pudding said miss bike decisively and between that and the arrival of the cheese you can make up your mind and then if you think better go back to the soup  thank you so much  now as to drink  shall i take the friedrichshalle first or the benedictine  you know the doctor insists upon the friedrichshalle but i dont think i did well to mix them as i did yesterday  or shall i take simply milk and beer  i should say simplicity was best  besides you can always fill up with champagne later  how splendidly this clearheaded cleareyed girl dominated the man lummox felt that really he might renew her acquaintance  he did so  i remembered you she said  youve not changed a bit since you were eight years old  john wishing to change the subject said that he thought mr starling seemed an uncertain man  very  hes even now in his stateroom sitting in his pyjamas with a rubber shoe on one foot and a pump on the other wondering whether he ought to put on golf knickerbockers with a dressinggown and straw hat before he comes on deck  he has already put on and taken off about twenty suits  he certainly is very trying returned lummox  he paused and colored deeply  i beg he stammered i hopeyou dont think me guilty of a pun  when i said trying i referred entirely to the effect on your sensitiveness of these tentative attempts toward clothing himself  i should never accuse you of levity mr lummox said the young lady gazing thoughtfully upon his calm but somewhat heavy featuresnever  yet he would have liked to reclaim himself by a show of lightness he was leaning on the rail looking at the sea  the scene was beautiful  i suppose he said rolling with the sea and his early studies of doctor johnson that one would in the more superior manner show his appreciation of all this by refraining from the obvious comment which must needs be recognized as comparatively commonplace and vulgar but really this is so superb that i must express some of my emotion even at the risk of lowering your opinion of my good taste provided of course that you have any opinion on the one hand or any good taste on the other  without that undue depreciation of ones self which must ever be a sign of selfconscious demerit said the young girl lightly i may say that i am not generally good at johnsonese but it may relieve your mind to know that had you kept silence one instant longer i should have taken the risk of lowering your opinion of my taste provided of course that you have one to lower and are capable of that exertionif such indeed it may be termedby remarking that this is perfectly magnificent  do you think he said gloomily still leaning on the rail that we can keep this kind of thing upperhaps i should say downmuch longer for myself i am feeling far from well it may have been the lobsteror that last sentencebut  they were both silent  yet she said after a pause you can at least take mr starling and his dyspepsia off my hands  you might be equal to that exertion  i suppose that by this time i ought to be doing something for somebody he said thoughtfully  yes i will  that evening after dinner he took mr starling into the smokingroom and cardroom  they had something hot  at 4 a m with the assistance of the steward he projected mr starling into mrs starlings stateroom delicately withdrawing to evade the ladys thanks  at breakfast he saw miss bike  thank you so much she said mrs starling found starling greatly improved  he himself admitted he was never berrer and far from worrying about what nightclothes he should wear went to bed as he waseven to his hat  mrs starling calls you her preserver and mr starling distinctly stated that you were a jollygoodfler  and you asked john lummox  in your present condition of abnormal selfconsciousness and apperceptive egotism i really shouldnt like to say  when the voyage was ended mr lummox went to see mary bike at her house and his fatherwhom he had not seen for ten yearsat his house  with a refined absence of natural affection he contented himself with inquiring of the servants as to his fathers habits and if he still wore dress clothes at dinner  the information thus elicited forced him to the conclusion that the old gentlemans circumstances were reduced and that it was possible that he john lummox might be actually compelled to earn his own living  he communicated that suspicion to his father at dinner and over the last bottle of mouton a circumstance which also had determined him in his resolution  you might said his father thoughtfully offer yourself to some rising american novelist as a study for the new heroone absolutely without ambition capacity or energy willing however to be whatever the novelist chooses to make him so long as he hasnt to choose for himself  if your inordinate selfconsciousness is still in your way i could give him a few points about you myself  i had thought said john hesitatingly of going into your office and becoming your partner in the business  you could always look after me you know  a shudder passed over the old man  then he tremblingly muttered to himself  thank heaven  there is one way it may still be averted retiring to his room he calmly committed suicide thoughtfully leaving the empty poison bottle in the fender  and this is how john lummox came to offer himself as a clerk to danl borem  the ways of providence are indeed strange yet those of the novelist are only occasionally novel   iii  john k lummox lived for a week at the turkey buzzard hotel exclusively on doughnuts and innuendoes  he was informed by mr borems clerkwhose place he was to fillthat he wouldnt be able to stand it and thus received the character of his employer from his last employee  i suppose said danl borem chuckling that he said i was a old skinflint good only at a hoss trade uneddicated ignorant and unable to keep accounts and an oppressor o the widder and orphan allowed that my cute sayins was a kind o tencent parody o them proverbs in poor richards almanack  omitting a few expletives he certainly did returned lummox with great delicacy  he allowed to me said danl thoughtfully that you was a poor critter that hadnt a single reason to show for livin that the foolkiller had bin shadderin you from your birth and that you hadnt paid a cent profit on your fathers original investment in ye nor on the assessments hed paid on ye ever since  he seems to be a cute feller arter all and im rather sorry hes leavin  i am quite willing to abandon my position in his favor now said lummox with alacrity  no said danl rubbing his chin argumentatively the only way for us to do is to circumvent him like in a hoss tradewith suthin unexpected  when he thinks youre goin to sleep in the shafts youll run away and when he thinks im vicious ill let a woman or a child drive me   iv  well danl hows that new clerk o yours gettin on said mrs bigby a week later  purty fine  hes good at accounts and hez got to know the banks customers by this time  but i allus reckoned hed get stuck with some o them counterfeit notesand he hez  ye see he aint accustomed to look at a five or a ten dollar note as sharp as some men and hes already taken in two tens and a five counterfeits  gracious said mrs bigsby  what did the poor feller do  oh he ups and tells me all right after he discovered it  and sez he ive charged my account with em sez he so the bank wont lose it  why danl said mrs bigsby ye didnt let that poor feller  you hol on said her brother business is business but i sez to him ye oughter put it down to profit and loss account  or perhaps well have a chance o gettin rid o themnot in noo york where folks is sharp but here in the country and then ye kin credit yourself with the amount arter youve got rid o them  laws  im sorry ye did that danl said mrs bigsby  with that he riz up continued danl ignoring his sister and takin them counterfeit notes from my hand sez he them notes belong to me now sez he and im goin to destroy em  and with that he walks over to the fire as stiff as a poker and held them notes in it until they were burnt clean up  well but that was honest and straightforward in him said mrs bigsby  um but it wasnt businessand ye see  danl paused and rubbed his chin  well go on said mrs bigsby impatiently  well ye see neither him nor me was very smart in detectin counterfeits or even knowin em and  well  for goodness sake danl speak out  wellthe dum fool burnt up three good bills and we neither of us knew it   v  the unexpected which danl borem had hinted might characterize his future conduct was first intimated by his treatment of the widow cully an aged and impoverished woman whose property was heavily mortgaged to him  he had curtly summoned her to come to his office on christmas day and settle up  frightened hopeless and in the face of a snowstorm the old woman attended but was surprised by receiving a satisfaction piece in full from the banker and a gorgeous christmas dinner  all the same said mrs bigsby to lummox danl might hev done all this without frightenin the poor old critter into a nervous fever chillin her through by makin her walk two miles through the snow and keepin her on the ragged edge o despair for two mortal hours  but its his humorous way  did he give any reason for being so lenient to the widow asked lummox  he said that her son had given him a core of his apple when they were boys together  danl ez mighty thoughtful o folks that was kind to him in them days  is that all said lummox astonished  wellive kinder thought suthin else said mrs bigsby hesitatingly  what  that its bein christmas dayand as ive heard tell thats no day in law but just like sundaydanl mebbe thought that he might crawl outer that satisfaction piece ef he ever wanted ter  danl is mighty cute   vi  mr john lummox was not behind his employer in developing unexpected traits of character  hitherto holding aloof from his neighbors in old folksville he suddenly went to a social gathering and distinguished himself as the principal and popular guest of the evening  as danl borem afterward told his sister he was one o them combination minstrels and variety shows in one he sang through a whole opery made the pianner jest howl gave some recitations casabianker and betsy and i are out imitated all them tragedians did tricks with cards and fetched rabbits outer hats besides liftin the pianner with two men sittin on it jest by his teeth  created snakes said borem concluding his account which here is necessarily abbreviated ef he learnt all that in his two years in europe i aint sayin anythin more agin eddication and furrin travel after this  why the next day there was quite a run on the bank jest to see him  he is makin the bizness poplar  then ye think yell get along together  i reckon well hitch hosses said danl with a smile  a few weeks later one evening danl borem sat with his sister alone john lummox who was now residing with them was attending a social engagement  mrs bigsby knew that danl had something to communicate but knew that he would do so in his own way  speakin o hoss trades he began  we wasnt and we aint goin to said mrs bigsby with great promptness  ive heard enough of em  but this here one hez suthin to do with your fren john lummox said danl with a chuckle  mrs bigsby stared  go on then she said but for goodness sake cut it short  danl threw away his quid and replenished it from his silver tobacco box  mrs bigsby shuddered slightly as she recognized the usual preliminary to prolixity but determined as far as possible to make her brother brief  it mout be two weeks ago began danl that i see john lummox over at palmyra where hed bin visitin  he was drivin a hoss the beautifulest critterfor colori ever saw  it was yaller with mane and tail a kinder golden like the hair o them british blondes that was here in the variety show  danl exclaimed mrs bigsby horrified  and you allowed you never went thar  saw em on the postersand mebbe the color was a little brighter thar said danl carelesslybut whos interruptin now  go on said mrs bigsby  got a fine hoss thar sez i reckon i never see such a purty color sez i  he is purty sez he peraps too purty for me to be adrivin but he isnt fast  i aint speakin o that sez i its his looks that im talkin of whar might ye hev got him he was offered to me by a fren o me boyhood sez he hes a pinto mustang sez he from californy whar they breed em whats a pinto hoss sez i  the same ez a calico hoss sez he what they have in cirkises but ye never see em that color  en he was right for when i looked him over i never did see such a soft and silky coat and his mane and tail jest glistened  it is a little too showy for ye sez i but i might take him at a fair price  whats your fren askin  he wont sell him to anybody but me sez lummox hes a horror o hoss traders anyway and his price is more like a gift to a fren  what might that price be ef its a fair question sez i for the more i looked at the hoss the more i liked him  a hundred and fifty dollars sez he but my fren would ask you double that couldnt you and me make a trade sez i ill exchange ye that roan mare thats worth two hundred for this hoss and fifty dollars  with that he drew himself up and sez he mr borem sez he i share my frens opinion about hoss tradin and i promised my mother id never swap hosses  you ought to know me by this time  thats so said mrs bigsby im wonderin ye dared to ax him  danl passed his hand over his mouth and continued i dunno but youre right lummox sez i peraps its jest as well as thar wasnt two in the bank in that bizness  but the more i looked at the hoss the more i hankered arter him  look here sez i i tell ye what ill do  ill lend you my hoss and youll lend me yourn  ill draw up a paper to that effect and provide that in case o accidents ef i dont return you your hoss ill agree to pay you a hundred and fifty dollars  youll give me the same kind o paper about my hosswith the proviso that you pay me two hundred for him  excuse me mr borem sez he but that difference of fifty makes a hoss trade accordin to my mind  its agin my principles to make such an agreement  an he was right danl said mrs bigsby approvingly  but danl wiped his mouth again leaving however a singular smile on it  well ez i wanted that hoss i jest thought and thought i knew i could get two hundred and fifty for him easy and that lummox didnt know anythin of his valoo and i finally agreed to make the swap even what do you call him sez i  pegasus sez hethe poets hoss on account o his golden mane sez he that made me laff for i never knew a poet ez could afford to hev a hossmuch less one like that but i said ill borry pegasus o you on those terms  the next day i took the hoss to

hoss trade sez he and im goin to send the hoss back  mebbe your conscience sez i may trouble you a little more ef youll step this way and with that i takes his arm and leads him round to the stable and brings out the hoss  well lummox never changes ez much as a hair ez he puts up his eyeglasses  im not good at whats called poplar art sez he is it a chromo or your own work sez he critical like

wants renewin sez he  wots that sez i  a few more bottles o that british blonde hair dye to set him up agin  thats wot they allus do in the cirkis whar he kem from  then i went back to the office and i took down my sign  whats that you re doin sez lummox with a sickly kind o smile  are you goin out o the bizness  no im only goin to change that sign from danl borem to borem and lummox sez i  ive concluded its cheaper for me to take you inter partnership now than to continue in this way which would only end in your hevin to take me in later  i preferred to do it fust   vii  a rich man and settled in business john lummox concluded that he would marry mary bike  with that farsighted logic which had always characterized him he reasoned that having first met her on a liner he would find her again on one if he took passage to europe  he didbut she was down on the passenger list as mrs edwin wraggles  the result of their interview was given to mrs bigsby by danl borem in his own dialect  ez far as i kin see it was like the deacons sunday hoss trade bein all ef it wassent  ef ye wasnt mrs wraggles sez lummox sez he id be tellin ye how ive loved ye ever sence i first seed ye  ef ye wasnt mrs wraggles id be squeezin yer hand sez he ef ye wasnt mrs wraggles id be askin ye to marry me  then the gal ups and sez sez she but i aint mrs wraggles sez she mrs wraggles is my sister and couldnt come so im travelin on her ticket and thats how my name is wraggles on the passenger list  but why didnt ye tell me so at once sez lummox  this is an episoode o protracted humor sez she and im bound to have a show in it somehow  well said mrs bigsby breathlessly then he did marry her  darned ef i know  he never said so straight outbut thats like lummox     stories three  by rdyd kplg   i  for simla reasons  some people say that improbable things dont necessarily happen in indiabut these people never find improbabilities anywhere  this sounds clever but you will at once perceive that it really means the opposite of what i intended to say  so well drop it  what i am trying to tell you is that after sparkley had that affair with miss millikens a singular change came over him  he grew abstracted and solitaryholding dark seances with himselfwhich was odd as everybody knew he never cared a rap for the millikens girl  it was even said that he was off his headwhich is rhyme  but his reason was undoubtedly affected for he had been heard to mutter incoherently at the club and strangest of all to answer questions that were never asked  this was so awkward in that branch of the civil department of which he was a high officialwhere the rule was exactly the reversethat he was presently invalided on full pay  then he disappeared  clever people said it was because the department was afraid he had still much to answer for stupid people simply envied him  mrs awksby whom everybody knew had been the cause of breaking off the match was now wild to know the reason of sparkleys retirement  she attacked heaven and earth and even went a step higherto the viceroy at the viceregal ball i saw behind the curtains of a window her rolling violetblue eyes with a singular glitter in them  it was the reflection of the viceroys star although the rest of his excellency was hidden in the curtain  i heard him saying come now really now you areyou know you are in reply to her cooing questioning  then she made a dash at me and captured me  what did you hear  nothing i should not have heard  dont be like all the other menyou silly boy she answered  i was only trying to find out something about sparkley  and i will find it out too she said clinching her thin little hand  and whats more she added turning on me suddenly you shall help me  i i said in surprise  dont pretend she said poutingly  youre too clever to believe hes cut up over the millikens  noits something awful oranother woman  now if i knew as much of india as you doand wasnt a woman and could go where i likedid go to bungloore and find him  oh you have his address i said  certainly  what did you expect i was behind the curtain with the viceroy for she said opening her violet eyes innocently  its bungloorefirst turning to the rightat the end of the passage  bungloorenear ghouli passin the jungle  i knew the place a spot of dank pestilence and mystery  you never could have gone there i said  you do not know what i could do for a friend she said sweetly veiling her eyes in demure significance  oh come off the roof i said bluntly  she could be obedient when it was necessary  she came off  not without her revenge  try to remember you are not at school with the stalkies she said and turned away  i went to bungloorenot on her account but my own  if you dont know india you wont know bungloore  its all that and more  an egg dropped by a vulture sat upon and addled by the department but i knew the house and walked boldly in  a lion walked out of one door as i came in at another  we did this two or three timesand found it amusing  a large cobra in the hall rose up bowed as i passed and respectfully removed his hood  i found the poor old boy at the end of the passage  it might have been the passage between calais and doverhe looked so green so limp and dejected  i affected not to notice it and threw myself in a chair  he gazed at me for a moment and then said did you hear what the chair was saying  it was an ordinary bamboo armchair and had creaked after the usual fashion of bamboo chairs  i said so  he cast his eyes to the ceiling  he calls it creaking he murmured  no matter he continued aloud its remark was not of a complimentary nature  its very difficult to get really polite furniture  the man was evidently stark staring mad  i still affected not to observe it and asked him if that was why he left simla  there were simla reasons certainly he replied  but you think i came here for solitude  solitude he repeated with a laugh why i hold daily conversations with any blessed thing in this house from the veranda to the chimneystack with any stick of furniture from the footstool to the towelhorse  i get more out of it than the gabble at the club  you look surprised  listen  i took this thing up in my leisure hours in the department  i had read much about the conversation of animals  i argued that if animals conversed why shouldnt inanimate things communicate with each other  you cannot prove that animals dont converseneither can you prove that inanimate objects do not  see  i was thunderstruck with the force of his logic  of course he continued there are degrees of intelligence and that makes it difficult  for instance a mahogany table would not talk like a rushbottomed kitchen chair  he stopped suddenly listened and replied i really couldnt say  i didnt speak i said  i know you didnt  but your chair asked me how long that fool was going to stay  i replied as you heard  pray dont movei intend to change that chair for one more accustomed to polite society  to continue i perfected myself in the language and it was awfully jolly at first  whenever i went by train i heard not only all the engines said but what every blessed carriage thought that joined in the conversation  if you chaps only knew what rot those whistles can get off  and as for the brakes they can beat any mule driver in cursing then after a time it got rather monotonous and i took a short sea trip for my health  but by jove every blessed inch of the whole shipfrom the screw to the bowsprithad something to say and the bad language used by the garboard strake when the ship rolled was something too awful  you dont happen to know what the garboard strake is do you  no i replied  no more do i  thats the dreadful thing about it  youve got to listen to chaps that you dont know  why coming home on my bicycle the other day there was an awful row between some infernal sprocket and the ball bearings of the machine and i never knew before there were such things in the whole concern  i thought i had got at his secret and said carelessly then i suppose this was the reason why you broke off your engagement with miss millikens  not at all he said coolly  nothing to do with it  that is quite another affair  its a very queer story would you like to hear it  by all means  i took out my notebook  you remember that night of the amateur theatricals got up by the white hussars when the lights suddenly went out all over the house  yes i replied i heard about it  well i had gone down there that evening with the determination of proposing to mary millikens the first chance that offered  she sat just in front of me her sister jane next and her mother smart widow millikenswho was a bit larky on her own account you rememberthe next on the bench  when the lights went out and the panic and tittering began i saw my chance  i leaned forward and in a voice that would just reach marys ear i said i have long wished to tell you how my life is bound up with you dear and i never never can be happy without youwhen just then there was a mighty big shove down my bench from the fellows beyond me who were trying to get out  but i held on like grim death and struggled back again into position and went on youll forgive my taking a chance like this but i felt i could no longer conceal my love for you when im blest if there wasnt another shove and though id got hold of her little hand and had a kind of squeeze in return i was drifted away again and had to fight my way back  but i managed to finish and said if the devotion of a lifetime will atone for this hurried avowal of my love for you let me hope for a response and just then the infernal lights were turned on and there i was holding the widows hand and she nestling on my shoulder and the two girls in hysterics on the other side  you see i never knew that they were shoved down on their bench every time just as i was and of course when i got back to where i was id just skipped one of them each time  yes sir  i had made that proposal in three sectionsa part to each girl winding up with the mother  no explanation was possible and i left simla next day  naturally it wasnt a thing they could talk about either  then you think mrs awksby had nothing to do with it i said  nothingabsolutely nothing  by the way if you see that lady you might tell her that i have possession of that brocade easychair which used to stand in the corner of her boudoir  you remember itfaded white and yellow with one of the casters off and a little frayed at the back but rather softspoken and amiable  but of course you dont understand that  i bought it after she moved into her new bungalow  but why should i tell her that i asked in wonder  nothingexcept that i find it very amusing with its reminiscences of the company she used to entertain and her confidences generally goodbytake care of the lion in the hall  he always couches on the left for a spring  tata  i hurried away  when i returned to simla i told mrs awksby of my discoveries and spoke of the armchair  i fancied she colored slightly but quickly recovered  dear old sparkley she said sweetly he was a champion liar   ii  a privates honor  i had not seen mulledwiney for several days  knowing the manthis looked bad  so i dropped in on the colonel  i found him in deep thought  this looked bad too for old cockey waxas he was known to everybody in the hill districts but himselfwasnt given to thinking i guessed the cause and told him so  yes he said wearily you are right  its the old story mulledwiney bleareyed and otherwise are at it againdrink followed by clink  even now two corporals and a private are sitting on mulledwineys head to keep him quiet and bleareyed is chained to an elephant  perhaps i suggested you are unnecessarily severe  do you really think so  thank you so much  i am always glad to have a civilians opinion on military mattersand vice versait broadens one so  and yetam i severe  i am willing for instance to overlook their raid upon a native village and the ransom they demanded for a native inspector  i have overlooked their taking the horses out of my carriage for their own use  i am content also to believe that my fowls meekly succumb to jungle fever and cholera  but there are some things i cannot ignore  the carrying off of the great god vishnu from the sacred shrine at ducidbad by the three for the sake of the priceless opals in its eyes  but i never heard of that i interrupted eagerly  tell me  ah said the colonel playfully thatas you so often and so amusingly sayis another story  yet i would have overlooked the theft of the opals if they had not substituted two of the queens regimental buttons for the eyes of the god  this while it did not deceive the ignorant priests had a deep political and racial significance  you are aware of course that the great mutiny was occasioned by the issue of cartridges to the native troops greased with hogs fatforbidden by their religion  but these three men could themselves alone quell a mutiny i replied  the colonel grasped my hand warmly  thank you  so they could  i never thought of that  he looked relieved  for all that he presently passed his hand over his forehead and nervously chewed his cheroot  there is something else i said  you are right  there is  it is a secret  promise me it shall go no furtherthan the press  nay swear that you will keep it for the press  i promise  thank you so much  it is a matter of my own and mulledwineys the fact is we have had a personal difficulty  he paused glanced around him and continued in a low agitated voice yesterday i came upon him as he was sitting leaning against the barrack wall  in a spirit of playfulnessmere playfulness i assure you siri poked him lightly in the shoulder with my stick saying boo  he turnedand i shall never forget the look he gave me  good heavens i gasped you touchedabsolutely touchedmulledwiney  yes he said hurriedly i knew what you would say it was against the queens regulationsandthere was his sensitive nature which shrinks from even a harsh word but i did it and of course he has me in his power  and you have touched him i repeatedtouched his private honor  yes  but i shall atone for it  i have already arranged with him that we shall have it out between ourselves alone in the jungle stripped to the buff with our fistsqueensberry rules  i havent fought since i stood up against spinks majoryou remember old spinks now of the bombay offensiblesat eton  and the old boy pluckily bared his skinny arm  it may be serious i said  i have thought of that  i have a wife several children and an aged parent in england  if i fall they must never know  you must invent a story for them  i have thought of cholera but that is played out you know we have already tried it on the boy who was thrown away  invent something quiet peaceable and respectableas far removed from fighting as possible  what do you say to measles  not half bad i returned  measles let it be then  say i caught it from wee willie winkie you do not think it too incredible he added timidly  not more than your story i said  he grasped my hand struggling violently with his emotion  then he struggled with meand i left hurriedly  poor old boy  the funeral was well attended however and no one knew the truth not even myself   iii  jungle folk  it was high noon of a warm summers day when moo kow came down to the wateringplace  miaow otherwise known as puskatthe warmthloving onewas crouching on a limb that overhung the pool sunning herself brer rabbitbut that is another story by another person  three or four gee gees already at the pool moved away on the approach of moo kow  why do ye stand aside said the moo kow  why do you say ye said the gee gees together  because its more impressive than you  dont you know that all animals talk that way in english said the moo kow  and they also say thou and dont you forget it interrupted miaow from the tree  i learnt that from a man cub  the animals were silent  they did not like miaows slang and were jealous of her occasionally sitting on a man cubs lap  once dunkee a poor relation of the gee gees had tried it on disastrouslybut that is also another and a more aged story  we are ridden by the englishplease to observe the capital letters said pi bol the leader of the gee gees proudly  they are a mighty race who ride anything and everybody  dye mind thati mean look ye well to it  what should they know of england who only england know said miaow  is that a conundrum asked the moo kow  no its poetry said the miaow  i know england said pi bol prancingly  i used to go from the bank to islington three times a dayi mean he added hurriedly before i became a screwi should say a screwgun horse  and i said the moo kow am terrible  when the young women and children in the village see me approach they fly shriekingly  my presence alone has scattered their sacred festivalthe sundes kool piknik  i strike terror to their inmost souls and am more feared by them than even kreepmows the insidious  and yet behold  i have taken the place of the mothers of men and i have nourished the mighty ones of the earth  but that said the moo kow turning her head aside bashfully that is anudder story  a dead silence fell on the pool  and i said miaow lifting up her voice i am the horror and haunter of the night season  when i pass like the night wind over the roofs of the houses men shudder in their beds and tremble when they hear my voice as i creep stealthily along their balconies they cry to their gods for succor  they arise and from their windows they offer me their priceless household treasuresthe sacred vessels dedicated to their great god shivwhich they call shivin mugsthe kloes brosh the boojak urging me to fly them and yet said miaow mournfully it is but my lovesong  think ye what they would do if i were on the warpath  another dead silence fell on the pool  then arose that strange mysterious indefinable thing known as the scent  the animals sniffed  it heralds the approach of the stalkiesthe most famous of british skool boaz said the moo kow  they have just placed a decaying guineapig two white mice in an advanced state of decomposition and a single slice of limburger cheese in the bed of their tutor  they had previously skillfully diverted the drains so that they emptied into the drawingroom of the headmaster  they have just burned down his house in an access of noble zeal and are fighting among themselves for the spoil  hark do ye hear them  a wild medley of shrieks and howls had arisen and an irregular mob of strange creatures swept out of the distance toward the pool some were like pygmies some had bloody noses  their talk consisted of feverish breathless ejaculationsa gibberish in which the words rot oach and giddy were preeminent  some were exciting themselves by chewing a kind of bhang made from the plant called pappahmint others had their faces streaked with djam  but who is this they are ducking in the pool asked pi bol  it is one who has foolishly and wantonly conceived that his parents have sent him here to study said the moo kow but that is against the rules of the stalkies who accept study only as a punishment  then these be surely the bander logthe monkey folkof whom the good rhuddyidd has told us said a gee geethe ones who have no purposeand forget everything  fool said the moo kow  know ye not that the great rhuddyidd has said that the stalkies become majorgenerals v cs and c bs of the english  truly they are great  look now ye shall see one of the greatest traits of the english stalky  one of the pygmy stalkies was offering a bun to a larger one who hesitated but took it coldly  behold it is one of the greatest traits of this mighty race not to show any emotion  he would take the bunhe has taken it  he is pleasedbut he may not show it  observe him eat  the taller stalky after eating the bun quietly kicked the giver knocked off his hat and turned away with a calm immovable face  good said the moo kow  ye would not dream that he was absolutely choking with grateful emotion  we would not said the animals  but why are they all running back the way they came asked pi bol  they are going back to punishment  great is its power  have ye not heard the gospel of rhuddyidd the mighty  force is everything gentleness wont wash courtesy is deceitful politeness is foreign be ye beaten that ye may beat  pass the kick on  but here he was interrupted by the appearance of three soldiers who were approaching the wateringplace  ye are now said the moo kow with the main guard  the first is bleareyed who carries a raven in a cage which he has stolen from the wife of a deputy commissioner  he will paint the bird snow white and sell it as a dove to the same lady  the second is otherwise who is dragging a small garden engine of which he has despoiled a native gardener whom he has felled with a single blow the third is mulledwiney swinging a cutglass decanter of sherry which he has just snatched from the table of his colonel mulledwiney and otherwise will play the engine upon bleareyed who is suffering from heat apoplexy and djimdjams  the three soldiers seated themselves in the pool  they are going to tell awful war stories now said the moo kow stories that are large and strong  some people are shockedothers like em  then he that was called mulledwiney told a story  in the middle of it miaow got up from the limb of the tree coughed slightly and put her paw delicately over her mouth  you must excuse me she said faintly i am taken this way sometimesand i have left my salts at home thanks  i can get down myself  the next moment she had disappeared but was heard coughing in the distance  mulledwiney winked at his companions and continued his story  wid that we wor in the thick av the foight  whin i say thick i mane it sorr  we wor that jammed together divil a bit cud we shoot or cut  at furrest i had lashed two mushkits together wid the baynits out so like a hay fork and getting the haymakers lift on thim i just lifted two paythians outone an aych baynitand passed em aisylike over me head to the rear rank for them to finish  but what wid the blud gettin into me ois i was blinded and the pressure kept incraysin until me arrums was thrussed like a fowl to me sides and sorra a bit cud i move but me jaws  and bloomin well you knew how to use them said otherwise  thrue for youthough ye dont mane it said mulledwiney playfully tapping otherwise on the head with a decanter till the cut glass slowly shivered  so begorra there wor nothing left for me to do but to ate thim  wirra but it was the crooel worruk  excuse me my lord interrupted the gasping voice of pi bol as he began to back from the pool i am but a horse i know and being built in that waynaturally have the stomach of oneyet really my lord thiser  and his voice was gone  the next moment he had disappeared  mulledwiney looked around with affected concern  save us  but weve cleaned out the jungle  sure theres not a baste left but ourselves  it was true  the wateringplace was empty  moo kow miaow and the gee gees had disappeared  presently there was a booming crash and a long deep rumbling among the distant hills  then they knew they were near the old moulmein pagoda and the dawn had come up like thunder out of china cross the bay  it always came up that way there  the strain was too great and day was actually breaking     zutski  the problem of a wicked feme sole  by mre crlli   i  the great pyramid towered up from the desert with its apex toward the moon which hung in the sky  for centuries it had stood thus disdaining the aid of gods or man being as the sphinx herself observed able to stand up for itself  and this was no small praise from that sublime yet mysterious female who had seen the ages come and go empires rise and fall novelist succeed novelist and who for eons and cycles the cynosure and centre of admiration and mens idolatrous worship had yetwonderful for a womanthrough it all kept her head which now alone remained to survey calmly the present  indeed at that moment that magnificent and peaceful face seemed to have lostwith a few unimportant featuresits usual expression of speculative wisdom and intense disdain its mouth smiled its left eyelid seemed to droop as the opal tints of dawn deepened upon it the eyelid seemed to droop lower closed and quickly recovered itself twice  you would have thought the sphinx had winked  then arose a voice like a wind on the desertbut really from the direction of the nile where a hired dahabiyeh lay moored to the bankarry axes  arry axes  with it came also a flapping trailing vision from the waterthe sacred ibis itselfand with wings aslant drifted mournfully away to its own creaking echo kraksis kraksis  again arose the weird voice arry axes wotcher doin of  and again the ibis croaked its wild refrain kraksis kraksis  moonlight and the hour wove their own mystery for which the author is not responsible and the voice was heard no more  but when the full day sprang in glory over the desert it illuminated the few remaining but sufficiently large features of the sphinx with a burning saffron radiance  the sphinx had indeed blushed   ii  it was the full season at cairo  the wealth and fashion of bayswater south kensington and even the bosky wood of the evangelist had sent their latest luxury and style to flout the tombs of the past with the ghastly flippancy of today  the cheap tripper was therethe latest example of the darwinian theoryapelike flea and curio hunting shamelessly inquisitive and always hungry what did he know of the sphinx or the pyramids or the voiceand for the matter of that what did they know of him and yet he was not half bad in comparison with the swagger peoplethese people who pretend to have lungs and what not and instead of galloping on merry hunters through the frost and snow of piccadilly and park instead of enjoying the roaring fires of piled logs in the evening at the first approach of winter steal away to the land of the sun and decline to die like honest britons on british soil  and then they know nothing of the egyptians and are horrified at bakshish which they really ought to pay for the privilege of shocking the straightlimbed nakedfooted arab in his single rough garment with their baggy elephantlegged trousers and they know nothing of the mystic land of the old gods filled with profound enigmas of the supernatural dark secrets yet unexplored except in this book  well might the great memnon murmur after this lapse of these thousand years theyre making me tired  such was the blissful selfsatisfied ignorance of sir midas pyle or as lord fitzfulke with his delightful imitation of the east london accent called him sir myde his pyle as he leaned back on his divan in the grand cairo hotel  he was the vulgar editor and proprietor of a vulgar london newspaper and had brought his wife with him who was vainly trying to marry off his faded daughters  there was to be a fancydress ball at the hotel that night and lady pyle hoped that her girls if properly disguised might have a better chance  here too was lady fitzfulke whose mother was immortalized by byronsixty if a day yet still dressing youthfullywho had sought the land of the sphinx in the faint hope that in the contiguity of that lady she might pass for being young  alaster mcfeckless a splendid young scotchmanalready dressed as a florentine sailor of the fifteenth century which enabled him to show his magnificent calves quite as well as in his native highland dress and who had added with characteristic noble pride a sporran to his costume was lolling on another divan  oh those exquisite those magnificent eyes of hers  eh sirs he murmured suddenly as waking from a dream  oh damn her eyes said lord fitzfulke languidly  tell you what old man youre just gone on that girl  ha roared mcfeckless springing to his feet ye will be using such language of the bonniest  you will excuse me gentlemen said sir midaswho hated scenes unless he had a trusted reporter with himbut i think it is time for me to go upstairs and put on my windsor uniform which i find exceedingly convenient for these mixed assemblies  he withdrew caressing his protuberant paunch with some dignity as the two men glanced fiercely at each other  in another moment they might have sprung at each others throats but luckily at this instant a curtain was pushed aside as if by some waiting listener and a thin man entered dressed in cap and gownwhich would have been simply academic but for his carrying in one hand behind him a bundle of birch twigs  it was dr haustus pilgrim a noted london practitioner and specialist dressed as ye oldefashioned pedagogue  he was presumably spending his holiday on the nile in a large dahabiyeh with a number of friends among whom he counted the two momentary antagonists he had just interrupted but those who knew the doctors farreaching knowledge and cryptic researches believed he had his own scientific motives  the two men turned quickly as he entered the angry light faded from their eyes and an awed and respectful submission to the intruder took its place  he walked quietly toward them put a lozenge in the mouth of one and felt the pulse of the other gazing critically at both  we will be all right in a moment he said with professional confidence  i say said fitzfulke gazing at the doctors costume you look dooced smart in those togs dontcherknow  they suit me said the doctor with a playful swish of his birch twigs at which the two grave men shuddered  but you were speaking of somebodys beautiful eyes  the princess zutskis returned mcfeckless eagerly and this daft callant said  he didnt like them put in fitzfulke promptly  ha said the doctor sharply and why not sir  as fitzfulke hesitated he added brusquely there  run away and play  ive business with this young man pointing to mcfeckless  as fitzfulke escaped gladly from the room the doctor turned to mcfeckless  it wont do my boy  the princess is not for youyoull only break your heart and ruin your family over her  thats my advice chuck her  but i cannot said mcfeckless humbly  think of her weirdly beautiful eyes  i see said the doctor meditatively sort of makes you feel creepy kind of alloverishness eh  thats like her  but whom have we here  he was staring at a striking figure that had just entered closely followed by a crowd of admiring spectators  and indeed he seemed worthy of the homage  his magnificent form was closely attired in a velveteen jacket and trousers with a singular display of pearl buttons along the seams that were absolutely lavish in their quantity a hat adorned with feathers and roses completed his singularly picturesque equipment  chevalier burst out mcfeckless in breathless greeting  ah mon ami  what good chance returned the newcomer rushing to him and kissing him on both cheeks to the british horror of sir midas who had followed  ah but you are perfect he added kissing his fingers in admiration of mcfecklesss florentine dress  but youwhat is this ravishing costume asked mcfeckless with a pang of jealousy  you are godlike  it is the dress of what you call the koster a transplanted phenician tribe answered the other  they who knocked em in the road of old kentknow you not the legend  as he spoke he lifted his superb form to a warriors height and gesture  but is this quite correct asked fitzfulke of the doctor  perfectly said the doctor oracularly  the renowned arry axesi beg his pardon he interrupted himself hastily i mean the chevalieris perfect in his archaeology and ethnology  the koster is originally a gypsy which is but a corruption of the word egyptian and if i mistake not that gentleman is a lineal descendant  but he is called chevalier and he speaks like a frenchman said fluffy  and being a frenchman of course knows nothing outside of paris said sir midas  we are in the land of mystery said the doctor gravely in a low voice  you have heard of the egyptian hall and the temple of mystery  a shudder passed through many that were there but the majority were following with wild adulation the superb koster who with elbows slightly outward and hands turned inward was passing toward the ballroom  mcfeckless accompanied him with conflicting emotions  would he see the incomparable princess who was lovelier and even still more a mystery than the chevalier  would sheterrible thoughtsuccumb to his perfections   iii  the princess was already there surrounded by a crowd of admirers equal if not superior to those who were following the superb chevalier indeed they met almost as rivals  their eyes sought each other in splendid competition  the chevalier turned away dazzled and incoherent  she is adorable magnificent he gasped to mcfeckless i love her on the instant  behold i am transported ravished present me  indeed as she stood there in a strange gauzy garment of exquisite colors apparently shapeless yet now and then revealing her perfect figure like a bather seen through undulating billows she was lovely two wands were held in her taper fingers whose mystery only added to the general curiosity but whose weird and cabalistic uses were to be seen later  her magnificent facestrange in its beautywas stranger still since with perfect archaeological egyptian correctness she presented it only in profile at whatever angle the spectator stood but such a profile  the words of the great poetking rose to mcfecklesss lips her nose is as a tower that looketh toward damascus  he hesitated a moment torn with love and jealousy and then presented his friend  you will fall in love with herand thenyou will fall also by my hand he hissed in his rivals ear and fled tumultuously  voulezvous danser mademoiselle whispered the chevalier in the perfect accent of the boulevardier  merci beaucoup she replied in the diplomatic courtesies of the ambassadeurs  they danced together not once but many times to the admiration the wonder and envy of all to the scandalized reprobation of a proper few who was she  who was he  it was easy to answer the last question the world rang with the reputation of chevalier the artist  but she was still a mystery  perhaps they were not so to each other  he was gazing deliriously into her eyes  she was looking at him in disdainful curiosity ive seen you before somewhere havent i she said at last with a crushing significance  he shuddered he knew not why and passed his hand over his high forehead  yes i go there very often he replied vacantly  but you mademoiselleyoui have met before  oh ages ages ago  there was something weird in her emphasis  ha said a voice near them i thought so  it was the doctor peering at them curiously  and you both feel rather dazed and creepy  he suddenly felt their pulses lingering however as the chevalier fancied somewhat longer than necessary over the ladys wrist and beautiful arm  he then put a small round box in the chevaliers hand saying one before each meal and turning to the lady with caressing professional accents said we must wrap ourselves closely and endeavor to induce perspiration and hurried away dragging the chevalier with him  when they reached a secluded corner he said you had just now a kind of feeling dont you know as if youd sort of been there before didnt you  yes what you call apreexistence said the chevalier wonderingly  yes i have often observed that those who doubt a future state of existence have no hesitation in accepting a previous one said the doctor dryly  but come i see from the way the crowd are hurrying that your divinitys number is upi mean he corrected himself hastily that she is probably dancing again  aha with him the imbecile mcfeckless gasped the chevalier  no alone  she was indeed alone in the centre of the ballroomwith outstretched arms revolving in an occult weird dreamy mystic druidical cabalistic circle  they now for the first time perceived the meaning of those strange wands which appeared to be attached to the many folds of her diaphanous skirts and involved her in a fleecy whirling cloud yet in the wild convolutions of her garments and the mad gyrations of her figure her face was upturned with the seraphic intensity of a devotee and her lips parted as with the impassioned appeal for light more light  and the appeal was answered  a flood of blue crimson yellow and green radiance was alternately poured upon her from the black box of a mysterious nubian slave in the gallery  the effect was marvelous at one moment she appeared as a martyr in a sheet of flame at another as an angel wrapped in white and muffled purity and again as a nymph of the cerulean sea and then suddenly a cloud of darkness seemed to descend upon her through which for an instant her figure as immaculate and perfect as a marble statue showed distinctlythen the light went out and she vanished  the whole assembly burst into a rapturous cry  even the common arab attendants who were peeping in at the doors raised their melodious native cry alloe fullah  aloe fullah again and again  a shocked silence followed  then the voice of sir midas pyle was heard addressing dr haustus pilgrim  may we not presume sir that what we have just seen is not unlike that remarkable exhibition when i was pained to meet you one evening at the alhambra  the doctor coughed slightly  the alhambraah yesyouerrefer i presume to granada and the land of the moor where we last met  the music and dance are both distinctly moorishwhich after all is akin to the egyptian  i am gratified indeed that your memory should be so retentive and your archaeological comparison so accurate  but see the ladies are retiring  let us follow   iv  the intoxication produced by the performance of the princess naturally had its reaction  the british moral soul startled out of its hypocrisy the night before demanded the bitter beer of selfconsciousness and remorse the next morning  the ladies were now openly shocked at what they had secretly envied  lady pyle was however propitiated by the doctors assurance that the princess was a friend of lady fitzfulke who had promised to lend her youthful age and aristocratic prestige to the return ball which the princess had determined to give at her own home  still i think the princess open to criticism said sir midas oracularly  damn all criticism and critics burst out mcfeckless with the noble frankness of a passionate and yet unfettered soul  sir midas who employed critics in his business as he did other base and ignoble slaves drew up himself and his paunch and walked away  the chevalier cast a superb look at mcfeckless  voila  regard me well  i shall seek out this princess when she is with herself alone comprenez  i shall seek her at her hotel in the egyptian hall  ha ha  i shall seek zutski  zut  and he made that rapid yet graceful motion of his palm against his thigh known only to the true parisian  its a rum hole where she lives and nobody gets a sight of her said flossy  its like a beastly family vault dont you know outside and theres a kind of nigger doorkeeper that vises you and chucks you out if you havent the straight tip  ill show you the way if you like  allons en avant said the chevalier gayly  i precipitate myself there on the instant  remember hissed mcfeckless grasping his arm you shall account to me  bien said the chevalier shaking him off lightly  all arrright  then in that incomparable baritone which had so often enthralled thousands he moved away trolling the first verse of the princesss own faint sweet sad song of the lotus lily that thrilled mcfeckless even through the chevaliers marked french accent       oh a hard zing to get is ze lotus lillee       she lif in ze swampin ze watair chillee       she make your foot wetand you look so sillee       but you buy her for sixpence in piccadillee   in half an hour the two men reached the remote suburb where the princess lived a gloomy windowless building  pausing under a low archway over which in egyptian characters appeared the faded legend sta ged oor they found a nubian slave blocking the dim entrance  i leave you here said flossy hurriedly as even i left once beforeonly then i was lightly assisted by his sandaled foot he added rubbing himself thoughtfully  but better luck to you  as his companion retreated swiftly the chevalier turned to the slave and would have passed in but the man stopped him  got a pass boss  no said the chevalier  the man looked at him keenly  oh i see one of de profesh  the chevalier nodded haughtily  the man preceded him by devious narrow ways and dark staircases coming abruptly upon a small apartment where the princess sat on a low divan  a single lamp inclosed in an ominous wire cage flared above her  strange things lay about the floor and shelves and from another door he could see hideous masks frightful heads and disproportionate faces  he shuddered slightly but recovered himself and fell on his knees before her  i lofe you he said madly  i have always lofed you  for how long she asked with a strange smile  he covertly consulted his shirt cuff  for tree tousand fife hundred and sixtytwo years he said rapidly  she looked at him disdainfully  the doctor has been putting you up to that  it wont wash  i dont refer to your shirt cuff she added with deep satire  adorable one he broke out passionately attempting to embrace her i have come to take you  without moving she touched a knob in the wall  a trapdoor beyond him sank and out of the bowels of the earth leaped three indescribable demons  then rising she took a cake of chalk from the table and drawing a mystic half circle on the floor returned to the divan lit a cigarette and leaning comfortably back said in a low monotonous voice advance one foot within that magic line and on that head although it wore a crown i launch the curse of rome  ionly wanted to take youwith a kodak he said with a light laugh to conceal his confusion as he produced the instrument from his coattail pocket  not with that cheap box she said rising with magnificent disdain come again with a decent instrumentand perhaps then lightly humming in a pure contralto ive been photographed like thisive been photographed like that she summoned the slave to conduct him back and vanished through a canvas screen which nevertheless seemed to the dazed chevalier to be the stony front of the pyramids   v  and you saw her said the doctor in french  yes but the threethousandyear gag did not work  she spotted you cher ami on the instant  and she wouldnt let me take her with my kodak  the doctor looked grave i see he mused thoughtfully  you must have my camera a larger one and more bulky perhaps to carry but she will not object to thatshe who has stood for full lengths i will give you some private instructions  but cher doctor this previousexistence ideaat what do you arrive  there is much to say for it said the doctor oracularly  it has survived in the belief of all ages  who can tell  that some men in a previous existence may have been goats or apes continued the doctor looking at him curiously does not seem improbable  from the time of pythagoras we have known that but that the individual as an individual ego has been remanded or projected has harked back or anticipated himself is we may say with our powers of apperceptionthat is the perception that we are perceivingis  but the chevalier had fled  no matter said the doctor i will see mcfeckless  he did  he found him gloomy distraught baleful  he felt his pulse  the mixture as before he said briefly and a little innocent diversion  there is an aunt sally on the esplanadetwo throws for a penny  it will do you good think no more of this woman  listeni wish you well your family have always been good patients of mine  marry some good scotch girl i know one with fifty thousand pounds  let the princess go  to himnever  i will marry her  yet he murmured softly to himself feefty thousand pun is nae small sum  aye  not that i care for sillerbut feefty thousand pun  eh sirs   vi  dr haustus knew that the chevalier had again visited the princess although he had kept the visit a secretand indeed was himself invisible for a day or two afterwards  at last the doctors curiosity induced him to visit the chevaliers apartment entering he was surprisedeven in that land of mysteryto find the room profoundly dark smelling of eastern drugs and the chevalier sitting before a large plate of glass which he was examining by the aid of a lurid ruby lampthe only light in the weird gloom  his face was pale and distraught his locks were disheveled  voila he said  mon dieu  it is my third attempt  always the samehideous monstrous unearthly  it is she and yet it is not she  the doctor professional man as he was and inured to such spectacles was startled  the plate before him showed the princesss face in all its beautiful contour but only dimly veiling a ghastly deathshead below  there was the whole bony structure of the head and the eyeless sockets even the graceful swanlike neck showed the articulated vertebral column that supported it in all its hideous reality  the beautiful shoulders were there dimly as in a dreambut beneath was the empty clavicle the knotty joint the hollow sternum and the ribs of a skeleton half length  the doctors voice broke the silence  my friend he said dryly you see only the truth  you see what she really is this peerless princess of yours  you see her as she is today and you see her kinship to the bones that have lain for centuries in yonder pyramid  yet they were once as fair as this and this was as fair as theyin effect the same you that have madly impiously adored her superficial beauty the mere dust of tomorrow let this be a warning to you  you that have no soul to speak of let that suffice you  take her and be happy  adieu  yet as he passed out of the fitting tomblike gloom of the apartment and descended the stairs he murmured to himself odd that i should have lent him my camera with the rontgenray attachment still on  no matter  it is not the first time that the princess has appeared in two parts the same evening   vii  in spite of envy jealousy and malice a certain curiosity greater than all these drew everybody to the princess zutskis ball  lady fitzfulke was there in virgin white looking more youthful than ever in spite of her sixtyfive years and the card labeled fresh paint which somebody had playfully placed upon her enameled shoulder  the mcfecklesses the pyles flossy the doctor and the chevalierlooking still anxiouswere in attendance  the mysterious nubian doorkeeper admitted the guests through the same narrow passages much to the disgust of lady pyle and the discomfiture of her paunchy husband but on reaching a large circular interior hall a greater surprise was in store for them it was found that the only entrance to the body of the hall was along a narrow ledge against the bare wall some distance from the floor which obliged the guests to walk slowly in single file along this precarious strip giving them the attitudes of an egyptian frieze which was suggested in the original plaster above them  it is needless to say that while the effect was ingenious and striking from the centre of the room where the princess stood with a few personal friends it was exceedingly uncomfortable to the figures themselves in their enforced march along the ledgeespecially a figure of sir midas pyles proportions suddenly an exclamation broke from the doctor  do you see he said to the princess pointing to the figure of the chevalier who was filing along with his sinewy hands slightly turned inward how surprisingly like he is to the first attendant on the king in the real frieze above  and that added the doctor was none other than arry axes the egyptian you are always thinking of  and he peered curiously at her  goodness me murmured the princess in an arabic much more soft and fluent than the original gum  so he doeslook like him  and do you know you look like him too  would you mind taking a walk around together  they did amid the acclamations of the crowd  the likeness was perfect  the princess however was quite white as she eagerly rejoined the doctor  and this means she hissed in a low whisper  that he is the real arry axes  hush not a word now  we join the dahabiyeh tonight  at daybreak you will meet him at the fourth angle of the pyramid first turning from the nile   viii  the crescent moon hung again over the apex of the great pyramid like a silver cutting from the rosy nail of a houri  the sphinxmighty guesser of riddles reader of rebuses and universal solver of missing wordslooked over the unfathomable desert and these few pages with the worried hopeless expression of one who is obliged at last to give it up  and then the wailing voice of a woman toiling up the steep steps of the pyramid was heard above the creaking of the ibis arry axes  where are you  wait for me  jy suis said a voice from the very summit of the stupendous granite bulk yet i cannot reach it  and in that faint light the figure of a man was seen lifting his arms wildly toward the moon  arry axes persisted the voice drifting higher wait for me we are pursued  and indeed it was true  a band of nubians headed by the doctor was already swarming like ants up the pyramid and the unhappy pair were secured  and when the sun rose it was upon the white sails of the dahabiyeh the vacant pyramid and the slumbering sphinx   there was great excitement at the cairo hotel the next morning the princess and the chevalier had disappeared and with them alaster mcfeckless lady fitzfulke the doctor and even his dahabiyeh  a thousand rumors had been in circulation  sir midas pyle looked up from the times with his usual itoldyouso expression  it is the most extraordinary thing dontcherknow said fitzfulke it seems that dr haustus pilgrim was here professionallyas a nerve specialistin the treatment of hallucinations produced by neurotic conditions you know  a mad doctor here gasped sir midas  yes  the princess the chevalier mcfeckless and even my mother were all patients of his on the dahabiyeh  he believed dontcherknow in humoring them and letting them follow out their cranks under his management  the princess was a musichall artist who imagined she was a dead and gone egyptian princess and the queerest of all arry axes was also a musichall singer who imagined himself chevalieryou know the great koster artistand thats how we took him for a frenchman mcfeckless and my poor old mother were the only ones with any real rank and positionbut you know what a beastly bounder mac was and the poor mater did overdo the youthful  we never called the doctor in until the day she wanted to go to a swell ball in london as little red ridinghood but the doctor writes me that the experiment was a success and theyll be all right when they get back to london  then it seems sir that you and i were the only sane ones here said sir midas furiously  really its as much as i can do to be certain about myself old chappie said fitzfulke turning away
