41440676	saved by the lifeboat by rm ballantyne   this book is mainly to describe the lifeboat service and how private individuals can donate the money for building a new lifeboat  we start off with a wreck just occurring near a little seaside village and how the local men rushed down to the beach to do what they could to save life  we then move to the offices of a mean grasping shipowner who will do anything to avoid properly equipping his ships with what they would need if disaster struck  eventually he is brought to a more sensible state of mind and donates money for a new lifeboat  there is a good fundraising chapter and it is interesting how very much the same todays appeals for the lifeboat service are though of course todays lifeboat is a very different item to the lifeboats of over a hundred years ago   saved by the lifeboat by rm ballantyne    chapter one  the wreck in the bay  on a dark november afternoon not many years ago captain boyns sat smoking his pipe in his own chimneycorner gazing with a somewhat anxious expression at the fire  there was cause for anxiety for there raged at the time one of the fiercest storms that ever blew on the shores of england  the wind was howling in the chimney with wild fury slates and tiles were being swept off the roofs of the fishermens huts and whirled up into the air as if they had been chips of wood and rain swept down and along the ground in great sheets of water or whirled madly in the air and mingled with the salt spray that came direct from the english channel while high and loud above all other sounds rose the loud plunging roar of the mighty sea  i fear there will be a call before long nancy for the services of the new lifeboat said captain boyns rising and taking down an oilcloth coat and souwester which he began to put on leisurely ill go down to the beach and see whats doin at the cove  the captain was a fine specimen of a british sailor  he was a massive man of iron build and so tall that his souwester almost touched the ceiling of his lowroofed parlour  his face was eminently masculine and his usual expression was a compound of sternness gravity and goodhumour  he was about forty years of age and unlike the men of his class at that time wore a short curly black beard and moustache which with his deeply bronzed countenance gave him the aspect of a foreigner  god help those on the sea said mrs boyns in reply to her husbands remark im thankful dan that you are on shore this night  nancy was a goodlooking ladylike woman of thirtythree or thereabouts without anything particularly noteworthy about her  she was busy with her needle at the time we introduce her and relapsed into silence while her stalwart husband pulled on a pair of huge seaboots  did you hear a gun nancy cried the captain as a terrific blast shook every timber in the cottagethere aint that it again  nancy listened intently but could hear nothing save the raging of the storm  the captain completed his toilet and was about to leave the room when the door suddenly burst open and a lad of about fourteen years of age sprang in  father he cried his eyes flashing with excitement theres a brig on the sands and they are going to launch the new lifeboat  whereaway ist lad asked boyns as he buttoned up his coat  to leeard of the breakwater  oh harry dont be too venturesome cried mrs boyns earnestly as her strapping boy was about to follow his father out into the pelting storm  harry who was tall and strong for his age and very like his father in many respects turning round with a hearty smile cried no fear mother and next instant was gone  the scene on the beach when father and son reached it was very impressive  so furious was the gale that it tore up sand and gravel and hurled it against the faces of the hardy men who dared to brave the storm  at times there were blasts so terrible that a wild shriek as if of a stormfiend rent the air and flakes of foam were whirled madly about  but the most awful sight of all was the seething of the sea as it advanced in a succession of great breaking rollers into the bay and churned itself white among the rocks  out among these billows scarce visible in the midst of the conflicting elements were seen the dark hull shattered masts and riven sails of a large brig over which the waves made clear breaches continually  in the little harbour of the seaport which was named covelly a number of strong men were engaged in hastily launching a new lifeboat which had been placed at that station only three weeks before while clustering about the pier and behind every sheltered nook along the shore were hundreds of excited spectators not a few of whom were women  much earnest talk had there been among the gossips in the town when the lifeboat referred to arrived  deep and nautically learned were the discussions that had been held as to her capabilities and great the longing for a stiffish gale in order that her powers might be fairly tested in rough weather for in those days lifeboats were not so numerous as happily they now are  many of the townspeople had only heard of such boats few had seen and not one had ever had experience of them  after her arrival the weather had continued tantalisingly calm and fine until the day of the storm above referred to when at length it changed and a gale burst forth with such violence that the bravest men in the place shook their heads and said that no boat of any kind whatever could live in such a sea  when however the brig before referred to was seen to rush helplessly into the bay and to strike on the sands where the seas ran most furiously all lent a willing hand to launch the new lifeboat into the harbour and a few men leaping in pulled her across to the stairs near the entrance where a number of seamen were congregated holding on under the lee of the parapetwall and gazing anxiously at the fearful scene outside  impossible said one no boat could live in such a sea for half a minute  the moment she shows her nose outside the breakwater shell capsize observed another  well have to risk it anyhow remarked a stout young fellow for i see men in the foreshrouds of the wreck and i for one wont stand by and see them lost while weve got a lifeboat by us  why wots the use o callin it a lifeboat if it cant do more than other boats  as he spoke there came an unusually furious gust which sent a wave right over the pier and wellnigh swept away one or two of them  the argument of the storm was more powerful than that of the young sailor no one responded to his appeal and when the boat came alongside the stairs none moved to enter her except himself  thats right bob gaston cried one of the four men who had jumped into the boat when she was launched i knowd you would be the first  and i wont be the last either said young gaston looking back at the men on the pier with a smile  right lad cried captain boyns who came up at the instant and leaped into the boat  come lads we want four more handsno no harry he added pushing back his son your arms are not yet strong enough come lads weve no time to lose  as he spoke a faint cry was heard coming from the wreck and it was seen that one of the masts had gone by the board carrying it was feared several poor fellows along with it  instantly there was a rush to the lifeboat  all thought of personal danger appeared to have been banished from the minds of the fishermen when the cry of distress broke on their ears  the boat was overmanned and old jacobs the coxswain had to order several of them to go ashore again  in another minute they were at the mouth of the harbour and the men paused an instant as if to gather strength for the mortal struggle before quitting the shelter of the breakwater and facing the fury of wind and waves  give way lads give way shouted old jacobs as he stood up in the sternsheets and grasped the steering oar  the men bent to the oars with all their might and the boat leaped out into the boiling sea  this was not one of those splendid boats which now line the shores of the united kingdom nevertheless it was a noble craftone of the good stable insubmergible and selfemptying kind which were known as the greathead lifeboats and which for many years did good service on our coasts  it sat on the raging waters like a swan and although the seas broke over it again and again it rose out of the water buoyantly and with the brine pouring from its sides kept endon to the seas surmounting them or dashing right through them while her gallant crew strained every muscle and slowly urged her on towards the wreck  at first the men on shore gazed at her in breathless anxiety expecting every moment to see her overturned and their comrades left to perish in the waves but when they saw her reappear from each overwhelming billow their hearts rose with a rebound and loud prolonged huzzas cheered the lifeboat on her course  they became silent again however when distance and the intervening haze of spray and rain rendered her motions indistinct and their feelings of anxiety became more and more intense as they saw her draw nearer and nearer to the wreck  at last they reached it but no one on the pier could tell with what success their efforts were attended  through the blinding spray they saw her faintly now rising on the crest of a huge wave then overwhelmed by tons of water  at last she appeared to get close under the stern of the brig and was lost to view  theyre all gone said a fisherman on the pier as he wiped the salt water off his face i knowd that no boat that ever wos built could live in that sea  ye dont know much yet bill bout anything amost replied an old man near him  why ive seed boats in the east not much better than two planks as could go through a worse surf than that  may be so retorted bill but i knowhallo is that her coming off  thats her cried several voicesall right my hearties  not so sure o that observed another of the excited band of men who watched every motion of the little craft intentlytherewhyi do believe there are more in her now than went out in her what think ee dick  dick did not reply for by that time the boat having got clear of the wreck was making for the shore and the observers were all too intent in using their eyes to make use of their tongues  coming as she did before the wind the progress of the lifeboat was very different from what it had been when she set out  in a few minutes she became distinctly visible careering on the crest of the waves towards the harbour mouth and then it was ascertained beyond doubt that some at least if not all of the crew of the brig had been rescued  a short sharp hurrah burst from the men on the outlook when this became certain but they relapsed into deep silence again for the return of the boat was more critical than its departure had been  there is much more danger in running before a heavy sea than in pulling against it every roaring billow that came into the bay near the cove like a green wall broke in thunder on the sands before reaching the wreck and as it continued its furious career towards the beach it seemed to gather fresh strength so that the steersman of the lifeboat had to keep her stern carefully towards it to prevent her from turning broadside onor as it is nautically expressed broaching to  had she done so the death of all on board would have been almost inevitable  knowing this the men on the pier gazed with breathless anxiety as each wave roared under the boats stern lifted it up until it appeared perpendicular carried it forward a few yards with fearful velocity and then let it slip back into the trough of the sea  but the boat was admirably managed and it was seen as she drew near that the steering oar was held in the firm grip of captain boyns  on it came before the gale with lightning speed towards the harbour mouth and here a new danger had to be faced for the entrance was narrow and the seas were sweeping not into but athwart it thereby rendering the danger of being dashed against the pierend very great indeed  missed it burst from several mouths as the boat flew round the head of the breakwater and was overwhelmed by a heavy sea which rendered her for one moment unmanageable but almost as soon as filled she was again emptied through the discharging tubes in her floor  no fear of father missing it exclaimed young harry boyns with a proud look and flashing eye as he saw the stalwart form of the captain standing firm in the midst of the foam with his breast pressed hard against the steering oar  back your starboard oars  hold water hard shouted several voices  shes round hurrah cried harry as the boat almost leaped out of the foam and sprang into the comparatively smooth water at the harbour mouth  the rowers gave vent to a short shout of triumph and several worn exhausted seamen in the bottom of the boat were seen to wave their hands feebly  at the same time captain boyns shouted in a deep loud voiceall saved thank god as they swept towards the land  then did there arise from the hundreds of people assembled on and near the pier a ringing cheer the like of which had never been heard before in covelly  again and again it was repeated while the lifeboat shot up on the beach and was fairly dragged out of the sea high and dry by many eager hands that were immediately afterwards extended to assist the saved crew of the brig to land  are all saved father asked harry boyns who was first at the side of the boat  ay lad every one  fifteen all told includin a woman and a little girl  lend a hand to get the poor things up to our house harry said the captain lifting the apparently inanimate form of a young girl over the side as he spoke she aint deadonly benumbed a little with the cold  many hands were stretched out but harry thrust all others aside and receiving the light form of the child in his strong arms bore her off to his fathers cottage leaving his comrades to attend to the wants of the others  oh harry exclaimed mrs boyns when her son burst into the house is your father safe  ay safe and well he cried  look sharp motherget hot blankets and things ready for heres a little girl almost dead with cold  she has just been rescued from a wrecksaved by the new lifeboat    chapter two  describes a merchant and his god and concludes with a message from the sea  a closefisted hardhearted narrowminded poorspirited man was john webster esquire merchant and shipowner of ingot lane liverpool  and yet he was not altogether without good points  indeed it might be said of him that if he had been reared under more favourable circumstances he might have been an ornament to society and a blessing to his country for he was intelligent and sociable and susceptible to some extent of tender influences when the indulging of amiable feelings did not interfere with his private interests  in youth he had even gone the length of holding some good principles and was known to have done one or two noble thingsbut all this had passed away for as he grew older the hopeful springs were dried up one by one by an allabsorbing passionthe love of moneywhich ultimately made him what he was a disgrace to the class to which he belonged and literally though not it would seem in the eye of law a wholesale murderer  at first he began by holding and frequently stating the opinion that the possession of much money was a most desirable thing which undoubtedly wasand is and will be as long as the world lasts perfectly true if the possession be accompanied with gods blessing but mr webster did not even pretend to look at the thing in that light he scorned to make use of the worldly mans oh of course of course when that idea was sometimes suggested to him by christian friends  on the contrary he boldly and coldly asserted his belief that god if there was a god at all did not interfere in such matters and that for his part he would be quite satisfied to let anybody else who wanted it have the blessing if he only got the money  and so it pleased god to give john webster much money without a blessing  the immediate result was that he fell in love with it and following the natural laws attached to that vehement passion he hugged it to his bosom became blind to everything else and gave himself entirely up to it with a selfdenying devotion that robbed him of much of his natural rest of nearly all his graces and most of his happinessleaving him with no hope in this world save that of increasing his stores of money and with no hope for the world to come at all  the abode of mr websters soul was a dingy little office with dirty little windows a miserable little fireplace and filthy little chairs and tablesall which were quite in keeping with the little occupant of the place  the abode of his body was a palatial residence in the suburbs of the city  although mr websters soul was little his body was largemuch too large indeed for the jewel which it enshrined and which was so terribly knocked about inside its large casket that its usual position was awry and it never managed to become upright by any chance whatever  to the former abode mr webster went body and soul one dark november morning  having seated himself before his desk he threw himself back in his chair and began to open his lettersgazing with a placid smile as he did so at the portrait of his deceased wifes fathera very wealthy old gentlemanwhich hung over the fireplace  we omitted to mention by the way that mr webster had once been married  this trifling little event of his life occurred when he was about fortyeight years of age and was a mercantile transaction of an extremely successful kind inasmuch as it had brought him after deducting lawyers fees stamps duties lost time in courtship weddingtour expenses doctors fees deathbed expenses etcetera a clear profit of sixty thousand pounds  to be sure there were also the additional expenses of four years of married life and the permanent board lodging and education of a little daughter but all things considered these were scarcely worth speaking of and in regard to the daughterannie by nameshe would in time become a marketable commodity which might if judiciously disposed of turn in a considerable profit besides being before she was sold a useful machine for sewing on buttons making tea reading the papers aloud fetching hats and sticks and slippers etcetera  there had however been a slight drawbacka sort of temporary losson this concern at first for the piece of goods became damaged owing to her mothers death having weighed heavily on a sensitive and loving spirit which found no comfort or sympathy at home save in the devoted affection of an old nurse named niven  when annie reached the age of six years the doctors ordered change of air and recommended a voyage to the west indies  their advice was followed  nothing was easier  mr webster had many ships on the sea  these were of two classes  the first class consisted of good new well found and manned ships with valuable cargoes on board which were anxiously watched and longed for the second class comprised those which were old wornout and unseaworthy and which being insured beyond their value might go to the bottom when they pleased  one of the best of the first class was selectedthe water lily a1 on lloydsand in it annie with her nurse was sent to sea for the benefit of her health  the parting was a somewhat important event in mr websters life for it convinced him to his own surprise that his power to love a human being was not yet utterly gone  annies arms clasped convulsively round his neck at the moment of partingher sobbing goodbye darling papa had stirred depths which had lain unmoved almost from the days of early manhood  but the memory of this passed away as soon as he turned again to gaze upon the loved countenance of his yellow mistress  the voyage did annie much good  the short residence in demerara while the vessel was discharging cargo and reloading wrought wonders and a letter forwarded by a ship that sailed a short time after their arrival in foreign parts told mr webster that he might expect to see his daughter home again sound and well in a month or two at the farthest  but to return from this digression to the abode of mr websters soul  having looked at the portrait of his late wifes father for a moment and smiled he glanced at the letter in his hand and frowned  not because he was displeased but because the writing was cramped and difficult to read  however the merchant was accustomed to receive such letters from seafaring men on many subjects of interest he therefore broke the seal and set himself patiently to decipher it  immediately his countenance became ghastly pale then it flushed up and became pale again while he coughed and gasped once or twice and started up and sat down abruptly in fact mr webster exhibited all the signs of having received a severe shock and an eyewitness might have safely concluded that he had just read the news of some great mercantile loss  so it was in one sense but that was not the ordinary sense  the letter in question was in the handwriting of a fussy officious bumble friend of the wealthy man who dwelt in the town of covelly it ran as follows    my dear siri write in great haste and in much perturbation   having just heard from my servant of the wreck of your ship the   water lily in covelly bay  she does not seem to be quite sure   however of the name and says that the only man who has been rescued   is scarcely able to speak so that i do sincerely hope my domestic   who is a stupid old woman may turn out to be mistaken  i am on the   point of hasting down to the shore to ascertain the truth for myself   but am obliged to write to you this brief and unsatisfactory account   of what i have heard in order to save the post which is just being   closed  you shall hear from me again of course by the next maili   remain my dear sir in much anxiety your most obedient humble   servant    joseph dowler  it chanced that at the moment the above letter was handed to the postmaster and while the wax was being melted before the final sealing of the postbag a sailor lad drenched to the skin and panting vehemently dashed into the office  stop stop he cried a letterabout the wreckthe water lilyto the ownersnot too late i hope  no no just in time  here in with it  there all right  now jim off with ee  the postman jumped on his vehicle the whip cracked and in another minute the royal mail was gone  thus it came to pass that two epistles reached mr webster that morning from covelly  but in the extreme agitation of his spirit he did not observe the other letter which lay among the usual morning mass that still awaited examination  after reading the letter twice and turning it over with trembling hands as if he wished there were more in it he pronounced a deep malediction on his humble friend and rang the bell for his confidential clerk who was an unusually meek mild and middleaged little man with a bald head a deprecatory expression of countenance and a pen behind his ear  mr grinder said mr webster putting strong constraint on himself and pretending to be quite composed a letter from covelly informs me that it is feared the water lily has been wrecked in  the water lily sir exclaimed grinder starting as if he had received an electric shock  i spoke audibly did i not said mr webster turning with a sharp look on his confidential clerk  yees sir but imiss an the poor man could get no further being of a timid nervous temperament and mr webster paying no attention to his remark was going on to say that he intended to go by the mail to covelly without delay to ascertain the truth for himself when he was interrupted by the confidential clerk who exclaimed in a burst of agitation  there were two letters sir from covelly this morningdid you read  he stopped for already his employer had sought for found and torn open the second epistle which was written in a fair legible hand  it ran thus    sirmy father captain boyns directs me to inform you that your   daughter miss annie has been saved from the wreck of your brig the   water lily which ran aground here this afternoon and has become a   total wreck  your daughters nurse and the crew have also been   rescued by our new lifeboat which is a noble craft and with gods   blessing will yet do good service on this coast  i have pleasure in   adding from myself that it was my father who rescued your child   she fell into the sea when being passed from the wreck into the boat   and sank but my father dived and brought her up in safety    much of the brigs cargo has been lost i regret to say but a good   deal of it has been washed ashore and saved in a damaged state  the   captain says that defective compasses were the cause of the disaster   there is not time to give you a more particular account as it is   close upon posttime  miss annie sends you her kindest love and bids   me say she is none the worse of what she has passed throughi am   sir your obedient servant    harry boyns  thank god exclaimed mr webster fervently  why what are you staring at mr grinder he added on observing that his confidential servant was gazing at him with an expression of considerable surprise  excuse me sir stammered the unfortunate man iiin factyou have so often told me that you did not believe in god that i fancied iwondered  really mr grinder i must beg of you to confine your remarks in future entirely to matters of business  the socalled religious observations which you sometimes venture to make in my presence are extremely distasteful i assure you  in explanation of what i said however i may tell you that this letter informs me of my daughters safety and i merely used the expression of satisfaction that is usual on such occasions  the phrase as it is generally understood except by weak men commits me to nothing more  but enough of this  i find that the water lily has indeed been lost  it was fully insured i believe  yes sir it was  very well report the matter without delay  i will go to covelly tonight and shall probably be back tomorrow  saying this mr webster left the office and on the evening of that day found himself seated in captain boynss parlour with little annie on his knee  her pretty head was on his shoulder her fair curls straggled over his chest and her round little arms tightly encircled his large body as far as they could reach while she sobbed on his bosom and kissed him by turns  this was quite a new experience in the life of the goldlover  he had declined to submit to familiar caresses in former years but on such an occasion as the present he felt that common propriety demanded the sacrifice of himself to some extent  he therefore allowed annie to kiss him and found the operationperformed as she did itmuch more bearable than he had anticipated and when annie exclaimed with a burst of enthusiasm oh dear dear papa i did feel such a dreadful longing for you when the waves were roaring round us and gave him another squeeze he felt that the market price of the bundle of goods on his knee was rising rapidly  did you think you were going to be drowned dear said mr webster with the air of a man who does not know very well what to say  im not sure what i thought replied annie smiling through her tears oh i was so frightened  you cant think papa how very dreadful it is to see the water boiling all round and sometimes over you and such awful thumping of the ship and then the masts breaking but what i feared most was to see the faces of the sailors they were so white and they looked as if they were afraid  are men ever afraid papa  sometimes annie but a white face is not always the sign of fearthat may be caused by anxiety  did any of them refuse to obey orders  no they were very obedient  did any of them get into the lifeboat before you and nurse  oh no they all refused to move till we were put into it and some of them ran to help us and were very very kind  then you may be quite sure they were not afraid however pale their faces were but what of yourself anniewere you afraid  oh dreadfully and so was poor nurse but once or twice i thought of the text thatthatyou know who was so fond ofcall upon me in the time of trouble and i will deliver thee so i prayed and felt a little better  then the lifeboat came and oh how my heart did jump for it seemed just like an answer to my prayer  i never felt any more fear after that except when i fell into the sea but even then i was not so frightened as i had been for i felt somehow that i was sure to be saved and i was right you see for dear captain boyns dived for me  i love captain boyns cried annie and here again she kissed her father and held him so tight that he felt quite angry with mrs niven who entered at the moment and said apologetically  oh la sir i didnt know as miss annie was with you  i only came to say that everythink is ready sir for going ome  we dont intend to go home said mr webster at least not for a day or two  i find that captain boyns can let us stay here while i look after the wreck so you can go and arrange with mrs boyns  during the few days that mr webster remained at coral cottage captain boynss residence mrs niven found in the quiet sympathetic mrs boyns if not a congenial friend at least a kind and sociable hostess and annie found in harry boyns a delightful companion who never wearied of taking her to the cliffs the shore and all the romantic places of the neighbourhood while mr webster found the captain to be most serviceable in connection with the wreck  one result of all this was that mr webster offered captain boyns the command of one of his largest vessels an offer which was gladly accepted for the captain had at that time been thrown out of employment by the failure of a firm in the service of which he had spent the greater part of his nautical career  another result was that mr webster at annies earnest solicitation agreed to make covelly his summer quarters next year instead of ramsgate and mrs boyns agreed to lodge the family in coral cottage  this having been all settled mr webster asked captain boyns on the morning of his departure for liverpool if he could do anything more for him for he felt that to him his daughter owed her life and he was anxious to serve him  if you could give my son harry something to do sir said boyns you would oblige me very much  harry is a smart fellow and a good seaman he has been a short time in the coasting trade perhaps  well yes ill see to that interrupted mr webster  you shall hear from me again as to it  now the fact is that mr webster did not feel attracted by young boyns and he would willingly have had nothing to do with him but being unable to refuse the request after having invited it he ultimately gave him a situation in one of his coasting vessels which plied between london and aberdeen  about a year after that captain boyns sailed in the warrior a large new ship for the sandwich islands and the chinese seas  true to his promise mr webster spent the following summer with annie and mrs boyns at covelly and young boyns so managed matters that he got his captain to send him down to covelly to talk with his employer on business  of course being there it was natural that he should ask and obtain leave to spend a few days with his mother and of course it was quite as natural that without either asking or obtaining leave he should spend the whole of these days in roaming about the shore and among the cliffs with annie webster  it would be absurd to say that these two fell in love seeing that one was only seven and the other fifteen but there can be no doubt they entertained some sort of regard for each other of a very powerful nature  the young sailor was wildly enthusiastic well educated manly and goodlookinglittle wonder that annie liked him  the child was winning in her ways simple yet laughterloving and very earnestless wonderful that harry liked her  another year fled and again the websters visited covelly and again harry spent a few days with his mother and although mr webster did not get the length of liking the youth he at last came to the condition of not disliking him  year followed year and still each summer annie pressed her father to return to the old place and he agreed chiefly because it mattered little to him where he went  he regarded the summer trip in the light of a penance to be paid for the sin of being a member of society and the head of a household and placed every minute so wasted to the debit of the profit and loss account in the mental ledger of his lifes affairs for it must not be supposed that mr websters character was changed by the events which followed the rescue of his child from the sea  true he had been surprised out of his habitual hardness for a short time but he soon relapsed if not quite back to the old position at least so near to it that the difference was not appreciable  as time ran on men begun to look for the return of the warrior but that vessel did not make her appearance  then they began to shake their heads and to grow prophetic while those who were most deeply interested in the human beings who manned her became uneasy  dont fret over it said harry one day to his mother in a kind earnest tone you may depend upon it father will turn up yet and surprise us  he never lost a ship in his life and he has sailed in worse ones than the warrior by a long way  it may be so replied mrs boyns sadly but it is a long long time since he went away  gods will be done  whether he gives or takes away i shall try to bless his name  at last harry gave over attempting to comfort his mother for he began to fear that his fathers ship was destined to be placed on the dark dreary list of those of which it is sometimes said with terrible brevity in the newspapers she sailed from port on such and such a day and has not since been heard of  in course of time harry made one or two trips to the east indies as first mate of one of mr websters vessels and ultimately obtained the command of one  at last a day came when there appeared in a welsh newspaper a paragraph which ran thusa message from the seaa bottle corked and sealed was found by a woman on the beach above conway north wales  inside was a letter containing the following    latitude 44 longitude 15 off tierra del fuego  if this should   ever reach the shores of england it will announce to friends at home   the sad fate of the ship warrior which sailed from liverpool on   13th february 18 hundred and something bound for china  we have been   boarded by pirates we have been all locked into the cabin with the   assurance that we shall be made to walk the plank in half an hour   our last act is to put this in a bottle and drop it overboard   farewell for this world my beloved wife and son    daniel boyns captain  this letter was forwarded to the owner and by him was sent to poor mrs boyns  alas how many sailors wives in our seagirt isle have received similar messages from the sea and lived under the dark cloud of neverending suspensehoping against hope that the dear lost ones might yet return    chapter three  shows what some men will do and dare for money and what sometimes comes of it  we must now beg the readers permission to allow a few more years to elapse  eight have come and gone since the dark day when poor mrs boyns received that message from the sea which cast a permanent cloud over her life  annie webster has become a beautiful woman and harry boyns a bronzed stalwart man  but things have changed with time  these two seldom meet now in consequence of the frequent absence of the latter on long voyages and when they do meet there is not the free frank intercourse that there used to be  in fact mr webster had long ago begun to suspect that his daughters regard for the handsome young sailor was of a nature that bade fair to interfere with his purposed mercantile transactions in reference to her so he wisely sent him off on voyages of considerable length hoping that he might chance to meet with the same fate as his father and wound up by placing him in command of one of his largest and most unseaworthy east indiamen in the full expectation that both captain and vessel would go to the bottom together and thus enable him at one stroke to make a good round sum out of the insurance offices and get rid of a troublesome servant  gloating over these and kindred subjects mr webster sat one morning in his office mending a pen and smiling in a sardonic fashion to the portrait of his deceased wifes father when a tap came to the door and harry boyns entered  i have come sir he said to tell you that the repairs done to the swordfish are not by any means sufficient  there are at least  please do not waste time captain boyns by entering upon details said mr webster interrupting him with a bland smile i am really quite ignorant of the technicalities of shipbuilding  if you will state the matter to mr cooper whom i employ expressly for  but sir interrupted harry with some warmth i have spoken to mr cooper and he says the repairs are quite sufficient  well then i suppose they are so  i assure you sir rejoined harry they are not and as the lives of passengers as well as men depend upon the vessel being in a seaworthy condition i do trust that you will have her examined by some one more competent to judge than mr cooper  i have no doubt of mr coopers competence returned mr webster but i will order a further examination as you seem so anxious about it meanwhile i hope that the ship is being got ready for sea as quickly as possible  there shall be no delay on my part sir said harry rising the ship has been removed from the birkenhead docks in which you are aware she has lain for the last eight months and is now lying in the brunswick dock taking in cargo  but i think it a very serious matter which demands looking into the fact that she had no sooner grounded in the dock than she sprang a leak which instantly let twentyeight inches of water into her and twice subsequently as much as forty inches have been sounded  yet no repairs worthy of the name have been made  all that has been done is the pumping of her out daily by the stevedores men when their stowing work is finished  has the agent for the underwriters visited her inquired mr webster  he has sir but he seems to be of opinion that his responsibility is at an end because a surveyor from the mersey docks and harbour board had previously visited her and directed that she should not be loaded deeper than twentyone feetchalking on the side amidships the six feet six inches clear beneath which she is not to be allowed to sink  well well said mr webster somewhat impatiently i will have the matter looked into  good morning captain boyns  the captain bowed and left the office and mr webster leant back in his chair clasped his hands twirled his thumbs and smiled grimly at the old gentleman over the fireplace  true to his word however he had an inspection made of the swordfish the inspector was of a kindred spirit with mr webster so that his report was naturally similar to that of mr cooper  nothing therefore was done to the vesselnothing being neededand the loading went on in spite of the remonstrances of captain harry boyns who with all the energy and persistency of his character continued to annoy worry and torment every one who possessed the faintest right or power to interfere in the matterbut all to no purpose for there are times when neither facts nor fancies fair words nor foul fire fury folly nor philosophy will avail to move some powers that be  in a towering fit of indignation harry boyns resolved to throw up his situation but it occurred to him that this would perhaps be deemed cowardice so he thought better of it  then he madly thought of going direct to the president of the board of trade and making a solemn protest backed by a heartstirring appeal but gave up that idea on recalling to memory a certain occasion on which a deputation of grave learned whitehaired gentlemen had gone to london expressly to visit that august functionary of the state and beseech him with all the earnestness that the occasion demanded that he would introduce into parliament a bill for the better regulation and supervision of ships and for preventing the possibility of seamen and passengers being seduced on board unseaworthy vessels carried off to sea and there murderously drowned in cold blood as well as in cold water which deputation received for answer that it was not the intention of government as at present advised to introduce a measure for providing more stringent enactments as to the equipments cargoes and crews of passenger vesselsa reply which was tantamount to saying that if the existing arrangements were inadequate to the ends desired government saw no way out of the difficulty and people must just be left unprotected and go to sea to be drowned or spared according as chance or the cupidity of shipowners might direct  this was pretty resolute on the part of government considering that above a thousand lives were then and above two thousand still are lost annually on the shores of the united kingdom a very large number of whichif we may believe the argument of facts and the pretty unanimous voice of the pressare sacrificed because government refuses to interfere effectively with the murderous tendencies of a certain class of the community  when harry boyns thought of all this he sighed deeply and made up his mind to remain by the swordfish and sink or swim with her  had he been more of a man of business perhaps he might have been more successful in finding out how to have prevented the evil he foresaw but it was the interest of the owner to keep him in the dark as much as possible for which end mr webster kept him out of the ships way as much as he could and when that was impossible he kept him so busily employed that he remained ignorant of a great deal that was said and done in regard to his vessel  at length the swordfish left the brunswick dock six inches deeper than the surveyor had directed and was towed to the wellington dock where she took in 120 tons of coke and sank still deeper  harry also discovered that the equipment of the ship was miserably insufficient for the long voyage she was intended to make  this was too much for him to bear  he went at once to mr websters office and said that if a deaf ear was to be turned any longer to his remonstrances he would throw up his appointment  poor harry could scarcely have taken a more effective step to insure the turning of the deaf ear to him  oh replied mr webster coolly if you refuse to take charge of my vessel captain boyns i will soon find another to do it  i certainly do refuse said harry preparing to leave the office and i think you will find some difficulty in getting any other man to go to sea in such a ship  i differ from you captain boyns  good afternoon  and if you do and lives should be lost in consequence added harry grasping the handle of the door i warn you solemnly that murder will have been committed by you whatever the law may say on the subject  good afternoon captain boyns  youve got a hard master said harry to grinder as he passed through the outer office  the confidential clerk shook his head in a deprecatory way and smiled  next moment harry boyns found himself in the streetwith nothing to do and the wide world before him  meanwhile the loading of the swordfish went onalso the pumping of her  that same day she was visited by a surveyor from the underwriters association who found her only five feet clear above water and still taking in cargo  that gentleman called in another surveyor to a consultation who agreed with him in pronouncing her overladen  she was represented as such to the local underwriters association for which the surveyor acted but as the swordfish was insured in london and not with them the liverpool underwriters did not consider themselves called upon to interfere  their surveyor however visited the vessel again a few days later when he found her only four feet clear and declared that so far from going to bombay he should not like to attempt to cross to dublin in her in anything like rough weather  now it must be observed that all these consultations and investigations took place in a quiet way  to the public eye all was fair and above board  few among the thousands who visited the docks knew much about deep loading still less about adequate equipping  they saw nought but a noble ship well painted washed gilded and varnished taking merchandise into her insatiable hold while the yoheaveho of the seamen rang out cheerily to the rattling accompaniment of chains and windlass  many other ships were there similarly treated equally beautiful and quite as worthy of the titles good and noble as the whited sepulchre is to be styled pure  a few days before the swordfish was ready for sea a new captain was sent down to her  this captain was not a bad man in the worst sense of that termneither was he a good one  vigour courage resolution when acting in accordance with his inclinationsthese were among his characteristics  but he was a reckless man in want of money out of employment and without an appreciable conscience  in the circumstances he was glad to get anything to do and had been so long ashore and in trouble that he would probably have agreed to take command of and go to sea in a washingtub if part paid beforehand for doing so  nevertheless even this man captain phelps by name felt some degree of nervous anxiety on getting on board and examining the state of the ship on further acquaintance with her he was so dissatisfied that he also resolved to throw up his appointment  but he had obtained the berth through the influence of a friend who happened to be acquainted with mr webster  this friend wrote him a stern letter saying if he ventured to do as he proposed he should never have a ship out of liverpool again as long as he the friend could prevent it  captain phelps was one of those angry men of iron mould who appear to take pleasure in daring fate to do her worst  on receipt of the letter he swore with an awful oath that he would now go to sea in the swordfish even if he knew she would go to the bottom in twentyfour hours after weighing anchor  accordingly having intrenched himself behind a wall of moral adamant he went about with quiet indifference and let things take their course  he made no objection whatever when in addition to the loading already in the ship the agents added a deck cargo of some massive pieces of machinery weighing thirty tons and a supply of coals the proper receptacle for which below had been filled with iron goods  neither did he utter a word whenafter the vessel had been taken out into the stream by the riggershe and the owner agents pilot and crew only six of which last were abs were taken off to her in a tug and put on board with orders to sail immediately  only a few passengers were going  these were already on board but some of their friends went off in the tug to bid them a last farewell  this was a sad scene but the captain regarded it with stoical indifference  there was a stout hale old indian officer going out on a pleasure trip to his beloved east and a daughter of the same whom he hoped to get married offhand comfortably there  there was a sick nephew of the old officer going the voyage for the benefit of his health on whose wan countenance consumption if not death had evidently set a deep mark  there were also a nurse and a ladysmaid and two girls of ten or thirteen years of agesisterswho were going to join their father and mother besides one or two others  earnest loving words passed kindly between these and their relatives and friends as the moment of parting drew near  dont forget to remember me to coleman and the rest of ours cried a stout elderly man waving his hand as the tug moved off  that i wont and i shall expect to shake you by the hand again old fellow in a year or two  youll never see him again thought captain phelps as he stood with compressed lip and frowning eye on the quarterdeck  goodbye darling nelly cried a lady to one of the sobbing girls from whom she was parting remember the message to mamma  oh yes exclaimed the child trying to look bright and we wont be very long of coming back again  youll never come back again thought the captain and he sighed very slightly as the thought passed through his brain  look alive there lads exclaimed the pilot as the tug sheared away  soon the anchor was at the bows the sails were shaken out and the swordfish began her voyage  theres not a piece of spare rope aboard sir said the first mate coming up to the captain with a blank look we cant even get enough to cat and fish the anchor  you can unreeve the topsl halyards replied the captain quietly  this was done and the anchor was secured therewith  how much water in the hold asked the captain  three feet sir the carpenter has just sounded  it seems that the riggers were at work on the pumps when we came out in the tug but were stopped by the agents before we got alongside  i fear she is very leaky sir said the mate  i know she is replied the captain keep the men at the pumps  that night the weather became what sailors call dirty and next morning it was found that the water had mounted to 4 feet 10 inches the pumps had become almost unworkable being choked with sand and it became evident that the voyage thus inauspiciously begun would very soon be ended  during the day the dirty weather became gale so that although the wind was fair captain phelps determined to run to the nearest port for shelter  with a good ship this might have been done easily enoughmany a vessel does it during every gale that visits our stormy shoresbut the swordfish was by this time getting waterlogged and unmanageable  she drifted helplessly before the gale and the heavy seas broke over her continually sweeping away everything moveable another night passed and next morningsundayit became plain that she was settling down so the captain gave orders to get out the longboat and told the passengers to get ready  day had broken some time before this but the weather was still so thick that nothing could be seen  take a cast of the lead said the captain  ay ay sir was the prompt reply but before the order could be obeyed the roar of breakers was heard above the howling of the storm and the shout land on the port bow was instantly followed by down with the helm and other orders hurriedly given by the captain and hastily obeyed by the men  all too late  the ship was embayed  as if to make their position more painful the mists cleared partially away and revealed the green fields and cottages on shore with the angry seaan impassable caldron of boiling foambetween  another instant and the ship struck with a convulsive quiver from stem to stern  the billows flew madly over her the mainmast went by the boardcarrying two of the men to their doom along with itand the swordfish bound for bombay was cast a total wreck upon the coast of cornwall    chapter four  the rescue  fortunate is it for this land that those who war for evil and those who fight for good do so side by side and well is it for poor humanity that the bane and the antidote grow together  the misanthrope sends his poisonous streams throughout the land but the philanthropist erects his dams everywhere to stem the foul torrents and turn them aside  the infidel plants unbelief with reckless hand far and wide but the christian scatters the word broadcast over the land  the sordid shipowner strews the coast with wreck and murdered fellowcreatures but thank god the righteous shipowneralong with other likeminded mensends forth a fleet of lifeboats from almost every bay and cove along the shore to rob the deep of its prey and rescue the perishing  in the bay where the swordfish was stranded there chanced to be a lifeboat  most of her noble crew were at the time the vessel struck in chapel probably engaged in singing the hymns of the great john wesley or listening to the preaching of the old old story of the salvation of souls through faith in jesus christ  but there were bodies to be saved that day as well as souls and the stout arms of the lifeboat crew were needed  the cry was quickly raised a wreck in the bay  the shout that naturally followed was the lifeboat  a stalwart cornish gentleman sprang from his pew to serve his master in another field  he was the honorary local secretary of the lifeboat institutiona man brimful of physical energy and with courage and heart for every good work  no time was lost  six powerful horses were procured so quickly that it seemed as if they had started ready harnessed into being  willing hands dragged the lifeboat mounted on its carriage from its shed the horses were attached and a loud cheer arose as the huge craft was whirled along the road towards the bay  the scene of the wreck was a mile distant and a large town had to be traversed on the way thither hundreds of worshippers were on the streets returning home with chastened thoughts and feelings perchance from church and chapel there was excitement however in their looks for the echo of that cry the lifeboat had reached the ears of many and eager inquiries were being made  presently the lifeboat itself with all its peculiar gear came thundering through the town rudely dispelling for a few moments the solemnity of the sabbath day  hundreds of men women and children followed in its train and hundreds more joined at every turn of the main thoroughfare  a wreck in the bay  crew in the rigging  mainmast gone  she cant hold long together in such a sea  well be in time yet hurrah  such were some of the exclamations heard on all sides as the rescuers dashed along and the excited multitude irresistibly followed  even females ventured to join the throng and holding shawls tightly round their heads and shoulders went down on the exposed sands and faced the pelting storm  in less than half an hour after the alarm was given the lifeboat swept down to the beach the horses obedient to the rein flew round the boats bow was presented to the sea and the carriage thrust as far into the surf as was possible  then hundreds of willing hands seized the launching ropes and the boat with her crew already seated and the oars out sprang from her carriage into the hissing flood  a tremendous billow met her  steady lads give way cried the coxswain on whose steering everything depended at the first plunge the short oars cracked as the men strained every muscle and shot the boat not over but right through the falling deluge  of course it was filled but the discharging tubes freed it in a few seconds and the cheers of the spectators had scarce burst forth when she rushed out to meet the succeeding breaker  there was another breathless moment when hundreds of men eager to vent their surcharged breast in another cheer could only gaze and gaspthen a roar a world of falling foam and the lifeboat was submerged  but the gallant coxswain met the shock straight as an arrow cleft the billow and leaped onwardirresistibly onward over through and in the teeth of raging wind and waves until they were fairly out and dancing on the chaotic ocean  but just before this took place the captain of the swordfish ignorant of the fact that the lifeboat was hastening to the rescue unfortunately took a fatal step  believing that no boat would venture to put off in such a gale he ordered the ships launch to be lowered this was done but it was immediately upset and stove against the side then the jollyboat was lowered and nine men and the captain got into it  the old indian officer with his daughter and all the women and children were also with great difficulty put on board of it  captain phelps was cool and selfpossessed in that hour of danger  he steered the boat with consummate skill and succeeded in keeping her afloat for some time  on she rushed as if driven by an irresistible impulse amid the cheers of the crowd and the prayers of many that she might safely reach the land  the brave fellows who manned her struggled hard and well but in vain  when the boat was little more three hundred yards from the shore an immense breaker overtook her  shell be swamped  shes gone  god save her and similar cries burst from those on shore  next moment the wave had the boat in its powerful grasp tossed her on its crest whirled her round and turned her keel up leaving her freight of human beings struggling in the sea  oh it was a terrible thing for the thousands on land to stand so close to those drowning men and women without the power of stretching out a hand to save  no one could get near them although they were so near they were tossed like straws on the raging surf  now hurled on the crest of a wave now sucked into the hollow beneath and overwhelmed again and again  the frail ones of the hapless crew soon perished  the strong men struggled on with desperate energy to reach the shore  three of them seized the keel of the boat but three times were they driven from their hold by the force of the seas  two or three caught at the floating oars but most of them were soon carried away by the undercurrent  the captain however with five or six of the men still struggled powerfully for life and succeeded in swimming close to the beach  up to this point there was one of the spectators who had stood behind the shelter of a bush surveying with sorrowful countenance the tragic scene  he was a short but finelooking and very athletic mana champion cornish wrestler named william jeff  he was a firstrate boatman and a bold swimmer  fortunately he also possessed a generous daring heart  when this man saw captain phelps near the shore he sprang forward dashed into the surf at the imminent risk of his life and caught the captain by the hair  the retreating water wellnigh swept the brave rescuer away but other men of the town fearless like himself leaped forward joined hands caught hold of jeff and hauled him safe ashore along with the captain who was carried away in a state of insensibility  again and again at the risk of his life did the champion wrestler wrestle with the waves and conquer them  aided by his daring comrades he dragged three others from the jaws of death  of those who entered the jollyboat of the swordfish only five reached the land  these were all sailors and one of them captain phelps was so much exhausted by his exertions that notwithstanding all that cordials rubbing and medical skill could effect he sank in a few minutes and died  but while this was occurring on the beach another scene of disaster was taking place at the wreck  the lifeboat after a severe pull of more than an hour reached the vessel  as she was passing under her stern a great sea struck the boat and immediately capsized her  all on board were at once thrown out  the boat was however one of those selfrighting crafts which had just at that time been introduced  she immediately righted emptied herself and the crew climbed into her by means of the lifelines festooned round her sides but the brave coxswain was jammed under her by some wreck and nearly lost his life having to dive three or four times before he could extricate himself when at last dragged into the boat by his comrades he was apparently dead  it was then discovered that the man who had pulled the stroke oar had been swept overboard and carried away  his companions believed him to be lost but he had on one of the cork lifebelts of the lifeboat institution and was by it floated to the shore where a brave fellow swam his horse out through the surf and rescued him  meanwhile the lifeboat men were so much injured and exhausted that they were utterly incapable of making any attempt to rescue those who remained of the crew of the swordfish  it was as much as they could do to guide the boat again towards the shore steered by the second coxswain who although scarcely able to stand performed his duty with consummate skill  nothing of all this could be seen by the thousands on shore owing to the spray which thickened the atmosphere and the distance of the wreck but when the lifeboat came in sight they soon perceived that something was wrong and when she drew near they rushed to meet her  dismay filled every breast when they saw the coxswain carried out apparently dead with a stream of blood trickling from a wound in his temple and learned from the wornout and disabled crew that no rescue had been effected  immediately the local secretary before mentioned who had been all this time caring for those already rescued and preparing for those expected called for a volunteer crew and the second coxswain at once shouted ill go again sir  this mans bravery produced a wonderful moral effect  he was not permitted to go being already too much exhausted but his example caused volunteers to come forward promptly  among them were men of the coastguard a body to which the country is deeply indebted for annually saving many lives  several gentlemen of the town also volunteered  with the new crew and the chief officer of the coastguard at the helm the noble boat was launched a second time  the struggle which followed was tremendous for they had to pull direct to windward in the teeth of wind and sea  sometimes the boat would rise almost perpendicularly to the waves and the spectators gazed with bated breath fearing that she must turn over then she would gain a yard or two and again be checked  thus inch by inch they advanced until the wreck was reached and the sailors were successfully taken off  but this was not accomplished without damage to the rescuers one of whom had three ribs broken while others were more or less injured  soon the boat was seen making once more for the beach  on she came on the wings of the wind  as she drew near the people crowded towards her as far as the angry sea would permit  how many saved was the anxious question  as the boat rushed forward high on the crest of a tumultuous billow the bowman stood up and shouted nine saved and in another moment amid the ringing cheers of the vast multitude the lifeboat leaped upon the sand with the rescued men  nine saved  a pleasant piece of news that was to be read next day in the papers by those who contributed to place that lifeboat on the coast for nine souls saved implies many more souls gladdened and filled with unutterable gratitude to almighty god  but twenty lost  a dismal piece of news this to those at whose door the murders will lie till the day of doom  even john webster esquire grew pale when he heard of it and his hard heart beat harder than usual against his iron ribs as he sat in the habitation of his soul and gazed at his deceased wifes father over the chimneypiece until he almost thought the canvas image frowned upon him  there was more however behind these twenty lost lives than mr webster dreamed of  the links in the chains of providence are curiously intermingled and it is impossible to say when one of them gives way which or how many will fall along with it as the next chapter will show    chapter five  things become shaky so does mr webster and the results are an illness and a voyage  the old indian officer who was drowned as we have seen in the wreck of the swordfish was in no way connected with mr john webster  in fact the latter gentleman read his name in the list of those lost with feelings of comparative indifference  he was very sorry indeed as he himself expressed it that so many human beings had been swept off the stage of time by that unfortunate wreck but it did not add to his sorrow that an old gentleman whom he had never seen or heard of before was numbered with the drowned  had he foreseen the influence that the death of that old officer was to have on his own fortunes he might have looked a little more anxiously at the announcement of it  but colonel greenthat was his namewas nothing to john webster  what mattered his death or life to him  he was no doubt a rich old fellow who had lived in the east indies when things were conducted in a rather loose style and when unscrupulous men in power had opportunities of feathering their nests well but even although that was true it mattered not for all colonel greens fortune if thrown into the pile or taken from it would scarcely have made an appreciable difference in the wealth of the great firm of webster and company  not that company had anything to do with it for there was no company  there had been one once but he had long ago passed into the realms where gold has no value  there was however a very large and important firm in liverpool which was deeply interested in the life of colonel green for he had long been a sleeping partner of the firm and had during a course of years become so deeply indebted to it that the other partners were beginning to feel uneasy about him  messrs wentworth and hodge would have given a good deal to have got rid of their sleeping partner but colonel green cared not a straw for wentworth nor a fig for hodge so he went on in his own way until the swordfish was wrecked when he went the way of all flesh and wentworth and hodge discovered that whatever riches he colonel green might at one time have possessed he left nothing behind him except a number of heavy debts  this was serious because the firm had been rather infirm for some years past and the consequences of the colonels death were that it became still more shaky and finally came down  now it is a well understood fact that men cannot fall alone  you cannot remove a small prop from a large old tree without running the risk of causing the old tree to fall and carry a few of the neighbouring trees with a host of branches creeping plants and parasites along with it  especially is this the case in the mercantile world  the death of colonel green was a calamity only to a few tradesmen but the fall of wentworth and company was a much more serious matter because that firm was an important prop to the much greater firm of dalgetty and son which immediately shook in its shoes and also went down spreading ruin and consternation in the city now it happened that dalgetty and son had extensive dealings with webster and company and their fall involved the latter so deeply that despite their great wealth their idolatrous head was compelled to puzzle his brain considerably in order to see his way out of his difficulties  but the more he looked the less he saw of a favourable nature  some of his evil practices also had of late begun to shed their legitimate fruit on john webster and to teach him something of the meaning of those words be sure your sins shall find you out  this complicated matters considerably  he consulted his cashbooks bankbooks billbooks salesbooks orderbooks ledgers etcetera etcetera again and again for hours at a time without arriving at any satisfactory result  he went to his diminutive office early in the morning and sat there late at night and did not by so doing improve his finances a whit although he succeeded in materially injuring his health  he worried the life of poor meek grinder to such an extent that that unfortunate man went home one night and told his wife he meant to commit suicide begged her to go out and purchase a quart of laudanum for that purpose at the fishmongers and was not finally induced to give up or at least to delay his rash purpose until he had swallowed a tumbler of mulled port wine and gone to sleep with a bottle of hot water at his feet  in short mr webster did all that it was possible for a man to do in order to retrieve his fortunesall except pray and commit his affairs into the hands of his maker that he held to be utterly ridiculous  to make use of gods winds and waves and natural laws and the physical and mental powers which had been given him for the furtherance of his designs was quite natural he said but to make use of gods word and his promisestut tut he said that was foolishness  however that may be the end was that webster and company became very shaky  they did not indeed go into the gazette but they got into very deep water and the principal ere long having overwrought all his powers was stricken with a raging fever  it was then that john webster found his god to be anything but a comforter for it sat upon him like a nightmare and poor annie who assisted by mrs niven was his constant and devoted nurse was horrified by the terrible forms in which the golden idol assailed him that fever became to him the philosophers stone  everything was transmuted by it into gold  the counting of guineas was the poor mans sole occupation from morning till night and the numbers to which he attained were sometimes quite bewildering but he invariably lost the thread at a certain point and with a weary sigh began over again at the beginning  the bed curtains became golden tissue the quilt golden filigree the posts golden masts and yards and bowsprits which now receded from him to immeasurable distance and anon advanced until he cried out and put up his hands to shield his face from harm but whether they advanced or retired they invariably ended by being wrecked and he was left in the raging sea surrounded by drowning men with whom he grappled and fought like a demon insomuch that it was found necessary at one time to have a strong man in an adjoining room to be ready to come in when summoned and hold him down  gold gold gold was the subject of his thoughtsthe theme of his ravingsat that time  he must have read at some period of his life and been much impressed by hoods celebrated poem on that subject for he was constantly quoting scraps of it  why dont you help me he would cry at times turning fiercely to his daughter  how can i remember it if i am not helped  i have counted it all upone two three on to millions and billions and trillions of gold gold gold hammered and rolled bought and sold scattered and doledthere ive lost it again  you are constantly setting me wrong all the things about me are gold and the very food you gave me yesterday was gold  oh how sick i am of this gold  why dont you take it away from me  and then he would fall into some other train of thought in which his god as before would take the reins and drive him on ever in the same direction  at last the crisis of the disease came and passed and john webster began slowly to recover  and it was now that he formed a somewhat true estimate of the marketable value of his daughter annie inasmuch as he came at length to the conclusion that she was priceless and that he would not agree to sell her for any sum that could be named  during this period of convalescence annies patience gentleness and powers of endurance were severely tried and not found wanting  the result was that the conscience of the invalid began to awake and smite him then his heart began to melt and ere long became knit to that of his child while she sought to relieve his pains and cheer his spirits she chatted played sang and read to him  among other books she read the bible  at first mr webster objected to this on the ground that he did not care for it but seeing that annie was much pained by his refusal he consented to permit her to read a few verses to him daily he always listened to them with his eyes shut but never by look or comment gave the least sign that they made any impression on him  during the whole period of mr websters illness and convalescence captain harry boyns found it convenient to have much business to transact in liverpool and he was extremely regular in his calls to inquire after the health of his late employer  this was very kind of him considering the way in which he had been treated  sometimes on these visits he saw annie sometimes he saw mrs nivenaccording as the one or other chanced to be on duty at the time but although he was never permitted to do more than exchange a few sentences with either of them the most careless observer could have told on each occasion which he had seen for he always left the door with a lengthened face and slow step when he had seen mrs niven but ran down the steps with a flushed countenance and sparkling eyes when he had met with annie  at last mr webster was so much restored that his doctor gave him leave to pay a short visit to his countingroom in the city  how strangely mr webster felt after his long absence when he entered once more the temple of his god and sat down in his old chair everything looked so familiar yet so strange  there were indeed the old objects but not the old arrangements for advantage had been taken of his absence to have the office thoroughly cleaned  there was the same air of quiet too and seclusion but the smells were not so musty as they used to be and there was something terribly unbusinesslike in the locked desk and the shut books and the utter absence of papers  the portrait of his deceased wifes father was there however as grim silent and steadfast in its gaze as ever so mr webster smiled nodded to it and rang a handbell for his confidential clerk who entered instantly having been stationed at the back of the door for full ten minutes in expectation of the summons  good morning mr grinder  i have been ill you see  glad to get back however  how has business been going on in my absence  the doctor forbade my making any inquiries while i was ill so that i have been rather anxious  yes sir i am awareiin fact i was anxious to see you several times on business but could not gain admittance  hm not going on so well as might be desired i suppose said mr webster  well not quite in short i might even say things are much worse than they were before you took ill sir but if a confidential agent were sent to jamaica totothat is if messrs bright and early were seen by yourself sir and some arrangement made we mightmightgo on for some time longer and if trade revives i think  so bad as that exclaimed mr webster musing  well well grinder we must do our best to pull through  are any of our vessels getting ready for sea just now  yes sir the ocean queen sails for jamaica about the end of this month  very well grinder i will go in her  she is one of our best ships i think  the doctor said something about a short voyage to recruit me so thats settled  bring me writing materials and send a statement of affairs home to me tonight  i have not yet strength to go into details here  grinder brought the writing materials and retired  his employer wrote several letters among them one to the doctor apprising him of his intention to go to jamaica and another to the captain of the ocean queen giving him the same information and directing him to fit up the two best berths in the cabin for the reception of himself and his daughter with a berth for an old female servant  three weeks thereafter he went on board with annie and mrs niven and the ocean queen spreading her sails was soon far out upon the broad bosom of the restless atlantic    chapter six  describes the presentation of a new lifeboat to covelly and treats of the royal national lifeboat institution  we must now change the scene and beg our readers to accompany us once more to covelly where not long after the events narrated in the last chapter an interesting ceremony was performed which called out the inhabitants in vast numbers  this was the presentation of a new lifeboat to the town and the rewarding of several men who had recently been instrumental in saving life in circumstances of peculiar danger  the weather was propitious  a bright sun and a calm sea rejoiced the eyes of the hundreds who had turned out to witness the launch  the old boat which had saved our heroine years before and had rescued many more since that day from the angry sea was worn out and had to be replaced by one of the magnificent new boats built on the selfrighting principle which had but recently been adopted by the lifeboat institution  a lady of the neighbourhood whose only daughter had been saved by the old boat some time before had presented the purchasemoney of the new one 400 pounds to the institution and with the promptitude which characterises all the movements of that society a fine selfrighting lifeboat with all the latest improvements had been sent at once to the port  high on her carriage in the centre of the town the new lifeboat stoodgay and brilliant in her blue and white paint the crew with their cork lifebelts on and a brass band in front ready to herald her progress to the shore  the mayor of the town with all the principal men headed the procession and a vast concourse of people followed  at the shore the boat was named the rescue by the young lady whose life had been saved by the old one and amid the acclamations of the vast multitude the noble craft was shot off her carriage into the calm sea where she was rowed about for a considerable time and very critically examined by her crew for although the whole affair was holidaywork to most of those who looked on the character of the new boat was a matter of serious import to those who manned her and who might be called on to risk their lives in her every time their shores should be lashed by a stormy sea  our hero harry boyns held the steering oar  he had been appointed by the parent institution to the position of local secretary of the covelly lifeboat branch and of course was anxious to know the qualities of his vessel  harry we may remark in passing having lost his situation and finding that his mothers health was failing had made up his mind to stay on shore for a year or two and seek employment in his native town  being a welleducated man he obtained this in the office of a mercantile house one of the partners of which was related to his mother  the rowing powers of the new boat were soon tested  then harry steered to the pier where a tackle had been prepared for the purpose of upsetting her  this was an interesting point in the proceedings because few there had seen a selfrighting boat and as usual there was a large sprinkling in the crowd of that class of human beings who maintain the plausible but false doctrine that seeing is believing  considerable difficulty was experienced in getting the boat to overturn the operation was slowly accomplished and all through there appeared to be an unwillingness on the part of the boat to upseta symptom which gave much satisfaction to her future crew who stood ready on her gunwale to leap away from her  at last she was raised completely on one side then she balanced for a moment and fell forward keel up with a tremendous splash while the men not a moment too soon sprang into the sea and a wild cheer mingled with laughter arose from the spectators  if the upsetting was slow and difficult the selfrighting was magically quick and easy  the boat went right round and almost before one could realise what had occurred she was again on an even keel  of course she was nearly full of water at the moment of rising but in a few seconds the discharging holes in her bottom had cleared the water completely away  the whole operation of selfrighting and selfemptying from first to last occupied only seventeen seconds  if there was laughter mingled with the shouts when she overturned and threw her crew into the sea there was nothing but deeptoned enthusiasm in the prolonged cheer which hailed her on righting for then it was fully realised especially by seafaring men what genuine and valuable qualities the boat possessed and the cheers became doubly enthusiastic when the crew grasping the lifelines which were festooned round her sides clambered on board again and were reseated at the oars in less than two minutes thereafter  this done the boat was hauled up on her carriage and conveyed to the house near the beach which had been prepared for her reception there to wait in constant readiness until the storm should call her forth to display her peculiar qualities in actual service  but another and if possible a still more interesting ceremony remained to be performed  this was the presentation of the gold and silver medals of the institution to several men of the town who in a recent storm had rendered signal service in the saving of human life  the zealous and indefatigable secretary of the institution had himself come down from london to present these  the presentation took place in the new town hall a large building capable of containing upwards of a thousand people which on the occasion was filled to overflowing  the mayor presided of course and opened proceedings as many chairmen do by taking the wind out of the sails of the principal speaker  that is to say he touched uninterestingly on each topic that was likely to engage the attention of the meeting and stated many facts and figures in a loose and careless way which every one knew the secretary would as a matter of course afterwards state much better and more correctly than himself  but the mayor was a respected wellmeaning man and although his speech was listened to with manifest impatience his sitting down was hailed with rapturous applause  at this pointthe mayor having in his excitement forgotten to call upon the secretary to speaka stout man on the platform took advantage of the oversight and started to his feet calling from a disgusted auditor the expression oh theres that bore dowler  it was indeed that same joseph who had on a memorable occasion long past signed himself the humble friend of mr webster  before a word could escape his lips however he was greeted with a storm of yells and obliged to sit down but he did so under protest and remained watchful for another favourable opportunity of breaking in  dowler never knew when he was out of order he never felt or believed himself to be out of order in fact he did not know what out of order meant when applied to himself  he was morally a rhinoceros  he could not be shamed by disapprobation could not be cowed by abuse never was put out by noisealthough he frequently was by the police nor put down by reasonthough he sometimes was by force spoke everywhere on all subjects against the opinions apparently of everybody and lived a life of perpetual public martyrdom and protest  silence having been obtained the secretary of the lifeboat institution rose and after a few complimentary remarks on the enthusiasm in the good cause shown by the town and especially by the lady who had presented the boat he called captain harry boyns to the platform and presented him with the gold medal of the institution in an able speech wherein he related the special act of gallantry for which it was awardedtelling how that during a terrible gale on a dark night in december the gallant young captain happening to walk homewards along the cliffs observed a vessel on the rocks not twenty yards from the land with the green seas making clean breaches over her and how that knowing the tide was rising and that before he could run to the town three miles distant for assistance the vessel would certainly be dashed to pieceshe plunged into the surf at the imminent risk of his life swam to the vessel and returned to the shore with a rope by which means a hawser was fixed to the cliffs and thirtynine lives were rescued from the sea  well did every one present know the minute details of the heroic deed referred to but they were glad to hear the praises of their townsman reechoed by one who thoroughly understood the merits of the case and whose comments thereon brought out more clearly to the minds of many the extent of the danger which the gallant captain had run so that when harry stepped forward to receive the medal he was greeted with the most enthusiastic cheers  thereafter the secretary presented silver medals to two fishermen of the cove namely old jacobs and robert gaston both of whom had displayed unusual daring at the rescue of the young lady who was the donor of the lifeboat  he then touched on the value of lifeboats in general and gave an interesting account of the origin of the society which he represented but as this subject deserves somewhat special treatment we shall turn aside from the thread of our tale for a little to regard the work and the boats of the royal national lifeboat institution assuring our reader that the subject is well worthy the earnest consideration of all men  the first lifeboat ever launched upon the stormy sea was planned and built by a london coachbuilder named lionel lukin who took out a patent for it in november 1785 and launched it at bamborough where it was the means of saving many lives the first year  although lukin thus demonstrated the possibility of lives being saved by a boat which could live under circumstances that would have proved fatal to ordinary boats he was doomed to disappointment  the prince of wales george the fourth did indeed befriend him but the lords of admiralty were deaf and the public were indifferent  lukin went to his grave unrewarded by man but stamped with a nobility which can neither be gifted nor inherited but only wonthe nobility which attaches to the character of national benefactor  the public were aroused from their apathy in 1789 by the wreck of the adventure of newcastle the crew of which perished in the presence of thousands who could do nothing to save them  models of lifeboats were solicited and premiums offered for the best  among those who responded william wouldhave a painter and henry greathead a boatbuilder of south shields stood preeminent  the latter afterwards became a noted builder and improver of lifeboats and was well and deservedly rewarded for his labours  in 1803 greathead had built thirtyone boatseighteen for england five for scotland and eight for other countries  this was so far well but it was a wretchedly inadequate provision for the necessities of the case  it was not until 1822 that a great champion of the lifeboat cause stood forth in the person of sir william hillary baronet  sir william besides being a philanthropist was a hero  he not only devised liberal things and carried them into execution but he personally shared in the danger of rescuing life from the sea  he dwelt on the shores of the isle of man where he established a sailors home at douglas  he frequently embarked in the boats that went off to rescue lives from the wrecks that were constantly occurring on the island once he had his ribs broken in this service and was frequently in imminent danger of being drowned  during his career he personally assisted in the saving of 305 human lives  he was the means of stirring up public men and the nation generally to a higher sense of their duty towards those who professionally and otherwise risk their lives upon the sea and eventually in conjunction with two members of parliament mr thomas wilson and mr george herbertwas the founder of the royal national institution for the preservation of life from shipwreck  this institutionnow named the royal national lifeboat institutionwas founded on the 24th of march 1824 and has gone on progressively doing its noble work of creating and maintaining a lifeboat fleet rescuing the shipwrecked and rewarding the rescuers from that day to this when life does not require to be saved and when opportunity offers the society allows its boats to save property of which we shall have something more to say presently  at the founding of the institution in 1824 the archbishop of canterbury of the day filled the chair the great wilberforce lord john russell and other magnates were present the dukes of kent sussex and other members of the royal family became vicepatrons the duke of northumberland its vicepresident and george the fourth its patron  in 1850 the muchlamented prince albertwhose life was a continual going about doing goodbecame its vicepatron and her majesty the queen became and still continues a warm supporter and an annual contributor  now this is a splendid array of names and titles but it ought ever to be borne in remembrance that the institution is dependent for its continued existence on the publicon you and me good readerfor it is supported almost entirely by voluntary contributions  that it will always find warm hearts to pray for it and open hands to give as long as its boats continue year by year to pluck men women and children from the jaws of death and give them back to gladdened hearts on shore is made very apparent from the records published quarterly in the lifeboat journal of the society a work full of interesting information  therein we find that the most exalted contributor is queen victoriathe lowliest a sailors orphan child  here are a few of the gifts to the institution selected very much at randomone gentleman leaves it a legacy of 10000 pounds  some time ago a sum of 5000 pounds was sent anonymously by a friend  there comes 100 pounds as a second donation from a sailors daughter and 50 pounds from a british admiral  five shillings are sent as the savings of a child 1 shilling 6 pence from another little child in postagestamps 15 pounds from three fellowservants 10 pounds from a shipwrecked pilot and 10 shillings 6 pence from an old salt indeed we can speak from personal experience on this subject because among others we received a letter one day in a cramped and peculiar hand which we perused with deep interest for it had been written by a blind youth whose eyes nevertheless had been thoroughly opened to see the great importance of the lifeboat cause for he had collected 100 pounds for the institution  on another occasion at the close of a lecture on the subject an old woman who appeared to be among the poorest of the classes who inhabit the old town of edinburgh came to us and said hae theres tippence for the lifeboat  it cannot be doubted that these sums and many many others that are presented annually are the result of moral influences which elevate the soul and which are indirectly caused by the lifeboat service  we therefore hold that the institution ought to be regarded as a prolific cause of moral good to the nation  and while we are on this subject it may be observed that our lifeboat influence for good on other nations is very considerable  in proof of this we cite the following facts finland sends 50 pounds to our institution to testify its appreciation of the good done by us to its sailors and shipping  the late president lincoln of the united states while involved in all the anxieties of the great civil war found time to send 100 pounds to our lifeboat institution in acknowledgement of the services rendered to american ships in distress  russia and holland send naval men to inspect our lifeboat management  france in generous emulation of ourselves starts a lifeboat institution of its own and last but not least it has been said that foreigners know when they are wrecked on the shores of britain by the persevering and noble efforts that are made to save their lives  but there are some minds which do not attach much value to moral influence and to which material benefit is an allpowerful argument well then to these we would address ourselves but in passing would remark that moral influence goes far to secure for us material advantage  it is just because so many hundreds of human living souls are annually preserved to us that men turn with glowing gratitude to the rescuers and to the institution which organises and utilises the latent philanthropy and pluck of our coast heroes  on an average 800 lives are saved every year while despite our utmost efforts 600 are lost those who know anything about our navy and our want of british seamen to man our ships cannot fail to see that the saving of so many valuable lives is a positive material benefit to the nation  but to descend to the lowest point we maintain that the value of the lifeboats to the nation in the mere matter of saving property is almost incredible  in regard to these things it is possible to speak definitely  for instance during stormy weather it frequently happens that vessels show signals of distress either because they are so badly strained as to be in a sinking condition or so damaged that they are unmanageable or the crews have become so exhausted as to be no longer capable of working for their own preservation  in such cases the lifeboat puts off with the intention in the first instance of saving life  it reaches the vessel in distress the boats crew spring on board and find perhaps that there is some hope of saving the ship  knowing the locality well they steer her clear of rocks and shoals  being fresh and vigorous they work the pumps with a will manage to keep her afloat and finally steer her into port thus saving ship and cargo as well as crew  now let it be observed that what we have here supposed is not imaginaryit is not even of rare occurrence  it happens every year last year thirtyeight ships were thus saved by lifeboats  the year before twentyeight were saved  the year before that seventeen before that twentyone  as surely and regularly as the year comes round so surely and regularly are ships and property thus saved to the nation  it cannot be too well understood that a wrecked ship is not only an individual but a national loss  insurance protects the individual but insurance cannot in the nature of things protect the nation  if you drop a thousand sovereigns in the street that is a loss to you but not to the nation  some lucky individual will find the money and circulate it  but if you drop it in the sea it is lost not only to you but to the nation to which you belongay lost to the world itself for ever  if a lifeboat therefore saves a ship worth 1000 pounds from destruction it literally presents that sum as a free gift to the nation  we say a free gift because the lifeboats are supported for the purpose of saving life not property  a few remarks on the value of loaded ships will throw additional light on this subject and make more apparent the value of the lifeboat institution  take first the case of a ship which was actually saved by a lifeboat  she was a large spanish ship which grounded on a bank off the south coast of ireland  the captain and crew forsook her and escaped to shore in their boats but one man was inadvertently left on board  soon after the wind moderated and shifted the ship slipped off the bank into deep water and drifted to the northward  the crew of the cahore lifeboat were on the lookout observed the vessel passing launched their boat and after a long pull against wind and sea boarded the vessel and rescued the spanish sailor  but they did more  finding seven feet of water in the hold they rigged the pumps trimmed the sails carried the ship into port and handed her over to an agent for the owners  this vessel and cargo were valued at 20000 pounds and we think we are justified in saying that england through the instrumentality of her lifeboat institution presented that handsome sum to spain upon that occasion  but many ships are much more costly than that was  some time ago a ship named the golden age was lost upon our shores it was valued at 200000 pounds  if that single ship had been one of the thirtyeight saved last year and it might have been the sum thus saved to the nation would have been more than sufficient to buy up all the lifeboats in the kingdom twice over  but that ship was not amongst the saved  it was lost  so was the ontario of liverpool which was wrecked in october 1864 and valued at 100000 pounds  also the assaye wrecked on the irish coast and valued at 200000 pounds  here are 500000 pounds lost for ever by the wreck of these three ships alone in one year  do you know reader what such sums represent  are you aware that the value of the ontario alone is equal to the income for one year of the london missionary society wherewith it supports its institutions at home and abroad and spreads the blessed knowledge of gospel truth over a vast portion of the globe  but we have only spoken of three shipsno doubt three of the largest sizeyet only three of the lost  couple the above figures with the fact that the number of ships lost or seriously damaged every year on the shores of the united kingdom is above two thousand and you will have some idea of one of the reasons why taxation is so heavy and if you couple them with the other fact that from twenty to thirty ships great and small are saved by lifeboats every year you will perceive that whatever amount may be given to the lifeboat institution it gives back to the nation far more than it receives in material wealth not to mention human lives at all  its receipts in 1868 from all sources were 31668 pounds and its expenditure 31585 pounds  the lives saved by its own boats last year were 603 in addition to which other 259 were saved by shore boats for which the institution rewarded the crews with thirteen medals and money to the extent of above 6573 pounds for all services  the lifeboat institution has a little sister whom it would be unjust as well as ungracious not to introduce in passing namely the shipwrecked mariners society  they do their blessed work hand in hand their relative position may be simply stated thusthe lifeboat institution saves life  having dragged the shipwrecked sailor from the sea its duty is done  it hands him over to the agent of the shipwrecked mariners society who takes him by the hand sees him housed warmed clad and fed and sends him home rejoicing free of expense and with a little cash in his pocket  formerly shipwrecked sailors had to beg their way to their homes  at first they were sympathised with and well treated  thereupon uprose a host of counterfeits  the land was overrun by shipwreckedmarinerbeggars and as people of the interior knew not which was which poor shipwrecked jack often suffered because of these vile impostors  but now there is not a port in the kingdom without its agent of the society  jack has therefore no need to beg his way  the world knows this the deceiver knows it too therefore his occupation is gone  apart from its benignant work the mere fact that the little sister has swept such vagrants off the land entitles her to a strong claim on our gratitude she also is supported by voluntary contributions  turning now to another branch of our subject let us regard for a little the boats of the lifeboat institution  what is a lifeboat  wherein does it differ from other boats are questions sometimes put  let us attempt a brief reply  a lifeboatthat is to say the present lifeboatdiffers from all other boats in four particulars1  it is almost indestructible 2  it is insubmergible 3  it is selfrighting 4  it is selfemptying  in other words it can hardly be destroyed it cannot be sunk it rights itself if upset it empties itself if filled  let us illustrate these points in succession  here is evidence on the first point  on a terrible night in 1857 a portuguese brig struck on the goodwin sands  the noble and now famous ramsgate lifeboat was at once towed out when the signalrocket from the lightship was seen indicating a wreck on the sands  a terrific battle with the winds and waves ensued at length the boat was cast off to windward of the sands and bore down on the brig through the shoal water which tossed her like a cork on its raging surface  they reached the brig and lay by her for some time in the hope of getting her off but failed  the storm increased the vessel began to break up so her crew were taken into the boat which having previously cast anchor to windward of the wreck and eased off the cable until it got under her leenow tried to pull back to its anchor  every effort was fruitless owing to the shifting nature of the sands and the fury of the storm  at last nothing was left for it but to hoist the sail cut the cable and make a desperate effort to beat off the sands  in this also they failed were caught on the crest of a breaking roller and borne away to leeward  water and wind in wildest commotion were comparatively small matters to the lifeboat but want of water was a serious matter  the tide happened to be out  the sands were only partially covered and over them the breakers swept in a chaotic seething turmoil that is inconceivable by those who have not witnessed it  every one has seen the ripples on the seashore when the tide is out  on the goodwins these ripples are great banks to be measured by yards instead of inches  from one to another of these sandbanks this boat was cast  each breaker caught her up hurled her onward a few yards and let her down with a crash that wellnigh tore every man out of her leaving her there a few moments to be caught up again and made sport with by the next billow  the portuguese sailors eighteen in number clung to the thwarts in silent despair but the crew of the boat did not lose heart  they knew her splendid qualities and hoped that if they should only escape being dashed against the portions of wreck which strewed the sands all might yet be well  thus literally fathom by fathom with a succession of shocks that would have knocked any ordinary boat to pieces was this magnificent lifeboat driven during two hours in the dead of night over two miles of the goodwin sands  at last she drove into deep water on the other side the sails were set and soon after through gods mercy the rescued men were landed safely in ramsgate harbour  so we repeat the lifeboat is almost indestructible  that she is insubmergible has been proved by what has already been written and our space forbids giving further illustration but a word about the cause of this quality is necessary  her floating power is due to airchambers fitted round the sides under the seats and in the bow and stern also to empty space and light wood or cork ballast under her floor  if thrust forcibly deep under water with as many persons in her as could be stowed away she would on being released rise again to the surface like a cork  the selfrighting principle is one of the most important qualities of the lifeboat  however good it may be in other respects a boat without this quality is a lifeboat only so long as it maintains its proper position on the water  if upset it is no better than any other boat it is true that great stability being one of the lifeboats qualities such boats are not easily overturned  nevertheless they sometimes are so and the results have been on several occasions disastrous  witness the case of the liverpool boat which in january 1865 upset and the crew of seven men were drowned  also the point of ayr lifeboat which upset when under sail at a distance from the land and her crew thirteen in number were drowned  two or three of the poor fellows were seen clinging to the keel for twenty minutes but no assistance could be rendered  now both of these were considered good lifeboats but they were not selfrighting  numerous cases might be cited to prove the inferiority of the nonselfrighting boats but one more will suffice in february 1858 the southwold boata large sailing boat esteemed one of the finest in the kingdom but not selfrightingwent out for exercise and was running before a heavy surf with all sail set when she suddenly ran on the top of a sea broachedto and upset  the crew in this case being near shore and having on cork lifebelts were rescued but three gentlemen who had gone off in her without lifebelts were drowned  this case and the last occurred in broad daylight  in contrast to these we give an instance of the action of the selfrighting lifeboat when overturned  it occurred on a dark stormy night in october 1858  on that night a wreck took place off the coast near dungeness three miles from shore  the small lifeboat belonging to that place put off to the rescue  eight stout men of the coastguard composed her crew  she belonged to the national lifeboat institution all the boats of which are now built on the selfrighting principle the wreck was reached soon after midnight and found to have been deserted by her crew the boat therefore returned to the shore  while crossing a deep channel between two shoals she was caught up and struck by three heavy seas in succession  the coxswain lost command of the rudder and she was carried away before a sea broached to and upset throwing the men out of her  immediately she righted herself cleared herself of water and the anchor having fallen out she was brought up by it  the crew meanwhile having on lifebelts regained the boat got into her by means of the lifelines hung round her sides cut the cable and returned to the shore in safety  the means by which the selfrighting is accomplished aretwo large aircases one in the bow the other in the stern and a heavy iron keel  these aircases are rounded on the top and raised so high that a boat bottom up resting on them would be raised almost quite out of the water  manifestly to rest on these pivots is an impossibility the overturned boat must fall on its side in which position the heavy iron keel comes into play and drags the bottom down thus placing the boat violently and quickly in her proper position  the simple plan here described was invented by the reverend james bremner of orkney and exhibited at leith near edinburgh in the year 1800  mr bremners aircases were empty casks in the bow and stern and his ballast was three hundredweight of iron attached to the keel  this plan however was not made practically useful until upwards of fifty years later when twenty out of twentyfour men were lost by the upsetting of the nonselfrighting lifeboat of south shields  after the occurrence of that melancholy event the late duke of northumberlandwho for many years was one of the warmest supporters and patrons of the lifeboat institutionoffered a prize of 100 pounds for the best selfrighting lifeboat  it was gained by mr beeching whose boat was afterwards considerably altered and improved by mr peak  the selfemptying principle is of almost equal importance with the selfrighting for in every case of putting off to a wreck a lifeboat is necessarily filled again and again with watersometimes overwhelmed by tons of it and a boat full of water however safe it may be is necessarily useless  six large holes in the bottom of the boat effect the discharge of water  there is an airtight floor to the lifeboat which is so placed that when the boat is fully manned and loaded with passengers it is a very little above the level of the sea  on this fact the acting of the principle depends  between this floor and the bottom of the boat a space of upwards of a foot in depth there is some light ballast of cork or wood and some parts of the space are left empty  the six holes above mentioned are tubes of six inches diameter which extend from the floor through the bottom of the boat  now it is one of natures laws that water must find its level  for instance take any boat and bore large holes in its bottom and suppose it to be held up in its ordinary floating position so that it cannot sink then fill it suddenly quite full of water it will be found that the water inside will run out until it is on a level with the water outside  water poured into a lifeboat will of course act in the same way but when that which has been poured into it reaches the level of the water outside it has also reached the floor in other words there is no more water left to run out  such are the principal qualities of the splendid lifeboat now used on our coasts and of which it may be said that it has almost reached the state of absolute perfection  the lifeboat institution which has been the means in gods hands of saving so many thousands of human lives is now in a high state of efficiency and of welldeserved prosperity both of which conditions are due very largely to the untiring exertions and zeal of its present secretary richard lewis esquire of the inner temple  success is not dependent on merit alone  good though the lifeboat cause unquestionably is we doubt whether the institution would have attained its present high position so soon had it not been guided thereto by the judicious management of its committeethe members of which bestow laborious and gratuitous service on its great and national workaided by the able and learned secretary and an experienced inspector of lifeboats captain jr ward rn both whose judgement and discretion have often been the themes of deserved praise by the public  that the claims of the institution are very strong must be admitted by all who reflect that during upwards of forty years it has been engaged in the grand work of saving human lives  up to the present date it has plucked 18225 human beings from the waves besides an incalculable amount of valuable property  it is a truly national blessing and as such deserves the support of every man and woman in the kingdom  see footnote  but to return from this prolonged yet by no means unnecessary digressionlet us remind the reader that we left him at the meeting in the townhall of covelly of which however we will only say further that it was very enthusiastic and most successful  that the mayor having been stirred in spirit by the secretarys speech redeemed himself by giving vent to a truly eloquent oration and laying on the table a handsome contribution towards the funds of the society  that many of the people present gladly followed his lead and that the only interruption to the general harmony was the repeated attempts made by mr joseph dowleralways out of orderto inflict himself upon the meeting an infliction which the meeting persistently declined to permit  thereafter the new lifeboat was conveyed to its house on the shore where however it had not rested many weeks before it was called into vigorous action    for the sake of those who sympathise with us and desire to give substantial evidence of their goodwill we would suggest that contributions may be sent to the secretary richard lewis esquire 14 john street adelphi london    chapter seven  the storm and the wreck  listen o ye who lie comfortably asleep secure in your homes oblivious of danger when the tempest is roaring overhead  come let us together wing our flight to the seashore and cast a searching glance far and near over the strand  on a certain friday morning in the year 18 hundred and something a terrific gale broke over the east coast and everywhere the lifeboat men went out to watch the raging sea knowing full well that ere long there would be rough but glorious work for them to do  a tremendous sea ran high on the bar at tynemouth and rolled with tremendous force on the black middensrocks that are black indeed in their history as well as their aspect  a barque was seen making for the tyne towed by a steamtug  a sudden squall struck them the tug was forced to let the vessel go and she went on the rocks  a few minutes had barely passed when another vessel was descried a brig which made for the harbour missed it and was driven on the same fatal rocks a few yards south of the barque  the alarmgun was fired and the members of the tynemouth volunteer life brigade were quickly at the scene of disaster  the rocket apparatus was fired and a line passed over one of the vessels but other anxious eyes had been on the lookout that night and soon the salvage boat william was launched at north shields and the south shields men launched the tynemouth lifeboat  the constant lifeboat also put off to the rescue  it was getting dark by that time so that those on shore could not see the boats after they had engaged in strife with the raging sea  meanwhile part of the crew of the barque were saved by the rocket apparatus but those of the brig did not know how to use it and they would certainly have perished had not the william got alongside and rescued them all  while this was going on a third vessel was driven ashore on the battery rock  the south shields lifeboat made towards her succeeded in getting alongside and rescued the crew  a mile west of folkestone harbour a brigantine laden with rum and sugar went ashore broadsideon near sandgate castle  the everready coastguardsmen turned out  a sandgate fisherman first passed a small grapnel on board then the coastguard sent out a small line with a lifebuoy attached and one by one the crew were all savedthe men of the coastguard with ropes round their waists standing in the surf as deep as they dared to venture catching the men who dropped and holding their heads above water until they were safe  but the gallant coastguardsmen had other work cut out for them that night  besides saving life it was their duty to protect property  the cargo was a tempting one to many roughs who had assembled  when the tide receded these attempted to get on board the wreck and regale themselves  the cutlasses of the coastguard however compelled them to respect the rights of private property and taught them the majesty of the law  elsewhere along the coast many vessels were wrecked and many lives were lost that night while many more were saved by the gallant lifeboat crews the details of which if written would thrill many a sympathetic breast from john o groats to the lands end but passing by these we turn to one particular vessel which staggered in the gale of that night but which fortunately for those on board was still at some distance from the dangerous and dreaded shore  it was the ocean queen  mr webster was seated in her cabin his face very pale and his hands grasping the arms of the locker tightly to prevent his being hurled to leeward  annie sat beside him with her arms round his waist  she was alarmed and looked anxious but evidently possessed more courage than her father  there was some reason for this however for she did not know that mr websters fortunes had got into such a desperate case that for the retrieving of them he depended very much on the successful voyage of the ocean queen  dont be so cast down father said annie i heard the captain say that we shall be in sight of land tomorrow  heaven forbid said mr webster  better to be in midocean than near land on such a night  annie was about to reply when the door opened and the captain looked in  he wore a souwester and was clad in oilcloth garments from head to foot which shone like black satin with the dripping spray  were getting on famously he said in a hearty tone the wind has shifted round to the souwest and if it holdswe shall  sprung a leak sir cried the first mate in a deep excited voice as he looked down the companion  what exclaimed the captain rushing upon deck  plank must have started sir theres three foot water in  his voice was drowned by distance and the roaring of the gale but mr webster and annie had heard enough to fill them with alarm  the ocean queen had indeed sprung a leak and so bad was it that when all the pumps available were set agoing they failed to reduce the depth of water in the hold  still by constantly changing hands and making strenuous exertions they prevented it from increasing rapidly all that night and next day they wrought with unflagging energy at the pumps  no man on board spared himself  the captain took his spell with the rest  even mr webster threw off his coat and went to work as if he had been born and bred a coalheaver  the work however was very exhausting and when land appeared no one seemed to have any heart to welcome it except annie and her old nurse mrs niven  towards evening of the next day the captain came up to mr webster who was seated on the cabin skylight with his head resting wearily on his hands  we cannot make the port of liverpool i find he said  the pilot says that if we wish to save the ship we must run for the nearest harbour on the coast which happens unfortunately to be the very small one of covelly  then by all means run for it said mr webster  strange he muttered to himself that fate should lead me there  the head of the ocean queen was at once turned towards the shore and as they neared it mr webster stood talking to annie about the time long long ago when she had been rescued by a lifeboat there and remarking on the curious coincidence that she should happen to come to the same place in distress a second time  the gale although somewhat more moderate was still blowing strong and an ugly sea was rolling on the bank where the swordfish had gone ashore many years before  this however mattered little because the direction of the wind was such that they could steer well clear of it but the channel leading to the harbour was very sinuous and as the pilot observed required careful steering  in one part this channel was so crooked that it became necessary to go on the other tack a short distance  in ordinary circumstances the captain would have thought nothing of this but he felt anxious just then because some of the stores and cordage furnished by mistake to him had been intended for the ruby  now the ruby was one of the vessels of webster and company which had been sent away with the hope if not the intention that it should be wrecked  the mistake had been discovered only after the ocean queen had set sail  ready about cried the pilot  the men leaped to their respective places  take another pull at that foresl sheet said the pilot  this was done  at sea this would not have been necessary because the ship was lively and answered her helm well but in the narrow channel things had to be done more vigorously  the extra pull was given  the tackle of the foresail sheet had been meant for the ruby  it snapped asunder and the ship missed stays and fell away  instantly all was desperate confusion  a hurried attempt was made to wear ship then two anchors were let go but almost before the startled owner was aware of what had occurred the good ship received a shock which made her quiver from stem to stern  she lifted with the next wave and in another minute was fast on the shoal which had proved fatal to the swordfish with the waves dashing wildly over her  long before this occurred our hero harry boyns had been watching the vessel with considerable anxiety  he little knew who was on board of her else would his anxiety have been infinitely increased  but harry was one of those men who do not require the spur of selfinterest to keep them alive to duty  he had observed that the ship was in distress and as the honorary secretary of the lifeboat branch he summoned together the crew of his boat  thus all was in readiness for action when the disaster occurred to the ocean queen  instantly the lifeboat was run down to the beach where hundreds of willing hands were ready to launch her for the people had poured out of the town on the first rumour of what was going on  the crew leaped into the boat and seized the oars  the launchingropes were manned  a loud huzzah was given and the lifeboat shot forth on her voyage of mercy cutting right through the first tremendous billow that met her  at that time old jacob the coxswain of the boat happened to be unwell harry himself therefore took the steeringoar and bob gaston was in the bow  mr joseph dowler chanced to be among the spectators on shore that fussy and conceited individual conceiving it to be a fitting occasion for the exercise of his tremendous powers stood upon an elevated rock and began a wildly enthusiastic speech to which nobody listened and in which he urged the lifeboatmen to do their duty in quite a nelsonian spirit  fortunately a sudden gust of wind blew him off his perch  he fell on his head so that his hat was knocked over his eyes and before he was thoroughly extricated from it the lifeboat was far from shore and the men were doing their duty nobly even although mr dowlers appeal had failed to reach their ears  it was a tough pull for wind waves and tide combined to beat them back but they combined in vain  inch by inch they advanced slowly and laboriously although it was so bitterly cold that the men had little feeling in the benumbed hands with which they pulled so gallantly  at last they reached the vessel pulled well to windward cast anchor and eased off the cable until they passed her stern and got under her lee  just then harry looked up and felt as if he had received a shock from electric fire for he beheld the pale face of annie webster gazing at him with glowing eyes  no longer did he feel the chilling blast the blood rushed wildly through his veins as he shouted  look alive bobheave  bob gaston stood up in the bow and with a beautiful swing cast a line on board by means of which the boat was hauled alongside  just at that moment the mainyard came down with a thundering crash upon the ships deck fortunately injuring no one  at the same time a tremendous billow broke over the stern of the ocean queen and falling into the lifeboat in a cataract completely sunk her  she rose like a cork keel uppermost and would have righted at once but a bight of the mainsail with some of the wreck held her down  her crew one by one succeeded in clambering upon her and harry shouted to the men in the ship to hand him an axe  one was thrown to him which he caught and began therewith to cut the wreck of cordage  slit the sail with your knife bob gaston he cried but bob did not reply  all the other men were there bob alone was missing  the difficulty of acting in such turmoil is not to be easily estimated twenty minutes elapsed before the boat was cleared  when this was accomplished she righted at once and bob gaston was found sticking to the bottom of her inside having found sufficient air and space there to keep him alive  another moment and harry boyns was on the deck of the wreck  perhaps the most earnest thank god that ever passed his lips burst from them when he seized annies hand and entreated her to go with him at once into the boat  stay hold cried mr webster seizing harry wildly by the sleeve and whispering to him in quick earnest tones can nothing be done to save the ship  all is lost if she goes  hold on a minute lads cried harry to the men in the boat are the pumps working freeis your ground tackle good he added turning hastily to the captain  ay but the men are used uputterly exhausted  jump aboard lads cried harry to his men  the men obeyed leaving four of their number in the boat to keep her off the ships side  under harrys orders some of them manned the pumps while others went to the windlass  come boys make one more effort to save the ship cried harry to the fatigued crew the tide will rise for another hour well save her yet if you have pluck to try  thus appealed to they all set to work and hove with such goodwill that the ship was soon hauled off the sandsan event which was much accelerated by the gradual abating of the gale and rising of the tide when it was thought safe to do this the sails were trimmed the cables cut and finally the ocean queen was carried triumphantly into portsaved by the covelly lifeboat  need we tell you good reader that mr webster and his daughter and mrs niven spent that night under the roof of hospitable mrs boyns whopartly because of the melancholy that ever rested like a soft cloud on her mild countenance and partly because the cap happened to suit her cast of featureslooked a very charming widow indeed  is it necessary to state that mr webster changed his sentiments in regard to young captain boyns and that from regarding him first with dislike and then with indifference he came to look upon him as one of the best fellows that ever lived and was rather pleased than otherwise when he saw him go out on the first morning after the rescue above recorded to walk with his daughter among the romantic cliffs of covelly  surely not  it would be an insult to your understanding to suppose that you required such information  it may be however necessary to let you know that not many weeks after these events widow boyns received a letter telling her that captain daniel boyns was still alive and well and that she might expect to see him within a very short period of time  on reading thus far poor mrs boyns fell flat on the sofa in a dead faint and being alone at the time remained in that condition till she recovered when she eagerly resumed the letter which went on to say that after the bottle containing the message from the sea had been cast overboard the pirates had put himself and his remaining companionssix in numberinto a small boat and left them to perish on the open sea instead of making them walk the plank as they had at first threatened that providentially a whaleship had picked them up two days afterwards and carried them off on a three years cruise to the south seas where she was wrecked on an uninhabited island  that there they had dwelt from that time to the present date without seeing a single sailthe island being far out of the track of merchant vessels  that at last a ship had been blown out of its course near the island had taken them on board and finally that here he was and she might even expect to see him in a few hours  this epistle was written in a curiously shaky hand and was much blotted yet strange to say it did not seem to have travelled far it being quite clean and fresh  the fact was that captain boyns was a considerate man  he had gone into a publichouse not ten yards distant from his own dwelling to pen this letter fearing that the shock would be too much for his wife if not broken gradually to her  but his impatience was great  he delivered the letter at his own door and stood behind it just long enough as he thought to give her plenty of time to read it and then burst in upon her just as she was recovering somewhat of her wonted selfpossession  over the scene that followed we drop the curtain and return to mr webster who is once again seated in the old chair in the old office gazing contemplatively at the portrait of his deceased wifes father    chapter eight  conclusion  there are times in the lives probably of all men when the conscience awakes and induces a spirit of selfaccusation and repentance  such a time had arrived in the experience of mr john webster  he had obtained a glimpse of himself in his true colours and the sight had filled him with dismay  he thought as he sat in the old chair in the old office of the wasted life that was behind him and the little of life that lay perchance before  his right hand from long habit fumbled with the coin in his trouserspocket  taking out a sovereign he laid it on the desk and gazed at it for some time in silence  for your sake he murmured i have all but sold myself body and soul  for the love of you i have undermined my health neglected my child ruined the fortunes of hundreds of men and women and committed m  he could not bring himself to say the word but he could not help thinking it and the thought filled him with horror  the memory of that dread hour when he expected every instant to be whelmed in the raging sea rushed upon him vividly  he passed from that to the period of his sickness when he used to fancy he was struggling fiercely in the seething brine with drowning menmen whom he had brought to that pass and who strove revengefully to drag him down along with them  he clasped his hands over his eyes as if he thought to shut out those dreadful memories and groaned in spirit  despair would have seized upon the goldlover at that time had not his guardian angel risen before his agonised mind  annies soft tones recurred to him  he thought of the words she had spoken to him the passages from gods word that she had read and for the first time in his long life the sordid man of business exclaimed god be merciful to me a sinner  no other word escaped him but when after remaining motionless for a long time he removed his hands from his face the subdued expression that rested there might have led an observer to believe that the prayer had been answered  a knock at the officedoor caused him to start and endeavour to resume his ordinary professional expression and composure as he said come in  harry boyns however had not waited for the answer  he was already in the room hat in hand  now sir he said eagerly are you ready to start  the train leaves in half an hour and we must not risk losing it today  losing it said mr webster as he rose and slowly put on his greatcoat assisted by harry why it just takes me five minutes to walk to the station  how do you propose to spend the remaining twentyfivebut i say harry he added with a peculiar smile how uncommonly spruce you are today  not an unusual condition for a man to be in on his weddingday retorted harry and i am sure that i can return you the compliment with interest  this was true for mr webster had got himself up that morning with elaborate care  his morning coat still smelt of the brown paper in which it had come home  his waistcoat was immaculately white  his pearlgrey trousers were palpably new  his lavender kidgloves were painfully clean  his patentleather boots were glitteringly black and his tout ensemble such as to suggest the idea that a bandbox was his appropriate and native home  dont be impatient boy he said putting some books into an iron safe i must attend to business first you know  you have no right to attend to business at all after making it over to me as you formally did yesterday said harry  if you come here again sir and meddle with my department i shall be compelled to dissolve partnership at once  please sir said mr grinder appearing suddenly at the door in a costume which was remarkable for its splendour and the badness of its fitfor grinders was a figure that no ordinary tailor could understand captain daniel boyns is at the door  send him in said webster  he wont come sir hes afraid of being late for the train  well well said webster with a laugh come along  are you ready grinder  yes sir  then lock the officedoor and dont forget to take out the key  so saying the old gentleman took harrys arm and accompanied by grinder and captain boyns senior hurried to the train was whirled in due course to covelly and shortly after found himself seated at a weddingbreakfast along with our hero harry boyns and our heroine annie webster who was costumed as a bride and looked inexpressibly bewitching  besides these there were present excellent mrs boyns happily no longer a widowand grinder whose susceptible nature rendered it difficult for him to refrain from shedding tears and a bevy of bridesmaids so beautiful and sweet that it seemed quite preposterous to suppose that they could remain another day in the estate of spinsterhood  mr joseph dowler was also there selfimportant as ever and ready for action at a moments notice besides a number of friends of the bride and bridegroom among whom was a pert young gentleman friend of mr dowler and a mr crashington friend of mr websteran earnest enthusiastic old gentleman who held the opinion that most things in the world were wrong and who wondered incessantly why in the world people would not set to work at once to put them all right  niven the old nurse was there too of course all excitement and tears and so was bob gaston whose appearance was powerfully suggestive of the individual styled in the ballad the jolly young waterman  now it would take a whole volume good reader to give you the details of all that was said and done by that weddingparty before that breakfast was over  but it is not necessary that we should go into full details  you know quite well that when the health of the happy couple was drunk annie blushed and looked down and harry tried to look at ease but failed to do so in consequence of the speech which had cost him such agonising thought the night before which he had prepared with such extreme care which contained such an inconceivable amount of sentimental nonsense which he fortunately forgot every word of at the critical moment of delivery and instead thereof delivered a few short earnest stammering sentences which were full of bad grammar and blunders but which nevertheless admirably conveyed the true manly sentiments of his heart  you also know doubtless that the groomsman rose to propose the health of the bridesmaids but you cannot be supposed to know that dowler rose at the same time having been told by his pert young friend that he was expected to perform that duty in consequence of the groomsman being unaccustomed to public speaking dowler although not easily put down was after some trouble convinced that he had made a mistake and sat down without making an apology and with a mental resolve to strike in at the first favourable opportunity  when these and various other toasts had been drunk and replied to the health of mr crashington as a very old friend of the brides family was proposed  hereupon crashington started to his feet  dowler who was slightly deaf and had only caught something about old friend of the family also started up and announced to the company that that was the happiest moment of his life an announcement which the company received with an explosion of laughter so loud and long that the two old friends of the family stood gazing in speechless amazement at the company and at each other for three or four minutes  at last silence was obtained and dowler exclaimed sir to which crashington replied sir and several of the company cried laughingly sit down dowler  it is certain that dowler would not have obeyed the order had not his pert young friend caught him by the coattails and pulled him down with such violence that he sat still astonished  then crashington ignoring him altogether turned to mr webster and said vehemently  sir and ladies and gentlemen if this is not the happiest moment of my life it is at least the proudest  i am proud to be recognised as an old friend of the family to which our beautiful bride belongs proud to see my dear annie wedded to a man who besides possessing many great and good qualities of mind has shown himself preeminently capable of cherishing and protecting his wife by the frequency and success with which he has risked his own life to save the lives of others  but ladies and gentlemen things more serious than proposing toasts and paying compliments are before us today  i regard this as a lifeboat wedding if i may be allowed the expression  in early life the blooming bride of today was saved by a lifeboat and the brave man who steered that boat and dived into the sea to rescue the child now sits on my left hand  again years after a lifeboat saved not only the bride but her father and her fathers ship which last although comparatively insignificant was nevertheless the means of preventing the fortunes of the family from being utterly wrecked and the man who steered the boat on that occasion as you all know was the bridegroom  butto turn from the particular to the general questioni am sure ladies and gentlemen that you will bear with me while i descant for a little on the wrong that is done to society by the present state of our laws in reference to the saving of life from shipwreck  despite the activity of our noble lifeboat institution despite the efficiency of her splendid boats and the courage of those who man them despite the vigour and zeal of our coastguardmen whose working of the rocket apparatus cannot be too highly praised despite all this i say hundreds of lives are lost annually on our coasts which might be saved and i feel assured that if the british public will continue their earnest support to our great national institution this deathroll must continue to be diminished  my friends sometimes tell me that i am a visionarythat many of my opinions are ridiculous  is it ridiculous that i should regard the annual loss of nearly 600 lives and above two millions of money as being worthy of the serious attention of every friend of his country  excuse me if i refrain from inflicting on you my own opinions and instead quote those of a correspondent of the times  here the old gentleman hastily unfolded a newspaper and read as follows  why should not such an amount of information be obtained as will not only induce but enable the board of trade immediately to frame some plain practical measure the enforcement of which would tend to lighten the appalling yearly deathlist from shipwreck  the plan i would suggest is that the board of trade should prepare a chart of the british and irish coasts on which every lifeboat rocketapparatus and mortar station should be laid down and along with this a sort of guidebook with instructions giving every particular connected with themsuch as their distances from each other whether they are stationary or transportable and the probable time that would elapse before one or the other could be brought to work with a view to the rescue of the shipwrecked crew  to illustrate my idea more plainly i will take the eastern shore of mounts bay in cornwall  a vessel has been driven on shore at gunwalloe the captain having this chart would find that there is a lifeboat at mullion on the south and a transporting lifeboat at porthleven on the north of him as well as a rocketapparatus at each place  referring to his book of instructions he would find something like thisthe mullion lifeboat will drop down on you from mullion island  the porthleven boat will most likely be launched from the beach opposite  all going well one or other of the boats will be alongside in less than an hour and a half  look out and get ready for the rocket lines in an hour after striking  the very knowledge even that the means of saving life are at hand would enable the captain to maintain a certain amount of discipline while passengers and crew alike would retain in a great measure their presence of mind and be prepared for every emergency  and again as is often the case if a captain is compelled to run his ship ashore with the view of saving the lives intrusted to him he would at once find from his chart and book of instructions the safest and nearest point from which he could obtain the desired assistance  it should be imperative not optional as at present for every vessel to carry a certain number of lifebelts  the cork jacket recommended by the royal national institution is by far the best yet introduced not only on account of its simplicity and cheapness but because it affords also warmth and protection to the body  now ladies and gentlemen continued crashington earnestly here you have the opinions of a man with whom i entirely agree for while much is done by philanthropists too little is done by government to rescue those who are in peril on our shores  in conclusion let me thank you ladies and gentlemen for drinking my health and permit me also to reiterate my hope that the happy pair who have this day been united may long live to support the lifeboat cause and never require the services of a lifeboat  although crashingtons remarks were regarded by some of the weddingparty as being somewhat out of place mr john webster listened to them with marked attention and replied to them with deep feeling after commenting slightly on the kind manner in which he had referred to the heroic deeds of his soninlaw and expressing his belief and hope that now that he had married annie and become a member of the firm of webster and company a life of usefulness and happiness lay before him he went on to say  i heartily sympathise with you sir in designating this a lifeboatwedding because under god my daughter and i owe our lives to the lifeboat  you are also right in stating that the lifeboat has been the means of preserving my fortunes from being wrecked because the saving of the ocean queen was a momentous turningpoint in my affairs but a far higher and more blessed result has accrued to myself than the saving of life or fortune for these events have been made the means of opening my eyes to the truth of god and inducing me to accept the offer of free forgiveness held out to me by that blessed saviour to whom my dear annie has clung for many a year while i was altogether immersed in business  i feel myself justified therefore in saying with deep humility and gratitude that i have been saved by the lifeboatbody and soul
