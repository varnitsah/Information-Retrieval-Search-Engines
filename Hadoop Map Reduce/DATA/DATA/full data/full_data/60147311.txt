60147311	lysbeth  a tale of the dutch   by h rider haggard   first published 1901      dedication  in token of the earnest reverence of a man of a later generation for his character and for that life work whereof we inherit the fruits today this tale of the times he shaped is dedicated to the memory of one of the greatest and most noblehearted beings that the world has known the immortal william called the silent of nassau     authors note  there are roughly two ways of writing an historical romancethe first to choose some notable and leading characters of the time to be treated and by the help of history attempt to picture them as they were the other to make a study of that time and history with the country in which it was enacted and from it to deduce the necessary characters  in the case of lysbeth the author has attempted this second method by an example of the trials adventures and victories of a burgher family of the generation of philip ii and william the silent he strives to set before readers of today something of the life of those who lived through perhaps the most fearful tyranny that the western world has known how did they live one wonders how is it that they did not die of very terror those of them who escaped the scaffold the famine and the pestilence  this and anotherwhy were such things suffered to beseem problems worth consideration especially by the young who are so apt to take everything for granted including their own religious freedom and personal security how often indeed do any living folk give a grateful thought to the forefathers who won for us these advantages and many others with them  the writer has sometimes heard travellers in the netherlands express surprise that even in an age of almost universal decoration its noble churches are suffered to remain smeared with melancholy whitewash could they look backward through the centuries and behold with the minds eye certain scenes that have taken place within these very temples and about their walls they would marvel no longer here we are beginning to forget the smart at the price of which we bought deliverance from the bitter yoke of priest and king but yonder the sword bit deeper and smote more often perhaps that is why in holland they still love whitewash which to them may be a symbol a perpetual protest and remembering stories that have been handed down as heirlooms to this day frown at the sight of even the most modest sacerdotal vestment those who are acquainted with the facts of their history and deliverance will scarcely wonder at the prejudice      lysbeth  a tale of the dutch     book the first  the sowing    chapter i  the wolf and the badger  the time was in or about the year 1544 when the emperor charles v ruled the netherlands and our scene the city of leyden  any one who has visited this pleasant town knows that it lies in the midst of wide flat meadows and is intersected by many canals filled with rhine water but now as it was winter near to christmas indeed the meadows and the quaint gabled roofs of the city lay buried beneath a dazzling sheet of snow while instead of boats and barges skaters glided up and down the frozen surface of the canals which were swept for their convenience outside the walls of the town not far from the morsch poort or gate the surface of the broad moat which surrounded them presented a sight as gay as it was charming just here one of the branches of the rhine ran into this moat and down it came the pleasureseekers in sledges on skates or afoot they were dressed most of them in their best attire for the day was a holiday set apart for a kind of skating carnival with sleighing matches such games as curling and other amusements  among these merry folk might have been seen a young lady of two or three and twenty years of age dressed in a coat of dark green cloth trimmed with fur and closefitting at the waist this coat opened in front showing a broidered woollen skirt but over the bust it was tightly buttoned and surmounted by a stiff ruff of brussels lace upon her head she wore a highcrowned beaver hat to which the nodding ostrich feather was fastened by a jewelled ornament of sufficient value to show that she was a person of some means in fact this lady was the only child of a sea captain and shipowner named carolus van hout who whilst still a middleaged man had died about a year before leaving her heiress to a very considerable fortune this circumstance with the added advantages of a very pretty face in which were set two deep and thoughtful grey eyes and a figure more graceful than was common among the netherlander women caused lysbeth van hout to be much sought after and admired especially by the marriageable bachelors of leyden  on this occasion however she was unescorted except by a serving woman somewhat older than herself a native of brussels greta by name who in appearance was as attractive as in manner she was suspiciously discreet  as lysbeth skated down the canal towards the moat many of the good burghers of leyden took off their caps to her especially the young burghers one or two of whom had hopes that she would choose them to be her cavalier for this days fete some of the elders also asked her if she would care to join their parties thinking that as she was an orphan without near male relations she might be glad of their protection in times when it was wise for beautiful young women to be protected with this excuse and that however she escaped from them all for lysbeth had already made her own arrangements  at that date there was living in leyden a young man of four or five and twenty named dirk van goorl a distant cousin of her own dirk was a native of the little town of alkmaar and the second son of one of its leading citizens a brass founder by trade as in the natural course of events the alkmaar business would descend to his elder brother their father appointed him to a leyden firm in which after eight or nine years of hard work he had become a junior partner while he was still living lysbeths father had taken a liking to the lad with the result that he grew intimate at the house which from the first was open to him as a kinsman after the death of carolus van hout dirk had continued to visit there especially on sundays when he was duly and ceremoniously received by lysbeths aunt a childless widow named clara van ziel who acted as her guardian thus by degrees favoured with such ample opportunity a strong affection had sprung up between these two young people although as yet they were not affianced nor indeed had either of them said a word of open love to the other  this abstinence may seem strange but some explanation of their selfrestraint was to be found in dirks character in mind he was patient very deliberate in forming his purposes and very sure in carrying them out he felt impulses like other men but he did not give way to them for two years or more he had loved lysbeth but being somewhat slow at reading the ways of women he was not quite certain that she loved him and above everything on earth he dreaded a rebuff moreover he knew her to be an heiress and as his own means were still humble and his expectations from his father small he did not feel justified in asking her in marriage until his position was more assured had the captain carolus still been living the case would have been different for then he could have gone to him but he was dead and dirks fine and sensitive nature recoiled from the thought that it might be said of him that he had taken advantage of the inexperience of a kinswoman in order to win her fortune also deep down in his mind he had a sincerer and quite secret reason for reticence whereof more in its proper place  thus matters stood between these two today however though only with diffidence and after some encouragement from the lady he had asked leave to be his cousins cavalier at the ice fete and when she consented readily enough appointed the moat as their place of meeting this was somewhat less than lysbeth expected for she wished his escort through the town but when she hinted as much dirk explained that he would not be able to leave the works before three oclock as the metal for a large bell had been run into the casting and he must watch it while it cooled  so followed only by her maid greta lysbeth glided lightly as a bird down the ice path on to the moat and across it through the narrow cut to the frozen mere beyond where the sports were to be held and the races run there the scene was very beautiful  behind her lay the roofs of leyden pointed picturesque and covered with sheets of snow while above them towered the bulk of the two great churches of st peter and st pancras and standing on a mound known as the burg the round tower which is supposed to have been built by the romans in front stretched the flat expanse of white meadows broken here and there by windmills with narrow waists and thin tall sails and in the distance by the church towers of other towns and villages  immediately before her in strange contrast to this lifeless landscape lay the peopled mere fringed around with dead reeds standing so still in the frosty air that they might have been painted things on this mere half the population of leyden seemed to be gathered at least there were thousands of them shouting laughing and skimming to and fro in their bright garments like flocks of gayplumaged birds among them drawn by horses with bells tied to their harness glided many sledges of wickerwork and wood mounted upon iron runners their foreends fashioned to quaint shapes such as the heads of dogs or bulls or tritons then there were vendors of cakes and sweetmeats vendors of spirits also who did a good trade on this cold day beggars too were numerous and among them deformities who nowadays would be hidden in charitable homes slid about in wooden boxes which they pushed along with crutches lastly many loafers had gathered there with stools for fine ladies to sit on while the skates were bound to their pretty feet and chapmen with these articles for sale and straps wherewith to fasten them to complete the picture the huge red ball of the sun was sinking to the west and opposite to it the pale full moon began already to gather light and life  the scene seemed so charming and so happy that lysbeth who was young and now that she had recovered from the shock of her beloved fathers death lighthearted ceased her forward movement and poised herself upon her skates to watch it for a space while she stood thus a little apart a woman came towards her from the throng not as though she were seeking her but aimlessly much as a childs toyboat is driven by light contrary winds upon the summer surface of a pond  she was a remarkablelooking woman of about thirtyfive years of age tall and bony in make with deepset eyes light grey of colour that seemed now to flash fiercely and now to waver as though in memory of some great dread from beneath a coarse woollen cap a wisp of grizzled hair fell across the forehead where it lay like the forelock of a horse indeed the high cheekbones scarred as though by burns widespread nostrils and prominent white teeth whence the lips had strangely sunk away gave the whole countenance a more or less equine look which this falling lock seemed to heighten for the rest the woman was poorly and not too plentifully clad in a gown of black woollen torn and stained as though with long use and journeys while on her feet she wore wooden clogs to which were strapped skates that were not fellows one being much longer than the other  opposite to lysbeth this strange gaunt person stopped contemplating her with a dreamy eye presently she seemed to recognise her for she said in a quick low voice the voice of one who lives in terror of being overheard  thats a pretty dress of yours van houts daughter oh yes i know you your father used to play with me when i was a child and once he kissed me on the ice at just such a fete as this think of it kissed me martha the mare and she laughed hoarsely and went on yes wellwarmed and wellfed and without doubt waiting for a gallant to kiss you here she turned and waved her hand towards the peopleall wellwarmed and wellfed and all with lovers and husbands and children to kiss but i tell you van houts daughter as i have dared to creep from my hiding hole in the great lake to tell all of them who will listen that unless they cast out the cursed spaniard a day shall come when the folk of leyden must perish by thousands of hunger behind those walls yes yes unless they cast out the cursed spaniard and his inquisition oh i know him i know him for did they not make me carry my own husband to the stake upon my back and have you heard why van houts daughter because what i had suffered in their torturedens had made my faceyes mine that once was so beautifullike the face of a horse and they said that a horse ought to be ridden  now while this poor excited creature one of a whole class of such people who in those sad days might be found wandering about the netherlands crazy with their griefs and sufferings and living only for revenge poured out these broken sentences lysbeth terrified shrank back before her as she shrank the other followed till presently lysbeth saw her expression of rage and hate change to one of terror in another instant muttering something about a request for alms which she did not wait to receive the woman had wheeled round and fled away as fast as her skates would carry herwhich was very fast indeed  turning about to find what had frightened her lysbeth saw standing on the bank of the mere so close that she must have overheard every word but behind the screen of a leafless bush a tall forbiddinglooking woman who held in her hand some broidered caps which apparently she was offering for sale these caps she began to slowly fold up and place one by one in a hide satchel that was hung about her shoulders all this while she was watching lysbeth with her keen black eyes except when from time to time she took them off her to follow the flight of that person who had called herself the mare  you keep ill company lady said the capseller in a harsh voice  it was none of my seeking answered lysbeth astonished into making a reply  so much the better for you lady although she seemed to know you and to know also that you would listen to her song unless my eyes deceived me which is not often that woman is an evildoer and a worker of magic like her dead husband van muyden a heretic a blasphemer of the holy church a traitor to our lord the emperor and one she added with a snarl with a price upon her head that before night will i hope be in black megs pocket then walking with long firm steps towards a fat man who seemed to be waiting for her the tall blackeyed pedlar passed with him into the throng where lysbeth lost sight of them  lysbeth watched them go and shivered to her knowledge she had never seen this woman before but she knew enough of the times they lived in to be sure that she was a spy of the priests already there were such creatures moving about in every gathering yes and in many a private place who were paid to obtain evidence against suspected heretics whether they won it by fair means or by foul mattered not provided they could find something and it need be little indeed to justify the inquisition in getting to its work  as for the other woman the mare doubtless she was one of those wicked outcasts accursed by god and man who were called heretics people who said dreadful things about the pope and the church and gods priests having been misled and stirred up thereto by a certain fiend in human form named luther lysbeth shuddered at the thought and crossed herself for in those days she was an excellent catholic yet the wanderer said that she had known her father so that she must be as well born as herselfand then that dreadful storyno she could not bear to think of it but of course heretics deserved all these things of that there could be no doubt whatever for had not her father confessor told her that thus alone might their souls be saved from the grasp of the evil one  the thought was comforting still lysbeth felt upset and not a little rejoiced when she saw dirk van goorl skating towards her accompanied by another young man also a cousin of her own on her mothers side who was destined in days to come to earn himself an immortal renownyoung pieter van de werff the two took off their bonnets to her dirk van goorl revealing in the act a head of fair hair beneath which his steady blue eyes shone in a rather thickset selfcontained face lysbeths temper always somewhat quick was ruffled and she showed it in her manner  i thought cousins that we were to meet at three and the kirk clock yonder has just chimed halfpast she said addressing them both but lookingnot too sweetlyat dirk van goorl  thats right cousin answered pieter a pleasantfaced and alert young man look at him scold him for he is to blame ever since a quarter past two have ii who must drive a sledge in the great race and am backed to winbeen waiting outside that factory in the snow but upon my honour he did not appear until seven minutes since yes we have done the whole distance in seven minutes and i call that very good skating  i thought as much said lysbeth dirk can only keep an appointment with a church bell or a stadhuis chandelier  it was not my fault broke in dirk in his slow voice i have my business to attend i promised to wait until the metal had cooled sufficiently and hot bronze takes no account of iceparties and sledge races  so i suppose that you stopped to blow on it cousin well the result is that being quite unescorted i have been obliged to listen to things which i did not wish to hear  what do you mean asked dirk taking fire at once  then she told them something of what the woman who called herself the mare had said to her adding doubtless the poor creature is a heretic and deserves all that has happened to her but it is dreadfully sad and i came here to enjoy myself not to be sad  between the two young men there passed a glance which was full of meaning but it was dirk who spoke the other more cautious remained silent  why do you say that cousin lysbeth he asked in a new voice a voice thick and eager why do you say that she deserves all that can happen to her i have heard of this poor creature who is called mother martha or the mare although i have never seen her myself she was nobleborn much better born than any of us three and very faironce they called her the lily of brusselswhen she was the vrouw van muyden and she has suffered dreadfully for one reason only because she and hers did not worship god as you worship him  as we worship him broke in van de werff with a cough  no answered dirk sullenly as our cousin lysbeth van hout worships him for that reason only they killed her husband and her little son and drove her mad so that she lives among the reeds of the haarlemer meer like a beast in its den yes they the spaniards and their spanish priests as i daresay that they will kill us also  dont you think that it is getting rather cold standing here interrupted pieter van de werff before she could answer look the sledge races are just beginning come cousin give me your hand and taking lysbeth by the arm he skated off into the throng followed at a distance by dirk and the servingmaid greta  cousin he whispered as he went this is not my place it is dirks place but i pray you as you love himi beg your pardonas you esteem a worthy relativedo not enter into a religious argument with him here in public where even the ice and sky are two great ears it is not safe little cousin i swear to you that it is not safe  in the centre of the mere the great event of the day the sledge races were now in progress as the competitors were many these must be run in heats the winners of each heat standing on one side to compete in the final contest now these victors had a pretty prerogative not unlike that accorded to certain dancers in the cotillion of modern days each driver of a sledge was bound to carry a passenger in the little car in front of him his own place being on the seat behind whence he directed the horse by means of reins supported upon a guiderod so fashioned that it lifted them above the head of the traveller in the car this passenger he could select from among the number of ladies who were present at the games unless indeed the gentleman in charge of her chose to deny him in set form namely by stepping forward and saying in the appointed phrase no for this happy hour she is mine  among the winners of these heats was a certain spanish officer the count don juan de montalvo who as it chanced in the absence on leave of his captain was at that date the commander of the garrison at leyden he was a man still young only about thirty indeed reported to be of noble birth and handsome in the usual castilian fashion that is to say he was tall of a graceful figure darkeyed strongfeatured with a somewhat humorous expression and of very good if exaggerated address as he had but recently come to leyden very little was known about this attractive cavalier beyond that he was well spoken of by the priests and according to report a favourite with the emperor also the ladies admired him much  for the rest everything about him was handsome like his person as might be expected in the case of a man reputed to be as rich as he was noble thus his sledge was shaped and coloured to resemble a great black wolf rearing itself up to charge the wooden head was covered in wolf skin and adorned by eyes of yellow glass and great fangs of ivory round the neck also ran a gilded collar hung with a silver shield whereon were painted the arms of its owner a knight striking the chains from off a captive christian saint and the motto of the montalvos trust to god and me his black horse too of the best breed imported from spain glittered in harness decorated with gilding and bore a splendid plume of dyed feathers rising from the headband  lysbeth happened to be standing near to the spot where this gallant had halted after his first victory she was in the company of dirk van goorl alonefor as he was the driver of one of the competing sledges her other cousin pieter van de werff had now been summoned away having nothing else to do at the moment she approached and not unnaturally admired this brilliant equipage although in truth it was the sledge and the horse rather than their driver which attracted her attention as for the count himself she knew him slightly having been introduced to and danced a measure with him at a festival given by a grandee of the town on that occasion he was courteous to her in the spanish fashion rather too courteous she thought but as this was the manner of castilian dons when dealing with burgher maidens she paid no more attention to the matter  the captain montalvo saw lysbeth among the throng and recognised her for he lifted his plumed hat and bowed to her with just that touch of condescension which in those days a spaniard showed when greeting one whom he considered his inferior in the sixteenth century it was understood that all the world were the inferiors to those whom god had granted to be born in spain the english who rated themselves at a valuation of their ownand were careful to announce the factalone excepted  an hour or so later after the last heat had been run a steward of the ceremonies called aloud to the remaining competitors to select their passengers and prepare for the final contest accordingly each jehu leaving his horse in charge of an attendant stepped up to some young lady who evidently was waiting for him and led her by the hand to his sledge while lysbeth was watching this ceremony with amusementfor these selections were always understood to show a strong preference on behalf of the chooser for the chosenshe was astonished to hear a welltrained voice addressing her and on looking up to see don juan de montalvo bowing almost to the ice  senora he said in castilian a tongue which lysbeth understood well enough although she only spoke it when obliged unless my ears deceived me i heard you admiring my horse and sledge now with the permission of your cavalier and he bowed courteously to dirk i name you as my passenger for the great race knowing that you will bring me fortune have i your leave senor  now if there was a people on earth whom dirk van goorl hated the spaniards were that people and if there lived a cavalier who he would prefer should not take his cousin lysbeth for a lonely drive that cavalier was the count juan de montalvo but as a young man dirk was singularly diffident and so easily confused that on the spur of the moment it was quite possible for a person of address to make him say what he did not mean thus on the present occasion when he saw this courtly spaniard bowing low to him a humble dutch tradesman he was overwhelmed and mumbled in reply certainly certainly  if a glance could have withered him without doubt dirk would immediately have been shrivelled to nothing to say that lysbeth was angry is too little for in truth she was absolutely furious she did not like this spaniard and hated the idea of a long interview with him alone moreover she knew that among her fellow townspeople there was a great desire that the count should not win this race which in its own fashion was the event of the year whereas if she appeared as his companion it would be supposed that she was anxious for his success lastlyand this was the chiefest sorealthough in theory the competitors had a right to ask any one to whom they took a fancy to travel in their sledges in practise they only sought the company of young women with whom they were on the best of terms and who were already warned of their intention  in an instant these thoughts flashed through her mind but all she did was to murmur something about the heer van goorl  has already given his consent like an unselfish gentleman broke in captain juan tendering her his hand  now without absolutely making a scene which then as today ladies considered an illbred thing to do there was no escape since half leyden gathered at these sledge choosings and many eyes were on her and the count therefore because she must lysbeth took the proferred hand and was led to the sledge catching as she passed to it through the throng more than one sour look from the men and more than one exclamation of surprise real or affected on the lips of the ladies of her acquaintance these manifestations however put her upon her mettle so determining that at least she would not look sullen or ridiculous she began to enter into the spirit of the adventure and smiled graciously while the captain montalvo wrapped a magnificent apron of wolf skins about her knees  when all was ready her charioteer took the reins and settled himself upon the little seat behind the sleigh which was then led into line by a soldier servant  where is the course senor lysbeth asked hoping that it would be a short one  but in this she was to be disappointed for he answered  up to the little quarkel mere round the island in the middle of it and back to this spot something over a league in all now senora speak to me no more at present but hold fast and have no fear for at least i drive well and my horse is surefooted and roughed for ice this is a race that i would give a hundred gold pieces to win since your countrymen who contend against me have sworn that i shall lose it and i tell you at once senora that grey horse will press me hard  following the direction of his glance lysbeths eye lit upon the next sledge it was small fashioned and painted to resemble a grey badger that silent stubborn and if molested savage brute which will not loose its grip until the head is hacked from off its body the horse which matched it well in colour was of flemish breed rather a rawboned animal with strong quarters and an ugly head but renowned in leyden for its courage and staying power what interested lysbeth most however was to discover that the charioteer was none other than pieter van de werff though now when she thought of it she remembered he had told her that his sledge was named the badger in his choice of passenger she noted too not without a smile that he showed his cautious character disdainful of any immediate glory so long as the end in view could be attained for there in the sleigh sat no fine young lady decked out in brave attire who might be supposed to look at him with tender eyes but a little fairhaired mate aged nine who was in fact his sister as he explained afterwards the rules provided that a lady passenger must be carried but said nothing of her age and weight  now the competitors eight of them were in a line and coming forward the master of the course in a voice that every one might hear called out the conditions of the race and the prize for which it was to be run a splendid glass goblet engraved with the crosskeys the arms of leyden this done after asking if all were ready he dropped a little flag whereon the horses were loosed and away they went  before a minute had passed forgetting all her doubts and annoyances lysbeth was lost in the glorious excitement of the moment like birds in the heavens cleaving the keen crisp air they sped forward over the smooth ice the gay throng vanished the dead reeds and stark bushes seemed to fly away from them the only sounds in their ears were the rushing of the wind the swish of the iron runners and the hollow tapping of the hooves of their galloping horses certain sledges drew ahead in the first burst but the wolf and the badger were not among these the count de montalvo was holding in his black stallion and as yet the grey flemish gelding looped along with a constrained and awkward stride when passing from the little mere they entered the straight of the canal these two were respectively fourth and fifth up the course they sped through a deserted snowclad country past the church of the village of alkemaade now half a mile or more away appeared the quarkel mere and in the centre of it the island which they must turn they reached it they were round it and when their faces were once more set homewards lysbeth noted that the wolf and the badger were third and fourth in the race some one having dropped behind half a mile more and they were second and third another half mile and they were first and second with perhaps a mile to go then the fight began  yard by yard the speed increased and yard by yard the black stallion drew ahead now in front of them lay a furlong or more of bad ice encumbered with lumps of frozen snow that had not been cleared away which caused the sleigh to shake and jump as it struck lysbeth looked round  the badger is coming up she said  montalvo heard and for the first time laid his whip upon the haunches of his horse which answered gallantly but still the badger came up the grey was the stronger beast and had begun to put out his strength presently his ugly head was behind them for lysbeth felt the breath from his nostrils blowing on her and saw their steam then it was past for the steam blew back into her face yes and she could see the eager eyes of the child in the grey sledge now they were neck and neck and the rough ice was done with six hundred yards away not more lay the goal and all about them outside the line of the course were swift skaters travelling so fast that their heads were bent forward and down to within three feet of the ice  van de werff called to his horse and the grey began to gain montalvo lashed the stallion and once more they passed him but the black was failing and he saw it for lysbeth heard him curse in spanish then of a sudden after a cunning glance at his adversary the count pulled upon the right rein and a shrill voice rose upon the air the voice of the little girl in the other sledge  take care brother it cried he will overthrow us  true enough in another moment the black would have struck the grey sideways lysbeth saw van de werff rise from his seat and throw his weight backward dragging the grey on to his haunches by an inchnot morethe wolf sleigh missed the gelding indeed one runner of it struck his hoof and the high wood work of the side brushed and cut his nostril  a foul a foul yelled the skaters and it was over once more they were speeding forward but now the black had a lead of at least ten yards for the grey must find his stride again they were in the straight the course was lined with hundreds of witnesses and from the throats of every one of them arose a great cry or rather two cries  the spaniard the spaniard wins said the first cry that was answered by another and a deeper roar  no hollander the hollander the hollander comes up  then in the midst of the fierce excitementbred of the excitement perhapssome curious spell fell upon the mind of lysbeth the race its details its objects its surroundings faded away these physical things were gone and in place of them was present a dream a spiritual interpretation such as the omens and influences of the times she lived in might well inspire what did she seem to see  she saw the spaniard and the hollander striving for victory but not a victory of horses she saw the black spanish wolf at first triumphant outmatch the netherland badger still the badger the dogged dutch badger held on  who would win the fierce beast or the patient beast who would be the master in this fight there was death in it look the whole snow was red the roofs of leyden were red and red the heavens in the deep hues of the sunset they seemed bathed in blood while about her the shouts of the backers and factions transformed themselves into a fierce cry as of battling peoples all voices mingled in that cryvoices of hope of agony and of despair but she could not interpret them something told her that the interpretation and the issue were in the mind of god alone  perhaps she swooned perhaps she slept and dreamed this dream perhaps the sharp rushing air overcame her at the least lysbeths eyes closed and her mind gave way when they opened and it returned again their sledge was rushing past the winning post but in front of it travelled another sledge drawn by a gaunt grey horse which galloped so hard that its belly seemed to lie upon the ice a horse driven by a young man whose face was set like steel and whose lips were as the lips of a trap  could that be the face of her cousin pieter van de werff and if so what passion had stamped that strange seal thereon she turned herself in her seat and looked at him who drove her  was this a man or was it a spirit escaped from doom blessed mother of christ what a countenance the eyeballs starting and upturned nothing but the white of them to be seen the lips curled and between two lines of shining fangs the lifted points of the mustachios touching the high cheekbones nono it was neither a spirit nor a man she knew now what it was it was the very type and incarnation of the spanish wolf  once more she seemed to faint while in her ears there rang the crythe hollander outstayed outstayed conquered is the accursed spaniard  then lysbeth knew that it was over and again the faintness overpowered her    chapter ii  she who buyspays  when lysbeths mind recovered from its confusion she found herself still in the sledge and beyond the borders of the crowd that was engaged in rapturously congratulating the winner drawn up alongside of the wolf was another sleigh of plain make and harnessed to it a heavy flemish horse this vehicle was driven by a spanish soldier with whom sat a second soldier apparently of the rank of sergeant there was no one else near already people in the netherlands had learnt to keep their distance from spanish soldiers  if your excellency would come now the sergeant was saying this little matter can be settled without any further trouble  where is she asked montalvo  not more than a mile or so away near the place called steene veld  tie her up in the snow to wait till tomorrow morning my horse is tired and it may save us trouble he began then added after glancing back at the crowd behind him and next at lysbeth no i will come  perhaps the count did not wish to listen to condolences on his defeat or perhaps he desired to prolong the teteatete with his fair passenger at any rate without further hesitation he struck his weary horse with the whip causing it to amble forward somewhat stiffly but at a good pace  where are we going senor asked lysbeth anxiously the race is over and i must seek my friends  your friends are engaged in congratulating the victor lady he answered in his suave and courteous voice and i cannot leave you alone upon the ice do not trouble this is only a little matter of business which will scarcely take a quarter of an hour and once more he struck the horse urging it to a better speed  lysbeth thought of remonstrating she thought even of springing from the sledge but in the end she did neither to seem to continue the drive with her cavalier would she determined look more natural and less absurd than to attempt a violent escape from him she was certain that he would not put her down merely at her request something in his manner told her so and though she had no longing for his company it was better than being made ridiculous before half the inhabitants of leyden moreover the position was no fault of hers it was the fault of dirk van goorl who should have been present to take her from the sledge  as they drove along the frozen moat montalvo leant forward and began to chat about the race expressing regret at having lost it but using no angry or bitter words could this be the man wondered lysbeth as she listened whom she had seen deliberately attempt to overthrow his adversary in a foul heedless of dishonour or of who might be killed by the shock could this be the man whose face just now had looked like the face of a devil had these things happened indeed or was it not possible that her fancy confused with the excitement and the speed at which they were travelling had deceived her certainly it seemed to have been overcome at last for she could not remember the actual finish of the race or how they got clear of the shouting crowd  while she was still wondering thus replying from time to time to montalvo in monosyllables the sledge in front of them turned the corner of one of the eastern bastions and came to a halt the place where it stopped was desolate and lonely for the town being in a state of peace no guard was mounted on the wall nor could any living soul be found upon the snowy waste that lay beyond the moat at first indeed lysbeth was able to see nobody at all for by now the sun had gone down and her eyes were not accustomed to the increasing light of the moon presently however she caught sight of a knot of people standing on the ice in a recess or little bay of the moat and half hidden by a fringe of dead reeds  montalvo saw also and halted his horse within three paces of them the people were five in number three spanish soldiers and two women lysbeth looked and with difficulty stifled a cry of surprise and fear for she knew the women the tall dark person with lowering eyes was none other than the capseller and spanish spy black meg and she who crouched there upon the ice her arms bound behind her her grizzled locks torn loose by some rough hand trailing on the snowsurely it was the woman who called herself the mare and who that very afternoon spoke to her saying that she had known her father and cursing the spaniards and their inquisition what were they doing here instantly an answer leapt into her mind for she remembered black megs wordsthat there was a price upon this heretics head which before nightfall would be in her pocket and why was there a square hole cut in the ice immediately in front of the captive could it beno that was too horrible  well officer broke in montalvo addressing the sergeant in a quiet wearied voice what is all this about set out your case  excellency replied the man it is a very simple matter this creature here so that woman is ready to take oath and he pointed to black meg is a notorious heretic who has already been condemned to death by the holy office and whose husband a learned man who painted pictures and studied the stars was burnt on a charge of witchcraft and heresy two years ago at brussels but she managed to escape the stake and since then has lived as a vagrant hiding in the islands of the haarlemer meer and it is suspected working murder and robbery on any of spanish blood whom she can catch now she has been caught herself and identified and of course the sentence being in full force against her can be dealt with at once on your excellencys command indeed it would not have been necessary that you should be troubled about the thing at all had it not been that this worthy woman and again he pointed to black meg who was the one who waylaid her pulled her down and held her till we came requires your certificate in order that she may claim the reward from the treasurer of the holy inquisition therefore you will be asked to certify that this is indeed the notorious heretic commonly known as martha the mare but whose other name i forget after which if you will please to withdraw we will see to the rest  you mean that she will be taken to the prison to be dealt with by the holy office queried montalvo  not exactly excellency answered the sergeant with a discreet smile and a cough the prison i am told is quite full but she may start for the prison andthere seems to be a hole in the ice into which since satan leads the footsteps of such people astray this heretic might chance to fallor throw herself  what is the evidence asked montalvo  then black meg stood forward and with the rapidity and unction of a spy poured out her tale she identified the woman with one whom she had known who was sentenced to death by the inquisition and escaped and after giving other evidence ended by repeating the conversation which she had overheard between the accused and lysbeth that afternoon  you accompanied me in a fortunate hour senora van hout said the captain gaily for now to satisfy myself as i wish to be just and do not trust these paid hags and he nodded towards black meg i must ask you upon your oath before god whether or no you confirm that womans tale and whether or no this very ugly person named the mare called down curses upon my people and the holy office answer and quickly if you please senora for it grows cold here and my horse is beginning to shiver  then for the first time the mare raised her head dragging at her hair which had become frozen to the ice until she tore it free  lysbeth van hout she cried in shrill piercing tones would you to please your spanish lover bring your fathers playmate to her death the spanish horse is cold and cannot stay but the poor netherland mareah she may be thrust beneath the blue ice and bide there till her bones rot at the bottom of the moat you have sought the spaniards you whose blood should have warned you against them and i tell you that it shall cost you dear but if you say this word they seek then it shall cost you everything not only the body but the spirit also woe to you lysbeth van hout if you cut me off before my work is done i fear not death nay i welcome it but i tell you i have work to do before i die  now in an agony of mind lysbeth turned and looked at montalvo  the count was a man of keen perceptions and understood it all leaning forward his arm resting on the back of the sledge as though to contemplate the prisoner he whispered into lysbeths ear so low that no one else could hear his words  senora he said i have no wishes in this matter i do not desire to drown that poor mad woman but if you confirm the spys story drown she must at present i am not satisfied so everything turns upon your evidence i do not know what passed between you this afternoon and personally i do not care only if you should chance to have no clear recollection of the matter alleged i must make one or two little stipulationsvery little ones let me see they arethat you will spend the rest of this evenings fete in my company further that whenever i choose to call upon you your door will be open to me though i must remind you that on three occasions already when i have wished to pay my respects it has been shut  lysbeth heard and understood if she would save this womans life she must expose herself to the attentions of the spaniard which she desired least of anything in the world more speaking upon her oath in the presence of god she must utter a dreadful lie she who as yet had never lied for thirty seconds or more she thought staring round her with anguished eyes while the scene they fell on sank into her soul in such fashion that never till her deaths day did she forget its aspect  the mare spoke no more she only knelt searching her face with a stern and wondering glance a little to the right stood black meg glaring at her sullenly for the bloodmoney was in danger behind the prisoner were two of the soldiers one patting his hand to his face to hide a yawn while the other beat his breast to warm himself the third soldier who was placed somewhat in front stirred the surface of the hole with the shaft of his halbert to break up the thin film of ice which was forming over it while montalvo himself still leaning sideways and forwards watched her eyes with an amused and cynical expression and over all over the desolate snows and gabled roofs of the town behind over the smooth blue ice the martyr and the murderers over the gay sledge and the furwrapped girl who sat within it fell the calm light of the moon through a silence broken only by the beating of her heart and now and again by the sigh of a frostwind breathing among the rushes  well senora asked montalvo if you have sufficiently reflected shall i administer the oath in the form provided  administer it she said hoarsely  so descending from the sledge he stood in front of lysbeth and lifting his cap repeated the oath to her an oath strong enough to blast her soul if she swore to it with false intent  in the name of god the son and of his blessed mother you swear he asked  i swear she answered  good senora now listen to me did you meet that woman this afternoon  yes i met her on the ice  and did she in your hearing utter curses upon the government and the holy church and call upon you to assist in driving the spaniards from the land as this spy whom i believe is called black meg has borne witness  no said lysbeth  i am afraid that is not quite enough senora i may have misquoted the exact words did the woman say anything of the sort  for one second lysbeth hesitated then she caught sight of the victims watching speculative eyes and remembered that this crazed and broken creature once had been a child whom her father had kissed and played with and that the crime of which she was accused was that she had escaped from death at the stake  the water is cold to die in the mare said in a meditative voice as though she were thinking aloud  then why did you run away from the warm fire heretic witch jeered black meg  now lysbeth hesitated no longer but again answered in a monosyllable no  then what did she do or say senora  she said she had known my father who used to play with her when she was a child and begged for alms that is all then that woman came up and she ran away whereon the woman said there was a price upon her head and that she meant to have the money  it is a lie screamed black meg in fierce strident tones  if that person will not be silent silence her said montalvo addressing the sergeant i am satisfied he went on that there is no evidence at all against the prisoner except the story of a spy who says she believes her to be a vagrant heretic of bad character who escaped from the stake several years ago in the neighbourhood of brussels whither it is scarcely worth while to send to inquire about the matter so that charge may drop there remains the question as to whether or no the prisoner uttered certain words this afternoon which if she did utter them are undoubtedly worthy of the death that under my authority as acting commandant of this town i have power to inflict this question i foresaw and that is why i asked the senora to whom the woman is alleged to have spoken the words to accompany me here to give evidence she has done so and her evidence on oath as against the statement of a spy woman not on oath is that no such words were spoken this being so as the senora is a good catholic whom i have no reason to disbelieve i order the release of the prisoner whom for my part i take for nothing more than a crazy and harmless wanderer  at least you will detain her till i can prove that she is the heretic who escaped from the stake near brussels shouted black meg  i will do nothing of the sort the prison here is overfull already untie her arms and let her go  the soldiers obeyed wondering somewhat and the mare scrambled to her feet for a moment she stood looking at her deliverer then crying we shall met again lysbeth van hout suddenly she turned and sped up a dyke at extraordinary speed in a few seconds there was nothing to be seen of her but a black spot upon the white landscape and presently she had vanished altogether  gallop as you will mare i shall catch you yet screamed black meg after her and you too my pretty little liar who have cheated me out of a dozen florins wait till you are up before the inquisition as a hereticfor thats where youll end no fine spanish lover will save you then so you have gone to the spanish have you and thrown over your fatfaced burgher well you will have enough of spaniards before you have done with them i can tell you  twice had montalvo tried to stop this flood of furious eloquence which had become personal and might prove prejudicial to his interests but without avail now he adopted other measures  seize her he shouted to two of the soldiers thats it now hold her under water in that hole till i tell you to let her up again  they obeyed but it took all three of them to carry out the order for black meg fought and bit like a wild cat until at last she was thrust into the icy moat head downwards when at length she was released soaked and shivering she crept off silently enough but the look of fury which she cast at montalvo and lysbeth drew from the captain a remark that perhaps it would have been as well to have kept her under water two minutes longer  now sergeant he added in a genial voice it is a cold night and this has been a troublesome business for a feastday so heres something for you and your watch to warm yourselves with when you go off duty and he handed him what in those days was a very handsome present by the way he said as the men saluted him gratefully perhaps you will do me a favour it is only to take this black horse of mine to his stable and harness that grey trooper nag to the sledge instead as i wish to go the round of the moat and my beast is tired  again the men saluted and set to work to change the horses whereon lysbeth guessing her cavaliers purpose turned as though to fly away for her skates were still upon her feet but he was watching  senora he said in a quiet voice i think that you gave me the promise of your company for the rest of this evening and i am certain he added with a slight bow that you are a lady whom nothing would induce to tell an untruth had i not been sure of that i should scarcely have accepted your evidence so readily just now  lysbeth winced visibly i thought senor that you were going to return to the fete  i do not remember saying so senora and as a matter of fact i have pickets to visit do not be afraid the drive is charming in this moonlight and afterwards perhaps you will extend your hospitality so far as to ask me to supper at your house  still she hesitated dismay written on her face  jufvrouw lysbeth he said in an altered voice in my country we have a homely proverb which says she who buys pays you have bought andthe goods have been delivered do you understand ah allow me to have the pleasure of arranging those furs i knew that you were the soul of honour and were butshall we say teasing me otherwise had you really wished to go of course you would have skated away just now while you had the opportunity that is why i gave it you as naturally i should not desire to detain you against your will  lysbeth heard and was aghast for this mans cleverness overwhelmed her at every step he contrived to put her in the wrong moreover she was crushed by the sense that he had justice on his side she had bought and she must pay why had she bought not for any advantage of her own but from an impulse of human pityto save a fellow creatures life and why should she have perjured herself so deeply in order to save that life she was a catholic and had no sympathy with such people probably this person was an anabaptist one of that dreadful sect which practised nameless immoralities and ran stripped through the streets crying that they were the naked truth was it then because the creature had declared that she had known her father in her childhood to some extent yes but was not there more behind had she not been influenced by the womans invocation about the spaniards of which the true meaning came home to her during that dreadful sledge race at the moment indeed when she saw the satanic look upon the face of montalvo it seemed to her that this was so though at the time she had not understood it it seemed to her that she was not a free agent that some force pushed her forward which she could neither control nor understand  moreoverand this was the worst of itshe felt that little good could come of her sacrifice or that if good came at least it would not be to her or hers now she was as a fish in a net though why it was worth this brilliant spaniards while to snare her she could not understand for she forgot that she was beautiful and a woman of property well to save the blood of another she had bought and in her own blood and happiness or in that of those dear to her assuredly she must pay however cruel and unjust might be the price  such were the thoughts that passed through lysbeths mind as the strong flemish gelding lumbered forward dragging the sledge at the same steady pace over rough ice and smooth and all the while montalvo behind her was chatting pleasantly about this matter and that telling her of the orange groves in spain of the court of the emperor charles of adventures in the french wars and many other things to which conversation she made such answer as courtesy demanded and no more what would dirk think she was wondering and her cousin pieter van de werff whose good opinion she valued and all the gossips of leyden she only prayed that they might not have missed her or at least that they took it for granted that she had gone home  on this point however she was soon destined to be undeceived for presently trudging over the snowcovered ice and carrying his useless skates in his hand they met a young man whom she knew as dirks fellow apprentice on seeing them he stopped in front of the sledge in such a position that the horse a steady and a patient animal pulled up of its own accord  is the jufvrouw lysbeth van hout there he asked anxiously  yes she replied but before she could say more montalvo broke in inquiring what might be the matter  nothing he answered except that she was lost and dirk van goorl my friend send me to look for her this way while he took the other  indeed then noble sir perhaps you will find the heer dirk van goorl and tell him that the senora his cousin is merely enjoying an evening drive and that if he comes to her house in an hours time he will find her safe and sound and with her myself the count juan de montalvo whom she has honoured with an invitation to supper  then before the astonished messenger could answer before indeed lysbeth could offer any explanation of his words montalvo lashed up the horse and left him standing on the moat bewildered his cap off and scratching his head  after this they proceeded on a journey which seemed to lysbeth almost interminable when the circuit of the walls was finished montalvo halted at one of the shut gates and calling to the guard within summoned them to open this caused delay and investigation for at first the sergeant of the guard would not believe that it was his acting commandant who spoke without  pardon excellency he said when he had inspected him with a lantern but i did not think that you would be going the rounds with a lady in your sledge and holding up the light the man took a long look at lysbeth grinning visibly as he recognised her  ah he is a gay bird the captain a very gay bird and its a pretty dutch dickey he is teaching to pipe now she heard him call to a comrade as he closed the heavy gates behind their sleigh  then followed more visits to other military posts in the town and with each visit a further explanation all this while the count montalvo uttered no word beyond those of ordinary compliment and ventured on no act of familiarity his conversation and demeanour indeed remaining perfectly courteous and respectful so far as it went this was satisfactory but at length there came a moment when lysbeth felt that she could bear the position no longer  senor she said briefly take me home i grow faint  with hunger doubtless he interrupted well by heaven so do i but my dear lady as you are aware duty must be attended to and after all you may have found some interest in accompanying me on a tour of the pickets at night i know your people speak roughly of us spanish soldiers but i hope that after this you will be able to bear testimony to their discipline although it is a fete day you will be my witness that we have not found a man off duty or the worse for drink here you he called to a soldier who stood up to salute him follow me to the house of the jufvrouw lysbeth van hout where i sup and lead this sledge back to my quarters    chapter iii  montalvo wins a trick  turning up the bree straat then as now perhaps the finest in the town of leyden montalvo halted his horse before a substantial house fronted with three roundheaded gables of which the largestthat over the entrance in the middlewas shaped into two windows with balconies this was lysbeths house which had been left to her by her father where until such time as she should please to marry she dwelt with her aunt clara van ziel the soldier whom he had summoned having run to the horses head montalvo leapt from his drivers seat to assist the lady to alight at the moment lysbeth was occupied with wild ideas of swift escape but even if she could make up her mind to try it there was an obstacle which her thoughtful cavalier had foreseen  jufvrouw van hout he said as he pulled up do you remember that you are still wearing skates  it was true though in her agitation she had forgotten all about them and the fact put sudden flight out of the question she could not struggle into her own house walking on the sides of her feet like the tame seal which old fisherman hans had brought from northern seas it would be too ridiculous and the servants would certainly tell the story all about the town better for a while longer to put up with the company of this odious spaniard than to become a laughing stock in an attempt to fly besides even if she found herself on the other side of it could she shut the door in his face would her promise let her and would he consent  yes she answered briefly i will call my servant  then for the first time the count became complimentary in a dignified spanish manner  let no baseborn menial hold the foot which it is an honour for an hidalgo of spain to touch i am your servant he said and resting one knee on the snowcovered step he waited  again there was nothing to be done so lysbeth must needs thrust out her foot from which very delicately and carefully he unstrapped the skate  what jack can bear jill must put up with muttered lysbeth to herself as she advanced the other foot just at that moment however the door behind them began to open  she who buys murmured montalvo as he commenced on the second set of straps then the door swung wide and the voice of dirk van goorl was heard saying in a tone of relief  yes sure enough it is she tante clara and some one is taking off her boots  skates senor skates interrupted montalvo glancing backward over his shoulder then added in a whisper as he bent once more to his task ahempays you will introduce me is it not so i think it will be less awkward for you  so as flight was impossible for he held her by the foot and an instinct told her that especially to the man she loved the only thing to do was to make light of the affair lysbeth said  dirk cousin dirk i think you knowthis isthe honourable captain the count juan de montalvo  ah it is the senor van goorl said montalvo pulling off the skate and rising from his knee which from his excess of courtesy was now wet through senor allow me to return to you safe and sound the fair lady of whom i have robbed you for a while  for a while captain blurted dirk why from first to last she has been gone nearly four hours and a fine state we have been in about her  that will all be explained presently senorat supper to which the jufvrouw has been so courteous as to ask me then aside and below his breath again the ominous word of reminderpays most happily your cousins presence was the means of saving a fellowcreatures life but as i have said the tale is long senorpermit and in another second lysbeth found herself walking down her own hall upon the arm of the spaniard while dirk her aunt and some guests followed obediently behind  now montalvo knew that his difficulties were over for that evening at any rate since he had crossed the threshold and was a guest  half unconsciously lysbeth guided him to the balconied sitkamer on the first floor which in our day would answer to the drawingroom here several other of her friends were gathered for it had been arranged that the icefestival should end with a supper as rich as the house could give to these too she must introduce her cavalier who bowed courteously to each in turn then she escaped but as she passed him distinctly she could swear did she see his lips shape themselves to the hateful wordpays  when she reached her chamber so great was lysbeths wrath and indignation that almost she choked with it till again reason came to her aid and with reason a desire to carry the thing off as well as might be so she told her maid greta to robe her in her best garment and to hang about her neck the famous collar of pearls which her father had brought from the east that was the talk and envy of half the women in leyden on her head too she placed the cap of lovely lace which had been a wedding gift to her mother by her grandmother the old dame who wove it then she added such golden ornaments as it was customary for women of her class of wear and descended to the gathering room  meanwhile montalvo had not been idle taking dirk aside and pleading his travelworn condition he had prayed him to lead him to some room where he might order his dress and person dirk complied though with an ill grace but so pleasant did montalvo make himself during those few minutes that before he ushered him back to the company in some way dirk found himself convinced that this particular spaniard was not as the saying went as black as his mustachios he felt almost sure too although he had not yet found time to tell him the details of it that there was some excellent reason to account for his having carried off the adorable lysbeth during an entire afternoon and evening  it is true that there still remained the strange circumstance of the attempted foul of his cousin van de werffs sledge in the great race but after all why should there not be some explanation of this also it had happened if it did happen at quite a distance from the winning post when there were few people to see what passed indeed now that he came to think of it the only real evidence on the matter was that of his cousin the little girl passenger since van de werff himself had brought no actual accusation against his opponent  shortly after they returned to the company it was announced that supper had been served whereon ensued a pause it was broken by montalvo who stepping forward offered his hand to lysbeth saying in a voice that all could hear  lady my companion of the race permit the humblest representative of the greatest monarch in the world to have an honour which doubtless that monarch would be glad to claim  that settled the matter for as the acting commandant of the spanish garrison of leyden had chosen to refer to his official position it was impossible to question his right of precedence over a number of folk who although prominent in their way were but unennobled netherlander burghers  lysbeth indeed did find courage to point to a rather flurried and spasmodic lady with grey hair who was fanning herself as though the season were july and wondering whether the cook would come up to the grand spaniards expectations and to murmur my aunt but she got no further for the count instantly added in a low voice  doubtless comes next in the direct line but unless my education has been neglected the heiress of the house who is of age goes before the collateralhowever aged  by this time they were through the door so it was useless to argue the point further and again lysbeth felt herself overmatched and submitted in another minute they had passed down the stairs entered the dining hall and were seated side by side at the head of the long table of which the foot was occupied presently by dirk van goorl and her aunt who was also his cousin the widow clara van ziel  there was a silence while the domestics began their service of which montalvo took opportunity to study the room the table and the guests it was a fine room panelled with german oak and lighted sufficiently if not brilliantly by two hanging brass chandeliers of the famous flemish workmanship in each of which were fixed eighteen of the best candles while on the sideboards were branch candlesticks also of worked brass the light thus provided was supplemented by that from the great fire of peat and old ships timber which burned in a wide bluetiled fireplace half way down the chamber throwing its reflections upon many a flagon and bowl of cunningly hammered silver that adorned the table and the sideboards  the company was of the same character as the furniture handsome and solid people of means every man and woman of them accumulated by themselves or their fathers in the exercise of the honest and profitable trade whereof at this time the netherlands had a practical monopoly  i have made no mistake thought montalvo to himself as he surveyed the room and its occupants my little neighbours necklace alone is worth more cash than ever i had the handling of and the plate would add up handsomely well before very long i hope to be in a position to make its inventory then having first crossed himself devoutly he fell to upon a supper that was well worth his attention even in a land noted for the luxury of its food and wines and the superb appetites of those who consumed them  it must not be supposed however that the gallant captain allowed eating to strangle conversation on the contrary finding that his hostess was in no talkative mood he addressed himself to his fellow guests chatting with them pleasantly upon every convenient subject among these guests was none other than pieter van de werff his conqueror in that afternoons conquest upon whose watchful and suspicious reserve he brought all his batteries to bear  first he congratulated pieter and lamented his own illluck and this with great earnestness for as a matter of fact he had lost much more money on the event than he could afford to pay then he praised the grey horse and asked if he was for sale offering his own black in part exchange  a good nag he said but one that i do not wish to conceal has his faults which must be taken into consideration if it comes to the point of putting a price upon him for instance mynheer van de werff you may have noticed the dreadful position in which the brute put me towards the end of the race there are certain things that this horse always shies at and one of them is a red cloak now i dont know if you saw that a girl in a red cloak suddenly appeared on the bank in an instant the beast was round and you may imagine what my feelings were being in charge of your fair kinswoman for i thought to a certainty that we should be over what is more it quite spoilt my chance of the race for after he has shied like that the black turns sulky and wont let himself go  when lysbeth heard this amazing explanation remembering the facts she gasped and yet now that she came to think of it a girl in a red cloak did appear near them at the moment and the horse did whip round as though it had shied violently was it possible she wondered that the captain had not really intended to foul the badger sledge  meanwhile van de werff was answering in his slow voice apparently he accepted montalvos explanation at least he said that he too saw the redcloaked girl and was glad that nothing serious had come of the mischance as regarded the proposed deal he should be most happy to go into it upon the lines mentioned as the grey although a very good horse was aged and he thought the barb one of the most beautiful animals that he had ever seen at this point as he had not the slightest intention of parting with his valuable charger at any rate on such terms montalvo changed the subject  at length when men and for the matter of that women too had well eaten and the beautiful tall flemish glasses not for the first time were replenished with the best rhenish or spanish wines montalvo taking advantage of a pause in the conversation rose and said that he wished to claim the privilege of a stranger among them and propose a toast namely the health of his late adversary pieter van de werff  at this the audience applauded for they were all very proud of the young mans success and some of them had won money over him still more did they applaud being great judges of culinary matters when the spaniard began his speech by an elegant tribute to the surpassing excellence of the supper rarely he assured them and especially did he assure the honourable widow van ziel who blushed all over with pleasure at his compliments and fanned herself with such vigour that she upset dirks wine over his new tunic cut in the brussels style the fame of whose skill in such matters had travelled so far as the hague for he had heard of it there himselfrarely even in the courts of kings and emperors or at the tables of popes and archbishops had he eaten food so exquisitely cooked or drunk wines of a better vintage  then passing on to the subject of his speech van de werff he toasted him and his horse and his little sister and his sledge in really wellchosen and appropriate terms not by any means overdoing it for he confessed frankly that his defeat was a bitter disappointment to him especially as every solder in the camp had expected him to win andhe was afraidbacked him for more than they could afford also incidentally so that every one might be well acquainted with it he retold the story of the girl with the red cloak next suddenly dropping his voice and adopting a quieter manner he addressed himself to the aunt clara and the wellbeloved heer dirk saying that he owed them both an apology which he must take this opportunity to make for having detained the lady at his right during so unreasonable a time that afternoon when however they had heard the facts they would he was sure blame him no longer especially if he told them that this breach of good manners had been the means of saving a human life  immediately after the race he explained one of his sergeants had found him out to tell him that a woman suspected of certain crimes against life and property and believed to be a notorious escaped witch or heretic had been captured asking for reasons which he need not trouble them with that he would deal with the case at once this woman also so said the man had been heard that every afternoon to make use of the most horrible the most traitorous and blaspheming language to a lady of leyden the jufvrouw lysbeth van hout indeed as was deposed by a certain spy named black meg who had overheard the conversation  now went on montalvo as he knew well every man and woman in that room would share his horror of traitorous and blasphemous hereticshere most of the company crossed themselves especially those who were already secret adherents of the new religion still even heretics had a right to a fair trial at least he who although a soldier by profession was a man who honestly detested unnecessary bloodshed held that opinion also long experience taught him great mistrust of the evidence of informers who had a money interest in the conviction of the accused lastly it did not seem well to him that the name of a young and noble lady should be mixed up in such a business as they knew under the recent edicts his powers in these cases were absolute indeed in his official capacity he was ordered at once to consign any suspected of anabaptism or other forms of heresy to be dealt with by the appointed courts and in the case of people who had escaped to cause them on satisfactory proof of their identity to be executed instantly without further trial under these circumstances fearing that did the lady knew his purpose she might take fright he had he confessed resorted to artifice as he was very anxious both for her sake and in the interest of justice that she should bear testimony in the matter so he asked her to accompany him on a short drive while he attended to a business affair a request to which she had graciously assented  friends he went on in a still more solemn voice the rest of my story is short indeed i do congratulate myself on the decision that i took for when confronted with the prisoner our young and honourable hostess was able upon oath to refute the story of the spy with the result that i in my turn was to save an unfortunate and as i believe a halfcrazed creature from an immediate and a cruel death is it not so lady and helpless in the net of circumstance not knowing indeed what else to do lysbeth bowed her head in assent  i think concluded montalvo that after this explanation what may have appeared to be a breach of manners will be forgiven i have only one other word to add my position is peculiar i am an official here and i speak boldly among friends taking the risk that any of you present will use what i say against me which for my part i do not believe although there is no better catholic and no truer spaniard in the netherlands i have been accused of showing too great a sympathy with your people and of dealing too leniently with those who have incurred the displeasure of our holy church in the cause of right and justice i am willing to bear such aspersions still this is a slanderous world a world in which truth does not always prevail therefore although i have told you nothing but the bare facts i do suggest in the interests of your hostessin my own humble interest who might be misrepresented and i may add in the interest of every one present at this boardthat it will perhaps be well that the details of the story which i have had the honour of telling you should not be spread aboutthat they should in fact find a grave within these walls friends do you agree  then moved by a common impulse and by a common if a secret fear with the single exception of lysbeth every person present yes even the cautious and farseeing young van de werff echoed we agree  friends said montalvo those simple words carry to my mind conviction deep as any vow however solemn deep if that were possible as did the oath of your hostess upon the faith of which i felt myself justified in acquitting the poor creature who was alleged to be an escaped heretic then with a courteous and allembracing bow montalvo sat down  what a good man what a delightful man murmured aunt clara to dirk in the buzz of conversation which ensued  yes yes cousin but  and what discrimination he has what taste did you notice what he said about the cooking  i heard something but  it is true that folk have told me that my capon stewed in milk such as we had tonightwhy lad what is the matter with your doublet you fidget me by continually rubbing at it  you have upset the red wine over it that is all answered dirk sulkily it is spoiled  and little loss either to tell you the truth dirk i never saw a coat worse cut you young men should learn in the matter of clothes from the spanish gentlemen look at his excellency the count montalvo for instance  see here aunt broke in dirk with suppressed fury i think i have heard enough about spaniards and the captain montalvo for one night first of all he spirits off lysbeth and is absent with her for four hours then he invites himself to supper and places himself at the head of the table with her setting me down to the dullest meal i ever ate at the other end  cousin dirk said aunt clara with dignity your temper has got the better of your manners certainly you might learn courtesy as well as dress even from so humble a person as a spanish hidalgo and commander then she rose from the table addingcome lysbeth if you are ready let us leave these gentlemen to their wine  after the ladies had gone the supper went on merrily in those days nearly everybody drank too much liquor at any rate at feasts and this company was no exception even montalvo his game being won and the strain on his nerves relaxed partook pretty freely and began to talk in proportion to his potations still so clever was the man that in his cups he yet showed a method for his conversation revealed a sympathy with netherlander grievances and a tolerance of view in religious matters rarely displayed by a spaniard  from such questions they drifted into a military discussion and montalvo challenged by van de werff who as it happened had not drunk too much wine explained how were he officer in command he would defend leyden from attack by an overwhelming force very soon van de werff saw that he was a capable soldier who had studied his profession and being himself a capable civilian with a thirst for knowledge pressed the argument from point to point  and suppose he asked at length that the city were starving and still untaken so that its inhabitants must either fall into the hands of the enemy or burn the place over their heads what would you do then  then mynheer if i were a small man i should yield to the clamour of the starving folk and surrender  and if you were a big man captain  if i were a big manah if i were a big man why theni should cut the dykes and let the sea beat once more against the walls of leyden an army cannot live in salt water mynheer  that would drown out the farmers and ruin the land for twenty years  quite so mynheer but when the corn has to be saved who thinks of spoiling the straw  i follow you senor your proverb is good although i have never heard it  many good things come from spain mynheer including this red wine one more glass with you for if you will allow me to say it you are a man worth meeting over a beakeror a blade  i hope that you will always retain the same opinion of me answered van de werff as he drank at the trencher or in the trenches  then pieter went home and before he slept that night made careful notes of all the spaniards suggested military dispositions both of attackers and attacked writing underneath them the proverb about the corn and the straw there existed no real reason why he should have done so as he was only a civilian engaged in business but pieter van de werff chanced to be a provident young man who knew many things might happen which could not precisely be foreseen as it fell out in after years a time came when he was able to put montalvos advice to good use all readers of the history of the netherlands know how the burgomaster pieter van de werff saved leyden from the spanish  as for dirk van goorl he sought his lodging rather tipsy and arminarm with none other than captain the count don juan de montalvo    chapter iv  three wakings  there were three persons in leyden whose reflections when they awoke on the morning after the sledge race are not without interest at any rate to the student of their history first there was dirk van goorl whose work made an early riser of himto say nothing of a splitting headache which on this morning called him into consciousness just as the clock in the bell tower was chiming halfpast four now there are few things more depressing than to be awakened by a bad headache at halfpast four in the black frost of a winter dawn yet as dirk lay and thought a conviction took hold of him that his depression was not due entirely to the headache or to the cold  one by one he recalled the events of yesterday first he had been late for this appointment with lysbeth which evidently vexed her then the captain montalvo had swooped down and carried her away as a hawk bears off a chicken under the very eyes of the henwife while hedonkey that he wascould find no words in which to protest next thinking it his duty to back the sledge wherein lysbeth rode although it was driven by a spaniard he had lost ten florins on that event which being a thrifty young man did not at all please him the rest of the fete he had spent hunting for lysbeth who mysteriously vanished with the spaniard an unentertaining and even an anxious pastime then came the supper when once more the count swooped down on lysbeth leaving him to escort his cousin clara whom he considered an old fool and disliked and who having spoilt his new jacket by spilling wine over it ended by abusing his taste in dress nor was that allhe had drunk a great deal more strong wine than was wise for to this his head certified lastly he had walked home arm in arm with his ladysnatching spaniard and by heaven yes he had sworn eternal friendship with him on the doorstep  well there was no doubt that the count was an uncommonly good fellowfor a spaniard as for that story of the foul he had explained it quite satisfactorily and he had taken his beating like a gentleman could anything be nicer or in better feeling than his allusions to cousin pieter in his aftersupper speech also and this was a graver matter the man had shown that he was tolerant and kindly by the way in which he dealt with the poor creature called the mare a woman whose history dirk knew well one whose sufferings had made of her a crazy and rashtongued wanderer who so it was rumoured could use a knife  in fact for the truth may as well be told at once dirk was a lutheran having been admitted to that community two years before to be a lutheran in those days that is in the netherlands meant it need scarcely be explained that you walked the world with a halter round your neck and a vision of the rack and the stake before your eyes circumstances under which religion became a more earnest and serious thing than most people find it in this century still even at that date the dreadful penalties attaching to the crime did not prevent many of the burgher and lower classes from worshipping god in their own fashion indeed if the truth had been known of those who were present at lysbeths supper on the previous night more than half including pieter van de werff were adherents of the new faith  to dismiss religious considerations however dirk could have wished that this kindly natured spaniard was not quite so goodlooking or quite so appreciative of the excellent points of the young leyden ladies and especially of lysbeths with whose sterling character he now remembered montalvo had assured him he was much impressed what he feared was that this regard might be reciprocal after all a spanish hidalgo in command of the garrison was a distinguished person and alas lysbeth also was a catholic dirk loved lysbeth he loved her with that patient sincerity which was characteristic of his race and his own temperament but in addition to and above the reasons that have been given already it was this fact of the difference of religion which hitherto had built a wall between them of course she was unaware of anything of the sort she did not know even that he belonged to the new faith and without the permission of the elders of his sect he would not dare to tell her for the lives of men and of their families could not be confided lightly to the hazard of a girls discretion  herein lay the real reason why although dirk was so devoted to lysbeth and although he imagined that she was not indifferent to him as yet no word had passed between them of love or marriage how could he who was a lutheran ask a catholic to become his wife without telling her the truth and if he told her the truth and she consented to take the risk how could he drag her into that dreadful net supposing even that she kept to her own faith which of course she would be at liberty to do although equally of course he was bound to try to convert her their children if they had any must be brought up in his beliefs then sooner or later might come the informer that dreadful informer whose shadow already lay heavy upon thousands of homes in the netherlands and after the informer the officer and after the officer the priest and after the priest the judge and after the judgethe executioner and the stake  in this case what would happen to lysbeth she might prove herself innocent of the horrible crime of heresy if by that time she was innocent but what would life become to the loving young woman whose husband and children perhaps had been haled off to the slaughter chambers of the papal inquisition this was the true first cause why dirk had remained silent even when he was sorely tempted to speak yes although his instinct told him that his silence had been misinterpreted and set down to overcaution or indifference or to unnecessary scruples  the next to wake up that morning was lysbeth who if she was not troubled with headache resulting from indulgenceand in that day women of her class sometimes suffered from ithad pains of her own to overcome when sifted and classified these pains resolved themselves into a sense of fiery indignation against dirk van goorl dirk had been late for his appointment alleging some ridiculous excuse about the cooling of a bell as though she cared whether the bell were hot or cold with the result that she had been thrown into the company of that dreadful martha the mare after the mareaggravated by black megcame the spaniard here again dirk had shown contemptible indifference and insufficiency for he allowed her to be forced into the wolf sledge against her will nay he had actually consented to the thing next in a fateful sequence followed all the other incidents of that hideous carnival the race the foul if it was a foul the dreadful nightmare vision called into her mind by the look upon montalvos face the trial of the mare her own unpremeditated but indelible perjury the lonely drive with the man who compelled her to it the exhibition of herself before all the world as his willing companion and the feast in which he appeared as her cavalier and was accepted of the simple company almost as an angel entertained by chance  what did he mean doubtless for on that point she could scarcely be mistaken he meant to make love to her for had he not in practice said as much and nowthis was the terrible thingshe was in his power since if he chose to do so without doubt he could prove that she had sworn a false oath for her own purposes also that lie weighed upon her mind although it had been spoken in a good cause if it was good to save a wretched fanatic from the fate which were the truth known without doubt her crime deserved  of course the spaniard was a bad man if an attractive one and he had behaved wickedly if with grace and breeding but who expected anything else from a spaniard who only acted after his kind and for his own ends it was dirkdirkthat was to blame not so muchand here again came the rubfor his awkwardness and mistakes of yesterday as for his general conduct why had he not spoken to her before and put her beyond the reach of such accidents as these to which a woman of her position and substance must necessarily be exposed the saints knew that she had given him opportunity enough she had gone as far as a maiden might and not for all the dirks on earth would she go one inch further why had she ever come to care for his foolish face why had she refused soandso and soandso and soandsoall of them honourable menwith the result that now no other bachelor ever came near her comprehending that she was under bond to her cousin in the past she had persuaded herself that it was because of something she felt but could not see of a hidden nobility of character which after all was not very evident upon the surface that she loved dirk van goorl but where was this something this nobility surely a man who was a man ought to play his part and not leave her in this false position especially as there could be no question of means she would not have come to him emptyhanded very far from it indeed oh were it not for the unlucky fact that she still happened to care about himto her sorrownever never would she speak to him again  the last of our three friends to awake on this particular morning between nine and ten oclock indeed when dirk had been already two hours at his factory and lysbeth was buying provisions in the market place was that accomplished and excellent officer captain the count juan de montalvo for a few seconds after his dark eyes opened he stared at the ceiling collecting his thoughts then sitting up in bed he burst into a prolonged roar of laughter really the whole thing was too funny for any man of humour to contemplate without being moved to merriment that gaby dirk van goorl the furiously indignant but helpless lysbeth the solemn fatheaded fools of netherlanders at the supper and the fashion in which he had played his own tune on the whole pack of them as though they were the strings of a fiddleoh it was delicious  as the reader by this time may have guessed montalvo was not the typical spaniard of romance and indeed of history he was not gloomy and stern he was not even particularly vengeful or bloodthirsty on the contrary he was a clever and utterly unprincipled man with a sense of humour and a gift of bonhomie which made him popular in all places moreover he was brave a good soldier in a certain sense sympathetic and strange to say no bigot indeed which seems to have been a rare thing in those days his religious views were so enlarged that he had none at all his conduct therefore if from time to time it was affected by passing spasms of acute superstition was totally uninfluenced by any settled spiritual hopes or fears a condition which he found gave him great advantages in life in fact had it suited his purpose montalvo was prepared at a moments notice to become lutheran or calvinist or mahomedan or mystic or even anabaptist on the principle he would explain that it is easy for the artist to paint any picture he likes upon a blank canvas  and yet this curious pliancy of mind this lack of conviction this absolute want of moral sense which ought to have given the count such great advantages in his conflict with the world were in reality the main source of his weakness fortune had made a soldier of the man and he filled the part as he would have filled any part but nature intended him for a playactor and from day to day he posed and mimed and mouthed through life in this character or in that though never in his own character principally because he had none still far down in montalvos being there was something solid and genuine and that something not good but bad it was very rarely on view the hand of circumstance must plunge deep to find it but it dwelt there the strong cruel spanish spirit which would sacrifice anything to save or even to advance itself it was this spirit that lysbeth had seen looking out of his eyes on the yesterday which when he knew that the race was lost had prompted him to try to kill his adversary although he killed himself and her in the attempt nor did she see it then for the last time for twice more at least in her life she was destined to meet and tremble at its power  in short although montalvo was a man who really disliked cruelty he could upon occasion be cruel to the last degree although he appreciated friends and desired to have them he could be the foulest of traitors although without a cause he would do no hurt to a living thing yet if that cause were sufficient he would cheerfully consign a whole cityful to death no not cheerfully he would have regretted their end very much and often afterwards might have thought of it with sympathy and even sorrow this was where he differed from the majority of his countrymen in that age who would have done the same thing and more brutally from honest principle and for the rest of their lives rejoiced at the memory of the deed  montalvo had his ruling passion it was not war it was not women it was money but here again he did not care about the money for itself since he was no miser and being the most inveterate of gamblers never saved a single stiver he wanted it to spend and to stake upon the dice thus again in variance to the taste of most of his countrymen he cared little for the other sex he did not even like their society and as for their passion and the rest he thought it something of a bore but he did care intensely for their admiration so much so that if no better game were at hand he would take enormous trouble to fascinate even a serving maid or a fish girl wherever he went it was his ambition to be reported the man the most admired of the fair in that city and to attain this end he offered himself upon the altar of numerous love affairs which did not amuse him in the least of course the indulgence of this vanity meant expense since the fair require money and presents and he who pursues them should be well dressed and horsed and able to do things in the very finest style also their relatives must be entertained and when they were entertained impressed with the sense that they had the honour to be guests of a grandee of spain  now that of a grandee has never been a cheap profession indeed as many a pauper peer knows today rank without resources is a terrific burden montalvo had the rank for he was a wellborn man whose sole heritage was an ancient tower built by some warlike ancestor in a position admirably suited to the purpose of the said ancestor namely the pillage of travellers through a neighbouring mountain pass when however travellers ceased to use that pass or for other reasons robbery became no longer productive the revenues of the montalvo family declined till at the present date they were practically nil thus it came about that the status of the last representative of this ancient stock was that of a soldier of fortune of the common type endowed unfortunately for himself with grand ideas a gamblers fatal fire expensive tastes and more than the usual pride of race  although perhaps he had never defined them very clearly even to himself juan de montalvo had two aims in life first to indulge his every freak and fancy to the full and nextbut this was secondary and somewhat nebulousto reestablish the fortunes of his family in themselves they were quite legitimate aims and in those times when fishers of troubled waters generally caught something and when men of ability and character might force their way to splendid positions there was no reason why they should not have led him to success yet so far at any rate in spite of many opportunities he had not succeeded although he was now a man of more than thirty the causes of his failures were various but at the bottom of them lay his lack of stability and genuineness  a man who is always playing a part amuses every one but convinces nobody montalvo convinced nobody when he discoursed on the mysteries of religion with priests even priests who in those days for the most part were stupid felt that they assisted in a mere intellectual exercise when his theme was war his audience guessed that his object was probably love when love was his song an inconvenient instinct was apt to assure the lady immediately concerned that it was love of self and not of her they were all more or less mistaken but as usual the women went nearest to the mark montalvos real aim was self but he spelt it money money in large sums was what he wanted and what in this way or that he meant to win  now even in the sixteenth century fortunes did not lie to the hand of every adventurer military pay was small and not easily recoverable loot was hard to come by and quickly spent even the ransom of a rich prisoner or two soon disappeared in the payment of such debts of honour as could not be avoided of course there remained the possibility of wealthy marriage which in a country like the netherlands that was full of rich heiresses was not difficult to a highborn handsome and agreeable man of the ruling spanish caste indeed after many chances and changes the time had come at length when montalvo must either marry or be ruined for his station his debts especially his gaming debts were enormous and creditors met him at every turn unfortunately for him also some of these creditors were persons who had the ear of people in authority so at last it came about that an intimation reached him that this scandal must be abated or he must go back to spain a country which as it happened he did not in the least wish to visit in short the sorry hour of reckoning that hour which overtakes all procrastinators had arrived and marriage wealthy marriage was the only way wherewith it could be defied it was a sad alternative to a man who for his own very excellent reasons did not wish to marry but this had to be faced  thus it came about that as the only suitable partie in leyden the count montalvo had sought out the wellfavoured and wellendowed jufvrouw lysbeth van hout to be his companion in the great sledge race and taken so much trouble to ensure to himself a friendly reception at her house  so far things went well and what was more the opening of the chase had proved distinctly entertaining also the society of the place after his appropriation of her at a public festival and their long moonlight teteatete which by now must be common gossips talk would be quite prepared for any amount of attention which he might see fit to pay to lysbeth indeed why should he not pay attention to an unaffianced woman whose rank was lower if her means were greater than his own of course he knew that her name had been coupled with that of dirk van goorl he was perfectly aware also that these two young people were attached to each other for as they walked home together on the previous night dirk possibly for motives of his own had favoured him with a semiintoxicated confidence to that effect but as they were not affianced what did that matter indeed had they been affianced what would it matter still dirk van goorl was an obstacle and therefore although he seemed to be a good fellow and he was sorry for him dirk van goorl must be got out of the way since he was convinced that lysbeth was one of those stubbornnatured creatures who would probably decline to marry himself until this young leyden lout had vanished and yet he did not wish to be mixed up with duels if for no other reason because in a duel the unexpected may always happen and that would be a poor end certainly also he did not wish to be mixed up with murder first because he intensely disliked the idea of killing anybody unless he was driven to it and secondly because murder has a nasty way of coming out one could never be quite sure in what light the despatching of a young netherlander of respectable family and fortune would be looked at by those in authority  also there was another thing to be considered if this young man died it was impossible to know exactly how lysbeth would take his death thus she might elect to refuse to marry or decide to mourn him for four or five years which for all practical purposes would be just as bad and yet while dirk lived how could he possibly persuade her to transfer her affections to himself it seemed therefore that dirk ought to decease for quite a quarter of an hour montalvo thought the matter over and then just as he had given it up and determined to leave things to chance for a while at least inspiration came a splendid a heavensent inspiration  dirk must not die dirk must live but his continued existence must be the price of the hand of lysbeth van hout if she was half as fond of the man as he believed it was probable that she would be delighted to marry anybody else in order to save his precious neck for that was just the kind of sentimental idiotcy of which nine women out of ten really enjoyed the indulgence moreover this scheme had other merits it did every one a good turn dirk would be saved from extinction for which he should be grateful lysbeth besides earning the honour of an alliance perhaps only temporary with himself would be able to go through life wrapped in a heavenly glow of virtue arising from the impression that she had really done something very fine and tragic while he montalvo under providence the humble purveyor of these blessings would also benefit to some small extent  the difficulty was how could the situation be created how could the interesting dirk be brought to a pass that would give the lady an opportunity of exercising her finer feelings on his behalf if only he were a heretic now well by the pope why shouldnt he be a heretic if ever a fellow had the heretical cut this fellow had flatfaced sanctimoniouslooking and with a fancy for darkcoloured stockingshe had observed that all heretics male and female wore darkcoloured stockings perhaps by way of mortifying the flesh he could think of only one thing against it the young man had drunk too much last night but there were certain breeds of heretics who did not mind drinking too much also the best could slip sometimes for as he had learned from the old castilian priest who taught him latin humanum est etc  this then was the summary of his reflections 1 that to save the situation within three months or so he must be united in holy matrimony with lysbeth van hout 2 that if it proved impossible to remove the young man dirk van goorl from his path by overmatching him in the ladys affections or by playing on her jealousy query could a woman be egged into becoming jealous of that flounder of a fellow and into marrying some one else out of pique stronger measures must be adopted 3 that such stronger measures should consist of inducing the lady to save her lover from death by uniting herself in marriage with one who for her sake would do violence to his conscience and manipulate the business 4 that this plan would be best put into execution by proving the lover to be a heretic but if unhappily this could not be proved because he was not still he must figure in that capacity for this occasion only 5 that meanwhile it would be well to cultivate the society of mynheer van goorl as much as possible first because he was a person with whom under the circumstances he montalvo would naturally wish to become intimate and secondly because he was quite certain to be an individual with cash to lend  now these researches after heretics invariably cost money for they involved the services of spies obviously therefore friend dirk the dutch flounder was a man to provide the butter in which he was going to be fried why if any hollander had a spark of humour he would see the joke of it himselfand montalvo ended his reflections as he had begun them with a merry peal of laughter after which he rose and ate a most excellent breakfast    it was about halfpast five oclock that afternoon before the captain and actingcommandant montalvo returned from some duty to which he had been attending for it may be explained that he was a zealous officer and a master of detail as he entered his lodgings the soldier who acted as his servant a man selected for silence and discretion saluted and stood at attention  is the woman here he asked  excellency she is here though i had difficulty enough in persuading her to come for i found her in bed and out of humour  peace to your difficulties where is she  in the small inner room excellency  good then see that no one disturbs us andstay when she goes out follow her and note her movements till you trace her home  the man saluted and montalvo passed upstairs into the inner room carefully shutting both doors behind him the place was unlighted but through the large stonemullioned window the rays of the full moon poured brightly and by them seated in a straightbacked chair montalvo saw a draped form there was something forbidding something almost unnatural in the aspect of this sombre form perched thus upon a chair in expectant silence it reminded himfor he had a touch of inconvenient imaginationof an evil bird squatted upon the bough of a dead tree awaiting the dawn that it might go forth to devour some appointed prey  is that you mother meg he asked in tones from which most of the jocosity had vanished quite like old times at the hagueisnt it  the moonlit figure turned its head for he could see the light shine upon the whites of the eyes  who else excellency said a voice hoarse and thick with rheum a voice like the croak of a crow though it is little thanks to your excellency those must be strong who can bathe in rhine water through a hole in the ice and take no hurt  dont scold woman he answered i have no time for it if you were ducked yesterday it served you right for losing your cursed temper could you not see that i had my own game to play and you were spoiling it must i be flouted before my men and listen while you warn a lady with whom i wish to stand well against me  you generally have a game to play excellency but when it ends in my being first robbed and then nearly drowned beneath the icewell that is a game which black meg does not forget  hush mother you are not the only person with a memory what was the reward twelve florins well you shall have them and five more thats good pay for a lick of cold water are you satisfied  no excellency i wanted the life that heretics life i wanted to baste her while she burned or to tread her down while she was buried i have a grudge against the woman because i know yes because i know she repeated fiercely that if i do not kill her she will try to kill me her husband and her young son were burnt upon my evidence mostly but this is the third time she has escaped me  patience mother patience and i dare say that everything will come right in the end you have bagged two of the familypapa heretic and young hopeful really you should not grumble if the third takes a little hunting or wonder that in the meanwhile you are not popular with mama now listen you know the young woman whom it was necessary that i should humour yesterday she is rich is she not  yes i know her and i knew her father he left her house furniture jewellery and thirty thousand crowns which are placed out at good interest a nice fortune for a gallant who wants money but it will be dirk van goorls not yours  ah that is just the point now what do you know about dirk van goorl  a respectable hardworking burgher son of welltodo parents brassworkers who live at alkmaar honest but not very clever the kind of man who grows rich becomes a burgomaster founds a hospital for the poor and has a fine monument put up to his memory  mother the cold water has dulled your wits when i ask you about a man i want to learn what you know against him  naturally excellency naturally but against this one i can tell you nothing he has no lovers he does not gamble he does not drink except a glass after dinner he works in his factory all day goes to bed early rises early and calls on the jufvrouw van hout on sundays that is all  where does he attend mass  at the groote kerke once a week but he does not take the sacrament or go to confession  that sounds bad mother very bad you dont mean to say that he is a heretic  probably he is excellency most of them are about here  dear me how very shocking do you know i should not like that excellent young woman a good catholic too like you and me mother to become mixed up with one of these dreadful heretics who might expose her to all sorts of dangers for mother who can touch pitch and not be defiled  you waste time excellency replied his visitor with a snort what do you want  well in the interests of this young lady i want to prove that this man is a heretic and it has struck me thatas one accustomed to this sort of thingyou might be able to find the evidence  indeed excellency and has it struck you what my face would look like after i had thrust my head into a wasps nest for your amusement do you know what it means to me if i go peering about among the heretics of leyden well i will tell you it means that i should be killed they are a strong lot and a determined lot and so long as you leave them alone they will leave you alone but if you interfere with them why then it is good night oh yes i know all about the law and the priests and the edicts and the emperor but the emperor cannot burn a whole people and though i hate them i tell you she added standing up suddenly and speaking in a fierce convinced voice that in the end the law and the edicts and the priests will get the worst of this fight yes these hollanders will beat them all and cut the throats of you spaniards and thrust those of you who are left alive out of their country and spit upon your memories and worship god in their own fashion and be proud and free when you are dogs gnawing the bones of your greatness dogs kicked back into your kennels to rot there those are not my own words said meg in a changed voice as she sat down again they are the words of that devil martha the mare which she spoke in my hearing when we had her on the rack but somehow i think that they will come true and that is why i always remember them  indeed her ladyship the mare is a more interesting person than i thought though if she can talk like that perhaps after all it would have been as well to drown her and now dropping prophecy and leaving posterity to arrange for itself let us come to business how much for evidence which would suffice to procure his conviction mind  five hundred florins not a stiver less so excellency you need not waste your time trying to beat me down you want good evidence evidence on which the council or whoever they may appoint will convict and that means the unshaken testimony of two witnesses well i tell you it isnt easy to come by there is great danger to the honest folk who seek it for these heretics are desperate people and if they find a spy while they are engaged in devilworship at one of their conventicles whythey kill him  i know all that mother what are you trying to cover up that you are so talkative it isnt your usual way of doing business well it is a bargainyou shall have your money when you produce the evidence and now really if we stop here much longer people will begin to make remarks for who shall escape aspersion in this censorious world so goodnight mother goodnight and he turned to leave the room  no excellency she croaked with a snort of indignation no pay no play i dont work on the faith of your excellencys word alone  how much he asked again  a hundred florins down  then for a while they wrangled hideously their heads held close together in the patch of moonlight and so loathsome did their faces look so plainly was the wicked purpose of their hearts written upon them that in that faint luminous glow they might have been mistaken for emissaries from the underworld chaffering over the price of a human soul at last the bargain was struck for fifty florins and having received it into her hand black meg departed  sixtyseven in all she muttered to herself as she regained the street well it was no use holding out for any more for he hasnt got the cash the mans as poor as lazarus but he wants to live like dives and what is more he gambles as i learned at the hague also theres something queer about his past i have heard as much as that it must be looked into and perhaps the bundle of papers which i helped myself to out of his desk while i was waitingand she touched the bosom of her dress to make sure that they were safemay tell me a thing or two though likely enough they are only unpaid bills ah most noble cheat and captain before you have done with her you may find that black meg knows how to pay back hot water for cold    chapter v  the dream of dirk  on the day following montalvos interview with black meg dirk received a message from that gentleman sent to his lodging by an orderly which reminded him that he had promised to dine with him this very night now he had no recollection of any such engagement remembering with shame however that there were various incidents of the evening of the supper whereof his memory was most imperfect he concluded that this must be one of them so much against his own wishes dirk sent back an answer to say that he would appear at the time and place appointed  this was the third thing that had happened to annoy him that day first he had met pieter van de werff who informed him that all leyden was talking about lysbeth and the captain montalvo to whom she was said to have taken a great fancy next when he went to call at the house in the bree straat he was told that both lysbeth and his cousin clara had gone out sleighing which he did not believe for as a thaw had set in the snow was no longer in a condition suitable to that amusement moreover he could almost have sworn that as he crossed the street he caught sight of cousin claras red face peeping at him from between the curtains of the upstairs sittingroom indeed he said as much to greta who contrary to custom had opened the door to him  i am sorry if mynheer sees visions answered that young woman imperturbably i told mynheer that the ladies had gone out sleighing  i know you did greta but why should they go out sleighing in a wet thaw  i dont know mynheer ladies do those things that please them it is not my place to ask their reasons  dirk looked at greta and was convinced that she was lying he put his hand in his pocket to find to his disgust that he had forgotten his purse then he thought of giving her a kiss and trying to melt the truth out of her in this fashion but remembering that if he did she might tell lysbeth which would make matters worse than ever refrained so the end of it was that he merely said oh indeed and went away  great softhead reflected greta as she watched his retreating form he knew i was telling lies why didnt he push past me ordo anything ah mynheer dirk if you are not careful that spaniard will take your wind well he is more amusing thats certain i am tired of these duckfooted leydeners who darent wink at a donkey lest he should bray and among such holy folk somebody a little wicked is rather a change then greta who it may be remembered came from brussels and had french blood in her veins went upstairs to make a report to her mistress telling her all that passed  i did not ask you to speak falsehoods as to my being out sleighing and the rest i told you to answer that i was not at home and mind you say the same to the captain montalvo if he calls said lysbeth with some acerbity as she dismissed her  in truth she was very sore and angry and yet ashamed of herself because it was so but things had gone so horribly wrong and as for dirk he was the most exasperating person in the world it was owing to his bad management and lack of readiness that her name was coupled with montalvos at every table in leyden and now what did she hear in a note from the captain himself sent to make excuses for not having called upon her after the supper party but that dirk was going to dine with him that night very well let him do it she would know how to pay him back and if necessary was ready to act up to any situation which he had chosen to create  thus thought lysbeth stamping her foot with vexation but all the time her heart was sore all the time she knew well enough that she loved dirk and however strange might be his backwardness in speaking out his mind that he loved her and yet she felt as though a river was running between them in the beginning it had been a streamlet but now it was growing to a torrent worse still the spaniard was upon her bank of the river  after he had to some extent conquered his shyness and irritation dirk became aware that he was really enjoying his dinner at montalvos quarters there were three guests besides himself two spanish officers and a young netherlander of his own class and age brant by name he was the only son of a noted and very wealthy goldsmith at the hague who had sent him to study certain mysteries of the metal workers art under a leyden jeweller famous for the exquisite beauty of his designs the dinner and the service were both of them perfect in style but better than either proved the conversation which was of a character that dirk had never heard at the tables of his own class and people not that there was anything even broad about it as might perhaps have been expected no it was the talk of highly accomplished and travelled men of the world who had seen much and been actors in many moving events men who were not overtrammelled by prejudices religious or other and who were above all things desirous of making themselves agreeable and instructive to the stranger within their gates the heer brant also who had but just arrived in leyden showed himself an able and polished man one that had been educated more thoroughly than was usual among his class and who at the table of his father the opulent burgomaster of the hague from his youth had associated with all classes and conditions of men indeed it was there that he made the acquaintance of montalvo who recognising him in the street had asked him to dinner  after the dishes were cleared one of the spanish officers rose and begged to be excused pleading some military duty when he had saluted his commandant and gone montalvo suggested that they should play a game of cards this was an invitation which dirk would have liked to decline but when it came to the point he did not for fear of seeming peculiar in the eyes of these brilliant men of the world  so they began to play and as the game was simple very soon he picked up the points of it and what is more found them amusing at first the stakes were not high but they doubled themselves in some automatic fashion till dirk was astonished to find that he was gambling for considerable sums and winning them towards the last his luck changed a little but when the game came to an end he found himself the richer by about three hundred and fifty florins  what am i do to with this he asked colouring up as with sighs which in one instance were genuine enough the losers pushed the money across to him  do with it laughed montalvo did anybody ever hear such an innocent why buy your ladylove or somebody elses ladylove a present no ill tell you a better use than this you give us tomorrow night at your lodging the best dinner that leyden can produce and a chance of winning some of this coin back again is it agreed  if the other gentlemen wish it said dirk modestly though my apartment is but a poor place for such company  of course we wish it replied the three as with one voice and the hour for meeting having been fixed they parted the heer brant walking with dirk to the door of his lodging  i was going to call on you tomorrow he said to bring to you a letter of introduction from my father though that should scarcely be needed as in fact we are cousinssecond cousins only our mothers having been first cousins  oh yes brant of the hague of whom my mother used to speak saying that they were kinsmen to be proud of although she had met them but little well welcome cousin i trust that we shall be friends  i am sure of it answered brant and putting his arm through dirks he pressed it in a peculiar fashion that caused him to start and look round hush muttered brant not here and they began to talk of their late companions and the game of cards which they had played an amusement as to the propriety of which dirk intimated that he had doubts  young brant shrugged his shoulders cousin he said we live in the world so it is as well to understand the world if the risking of a few pieces at play which it will not ruin us to lose helps us to understand it well for my part i am ready to risk them especially as it puts us on good terms with those who as things are it is wise we should cultivate only cousin if i may venture to say it be careful not to take more wine than you can carry with discretion better lose a thousand florins than let drop one word that you cannot remember  i know i know answered dirk thinking of lysbeths supper and at the door of his lodgings they parted  like most netherlanders when dirk made up his mind to do anything he did it thoroughly thus having undertaken to give a dinner party he determined to give a good dinner in ordinary circumstances his first idea would have been to consult his cousins clara and lysbeth after that monstrous story about the sleighing however which by inquiry from the coachman of the house whom he happened to meet he ascertained to be perfectly false this for the young man had some pride he did not feel inclined to do so in place of it he talked first to his landlady a worthy dame and by her advice afterwards with the first innkeeper of leyden a man of resource and experience the innkeeper well knowing that this customer would pay for anything which he ordered threw himself into the affair heartily with the result that by five oclock relays of cooks and other attendants were to be seen streaming up dirks staircase carrying every variety of dish that could be supposed to tempt the appetite of highclass cavaliers  dirks apartment consisted of two rooms situated upon the first floor of an old house in a street that had ceased to be fashionable once however it had been a fine house and according to the ideas of the time the rooms themselves were fine especially the sitting chamber which was oakpanelled low and spacious with a handsome fireplace carrying the arms of its builder out of it opened his sleeping roomwhich had no other doorwaylikewise oakpanelled with tall cupboards not unlike the canopy of a tomb in shape and general appearance  the hour came and with it the guests the feast began the cooks streamed up and down bearing relays of dishes from the inn above the table hung a sixarmed brass chandelier and in each of its sockets guttered a tallow candle furnishing light to the company beneath although outside of its bright ring there was shadow more or less dense towards the end of dinner a portion of the rush wick of one of these candles fell into the brass saucer beneath causing the molten grease to burn up fiercely as it chanced by the light of this sudden flare montalvo who was sitting opposite to the door thought that he caught sight of a tall dark figure gliding along the wall towards the bedroom for one instant he saw it then it was gone  caramba my friend he said addressing dirk whose back was turned towards the figure have you any ghosts in this gloomy old room of yours because if so i think i have just seen one  ghosts answered dirk no i never heard of any i do not believe in ghosts take some more of that pasty  montalvo took some more pasty and washed it down with a glass of wine but he said no more about ghostsperhaps an explanation of the phenomenon had occurred to him at any rate he decided to leave the subject alone  after the dinner they gambled and this evening the stakes began where those of the previous night left off for the first hour dirk lost then the luck turned and he won heavily but always from montalvo  my friend said the captain at last throwing down his cards certainly you are fated to be unfortunate in your matrimonial adventures for the devil lives in your dicebox and his highness does not give everything i pass and he rose from the table  i pass also said dirk following him into the window place for he wished to take no more money you have been very unlucky count he said  very indeed my young friend answered montalvo yawning in fact for the next six months i must live onwellwell nothing except the recollection of your excellent dinner  i am sorry muttered dirk confusedly i did not wish to take your money it was the turn of those accursed dice see here let us say no more about it  sir said montalvo with a sudden sternness an officer and a gentleman cannot treat a debt of honour thus but he added with a little laugh if another gentleman chances to be good enough to charge a debt of honour for a debt of honour the affair is different if for instance it would suit you to lend me four hundred florins which added to the six hundred which i have lost tonight would make a thousand in all well it will be a convenience to me though should it be any inconvenience to you pray do not think of such a thing  certainly answered dirk i have won nearly as much as that and here at my own table take them i beg of you captain and emptying a roll of gold into his hand he counted it with the skill of a merchant and held it towards him  montalvo hesitated then he took the money pouring it carelessly into his pocket  you have not checked the sum said dirk  my friend it is needless answered his guest your word is rather better than any bond and again he yawned remarking that it was getting late  dirk waited a few moments thinking in his coarse businesslike way that the noble spaniard might wish to say something about a written acknowledgment as however this did not seem to occur to him and the matter was not one of ordinary affairs he led the way back to the table where the other two were now showing their skill in card tricks  a few minutes later the two spaniards took their departure leaving dirk and his cousin brant alone  a very successful evening said brant and cousin you won a great deal  yes answered dirk but all the same i am a poorer man than i was yesterday  brant laughed did he borrow of you he asked well i thought he would and whats more dont you count on that money montalvo is a good sort of fellow in his own fashion but he is an extravagant man and a desperate gambler with a queer history i fancyat least nobody knows much about him not even his brother officers if you ask them they shrug their shoulders and say that spain is a big kettle full of all sorts of fish one thing i do know however that he is over head and ears in debt indeed there was trouble about it down at the hague so cousin dont you play with him more than you can help and dont reckon on that thousand florins to pay your bills with it is a mystery to me how the man gets on but i am told that a foolish old vrouw in amsterdam lent him a lot till she discoveredbut there i dont talk scandal and now he added changing his voice is this place private  lets see said dirk they have cleared the things away and the old housekeeper has tidied up my bedroom yes i think so nobody ever comes up here after ten oclock what is it  brant touched his arm and understanding the truth dirk led the way into the windowplace there standing with his back to the room and his hands crossed in a peculiar fashion he uttered the word jesus and paused brant also crossed his hands and answered or rather continued wept it was the password of those of the new religion  you are one of us cousin said dirk  i and all my house my father my mother my sister and the maiden whom i am to marry they told me at the hague that i must seek of you or the young heer pieter van de werff knowledge of those things which we of the faith need to know who are to be trusted and who are not to be trusted where prayer is held and where we may partake of the pure sacrament of god the son  dirk took his cousins hand and pressed it the pressure was returned and thenceforward brother could not have trusted brother more completely for now between them was the bond of a common and burning faith  such bonds the reader may say tie ninety out of every hundred people to each other in the present year of grace but it is not to be observed that a like mutual confidence results no because the circumstances have changed thanks very largely to dirk van goorl and his fellows of that day especially to one william of orange it is no longer necessary for devout and godfearing people to creep into holes and corners like felons hiding from the law that they may worship the almighty after some fashion as pure as it is simple knowing the while that if they are found so doing their lot and the lot of their wives and children will be the torment and the stake now the thumbscrew and the rack as instruments for the discomfiture of heretics are relegated to the dusty cases of museums but some short generations since all this was different for then a man who dared to disagree with certain doctrines was treated with far less mercy than is shown to a dog on the vivisectors table  little wonder therefore that those who lay under such a ban those who were continually walking in the cold shadow of this dreadful doom clung to each other loved each other and comforted each other to the last passing often enough handinhand through the fiery gates to that country in which there is no more pain to be a member of the new religion in the netherlands under the awful rule of charles the emperor and philip the king was to be one of a vast family it was not sir or mistress or madame it was my father and my mother or my sister and my brother yes and between people who were of very different status and almost strangers in the flesh strangers in the flesh but brethren in spirit  it will be understood that in these circumstances dirk and brant already liking each other and being already connected by blood were not slow in coming to a complete understanding and fellowship  there they sat in the windowplace telling each other of their families their hopes and fears and even of their ladyloves in this as in every other respect hendrik brants story was one of simple prosperity he was betrothed to a lady of the hague the only daughter of a wealthy winemerchant who according to his account seemed to be as beautiful as she was good and rich and they were to be married in the spring but when dirk told him of his affair he shook his wise young head  you say that both she and her aunt are catholics he asked  yes cousin this is the trouble i think that she is fond of me or at any rate she was until a few days since he added ruefully but how can i being a heretic ask her to plight her troth to me unless i tell her and that you know is against the rule indeed i scarcely dare to do so  had you not best consult with some godly elder who by prayer and words may move your ladys heart till the light shines on her asked brant  cousin it has been done but always there is the other in the way that rednosed aunt clara who is a mad idolator also there is the servingwoman greta whom i take for little better than a spy therefore between the two of them i see little chance that lysbeth will ever hear the truth this side of marriage and yet how dare i marry her is it right that i should marry her and therefore perhaps bring her too to some dreadful fate such as may wait for you or me moreover now since this man montalvo has crossed my path all things seem to have gone wrong between me and lysbeth indeed but yesterday her door was shut on me  women have their fancies answered brant slowly perhaps he has taken hers she would not be the first who walked that plank or perhaps she is vexed with you for not speaking out ere this for man not knowing what you are how can she read your mind  perhaps perhaps said dirk but i know not what to do and in his perplexity he struck his forehead with his hand  then brother in that case what hinders that we should ask him who can tell you said brant calmly  dirk understood what he meant at once it is a wise thought and a good one cousin i have the holy book first let us pray and then we can seek wisdom there  you are rich indeed answered brant sometime you must tell me how and where you came by it  here in leyden if one can afford to pay for them such goods are not hard to get said dirk what is hard is to keep them safely for to be found with a bible in your pocket is to carry your own deathwarrant  brant nodded is it safe to show it here he asked  as safe as anywhere cousin the window is shuttered the door is or will be locked but who can say that he is safe this side of the stake in a land where the rats and mice carry news and the wind bears witness come i will show you were i keep it and going to the mantelpiece he took down a candlestick a quaint brass ornamented on its massive oblong base with two copper snails and lit the candle do you like the piece he asked it is my own design which i cast and filed out in my spare hours and he gazed at the holder with the affection of an artist then without waiting for an answer he led the way to the door of his sittingroom and paused  what is it asked brant  i thought i heard a sound that is all but doubtless the old vrouw moves upon the stairs turn the key cousin so now come on  they entered the sleeping chamber and having glanced round and made sure that it was empty and the window shut dirk went to the head of the bed which was formed of oakpanels the centre one carved with a magnificent coatofarms fellow to that in the fireplace of the sittingroom at this panel dirk began to work till presently it slid aside revealing a hollow out of which he took a book bound in boards covered with leather then having closed the panel the two young men returned to the sittingroom and placed the volume upon the oak table beneath the chandelier  first let us pray said brant  it seems curious does it not that two young men as a finale to a dinner party and a gambling match at which the stakes had not been low young men who like others had their weaknesses for one of them at any rate could drink too much wine at times and both being human doubtless had further sins to bear should suggest kneeling side by side to offer prayers to their maker before they studied the scriptures but then in those strange days prayer now so common and so neglected an exercise was an actual luxury to these poor hunted men and women it was a joy to be able to kneel and offer thanks and petitions to god believing themselves to be safe from the sword of those who worshipped otherwise thus it came about that religion being forbidden was to them a very real and earnest thing a thing to be indulged in at every opportunity with solemn and grateful hearts so there beneath the light of the guttering candles they knelt side by side while brant speaking for both of them offered up a prayera sight touching enough and in its way beautiful  the words of his petition do not matter he prayed for their church he prayed for their country that it might be made strong and free he even prayed for the emperor the carnal harelipped guzzling able hapsburg selfseeker then he prayed for themselves and all who were dear to them and lastly that light might be vouchsafed to dirk in his present difficulty no not quite lastly for he ended with a petition that their enemies might be forgiven yes even those who tortured them and burnt them at the stake since they knew not what they did it may be wondered whether any human aspirations could have been more thoroughly steeped in the true spirit of christianity  when at length he had finished they rose from their knees  shall i open the book at a hazard asked dirk and read what my eye falls on  no answered brant for it savours of superstition thus did the ancients with the writings of the poet virgilius and it is not fitting that we who hold the light should follow the example of those blind heathen what work of the book brother are you studying now  the first letter of paul to the corinthians which i have never read before he answered  then begin where you left off brother and read your chapter perhaps we may find instruction in it if not no answer is vouchsafed to us tonight  so from the blackletter volume before him dirk began to read the seventh chapter in which as it chances the great apostle deals with the marriage state on he read in a quiet even voice till he came to the twelfth and four following verses of which the last three run for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean but now they are holy but if the unbelieving depart let him depart a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases but god has called us to peace for what knowest thou o wife whether thou shalt save thy husband or how knowest thou o man whether thou shalt save thy wife dirks voice trembled and he paused  continue to the end of the chapter said brant so the reader went on  there is a sound they do not hear it but the door of the bedchamber behind them opens ever so little they do not see it but between door and lintel something white thrusts itself a womans white face crowned with black hair and set in it two evil staring eyes surely when first he raised his head in eden satan might have worn such a countenance as this it cranes itself forward till the long thin neck seems to stretch then suddenly a stir or a movement alarms it and back the face draws like the crest of a startled snake back it draws and the door closes again  the chapter is read the prayer is prayed and strange may seem the answer to that prayer an answer to shake out faith from the hearts of men men who are impatient who do not know that as the light takes long in travelling from a distant star so the answer from the throne to the supplication of trust may be long in coming it may not come today or tomorrow it may not come in this generation or this century the prayer of today may receive its crown when the childrens children of the lips that uttered it have in their turn vanished in the dust and yet that divine reply may in no wise be delayed even as our liberty of this hour may be the fruit of those who died when dirk van goorl and hendrik brant walked upon the earth even as the vengeance that but now is falling on the spaniard may be the reward of the deeds of shame that he worked upon them and upon their kin long generations gone for the throne is still the throne and the star is still the star from the one flows justice and from the other light and to them time and space are naught  dirk finished the chapter and closed the book  it seems that you have your answer brother said brant quietly  yes replied dirk it is written large enoughthe unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband    how knowest thou o man whether thou shalt save thy wife had the apostle foreseen my case he could not have set the matter forth more clearly  he or the spirit in him knew all cases and wrote for every man that ever shall be born answered brant this is a lesson to us had you looked sooner you would have learned sooner and mayhap much trouble might have been spared as it is without doubt you must make haste and speak to her at once leaving the rest with god  yes said dirk as soon as may be but there is one thing more ought i tell her all the truth  i should not be careful to hide it friend and now good night no do not come to the door with me who can tell there may be watchers without and it is not wise that we should be seen together so late    when his cousin and newfound friend had gone dirk sat for a while till the guttering tallow lights overhead burned to the sockets indeed then taking the candle from the snailadorned holder he lit it and having extinguished those in the chandeliers went into his bedroom and undressed himself the bible he returned to its hidingplace and closed the panel after which he blew out the light and climbed into the tall bed  as a rule dirk was a most excellent sleeper when he laid his head on the pillow his eyes closed nor did they open again until the appointed and accustomed hour but this night he could not sleep whether it was the dinner or the wine or the gambling or the prayer and the searching of the scriptures with his cousin brant the result remained the same he was very wakeful which annoyed him the more as a man of his race and phlegm found it hard to attribute this unrest to any of these trivial causes still as vexation would not make him sleep he lay awake watching the moonlight flood the chamber in broad bars and thinking  somehow as dirk thought thus he grew afraid it seemed to him as though he shared that place with another presence an evil and malignant presence never in his life before had he troubled over or been troubled by tales of spirits yet now he remembered montalvos remark about a ghost and of a surety he felt as though one were with him there in this strange and new alarm he sought for comfort and could think of none save that which an old and simple pastor had recommended to him in all hours of doubt and danger namely if it could be had to clasp a bible to his heart and pray  well both things were easy raising himself in bed in a moment he had taken the book from its hidingplace and closed the panel then pressing it against his breast between himself and the mattress he lay down again and it would seem that the charm worked for presently he was asleep  yet dirk dreamed a very evil dream he dreamed that a tall black figure leaned over him and that a long white hand was stretched out to his bedhead where it wandered to and fro till at last he heard the panel slide home with a rattling noise  then it seemed to him that he woke and that his eyes met two eyes bent down over him eyes which searched him as though they would read the very secrets of his heart he did not stir he could not but lo in this dream of his the figure straightened itself and glided away appearing and disappearing as it crossed the bars of moonlight until it vanished by the door  a while later and dirk woke up in truth to find that although the night was cold enough the sweat ran in big drops from his brow and body but now strangely enough his fear was gone and knowing that he had but dreamed a dream he turned over touched the bible on his breast and fell sleeping like a child to be awakened only by the light of the rising winter sun pouring on his face  then dirk remembered that dream of the bygone night and his heart grew heavy for it seemed to him that this vision of a dark woman searching his face with those dreadful eyes was a portent of evil not far away    chapter vi  the betrothal of lysbeth  on the following morning when montalvo entered his private room after breakfast he found a lady awaiting him in whom notwithstanding the long cloak and veil she wore he had little difficulty in recognising black meg in fact black meg had been waiting some while and being a person of industrious habits she had not neglected to use her time to the best advantage  the reader may remember that when meg visited the gallant captain montalvo upon a previous occasion she had taken the liberty of helping herself to certain papers which she found lying just inside an unlocked desk these papers on examination as she feared might be the case for the most part proved to be quite unimportantunpaid accounts military reports a billet or two from ladies and so forth but in thinking the matter over black meg remembered that this desk had another part to it which seemed to be locked and therefore just in case they should prove useful she took with her a few skeleton keys and one or two little instruments of steel and attended the pleasure of her noble patron at an hour when she believed that he would be at breakfast in another room things went well he was at breakfast and she was left alone in the chamber with the desk the rest may be guessed replacing the worthless bundle in the unlocked part by the aid of her keys and instruments she opened the inner half there sure enough were letters hidden and in a little drawer two miniatures framed in gold one of a lady young and pretty with dark eyes and the other of two children a boy and a girl of five or six years of age also there was a curling lock of hair labelled in montalvos writingjuanitas hair which she gave me as a keepsake  here was treasure indeed whereof black meg did not fail to possess herself thrusting the letters and other articles into the bosom of her dress to be examined at leisure she was clever enough before closing and relocking the desk to replace them with a dummy bundle hastily made up from some papers that lay about  when everything had been satisfactorily arranged she went outside and chattered for a while with the soldier on guard only reentering the room by one door as montalvo appeared in it through the other  well my friend he said have you the evidence  i have some evidence excellency she answered i was present at the dinner that you ate last night although none of it came my way andi was present afterwards  indeed i thought i saw you slip in and allow me to congratulate you on that it was very well thought out and done just as folk were moving up and down the stairs also when i went home i believe that i recognised a gentleman in the street whom i have been given to understand you honour with your friendship a short stout person with a bald head let me see he was called the butcher at the hague was he not no do not pout i have no wish to pry into the secrets of ladies but still in my position here it is my business to know a thing or two well what did you see  excellency i saw the young man i was sent to watch and hendrik brant the son of the rich goldsmith at the hague praying side by side upon their knees  that is bad very bad said montalvo shaking his head but  i saw she went on in her hoarse voice the pair of them read the bible  how shocking replied montalvo with a simulated shudder think of it my orthodox friend if you are to be believed these two persons hitherto supposed to be respectable have been discovered in the crime of consulting that work upon which our faith is founded well those who could read anything so dull must indeed as the edicts tell us be monsters unworthy to live but if you please your proofs of course you have this book  then black meg poured forth all her talehow she had watched and seen something how she had listened and heard little how she had gone to the secret panel bending over the sleeping man and foundnothing  you are a poor sort of spy mother commented the captain when she had done and upon my soul i do not believe that even a papal inquisitor could hang that young fellow on your evidence you must go back and get some more  no answered black meg with decision if you want to force your way into conventicles you had best do it yourself as i wish to go on living here is no job for me i have proved to you that this young man is a heretic so now give me my reward  your reward ah your reward no i think not at present for a reward presupposes servicesand i see none  black meg began to storm  be silent said montalvo dropping his bantering tone look i will be frank with you i do not want to burn anybody i am sick of all this nonsense about religion and for aught i care every netherlander in leyden may read the bible until he grows tired i seek to marry that jufvrouw lysbeth van hout and to do this i desire to prove that the man whom she loves dirk van goorl is a heretic what you have told me may or may not be sufficient for my purpose if it is sufficient you shall be paid liberally after my marriage if notwell you have had enough as for your evidence for my part i may say that i do not believe a word of it for were it true you would have brought the bible  as he spoke he rang a bell which stood upon a table and before meg could answer the soldier appeared  show this good woman out he said adding in a loud voice mother i will do my best for you and forward your petition to the proper quarter meanwhile take this trifle in charity and he pressed a florin into her hand now guard the prisoners the prisoners i have no time to wasteand listenlet me be troubled with no more beggars or you will hear of it    that afternoon dirk filled with a solemn purpose and dressed in his best suit called at the house in the bree straat where the door was again opened by greta who looked at him expectantly  is your mistress in he stammered i have come to see your mistress  alas mynheer answered the young woman you are just too late my mistress and her aunt the vrouw clara have gone away to stay for a week or ten days as the vrouw claras health required a change  indeed said dirk aghast and where have they gone  oh mynheer i do not know that they did not tell me and no other answer could he extract from her  so dirk went away discomfited and pondering an hour later the captain montalvo called and strange to say proved more fortunate by hook or by crook he obtained the address of the ladies who were visiting it appeared at a seaside village within the limits of a ride by a curious coincidence that very afternoon montalvo also seeking rest and change of air appeared at the inn of this village giving it out that he proposed to lodge there for a while  as he walked upon the beach next day whom should he chance to meet but the vrouw clara van ziel and never did the worthy clara spend a more pleasant morning so at least she declared to lysbeth when she brought her cavalier back to dinner  the reader may guess the rest montalvo paid his court and in due course montalvo was refused he bore the blow with a tender resignation  confess dear lady he said that there is some other man more fortunate  lysbeth did not confess but on the other hand neither did she deny  if he makes you happy i shall be more than satisfied the count murmured but lady loving you as i do i do not wish to see you married to a heretic  what do you mean senor asked lysbeth bridling  alas he answered i mean that as i fear the worthy heer dirk van goorl a friend of mine for whom i have every respect although he has outstripped me in your regard has fallen into that evil net  such accusations should not be made said lysbeth sternly unless they can be proved even then and she stopped  i will inquire further replied the swain for myself i accept the position that is until you learn to love me if such should be my fortune meanwhile i beg of you at least to look upon me as a friend a true friend who would lay down his life to serve you  then with many a sigh montalvo departed home to leyden upon his beautiful black horse but not before he had enjoyed a few minutes earnest conversation with the worthy tante clara  now if only this old lady were concerned he reflected as he rode away the matter might be easy enough and the saints know it would be one to me but unhappily that obstinate pig of a hollander girl has all the money in her own right in what labours do not the necessities of rank and station involve a man who by disposition requires only ease and quiet well my young friend lysbeth if i do not make you pay for these exertions before you are two months older my name is not juan de montalvo    three days later the ladies returned to leyden within an hour of their arrival the count called and was admitted  stay with me said lysbeth to her aunt clara as the visitor was announced and for a while she stayed then making an excuse she vanished from the room and lysbeth was left face to face with her tormentor  why do you come here she asked i have given you my answer  i come for your own sake he replied to give you my reasons for conduct which you may think strange you remember a certain conversation  perfectly broke in lysbeth  a slight mistake i think jufvrouw i mean a conversation about an excellent friend of yours whose spiritual affairs seem to interest you  what of it senor  only this i have made inquiries and  lysbeth looked up unable to conceal her anxiety  oh jufvrouw let me beg of you to learn to control your expression the open face of childhood is so dangerous in these days  he is my cousin  i know were he anything more i should be so grieved but we can most of us spare a cousin or two  if you would cease amusing yourself senor  and come to the point of course i will well the result of my inquiries has been to find out that this worthy person is a heretic of the most pernicious sort i said inquiries but there was no need for me to make any he has been  not denounced broke in lysbeth  oh my dear lady again that telltale emotion from which all sorts of things might be concluded yesdenouncedbut fortunately to myself as a person appointed under the edict it will i fear be my duty to have him arrested this eveningyou wish to sit down allow me to hand you a chairbut i shall not deal with the case myself indeed i propose to pass him over to the worthy ruard tapper the papal inquisitor you knowevery one has heard of the unpleasant tapperwho is to visit leyden next week and who no doubt will make short work of him  what has he done asked lysbeth in a low voice and bending down her head to hide the working of her features  done my dear lady it is almost too dreadful to tell you this misguided and unfortunate young man with another person whom the witnesses have not been able to identify was seen at midnight reading the bible  the bible why should that be wrong  hush are you also a heretic do you not know that all this heresy springs from the reading of the bible you see the bible is a very strange book it seems that there are many things in it which when read by an ordinary layman appear to mean this or that when read by a consecrated priest however they mean something quite different in the same way there are many doctrines which the layman cannot find in the bible that to the consecrated eye are plain as the sun and the moon the difference between heresy and orthodoxy is in short the difference between what can actually be found in the letter of this remarkable work and what is really thereaccording to their holinesses  almost thou persuadest me began lysbeth bitterly  hush ladyto be what you are an angel  there came a pause  what will happen to him asked lysbeth  afterafter the usual painful preliminaries to discover accomplices i presume the stake but possibly as he has the freedom of leyden he might get off with hanging  is there no escape  montalvo walked to the window and looking out of it remarked that he thought it was going to snow then suddenly he wheeled round and staring hard at lysbeth asked  are you really interested in this heretic and do you desire to save him  lysbeth heard and knew at once that the buttons were off the foils the bantering whimsical tone was gone now her tormentors voice was stern and cold the voice of a man who was playing for great stakes and meant to win them  she also gave up fencing  i am and i do she answered  then it can be doneat a price  what price  yourself in marriage within three weeks  lysbeth quivered slightly then sat still  would not my fortune do instead she asked  oh what a poor substitute you offer me montalvo said with a return to his hateful banter then he added that offer might be considered were it not for the abominable laws which you have here in practice it would be almost impossible for you to hand over any large sum much of which is represented by real estate to a man who is not your husband therefore i am afraid i must stipulate that you and your possessions shall not be separated  again lysbeth sat silent montalvo watching her with genuine interest saw signs of rebellion perchance of despair he saw the womans mental and physical loathing of himself conquering her fears for dirk unless he was much mistaken she was about to defy him which as a matter of fact would have proved exceedingly awkward as his pecuniary resources were exhausted also on the very insufficient evidence which he possessed he would not have dared to touch dirk and thus to make himself a thousand powerful enemies  it is strange he said that the irony of circumstances should reduce me to pleading for a rival but lysbeth van hout before you answer i beg you to think upon the next movements of your lips it depends whether that body you love shall be stretched upon the rack whether those eyes which you find pleasant shall grow blind with agony in the darkness of a dungeon and whether that flesh which you think desirable shall scorch and wither in the furnace or on the other hand whether none of these things shall happen whether this young man shall go free to be for a month or two a little piqueda little bitterabout the inconstancy of women and then to marry some opulent and respected heretic surely you could scarcely hesitate oh where is the selfsacrificing spirit of the sex of which we hear so much choose  still there was no answer montalvo playing his trump card drew from his vest an officiallooking document sealed and signed  this he said is the information to be given to the incorruptible ruard trapper look here written on it is your cousins name my servant waits for me in your kitchen if you hesitate any longer i call him and in your presence charge him to hand that paper to the messenger who starts this afternoon for brussels once given it cannot be recalled and the pious dirks doom is sealed  lysbeths spirit began to break how can i she asked it is true that we are not affianced perhaps for this very reason which i now learn but he cares for me and knows that i care for him must i then in addition to the loss of him be remembered all his life as little better than a lightoflove caught by the tricks and glitter of such a man as you i tell you that first i will kill myself  again montalvo went to the window for this hint of suicide was most disconcerting no one can marry a dead woman and lysbeth was scarcely likely to leave a will in his favour it seemed that what troubled her particularly was the fear lest the young man should think her conduct light well why should she not give him a reason which he would be the first to acknowledge as excellent for breaking with him could she a catholic be expected to wed a heretic and could he not be made to tell her that he was a heretic  behold an answer to his question the saints themselves desiring that this pearl of price should continue to rest in the bosom of the true church had interfered in his behalf for there in the street below was dirk van goorl approaching lysbeths door yes there he was dressed in his best burghers suit his brow knit with thought his step hesitating a very picture of the timid doubtful lover  lysbeth van hout said the count turning to her as it chances the heer dirk van goorl is at your door you will admit him and this matter can be settled one way or the other i wish to point out to you how needless it is that the young man should be left believing that you have treated him ill all which is necessary is that you should ask whether or no he is of your faith if i know him he will not lie to you then it remains only for you to sayfor doubtless the man comes here to seek your handthat however much it may grieve you to give such an answer you can take no heretic to husband do you understand  lysbeth bowed her head  then listen you will admit your suitor you will allow him to make his offer to you nowif he is so inclined you will before giving any answer ask him of his faith if he replies that he is a heretic you will dismiss him as kindly as you wish if he replies that he is a true servant of the church you will say that you have heard a different tale and must have time to make inquiries remember also that if by one jot you do otherwise than i have bid you when dirk van goorl leaves the room you see him for the last time unless it pleases youto attend his execution whereas if you obey and dismiss him finally as the door shuts behind him i put this information in the fire and satisfy you that the evidence upon which it is based is for ever deprived of weight and done with  lysbeth looked a question  i see you are wondering how i should know what you do or do not do it is simple i shall be the harmless but observant witness of your interview over this doorway hangs a tapestry you will grant me the privilegenot a great one for a future husbandof stepping behind it  never never said lysbeth i cannot be put to such a shame i defy you  as she spoke came the sound of knocking at the street door glancing up at montalvo for the second time she saw that look which he had worn at the crisis of the sledge race all its urbanity its careless bonhomie had vanished instead of these appeared a reflection of the last and innermost nature of the man the rock foundation as it were upon which was built the false and decorated superstructure that he showed to the world there were the glaring eyes there the grinning teeth of the spanish wolf a ravening brute ready to rend and tear if so he might satisfy himself with the meat his soul desired  dont play tricks with me he muttered and dont argue for there is no time do as i bid you girl or on your head will be this psalmsinging fellows blood and look you dont try setting him on me for i have my sword and he is unarmed if need be a heretic may be killed at sight you know that is by one clothed with authority when the servant announces him go to the door and order that he is to be admitted and picking up his plumed hat which might have betrayed him montalvo stepped behind the arras  for a moment lysbeth stood thinking alas she could see no possible escape she was in the toils the rope was about her throat either she must obey or so she thought she must give the man she loved to a dreadful death for his sake she would do it for his sake and might god forgive her might god avenge her and him  another instant and there came a knock upon the door she opened it  the heer van goorl stands below said the voice of greta wishing to see you madam  admit him answered lysbeth and going to a chair almost in the centre of the room she seated herself  presently dirks step sounded on the stair that known beloved step for which so often she had listened eagerly again the door opened and greta announced the heer van goorl that she could not see the captain montalvo evidently surprised the woman for her eyes roamed round the room wonderingly but she was too well trained or too well bribed to show her astonishment gentlemen of this kidney as greta had from time to time remarked have a faculty for vanishing upon occasion  so dirk walked into the fateful chamber as some innocent and unsuspecting creature walks into a bitter snare little knowing that the lady whom he loved and whom he came to win was set as a bait to ruin him  be seated cousin said lysbeth in a voice so forced and strained that it caused him to look up but he saw nothing for her head was turned away from him and for the rest his mind was too preoccupied to be observant by nature simple and open it would have taken much to wake dirk into suspicion in the home and presence of his love and cousin lysbeth  good day to you lysbeth he said awkwardly why how cold your hand is i have been trying to find you for some time but you have always been out or away leaving no address  i have been to the sea with my aunt clara she answered  then for a whilefive minutes or morethere followed a strained and stilted conversation  will the booby never come to the point reflected montalvo surveying him through a join in the tapestry by the saints what a fool he looks  lysbeth said dirk at last i want to speak to you  speak on cousin she answered  lysbeth iihave loved you for a long while and ihave come to ask you to marry me i have put it off for a year or more for reasons which i hope to tell you some day but i can keep silent no longer especially now when i see that a much finer gentleman is trying to win youi mean the spanish count montalvo he added with a jerk  she said nothing in reply so dirk went on pouring out all his honest passion in words that momentarily gathered weight and strength till at length they were eloquent enough he told her how since first they met he had loved her and only her and how his one desire in life was to make her happy and be happy with her pausing at length he began to speak of his prospectsthen she stopped him  your pardon dirk she said but i have a question to ask of you and her voice died away in a kind of sob i have heard rumours about you she went on presently which must be cleared up i have heard dirk that by faith you are what is called a heretic is it true  he hesitated before answering feeling that much depended on that answer but it was only for an instant since dirk was far too honest a man to lie  lysbeth he said i will tell to you what i would not tell to any other living creature not being one of my own brotherhood for whether you accept me or reject me i know well that i am as safe in speaking to you as when upon my knees i speak to the god i serve i am what you call a heretic i am a member of that true faith to which i hope to draw you but which if you do not wish it i should never press upon you it is chiefly because i am what i am that for so long i have hung back from speaking to you since i did not know whether it would be rightthings being thusto ask you to mix your lot with mine or whether i ought to marry you if you would marry me keeping this secret from you only the other night i sought counsel ofwell never mind of whomand we prayed together and together searched the word of god and there lysbeth by some wonderful mercy i found my prayer answered and my doubts solved for the great st paul had foreseen this case as in that book all cases are foreseen and i read how the unbelieving wife may be sanctified by the husband and the unbelieving husband by the wife then everything grew clear to me and i determined to speak and now dear i have spoken and it is for you to answer  dirk dear dirk she replied almost with a cry alas for the answer which i must give you renounce the error of your ways make confession and be reconciled to the church andi will marry you otherwise i cannot no and although i love you you and no other manhere she put an energy into her voice that was almost dreadfulwith all my heart and soul and body i cannot i cannot i cannot  dirk heard and his ruddy face turned ashen grey  cousin he replied you seek of me the one thing which i must not give even for your sake i may not renounce my vows and my god as i behold him though it break my heart to bid you farewell and live without you here i pay you back in your own wordsi cannot i cannot i cannot  lysbeth looked at him and lo his short massive form and his squarecut honest countenance in that ardour of renunciation had suffered a change to things almost divine at that momentto her sight at leastthis homely hollander wore the aspect of an angel she ground her teeth and pressed her hands upon her heart for his saketo save him she muttered to herselfthen she spoke  i respect you for it i love you for it more than ever but dirk it is over between us one day here or hereafter you will understand and you will forgive  so be it said dirk hastily stretching out his hand to find his hat for he was too blind to see it is a strange answer to my prayer a very strange answer but doubtless you are right to follow your lights as i am sure that i am right to follow mine we must carry our cross dear lysbeth each of us you see that we must carry our cross only i beg of youi dont speak as a jealous man because the thing has gone further than jealousyi speak as a friend and come what may while i live you will always find me thati beg of you beware of the spaniard montalvo i know that he followed you to the coast i have heard too he boasts that he will marry you the man is wicked although he took me in at first i feel ithis presence seems to poison the air yes this very air i breathe but oh and i should like him to hear me say it because i am sure that he is at the bottom of all this his hour will come for whatever he does he will be paid back he will be paid back here and hereafter and now goodbye god bless you and protect you dear lysbeth if you think it wrong you are quite right not to marry me and i know that you will keep my secret goodbye again and lifting her hand dirk kissed it then he stumbled from the room  as for lysbeth she cast herself at full length and in the bitterness of her heart beat her brow upon the boards    when the front door had shut behind dirk but not before montalvo emerged from his hiding place and stood over the prostrate lysbeth he tried to adopt his airy and sarcastic manner but he was shaken by the scene which he had overheard shaken and somewhat frightened also for he felt that he had called into being passions of which the force and fruits could not be calculated  bravo my little actress he began then gave it up and added in his natural voice you had best rise and see me burn this paper  lysbeth struggled to her knees and watched him thrust the document between two glowing peats  i have fulfilled my promise he said and that evidence is done with but in case you should think of playing any tricks and not fulfilling yours please remember that i have fresh evidence infinitely more valuable and convincing to gain which indeed i condescended to a stratagem not quite in keeping with my traditions with my own ears i heard this worthy gentleman who is pleased to think so poorly of me admit that he is a heretic that is enough to burn him any day and i swear that if within three weeks we are not man and wife burn he shall  while he was speaking lysbeth had risen slowly to her feet now she confronted him no longer the lysbeth whom he had known but a new being filled like a cup with fury that was the more awful because it was so quiet  juan de montalvo she said in a low voice your wickedness has won and for dirks sake my person and my goods must pay its price so be it since so it must be but listen i make no prophecies about you i do not say that this or that shall happen to you but i call down upon you the curse of god and the execration of men  then she threw up her hands and began to pray god whom it has pleased that i should be given to a fate far worse than death o god blast the mind and the soul of this monster let him henceforth never know a peaceful hour let misfortune come upon him through me and mine let fears haunt his sleep let him live in heavy labour and die in blood and misery and through me and if i bear children to him let the evil be upon them also  she ceased montalvo looked at her and tried to speak again he looked and again he tried to speak but no words would come  then the fear of lysbeth van hout fell upon him that fear which was to haunt him all his life he turned and crept from the room and his face was like the face of an old man nor notwithstanding the height of his immediate success could his heart have been more heavy if lysbeth had been an angel sent straight from heaven to proclaim to him the unalterable doom of god    chapter vii  hendrik brant has a visitor  nine months had gone by and for more then eight of them lysbeth had been known as the countess juan de montalvo indeed of this there could be no doubt since she was married with some ceremony by the bishop in the groote kerk before the eyes of all men folk had wondered much at these hurried nuptials though some of the more illnatured shrugged their shoulders and said that when a young woman had compromised herself by long and lonely drives with a spanish cavalier and was in consequence dropped by her own admirer why the best thing she could do was to marry as soon as possible  so the pair who looked handsome enough before the altar were wed and went to taste of such nuptial bliss as was reserved for them in lysbeths comfortable house in the bree straat here they lived almost alone for lysbeths countrymen and women showed their disapproval of her conduct by avoiding her company and for reasons of his own montalvo did not encourage the visiting of spaniards at his house moreover the servants were changed while tante clara and the girl greta had also disappeared indeed lysbeth finding out the false part which they had played towards her dismissed them both before her marriage  it will be guessed that after the events that led to their union lysbeth took little pleasure in her husbands society she was not one of those women who can acquiesce in marriage by fraud or capture and even learn to love the hand which snared them so it came about that to montalvo she spoke very seldom indeed after the first week of marriage she only saw him on rare occasions very soon he found out that his presence was hateful to her and turned her detestation to account with his usual cleverness in other words lysbeth bought freedom by parting with her propertyin fact a regular tariff was established so many guilders for a weeks liberty so many for a months  this was an arrangement that suited montalvo well enough for in his heart he was terrified of this woman whose beautiful face had frozen into a perpetual mask of watchful hatred he could not forget that frightful curse which had taken deep root in his superstitious mind and already seemed to flourish there for it was true that since she spoke it he had never known a quiet hour how could he when he was haunted night and day by the fear lest his wife should murder him  surely if ever death looked out of a womans eyes it looked out of hers and it seemed to him that such a deed might trouble her conscience little that she might consider it in the light of an execution and not as a murder bah he could not bear to think of it what would it be to drink his wine one day and then feel a hand of fire gripping at his vitals because poison had been set within the cup or worse still if anything could be worse to wake at night and find a stiletto point grating against his backbone little wonder that montalvo slept alone and was always careful to lock his door  he need not have taken such precautions whatever her eyes might say lysbeth had no intention of killing this man in that prayer of hers she had as it were placed the matter in the hand of a higher power and there she meant to leave it feeling quite convinced that although vengeance might tarry it would fall at last as for her money he could have it from the beginning her instinct told her that her husbands object was not amorous but purely monetary a fact of which she soon had plentiful proof and her great indeed her only hope was that when the wealth was gone he would go too an otter says the dutch proverb does not nest in a dry dyke  but oh what months those were what dreadful months from time to time she saw her husbandwhen he wanted cashand every night she heard him returning home often with unsteady steps twice or thrice a week also she was commanded to prepare a luxurious meal for himself and some six or eight companions to be followed by a gambling party at which the stakes ruled high then in the morning before he was up strange people would arrive jews some of them and wait till they could see him or catch him as he slipped from the house by a back way these men lysbeth discovered were duns seeking payment of old debts under such constant calls her fortune which if substantial was not great melted rapidly soon the ready money was gone then the shares in certain ships were sold then the land and the house itself were mortgaged  so the time went on    almost immediately after his refusal by lysbeth dirk van goorl had left leyden and returned to alkmaar where his father lived his cousin and friend however hendrik brant remained there studying the jewellers art under the great master of filigree work who was known as petrus one morning as hendrik was sitting at breakfast in his lodging it was announced that a woman who would not give her name wished to see him moved more by curiosity than by any other reason he ordered her to be admitted when she entered he was sorry for in the gaunt person and darkeyed face he recognised one against whom he had been warned by the elders of his church as a spy a creature who was employed by the papal inquisitors to get up cases against heretics and who was known as black meg  what is your business with me brant asked sternly  nothing to your hurt worthy heer believe me nothing to your hurt oh yes i know that tales are told against me who only earn an honest living in an honest way to keep my poor husband who is an imbecile once alas he followed that mad anabaptist fool john of leyden the fellow who set up as a king and said that men might have as many wives as they wished that was what sent my husband silly but thanks be to the saints he has repented of his errors and is reconciled to the church and christian marriage and now i who have a forgiving nature am obliged to support him  your business said brant  mynheer she answered dropping her husky voice you are a friend of the countess montalvo she who was lysbeth van hout  no i am acquainted with her that is all  at least you are a friend of the heer dirk van goorl who has left this town for alkmaar he who was her lover  yes i am his cousin but he is not the lover of any married woman  no no of course not love cannot look through a bridal veil can it still you are his friend and therefore perhaps her friend andshe isnt happy  indeed i know nothing of her present life she must reap the field which she has sown that door is shut  not altogether perhaps i thought it might interest dirk van goorl to learn that it is still ajar  i dont see why it should fish merchants are not interested in rotten herrings they write off the loss and send out the smack for a fresh cargo  the first fish we catch is ever the finest mynheer and if we havent quite caught it oh what a fine fish is that  i have no time to waste in chopping riddles what is your errand tell it or leave it untold but be quick  black meg leant forward and the hoarse voice sank to a cavernous whisper  what will you give me she asked if i prove to you that the captain montalvo is not married at all to lysbeth van hout  it does not much matter what i would give you for i saw the thing done in the groote kerk yonder  things are not always done that seem to be done  look here woman i have had enough of this and brant pointed to the door  black meg did not stir only she produced a packet from the bosom of her dress and laid it on the table  a man cant have two wives living at once can he  no i suppose notthat is legally  well if i show you that montalvo has two wives how much  brant became interested he hated montalvo he guessed indeed he knew something of the part which the man had played in this infamous affair and knew also that it would be a true kindness to lysbeth to rid her of him  if you proved it he said let us say two hundred florins  it is not enough mynheer  it is all i have to offer and mind you what i promise to pay  ah yes the other promises and doesnt paythe rogue the rogue she added striking a bony fist upon the table well i agree and i ask no bond for you merchant folk are not like cavaliers your word is as good as your paper now read these and she opened the packet and pushed its contents towards him  with the exception of two miniatures which he placed upon one side they were letters written in spanish and in a very delicate hand brant knew spanish well and in twenty minutes he had read them all they proved to be epistles from a lady who signed herself juanita de montalvo written to the count juan de montalvo whom she addressed as her husband very piteous documents they were also telling a tale that need not be set out here of heartless desertion pleading for the writers sake and for the sake of certain children that the husband and father would return to them or at least remit them means to live for they his wife and family were sunk in great poverty  all this is sad enough said brant with a gesture of disgust as he glanced at the miniature of the lady and her children but it proves nothing how are we to know that she is the mans wife  black meg put her hand into the bosom of her dress and produced another letter dated not more than three months ago it was or purported to be written by the priest of the village where the lady lived and was addressed to the captain the count juan de montalvo at leyden in substance this epistle was an earnest appeal to the noble count from one who had a right to speak as the man who had christened him taught him and married him to his wife either to return to her or to forward her the means to join him a dreadful rumour the letter ended has reached us here in spain that you have taken to wife a dutch lady at leyden named van hout but this i do not believe since never could you have committed such a crime before god and man write write at once my son and disperse this black cloud of scandal which is gathering on your honoured and ancient name  how did you come by these woman asked brant  the last i had from a priest who brought it from spain i met him at the hague and offered to deliver the letter as he had no safe means of sending it to leyden the others and the pictures i stole out of montalvos room  indeed most honest merchant and what might you have been doing in his excellencys room  i will tell you she answered for as he never gave me my pay my tongue is loosed he wished for evidence that the heer dirk van goorl was a heretic and employed me to find it  brants face hardened and he became more watchful  why did he wish such evidence  to use it to prevent the marriage of jufvrouw lysbeth with the heer dirk van goorl  how  meg shrugged her shoulders by telling his secret to her so that she might dismiss him i suppose or more likely by threatening that if she did not he would hand her lover over to the inquisitors  i see and did you get the evidence  well i hid in the heer dirks bedroom one night and looking through a door saw him and another young man whom i do not know reading the bible and praying together  indeed what a terrible risk you must have run for had those young men or either of them chanced to catch you it is quite certain that you would not have left that room alive you know these heretics think that they are justified in killing a spy at sight and upon my word i do not blame them in fact my good woman and he leaned forward and looked her straight in the eyes were i in the same position i would have knocked you on the head as readily as though you had been a rat  black meg shrank back and turned a little blue about the lips  of course mynheer of course it is a rough game and the poor agents of god must take their risks not that the other young man had any cause to fear i wasnt paid to watch him andas i have saidi neither know nor care who he is  well who can say that may be fortunate for you especially if he should ever come to know or to care who you are but it is no affair of ours is it now give me those letters what do you want your money first very well and rising brant went to a cupboard and produced a small steel box which he unlocked and having taken from it the appointed sum locked it again there you are he said oh you neednt stare at the cupboard the box wont live there after today or anywhere in this house by the way i understand that montalvo never paid you  not a stiver she answered with a sudden access of rage the low thief he promised to pay me after his marriage but instead of rewarding her who put him in that warm nest i tell you that already he has squandered every florin of the noble ladys money in gambling and satisfying such debts as he was obliged to so that today i believe that she is almost a beggar  i see said brant and now good morning and look you if we should chance to meet in the town you will understand that i do not know you  i understand mynheer said black meg with a grin and vanished  when she had gone brant rose and opened the window bah he said the air is poisoned but i think i frightened her i think that i have nothing to fear yet who can tell my god she saw me reading the bible and montalvo knows it well it is some time ago now and i must take my chance  ah who could tell indeed  then taking the miniatures and documents with him brant started to call upon his friend and coreligionist the heer pieter van de werff dirk van goorls friend and lysbeths cousin a young man for whose judgment and abilities he had a great respect as a result of this visit these two gentlemen left that afternoon for brussels the seat of government where they had very influential friends  it will be sufficient to tell the upshot of their visit just at that time the government of the netherlands wished for its own reasons to stand well with the citizen class and when those in authority learned of the dreadful fraud that had been played off upon a lady of note who was known to be a good catholic for the sole object of robbing her of her fortune there was indignation in high places indeed an order was issued signed by a hand which could not be resistedso deeply was one woman moved by the tale of anothers wrongthat the count montalvo should be seized and put upon his trial just as though he were any common netherland malefactor moreover since he was a man with many enemies no one was found to stand between him and the royal decree    three days later montalvo made an announcement to lysbeth for a wonder he was supping at home alone with his wife whose presence he had commanded she obeyed and attended sitting at the further end of the table whence she rose from time to time to wait upon him with her own hands watching him the while with her quiet eyes she noticed that he was ill at ease  cannot you speak he asked at last and savagely do you think it is pleasant for a man to sit opposite a woman who looks like a corpse in her coffin till he wishes she were one  so do i answered lysbeth and again there was silence  presently she broke it what do you want she asked more money  of course i want money he answered furiously  then there is none everything has gone and the notary tells me that no one will advance another stiver on the house all my jewellery is sold also  he glanced at her hand you have still that ring he said  she looked at it it was a hoop of gold set with emeralds of considerable value which her husband had given her before marriage and always insisted upon her wearing in fact it had been bought with the money which he borrowed from dirk van goorl  take it she said smiling for the first time and drawing off the ring she passed it over to him he turned his head aside as he stretched his hand towards the trinket lest his face should betray the shame which even he must feel  if your child should be a son he muttered tell him that his father had nothing but a piece of advice to leave him that he should never touch a dicebox  are you going away then she asked  for a week or two i must i have been warned that a difficulty has arisen about which i need not trouble you doubtless you will hear of it soon enough and though it is not true i must leave leyden until the thing blows over in fact i am going now  you are about to desert me she answered having got all my money i say that you are going to desert me who amthus i see it in your face  montalvo turned away and pretended not to hear  well thank god for it lysbeth added only i wish that you could take your memory and everything else of yours with you  as these bitter words passed her lips the door opened and there entered one of his own subalterns followed by four soldiers and a man in a lawyers robe  what is this asked montalvo furiously  the subaltern saluted as he entered  my captain forgive me but i act under orders and they are to arrest you alive or he added significantly dead  upon what charge asked montalvo  here notary you had best read the charge said the subaltern but perhaps the lady would like to retire first he added awkwardly  no answered lysbeth it might concern me  alas senora i fear it does put in the notary then he began to read the document which was long and legal but she was quick to understand before ever it was done lysbeth knew that she was not the lawful wife of count juan de montalvo and that he was to be put upon his trial for his betrayal of her and the trick he had played the church so she was freefree and overcome by that thought she staggered fell and swooned away  when her eyes opened again montalvo officer notary and soldiers all had vanished    chapter viii  the mares stable  when lysbeths reason returned to her in that empty room her first sense was one of wild exultation she was free she was not montalvos wife never again could she be obliged to see him never again could she be forced to endure the contamination of his touchthat was her thought she was sure that the story was true were it not true who could have moved the authorities to take action against him moreover now that she had the key a thousand things were explained trivial enough in themselves each of them but in their sum amounting to proof positive of his guilt had he not spoken of some entanglement in spain and of children had he not in his sleepbut it was needless to remember all these things she was free she was free and there on the table still lay the symbol of her bondage the emerald ring that was to give him the means of flight a flight from this charge which he knew was hanging over him she took it up dashed it to the ground and stamped upon it next she fell upon her knees praising and blessing god and then worn out crept away to rest  the morning came the still and beautiful autumn morning but now all her exultation had left her and lysbeth was depressed and heavy hearted she rose and assisted the one servant who remained in the house to prepare their breakfast taking no heed of the sidelong glances that the woman cast at her afterwards she went to the market to spend some of her last florins in necessaries here and in the streets she became aware that she was the object of remark for people nudged each other and stared at her moreover as she hurried home appalled her quick ear caught the conversation of two coarse women while they walked behind her  shes got it now said one  serve her right too answered the other for running after and marrying a spanish don  marrying broke in the first it was the best that she could do she couldnt stop to ask questions some corpses must be buried quickly  glancing behind her lysbeth saw the creature nip her nostrils with her fingers as though to shut out an evil smell  then she could bear it no longer and turned upon them  you are evil slanderers she said and walked away swiftly pursued by the sound of their loud insulting laughter  at the house she was told that two men were waiting to see her they proved to be creditors clamouring for large sums of money which she could not pay lysbeth told them that she knew nothing of the matter thereupon they showed her her own writing at the foot of deeds and she remembered that she had signed more things than she chose to keep count of everything indeed that the man who called himself her husband put before her if only to win an hour of blessed freedom from his presence at length the duns went away vowing that they would have their money if they dragged the bed from under her  after that came loneliness and silence no friend appeared to cheer her indeed she had no friends left for by her husbands command she had broken off her acquaintance with all who after the strange circumstances connected with her marriage were still inclined to know her he said that he would have no chattering dutch vrouws about the house and they said and believed that the countess de montalvo had become too proud to associate with those of her own class and people  midday came and she could eat no food indeed she had touched none for twentyfour hours her gorge rose against it although in her state she needed food now the shame of her position began to come home to lysbeth she was a wife and no wife soon she must bear the burden of motherhood and oh what would that child be and what should she be its mother what too would dirk think of her dirk for whom she had done and suffered all these things through the long afternoon hours she lay upon her bed thinking such thoughts as these till at length her mind gave and lysbeth grew lightheaded her brain became a chaos a perfect hell of distorted imaginations  then out of its turmoil and confusion rose a vision and a desire a vision of peace and a desire for rest but what rest was there for her except the rest of death well why not die god would forgive her the mother of god would plead for her who was shamed and brokenhearted and unfit to live even dirk would think kindly of her when she was dead though doubtless now if he met her he would cover his eyes with his hand she was burning hot and she was thirsty how cool the water would be on this fevered night what could be better than to slip into it and slowly let it close above her poor aching head she would go out and look at the water in that at any rate there could be no harm  she wrapped herself in a long cloak and drew its hood over her head then she slipped from the house and stole like a ghost through the darkling streets and out of the maren or sea poort where the guard let her pass thinking that she was a country woman returning to her village now the moon was rising and by the light of it lysbeth recognised the place here was the spot where she had stood on the day of the ice carnival when that woman who was called martha the mare and who said that she had known her father had spoken to her on that water she had galloped in montalvos sledge and up yonder canal the race was run she followed along its banks remembering the reedy mere some miles away spotted with islets that were only visited from time to time by fishermen and wildfowlers the great haarlemer meer which covered many thousands of acres of ground that mere she felt must look very cool and beautiful on such a night as this and the wind would whisper sweetly among the tall bulrushes which fringed its banks  on lysbeth went and on it was a long long walk but at last she came there and oh the place was sweet and vast and lonely for so far as her eye could reach in the light of the low moon there was nothing but glimmering water broken here and there by the reedwreathed islands hark how the frogs croaked and the bitterns boomed among the rushes look where the wild ducks swam leaving behind them broad trails of silver as their breasts broke the surface of the great mere into rippling lines  there on an island not a bowshot from her grew tufts of a daisylike marsh bloom white flowers such as she remembered gathering when she was a child a desire came upon her to pluck some of these flowers and the water was shallow surely she could wade to the island or if not what did it matter then she could turn to the bank again or she might stay to sleep a while in the water what did it matter she stepped from the bankhow sweet and cool it felt to her feet now it was up to her knees now it reached her middle and now the little wavelets beat against her breast but she would not go back for there ahead of her was the island and the white flowers were so close that she could count them eight upon one bunch and twelve upon the next another step and the water struck her in the face one more and it closed above her head she rose and a low cry broke from her lips  then as in a dream lysbeth saw a skiff glide out from among the rushes before her she saw also a strange mutilated face which she remembered dimly bending over the edge of the boat and a long brown hand stretched out to clasp her while a hoarse voice bade her keep still and fear nothing  after this came a sound of singing in her ears anddarkness    when lysbeth woke again she found herself lying upon the ground or rather upon a soft mattress of dry reeds and aromatic grasses looking round her she saw that she was in a hut reedroofed and plastered with thick mud in one corner of this hut stood a fireplace with a chimney artfully built of clay and on the fire of turfs boiled an earthen pot hanging from the roof by a string of twisted grass was a fish fresh caught a splendid pike and near to it a bunch of smoked eels over her also was thrown a magnificent rug of otter skins noting these things she gathered that she must be in the hovel of some fisherman  now by degrees the past came back to lysbeth and she remembered her parting with the man who called himself her husband remembered also her moonlight flight and how she had waded out into the waters of the great mere to pluck the white flowers and how as they closed above her head a hand had been stretched out to save her lysbeth remembered and remembering she sighed aloud the sound of her sighing seemed to attract the attention of some one who was listening outside the hut at any rate a rough door was opened or pushed aside and a figure entered  are you awake lady asked a hoarse voice  yes answered lysbeth but tell me how did i come here and who are you  the figure stepped back so that the light from the open door fell full upon it look carolus van houts daughter and juan montalvos wife those who have seen me once do not forget me  lysbeth sat up on the bed and stared at the gaunt powerful form the deepset grey eyes the widespread nostrils the scarred high cheekbones the teeth made prominent by some devils work upon the lips and the grizzled lock of hair that hung across the forehead in an instant she knew her  you are martha the mare she said  yes i am the mare none other and you are in the mares stable what has he been doing to you that spanish dog that you came last night to ask the great water to hide you and your shame  lysbeth made no answer the story seemed hard to begin with this strange woman then martha went on  what did i tell you lysbeth van hout did i not say that your blood should warn you against the spaniards well well you saved me from the ice and i have saved you from the water ah who was it that led me to row round by that outer isle last night because i could not sleep but what does it matter god willed it so and here you lie in the mares stable nay do not answer me first you must eat  then going to the pot she took it from the fire pouring its contents into an earthen basin and at the smell of them for the first time for days lysbeth felt hungry of what that stew was compounded she never learned but she ate it to the last spoonful and was thankful while martha seated on the ground beside her watched her with delight from time to time stretching out a long thin hand to touch the brown hair that hung about her shoulders  come out and look said martha when her guest had done eating and she led her through the doorway of the hut  lysbeth gazed round her but in truth there was not much to see the hut itself was hidden away in a little clump of swamp willows that grew upon a mound in the midst of a marshy plain broken here and there by patches of reed and bulrushes walking across this plain for a hundred yards or so they came to more reeds and in them a boat hidden cunningly for here was the water of the lake and not fifty paces away what seemed to be the shore of an island the mare bade her get into the boat and rowed her across to this island then round it to another and thence to another and yet another  now tell me she said upon which of them is my stable built  lysbeth shook her head helplessly  you cannot tell no nor any living man i say that no man lives who could find it save i myself who know the path there by night or by day look and she pointed to the vast surface of the mere on this great sea are thousands of such islets and before they find me the spaniards must search them all for here upon the lonely waters no spies or hound will help them then she began to row again without even looking round and presently they were in the clump of reeds from which they had started  i must be going home faltered lysbeth  no answered martha it is too late you have slept long look the sun is westering fast this night you must stop with me oh do not be afraid my fare is rough but it is sweet and fresh and plenty fish from the mere as much as you will for who can catch them better than i and waterfowl that i snare yes and their eggs moreover dried flesh and bacon which i get from the mainland for there i have friends whom sometimes i meet at night  so lysbeth yielded for the great peace of this lake pleased her oh after all that she had gone through it was like heaven to watch the sun sinking towards the quiet water to hear the wildfowl call to see the fish leap and the halcyons flash by and above all to be sure that by nothing short of a miracle could this divine silence broken only by natures voices be defiled with the sound of the hated accents of the man who had ruined and betrayed her yes she was weary and a strange unaccustomed langour crept over her she would rest there this night also  so they went back to the hut and made ready their evening meal and as she fried the fish over the fire of peats verily lysbeth found herself laughing like a girl again then they ate it with appetite and after it was done mother martha prayed aloud yes and without fear although she knew lysbeth to be a catholic read from her one treasure a testament crouching there in the light of the fire and saying  see lady what a place this is for a heretic to hide in where else may a woman read from the bible and fear no spy or priest remembering a certain story lysbeth shivered at her words  now said the mare when she had finished reading tell me before you sleep what it was that brought you into the waters of the haarlemer meer and what that spanish man has done to you do not be afraid for though i am mad or so they say i can keep counsel and between you and me are many bonds carolus van houts daughter some of which you know and see and some that you can neither know nor see but which god will weave in his own season  lysbeth looked at the weird countenance distorted and made unhuman by long torment of body and mind and found in it something to trust yes even signs of that sympathy which she so sorely needed so she told her all the tale from the first word of it to the last  the mare listened in silence for no story of evil perpetrated by a spaniard seemed to move or astonish her only when lysbeth had done she said  ah child had you but known of me and where to find me you should have asked my aid  why mother what could you have done answered lysbeth  done i would have followed him by night until i found my chance in some lonely place and there i would have then she stretched out her bony hand to the red light of the fire and lysbeth saw that in it was a knife  she sank back aghast  why are you frightened my pretty lady asked the mare i tell you that i live on for only one thingto kill spaniards yes priests first and then the others oh i have a long count to pay for every time that he was tortured a life for every groan he uttered at the stake a life yes so many for the father and half as many for the son well i shall live to be old i know that i shall live to be old and the count will be discharged ay to the last stiver  as she spoke the outlawed water wife had risen and the flare of the fire struck full upon her it was an awful face that lysbeth beheld by the light of it full of fierceness and energy the face of an inspired avenger dread and unnatural yet not altogether repulsive indeed that countenance was such as an imaginative artist might give to one of the beasts in the book of revelation amazed and terrified lysbeth said nothing  i frighten you gentle one went on the mare you who although you have suffered are still full of the milk of human kindness wait woman wait till they have murdered the man you love till your heart is like my heart and you also live on not for loves sake not for lifes sake but to be a sword a sword a sword in the hand of god  cease i pray you said lysbeth in a low voice i am faint i am ill  ill she was indeed and before morning there in that lonely hovel on the island of the mere a son was born to her    when she was strong enough her nurse spoke  will you keep the brat or shall i kill it she asked  how can i kill my child said lysbeth  it is the spaniards child also and remember the curse you told me of your own curse uttered on this thing before ever you were married if it lives that curse shall cling to it and through it you too shall be accursed best let me kill it and have done  how can i kill my own child touch it not answered lysbeth sullenly  so the blackeyed boy lived and throve    somewhat slowly lying there in the island hut lysbeth won back her strength the mare or mother martha as lysbeth had now learned to call her tended her as few midwives would have done food too she had in plenty for martha snared the fowl and caught the fish or she made visits to the mainland and thence brought eggs and milk and flesh which so she said the boors of that country gave her as much as she wanted of them also to while away the hours she would read to her out of the testament and from that reading lysbeth learnt many things which until then she had not known indeed before it was done withcatholic though she wasshe began to wonder in what lay the wickedness of these heretics and how it came about that they were worthy of death and torment since sooth to say in this book she could find no law to which their lives and doctrine seemed to give offence  thus it happened that martha the fierce halfcrazy waterdweller sowed the seed in lysbeths heart that was to bear fruit in due season  when three weeks had gone by and lysbeth was on her feet again though as yet scarcely strong enough to travel martha told her that she had business which would keep her from home a night but what the business was she refused to say accordingly on a certain afternoon having left good store of all things to lysbeths hand the mare departed in her skiff nor did she return till after midday on the morrow now lysbeth talked of leaving the island but martha would not suffer it saying that if she desired to go she must swim and indeed when lysbeth went to look she found that the boat had been hidden elsewhere so nothing loth she stayed on and in the crisp autumn air her health and beauty came back to her till she was once more much as she had been before the day when she went sledging with juan de montalvo  on a november morning leaving her infant in the hut with martha who had sworn to her on the bible that she would not harm it lysbeth walked to the extremity of the island during the night the first sharp frost of late autumn had fallen making a thin film of ice upon the surface of the lake which melted rapidly as the sun grew high the air too was very clear and calm and among the reeds now turning golden at their tips the finches flew and chirped forgetful that winter was at hand so sweet and peaceful was the scene that lysbeth also forgetful of many things surveyed it with a kind of rapture she knew not why but her heart was happy that morning it was as though a dark cloud had passed from her life as though the blue skies of peace and joy were spread about her doubtless other clouds might appear upon the horizon doubtless in their season they would appear but she felt that this horizon was as yet a long way off and meanwhile above her bent the tender sky serene and sweet and happy  upon the crisp grass behind her suddenly she heard a footfall a new footfall not that of the long stealthy stride of martha who was called the mare and swung round upon her heel to meet it  oh god who was this oh god there before her stood dirk van goorl dirk and no other than dirk unless she dreamed dirk with his kind face wreathed in a happy smile dirk with his arms outstretched towards her lysbeth said nothing she could not speak only she stood still gazing gazing gazing and always he came on till now his arms were round her then she sprang back  do not touch me she cried remember what i am and why i stay here  i know well what you are lysbeth he answered slowly you are the holiest and purest woman who ever walked this earth you are an angel upon this earth you are the woman who gave her honour to save the man she loved oh be silent be silent i have heard the story i know it every word and here i kneel before you and next to my god i worship you lysbeth i worship you  but the child she murmured it lives and it is mine and the mans  dirks face hardened a little but he only answered  we must bear our burdens you have borne yours i must bear mine and he seized her hands and kissed them yes and the hem of her garment and kissed it also  so these two plighted their troth  afterwards lysbeth heard all the story montalvo had been put upon his trial and as it chanced things went hard with him among his judges one was a great netherlander lord who desired to uphold the rights of his countrymen one was a high ecclesiastic who was furious because of the fraud that had been played upon the church which had been trapped into celebrating a bigamous marriage and a third was a spanish grandee who as it happened knew the family of the first wife who had been deserted  therefore for the luckless montalvo when the case had been proved to the hilt against him by the evidence of the priest who brought the letter of the wifes letters and of the truculent black meg who now found an opportunity of paying back hot water for cold there was little mercy his character was bad and it was said moreover that because of his cruelties and the shame she had suffered at his hands lysbeth van hout had committed suicide at least this was certain that she was seen running at night towards the haarlemer meer and that after this search as her friends would nothing more could be heard of her  so that an example might be made although he writhed and fenced his best the noble captain count juan de montalvo was sent to serve for fourteen years in the galleys as a common slave and there for the while was an end of him    there also was an end of the strange and tragic courtship of dirk van goorl and lysbeth van hout  six months afterwards they were married and by dirks wish took the child who was christened adrian to live with them a few months later lysbeth entered the community of the new religion and less than two years after her marriage a son was born to her the hero of this story who was named foy  as it happened she bore no other children      book the second  the ripening    chapter ix  adrian foy and martin the red  many years had gone by since lysbeth found her love again upon the island in the haarlemer meer the son that she bore there was now a grown man as was her second son foy and her own hair showed grey beneath the lappets of her cap  fast fast wove the loom of god during those fateful years and the web thereof was the story of a peoples agony and its woof was dyed red with their blood edict had followed edict crime had been heaped upon crime alva like some inhuman and incarnate vengeance had marched his army quiet and harmless as is the tiger when he stalks his prey across the fields of france now he was at brussels and already the heads of the counts egmont and hoorn had fallen already the blood council was established and at its work in the low countries law had ceased to exist and there anything might happen however monstrous or inhuman indeed with one decree of the holy office confirmed by a proclamation of philip of spain all the inhabitants of the netherlands three millions of them had been condemned to death mens minds were full of terror for on every side were burnings and hangings and torturings without were fightings within were fears and none knew whom they could trust since the friend of today might be the informer or judge of tomorrow all this because they chose to worship god in their own fashion unaided by images and priests    although so long a time had passed as it chanced those personages with whom we have already made acquaintance in this history were still alive let us begin with two of them one of whom we know and one of whom although we have heard of him before will require some introductiondirk van goorl and his son foy    scenean upper room above a warehouse overlooking the marketplace of leyden a room with small windows and approached by two staircases time a summer twilight the faint light which penetrated into this chamber through the unshuttered windows for to curtain them would have been to excite suspicion showed that about twenty people were gathered there among whom were one or two women for the most part they were men of the better class middleaged burghers of sober mien some of whom stood about in knots while others were seated upon stools and benches at the end of the room addressing them was a man well on in middle life with grizzled hair and beard small and somewhat mean of stature yet one through whose poor exterior goodness seemed to flow like light through some rough casement of horn this was jan arentz the famous preacher by trade a basketmaker a man who showed himself steadfast to the new religion through all afflictions and who was gifted with a spirit which could remain unmoved amidst the horrors of perhaps the most terrible persecution that christians have suffered since the days of the roman emperors he was preaching now and these people were his congregation  i come not to bring peace but a sword was his text and certainly this night it was most appropriate and one easy of illustration for there on the very marketplace beneath them guarded by soldiers and surrounded with the rabble of the city two members of his flock men who a fortnight before had worshipped in that same room at this moment were undergoing martyrdom by fire  arentz preached patience and fortitude he went back into recent history and told his hearers how he himself had passed a hundred dangers how he had been hunted like a wolf how he had been tried how he had escaped from prisons and from the swords of soldiers even as st paul had done before him and how yet he lived to minister to them this night he told them that they must have no fear that they must go on quite happy quite confident taking what it pleased god to send them feeling that it would all be for the best yes that even the worst would be for the best what was the worst some hours of torment and death and what lay beyond the death ah let them think of that the whole world was but a brief and varying shadow what did it matter how or when they walked out of that shadow into the perfect light the sky was very black but behind it the sun shone they must look forward with the eye of faith perhaps the sufferings of the present generation were part of the scheme of things perhaps from the earth which they watered with their blood would spring the flower of freedom that glorious freedom in whose day all men would be able to worship their creator responsible only to the bible law and their own conscience not to the dogmas or doctrines of other men  as arentz spoke thus eloquently sweetly spoke like one inspired the twilight deepened and the flare of those sacrificial fires flickered on the window pane and the mixed murmurs of the crowd of witnesses broke upon his listeners ears the preacher paused and looked down upon the dreadful scene below for from where he stood he could behold it all  mark is dead he said and our dear brother andreas jansen is dying the executioners heap the faggots round him you think it cruel you think it piteous but i say to you no i say that it is a holy and a glorious sight for we witness the passing of souls to bliss brethren let us pray for him who leaves us and for ourselves who stay behind yes and let us pray for those who slay him that know not what they do we watch his sufferings but i tell you that christ his lord watches also christ who hung upon the cross the victim of such men as these he stands with him in the fire his hand compasses him his voice supports him brethren let us pray  then at his bidding every member of that little congregation knelt in prayer for the passing spirit of andreas jansen  again arentz looked through the window  he dies he cried a soldier has thrust him through with a pike in mercy his head falls forward oh god if it be thy will grant to us a sign  some strange breath passed through that upper chamber a cold breath which blew upon the brows of the worshippers and stirred their hair bringing with it a sense of the presence of andreas jansen the martyr then there upon the wall opposite to the window at the very spot where their brother and companion andreas saint and martyr was wont to kneel appeared the sign or what they took to be a sign yes there upon the whitewashed wall reflected mayhap from the fires below and showing clearly in the darkened room shone the vision of a fiery cross for a second it was seen then it was gone but to every soul in this room the vision of that cross had brought its message to each a separate message an individual inspiration for in the light of it they read strange lessons of life and death the cross vanished and there was silence  brethren said the voice of arentz speaking in the darkness you have seen through the fire and through the shadow follow the cross and fear not    the service was over and below in the emptied marketplace the executioners collected the poor calcined fragments of the martyrs to cast them with contumely and filthy jests into the darkling waters of the river now one by one and two by two the worshippers slipped away through some hidden door opening on an alley let us look at three of their number as they crept through bye streets back to a house on the bree straat with which we are acquainted two of them walking in front and one behind  the pair were dirk van goorl and his son foythere was no mistaking their relationship save that he had grown somewhat portly and thoughtful dirk was the dirk of five and twenty years ago thickset greyeyed bearded a handsome man according to the dutch standard whose massive kindly countenance betrayed the massive kindly mind within very like him was his son foy only his eyes were blue instead of grey and his hair was yellow though they seemed sad enough just now these were merry and pleasant eyes and the round the somewhat childlike face was merry also the face of a person who looked upon the bright side of things  there was nothing remarkable or distinguished about foys appearance but from it the observer who met him for the first time received an impression of energy honesty and goodnature in truth such were apt to set him down as a sailorman who had just returned from a long journey in the course of which he had come to the conclusion that this world was a pleasant place and one well worth exploring as foy walked down the street with his quick and nautical gait it was evident that even the solemn and dreadful scene which he had just experienced had not altogether quenched his cheery and hopeful spirit yet of all those who listened to the exhortation of the saintlike arentz none had laid its burden of faith and carelessness for the future to heart more entirely than foy van goorl  but of this power of looking on the bright side of things the credit must be given to his nature and not to his piety for foy could not be sad for long dum spiro spero would have been his motto had he known latin and he did not mean to grow sorrowfulover the prospect of being burnt for instanceuntil he found himself fast to the stake it was this quality of good spirits in a depressing and melancholy age that made of foy so extraordinarily popular a character  behind these two followed a much more remarkablelooking personage the frisian martin roos or red martin so named from his hair which was red to the verge of flame colour and his beard of a like hue that hung almost to his breast there was no other such beard in leyden indeed the boys taking advantage of his good nature would call to him as he passed asking him if it was true that the storks nested in it every spring this strangelooking man who was now perhaps a person of forty years of age for ten years or more had been the faithful servant of dirk van goorl whose house he had entered under circumstances which shall be told of in their place  any one glancing at martin casually would not have said that he was a giant and yet his height was considerable to be accurate when he stood upright something over six feet three inches the reason why he did not appear to be tall was that in truth his great bulk shortened him to the eye and also because his carried himself ill more from a desire to conceal his size than for any other reason it was in girth of chest and limb that martin was really remarkable so much so that a shortarmed man standing before him could not make his fingers touch behind his back his face was fair as a girls and almost as flat as a full moon for of nose he had little nature indeed had furnished him with one of ordinary if not excessive size but certain incidents in martins early career which in our day would be designated as that of a prizefighter had caused it to spread about his countenance in an interesting and curious fashion his eyebrows however remained prominent beneath them appeared a pair of very large round and rather mild blue eyes covered with thick white lids absolutely devoid of lashes which eyes had a most unholy trick of occasionally taking fire when their owner was irritated then they could burn and blaze like lamps tied to a barge on a dark night with an effect that was all the more alarming because the rest of his countenance remained absolutely impassive  suddenly while this little company went homewards a sound arose in the quiet street as of people running instantly all three of them pressed themselves into the doorway of a house and crouched down martin lifted his ear and listened  three people he whispered a woman who flies and two men who follow  at that moment a casement was thrown open forty paces or so away and a hand bearing a torch thrust out of it by its light they saw the pale face of a lady speeding towards them and after her two spanish soldiers  the vrouw andreas jansen whispered martin again flying from two of the guard who burned her husband  the torch was withdrawn and the casement shut with a snap in those days quiet burghers could not afford to be mixed up in street troubles especially if soldiers had to do with them once more the place was empty and quiet except for the sound of running feet  opposite to the doorway the lady was overtaken oh let me go she sobbed oh let me go is it not enough that you have killed my husband why must i be hunted from my house thus  because you are so pretty my dear answered one of the brutes also you are rich catch hold of her friend lord how she kicks  foy made a motion as though to start out of the doorway but martin pressed him back with the flat of his hand without apparent effort and yet so strongly that the young man could not move  my business masters he muttered you would make a noise and they heard his breath come thick  now moving with curious stealthiness for one of so great a bulk martin was out of the porch by the summer starlight the watchers could see that before they had caught sight of or even heard him he gripped the two soldiers small men like most spaniards by the napes of their necks one in either hand and was grinding their faces together this indeed was evident for his great shoulders worked visibly and their breastplates clicked as they touched but the men themselves made no sound at all then martin seemed to catch them round the middle and behold in another second the pair of them had gone headlong into the canal which ran down the centre of the street  my god he has killed them muttered dirk  and a good job too father said foy only i wish that i had shared in it  martins great form loomed in the doorway the vrouw jansen has fled away he said and the street is quite quiet now so i think that we had better be moving before any see us my masters  some days later the bodies of these spanish soldiers were found with their faces smashed flat it was suggested in explanation of this plight that they had got drunk and while fighting together had fallen from the bridge on to the stonework of a pier this version of their end found a ready acceptance as it consorted well with the reputations of the men so there was no search or inquiry  i had to finish the dogs martin explained apologeticallymay the lord jesus forgive mebecause i was afraid that they might know me again by my beard  alas alas groaned dirk what times are these say nothing of this dreadful matter to your mother son or to adrian either but foy nudged martin in the ribs and muttered well done old fellow well done  after this experience which the reader must remember was nothing extraordinary in those dark and dreadful days when neither the lives of men nor the safety of womenespecially protestant men and womenwere things of much account the three of them reached home without further incident and quite unobserved arriving at the house they entered it near the watergate by a back door that led into the stableyard it was opened by a woman whom they followed into a little room where a light burned here she turned and kissed two of them dirk first and then foy  thank god that i see you safe she said whenever you go to the meetingplace i tremble until i hear your footsteps at the door  whats the use of that mother said foy your fretting yourself wont make things better or worse  ah dear how can i help it she replied softly we cannot all be young and cheerful you know  true wife true broke in dirk though i wish we could we should be lighterhearted so and he looked at her and sighed  lysbeth van goorl could no longer boast the beauty which was hers when first we met her but she was still a sweet and graceful woman her figure remaining almost as slim as it had been in girlhood the grey eyes also retained their depth and fire only the face was worn though more by care and the burden of memories than with years the lot of the loving wife and mother was hard indeed when philip the king ruled in spain and alva was his prophet in the netherlands  is it done she asked  yes wife our brethren are now saints in paradise therefore rejoice  it is very wrong she answered with a sob but i cannot oh she added with a sudden blaze of indignation if he is just and good why does god suffer his servants to be killed thus  perhaps our grandchildren will be able to answer that question replied dirk  that poor vrouw jansen broke in lysbeth just married and so young and pretty i wonder what will become of her  dirk and foy looked at each other and martin who was hovering about near the door slunk back guiltily into the passage as though he had attempted to injure the vrouw jansen  tomorrow we will look to it wife and now let us eat for we are faint with hunger  ten minutes later they were seated at their meal the reader may remember the room it was that wherein montalvo excount and captain made the speech which charmed all hearers on the night when he had lost the race at the icecarnival the same chandelier hung above them some portion of the same plate even repurchased by dirk was on the table but how different were the company and the feast aunt clara the fatuous was long dead and with her many of the companions of that occasion some naturally some by the hand of the executioner while others had fled the land pieter van de werff still lived however and though regarded with suspicion by the authorities was a man of weight and honour in the town but tonight he was not present there the food too if ample was plain not on account of the poverty of the household for dirk had prospered in his worldly affairs being hardworking and skilful and the head of the brass foundry to which in those early days he was apprenticed but because in such times people thought little of the refinements of eating when life itself is so doubtful its pleasures and amusements become of small importance the ample waiting service of the maid greta who long ago had vanished none knew where and her fellow domestics was now carried on by the man martin and one old woman since as every menial might be a spy even the richest employed few of them in short all the lighter and more cheerful parts of life were in abeyance  where is adrian asked dirk  i do not know answered lysbeth i thought that perhaps  no replied her husband hastily he did not accompany us he rarely does  brother adrian likes to look underneath the spoon before he licks it said foy with his mouth full  the remark was enigmatic but his parents seemed to understand what foy meant at least it was followed by an uncomfortable and acquiescent silence just then adrian came in and as we have not seen him since some four and twenty years ago he made his entry into the world on the secret island in the haarlemer meer here it may be as well to describe his appearance  he was a handsome young man but of quite a different stamp from his halfbrother foy being tall slight and very graceful in figure advantages which he had inherited from his mother lysbeth in countenance however he differed from her so much that none would have guessed him to be her son indeed adrians face was pure spanish there was nothing of a netherlander about his dark beauty spanish were the eyes of velvet black set rather close together spanish also the finely chiselled features and the thin spreading nostrils spanish the cold yet somewhat sensual mouth more apt to sneer than smile the straight black hair the clear olive skin and that indifferent halfwearied mien which became its wearer well enough but in a man of his years of northern blood would have seemed unnatural or affected  he took his seat without speaking nor did the others speak to him till his stepfather dirk said  you were not at the works today adrian although we should have been glad of your help in founding the culverin  no fatherhe called him fatheranswered the young man in a measured and rather melodious voice you see we dont quite know who is going to pay for that piece or at any rate i dont quite know as nobody seems to take me into confidence and if it should chance to be the losing side well it might be enough to hang me  dirk flushed up but made no answer only foy remarked  thats right adrian look after your own skin  just now i find it more interesting went on adrian loftily and disregardful of his brother to study those whom the cannon may shoot than to make the cannon which is to shoot them  hope you wont be one of them interrupted foy again  where have you been this evening son asked lysbeth hastily fearing a quarrel  i have been mixing with the people mother at the scene on the marketplace yonder  not the martyrdom of our good friend jansen surely  yes mother why not it is terrible it is a crime no doubt but the observer of life should study these things there is nothing more fascinating to the philosopher than the play of human passions the emotions of the brutal crowd the stolid indifference of the guard the grief of the sympathisers the stoical endurance of the victims animated by religious exaltation  and the beautiful logic of the philosopher with his nose in the air while he watches his friend and brother in the faith being slowly burnt to death broke out foy with passion  hush hush said dirk striking his fist upon the table with a blow that caused the glasses to ring this is no subject for wordchopping adrian you would have been better with us than down below at that butchery even though you were less safe he added with meaning but i wish to run none into danger and you are of an age to judge for yourself i beg you however to spare us your light talk about scenes that we think dreadful however interesting you may have found them  adrian shrugged his shoulders and called to martin to bring him some more meat as the great man approached him he spread out his finedrawn nostrils and sniffed  you smell martin he said and no wonder look there is blood upon your jerkin have you been killing pigs and forgotten to change it  martins round blue eyes flashed then went pale and dead again  yes master he answered in his thick voice i have been killing pigs but your dress also smells of blood and fire perhaps you went too near the stake at that moment to put an end to the conversation dirk rose and said grace then he went out of the room accompanied by his wife and foy leaving adrian to finish his meal alone which he did reflectively and at leisure  when he left the eating chamber foy followed martin across the courtyard to the walledin stables and up a ladder to the room where the serving man slept it was a queer place and filled with an extraordinary collection of odds and ends the skins of birds otters and wolves weapons of different makes notably a very large twohanded sword plain and oldfashioned but of excellent steel bits of harness and other things  there was no bed in this room for the reason that martin disdained a bed a few skins upon the floor being all that he needed to lie on nor did he ask for much covering since so hardy was he by nature that except in the very bitterest weather his woollen vest was enough for him indeed he had been known to sleep out in it when the frost was so sharp that he rose with his hair and beard covered with icicles  martin shut the door and lit three lanterns which he hung to hooks upon the wall  are you ready for a turn master he asked  foy nodded as he answered i want to get the taste of it all out of my mouth so dont spare me lay on till i get angry it will make me forget and taking a leathern jerkin off a peg he pulled it over his head  forget what master  oh the prayings and the burnings and vrouw jansen and adrians sealawyer sort of talk  ah yes thats the worst of them all for us and the big man leapt forward and whispered keep an eye on him master foy  what do you mean asked foy sharply and flushing  what i say  you forget you are talking of my brother my own mothers son i will hear no harm of adrian his ways are different to ours but he is goodhearted at bottom do you understand me martin  but not your fathers son master its the sire sets the strain i have bred horses and i know  foy looked at him and hesitated  no said martin answering the question in his eyes i have nothing against him but he always sees the other side and thats bad also he is spanish  and you dont like spaniards broke in foy martin you are a pigheaded prejudiced unjust jackass  martin smiled no master i dont like spaniards nor will you before you have done with them but then it is only fair as they dont like me  i say martin said foy following a new line of thought how did you manage that business so quietly and why didnt you let me do my share  because youd have made a noise master and we didnt want the watch on us also being fulled armed they might have bettered you  good reasons martin how did you do it i couldnt see much  it is a trick i learned up there in friesland some of the northmen sailors taught it me there is a place in a mans neck here at the back and if he is squeezed there he loses his senses in a second thus master and putting out his great hand he gripped foys neck in a fashion that caused him the intensest agony  drop it said foy kicking at his shins  i didnt squeeze i was only showing you answered martin opening his eyes well when their wits were gone of course it was easy to knock their heads together so that they mightnt find them again you see he added if i had left them alivewell they are dead anyway and getting a hot supper by now i expect which shall it be master dutch stick or spanish point  stick first then point answered foy  good we need em both nowadays and martin reached down a pair of ash plants fitted into old sword hilts to protect the hands of the players  they stood up to each other on guard and then against the light of the lanterns it could be seen how huge a man was martin foy although wellbuilt and sturdy and like all his race of a stout habit looked but a child beside the bulk of this great fellow as for their stick game which was in fact sword exercise it is unnecessary to follow its details for the end of it was what might almost have been expected foy sprang to and fro slashing and cutting while martin the solid scarcely moved his weapon then suddenly there would be a parry and a reach and the stick would fall with a thud all down the length of foys back causing the dust to start from his leathern jerkin  its no good said foy at last rubbing himself ruefully whats the use of guarding against you you great brute when you simply crash through my guard and hit me all the same that isnt science  no master answered martin but it is business if we had been using swords you would have been in pieces by now no blame to you and no credit to me my reach is longer and my arm heavier that is all  at any rate i am beaten said foy now take the rapiers and give me a chance  then they went at it with the thrustingswords rendered harmless by a disc of lead upon their points and at this game the luck turned foy was active as a cat in the eye of a hawk and twice he managed to get in under martins guard  youre dead old fellow he said at the second thrust  yes young master answered martin but remember that i killed you long ago so that you are only a ghost and of no account although i have tried to learn its use to please you i dont mean to fight with a toasting fork this is my weapon and seizing the great sword which stood in the corner he made it hiss through the air  foy took it from his hand and looked at it it was a long straight blade with a plain iron guard or cage for the hands and on it in old letters was engraved one latin word silentium silence  why is it called silence martin  because it makes people silent i suppose master  what is its history and how did you come by it asked foy in a malicious voice he knew that the subject was a sore one with the huge frisian  martin turned red as his own beard and looked uncomfortable i believe he answered staring upwards that it was the ancient sword of justice of a little place up in friesland as to how i came by it well i forget  and you call yourself a good christian said foy reproachfully now i have heard that your head was going to be chopped off with this sword but that somehow you managed to steal it first and got away  there was something of the sort mumbled martin but it is so long ago that it slips my mind i was so often in broils and drunk in those daysmay the dear lord forgive methat i cant quite remember things and now by your leave i want to go to sleep  you old liar said foy shaking his head at him you killed that poor executioner and made off with his sword you know you did and now you are ashamed to own the truth  may be may be answered martin vacuously so many things happen in the world that a fool man cannot remember them all i want to go to sleep  martin said foy sitting down upon a stool and dragging off his leather jerkin what used you to do before you turned holy you have never told me all the story come now speak up i wont tell adrian  nothing worth mentioning master foy  out with it martin  well if you wish to know i am the son of a friesland boor  and an englishwoman from yarmouth i know all that  yes repeated martin an englishwoman from yarmouth she was very strong my mother she could hold up a cart on her shoulders while my father greased the wheels that is for a bet otherwise she used to make my father hold the cart up while she greased the wheels folk would come to see her do the trick when i grew up i held the cart and they both greased the wheels but at last they died of the plague the pair of them god rest their souls so i inherited the farm  and said foy fixing him with his eye  and jerked out martin in an unwilling fashion fell into bad habits  drink suggested the merciless foy  martin sighed and hung his great head he had a tender conscience  then you took to prizefighting went on his tormentor you cant deny it look at your nose  i did master for the lord hadnt touched my heart in those days and he added brisking up it wasnt such a bad trade for nobody ever beat me except a brussels man once when i was drunk he broke my nose but afterwards when i was sober and he stopped  you killed the spanish boxer here in leyden said foy sternly  yes echoed martin i killed him sure enough butoh it was a pretty fight and he brought it on himself he was a fine man that spaniard but the devil wouldnt play fair so i just had to kill him i hope that they bear in mind up above that i had to kill him  tell me about it martin for i was at the hague at the time and cant remember of course i dont approve of such thingsand the young rascal clasped his hands and looked piousbut as it is all done with one may as well hear the story of the fight to spin it wont make you more wicked than you are  then suddenly martin the unreminiscent developed a marvellous memory and with much wealth of detail set out the exact circumstances of that historic encounter  and after he had kicked me in the stomach he ended which master you will know he had no right to do i lost my temper and hit out with all my strength having first feinted and knocked up his guard with my left arm  and then said foy growing excited for martin really told the story very well what happened  oh his head went back between his shoulders and when they picked him up his neck was broken i was sorry but i couldnt help it the lord knows i couldnt help it he shouldnt have called me a dirty frisian ox and kicked me in the stomach  no that was very wrong of him but they arrested you didnt they martin  yes for the second time they condemned me to death as a brawler and a manslayer you see the other friesland business came up against me and the magistrates here had money on the spaniard then your dear father saved me he was burgomaster of that year and he paid the death fine for mea large sumafterwards too he taught me to be sober and think of my soul so you know why red martin will serve him and his while there is a drop of blood left in his worthless carcase and now master foy im going to sleep and god grant that those dirty spanish dogs maynt haunt me  dont you fear for that martin said foy as he took his departure absolvo te for those spaniards through your strength god smote them who were not ashamed to rob and insult a poor new widowed woman after helping to murder her husband yes martin you may enter that on the right side of the ledgerfor a changefor they wont haunt you at night im more afraid lest the business should be traced home to us but i dont think it likely since the street was quite empty  quite empty echoed martin nodding his head nobody saw me except the two soldiers and vrouw jansen they cant tell and im sure that she wont goodnight my young master    chapter x  adrian goes out hawking  in a house down a back street not very far from the leyden prison a man and a woman sat at breakfast on the morning following the burning of the heer jansen and his fellow martyr these also we have met before for they were none other than the estimable black meg and her companion named the butcher time which had left them both strong and active had not it must be admitted improved their personal appearance black meg indeed was much as she had always been except that her hair was now grey and her features which seemed to be covered with yellow parchment had become sharp and haglike though her dark eyes still burned with their ancient fire the man hague simon or the butcher scoundrel by nature and spy and thief by trade one of the evil spawn of an age of violence and cruelty boasted a face and form that became his reputation well his countenance was villainous very fat and flabby with small piglike eyes and framed as it were in a fringe of sandycoloured whiskers running from the throat to the temple where they faded away into a great expanse of utterly bald head the figure beneath was heavy pothaunched and supported upon a pair of bowed but sturdy legs  but if they were no longer young and such good looks as they ever possessed had vanished the years had brought them certain compensations indeed it was a period in which spies and all such wretches flourished since besides other pickings by special enactment a good proportion of the realized estates of heretics was paid over to the informers as bloodmoney of course however humble tools like the butcher and his wife did not get the largest joints of the heretic sheep for whenever one was slaughtered there were always many honest middlemen of various degree to be satisfied from the judge down to the executioner with others who never showed their faces  still when the burnings and torturings were brisk the amount totalled up very handsomely thus as the pair sat at their meal this morning they were engaged in figuring out what they might expect to receive from the estate of the late heer jansen or at least black meg was so employed with the help of a deal board and a bit of chalk at last she announced the result which was satisfactory simon held up his fat hands in admiration  clever little dove he said you ought to have been a lawyers wife with your head for figures ah it grows near it grows near  what grows near you fool asked meg in her deep mannish voice  that farm with an inn attached of which i dream standing in rich pasture land with a little wood behind it and in the wood a church not too large no i am not ambitious let us say a hundred acres enough to keep thirty or forty cows which you would milk while i marketed the butter and the cheeses  and slit the throats of the guests interpolated meg  simon looked shocked no wife you misjudge me it is a rough world and we must take queer cuts to fortune but once i get there respectability for me and a seat in the village church provided of course that it is orthodox i know that you come of the people and your instincts are of the people but i can never forget that my grandfather was a gentleman and simon puffed himself out and looked at the ceiling  indeed sneered meg and what was your grandmother or for the matter of that how do you know who was your grandfather country house the old red mill where you hide goods out there in the swamp is likely to be your only country house village church village gallows more likely no dont you look nasty at me for i wont stand it you dirty little liar i have done things i know but i wouldnt have got my own aunt burned for an anabaptist which she wasnt in order to earn twenty florins so there  simon turned purple with rage that aunt story was one which touched him on the raw ugly he began  instantly megs hand shot out and grasped the neck of a bottle whereon he changed his tune  the sex the sex he murmured turning aside to mop his bald head with a napkin well its only their pretty way they will have their little joke hullo there is someone knocking at the door  and mind how you open it said meg becoming alert remember we have plenty of enemies and a pike blade comes through a small crack  can you live with the wise and remain a greenhorn trust me and placing his arm about his spouses waist simon stood on tiptoe and kissed her gently on the cheek in token of reconciliation for meg had a nasty memory in quarrels then he skipped away towards the door as fast as his bandy legs would carry him  the colloquy there was long and for the most part carried on through the keyhole but in the end their visitor was admitted a beetlebrowed brute of much the same stamp as his host  you are nice ones he said sulkily to be so suspicious about an old friend especially when he comes on a job  dont be angry dear hans interrupted simon in a pleading voice you know how many bad characters are abroad in these rough times why for aught we could tell you might have been one of these desperate lutherans who stick at nothing but about the business  lutherans indeed snarled hans well if they are wise theyd stick at your fat stomach but it is a lutheran job that i have come from the hague to talk about  ah said meg who sent you  a spaniard named ramiro who has recently turned up there a humorous dog connected with the inquisition who seems to know everybody and whom nobody knows however his money is right enough and no doubt he has authority behind him he says that you are old friends of his  ramiro ramiro repeated meg reflectively that means oarsman doesnt it and sounds like an alias well ive lots of acquaintances in the galleys and he may be one of them what does he want and what are the terms  hans leant forward and whispered for a long while the other two listened in silence only nodding from time to time  it doesnt seem much for the job said simon when hans had finished  well friend it is easy and safe a fat merchant and his wife and a young girl mind you there is no killing to be done if we can help it and if we cant help it the holy office will shield us also it is only the letter which he thinks that the young woman may carry that the noble ramiro wants doubtless it has to do with the sacred affairs of the church any valuables about them we may keep as a perquisite over and above the pay  simon hesitated but meg announced with decision  it is good enough these merchant woman generally have jewels hidden in their stays  my dear interrupted simon  dont my dear me said meg fiercely i have made up my mind so theres an end we meet by the boshhuysen at five oclock at the big oak in the copse where we will settle the details  after this simon said no more for he had this virtue so useful in domestic lifehe knew when to yield    on this same morning adrian rose late the talk at the supper table on the previous night especially foys coarse uneducated sarcasm had ruffled his temper and when adrians temper was ruffled he generally found it necessary to sleep himself into good humour as the bookkeeper of the establishment for his stepfather had never been able to induce him to take an active part in its work which in his heart he considered beneath him adrian should have been in the office by nine oclock not having risen before ten however nor eaten his breakfast until after eleven this was clearly impossible then he remembered that here was a good chance of finishing a sonnet of which the last lines were running in his head it chanced that adrian was a bit of a poet and like most poets he found quiet essential to the art of composition somehow when foy was in the house singing and talking and that great frisian brute martin was tramping to and fro there was never any quiet for even when he could not hear them the sense of their presence exasperated his nerves so now was his opportunity especially as his mother was outmarketing she saidbut in all probability engaged upon some wretched and risky business connected with the people whom she called martyrs adrian determined to avail himself of it and finish his sonnet  this took some time first as all true artists know the muse must be summoned and she will rarely arrive under an hours appropriate and gloomy contemplation of things in general then especially in the case of sonnets rhymes which are stubborn and remorseless things must be found and arranged the pivot and object of this particular poem was a certain notable spanish beauty isabella dovanda by name she was the wife of a decrepit but exceedingly noble spaniard who might almost have been her grandfather and who had been sent as one of a commission appointed by king philip ii to inquire into certain financial matters connected with the netherlands  this grandee who as it happened was a very industrious and conscientious person among other cities had visited leyden in order to assess the value of the imperial dues and taxes the task did not take him long because the burghers rudely and vehemently declared that under their ancient charter they were free from any imperial dues or taxes whatsoever nor could the noble marquiss arguments move them to a more rational view still he argued for a week and during that time his wife the lovely isabella dazzled the women of the town with her costumes and the men with her exceedingly attractive person  especially did she dazzle the romantic adrian hence the poetry on the whole the rhymes went pretty well though there were difficulties but with industry he got round them finally the sonnet a highflown and very absurd composition was completed  by now it was time to eat indeed there are few things that make a man hungrier than longcontinued poetical exercise so adrian ate in the midst of the meal his mother returned pale and anxiousfaced for the poor woman had been engaged in making arrangements for the safety of the beggared widow of the martyred jansen a pathetic and even a dangerous task in his own way adrian was fond of his mother but being a selfish puppy he took but little note of her cares or moods therefore seizing the opportunity of an audience he insisted upon reading to her his sonnet not once but several times  very pretty my son very pretty murmured lysbeth through whose bewildered brain the stilted and meaningless words buzzed like bees in an empty hive though i am sure i cannot guess how you find the heart in such times as these to write poetry to fine ladies whom you do not know  poetry mother said adrian sententiously is a great consoler it lifts the mind from the contemplation of petty and sordid cares  petty and sordid cares repeated lysbeth wonderingly then she added with a kind of cry oh adrian have you no heart that you can watch a saint burn and come home to philosophise about his agonies will you never understand if you could have seen that poor woman this morning who only three months ago was a happy bride then bursting into tears lysbeth turned and fled from the room for she remembered that what was the fate of the vrouw jansen today tomorrow might be her own  this show of emotion quite upset adrian whose nerves were delicate and who being honestly attached to his mother did not like to see her weeping  pest on the whole thing he thought to himself why cant we go away and live in some pleasant place where they havent got any religion unless it is the worship of venus yes a place of orange groves and running streams and pretty women with guitars who like having sonnets read to them and  at this moment the door opened and martins huge and flaming poll appeared  the master wants to know if you are coming to the works heer adrian and if not will you be so good as to give me the key of the strongbox as he needs the cash book  with a groan adrian rose to go then changed his mind no after that perfumed vision of green groves and lovely ladies it was impossible for him to face the malodorous and prosaic foundry  tell them i cant come he said drawing the key from his pocket  very good heer adrian why not  because i am writing  writing what queried martin  a sonnet  whats a sonnet asked martin blankly  illeducated clown murmured adrian thenwith a sudden inspiration ill show you what a sonnet is i will read it to you come in and shut the door martin obeyed and was duly rewarded with the sonnet of which he understood nothing at all except the name of the lady isabella dovanda but martin was not without the guile of the serpent  beautiful he said beautiful read it again master  adrian did so with much delight remembering the tale of how the music of orpheus had charmed the very beasts  ah said martin thats a loveletter isnt it to that splendid blackeyed marchioness whom i saw looking at you  well not exactly said adrian highly pleased although to tell the truth he could not recollect upon what occasion the fair isabella had favoured him with her kind glances yet i suppose that you might call it so an idealised loveletter a letter in which ardent and distant yet tender admiration is wrapt with the veil of verse  quite so well master adrian just you send it to her  you dont think that she might be offended queried adrian doubtfully  offended said martin if she is i know nothing of women as a matter of fact he didnt no she will be very pleased shell take it away and read it by herself and sleep with it under her pillow until she knows it by heart and then i daresay she will ask you to come and see her well i must be off but thank you for reading me the beautiful poetry letter heer adrian  really reflected adrian as the door closed behind him this is another instance of the deceitfulness of appearances i always thought martin a great brutal fool yet in his breast uncultured as it is the sacred spark still smoulders and then and there he made up his mind that he would read martin a further selection of poems upon the first opportunity  if only adrian could have been a witness to the scene which at that very moment was in progress at the works martin having delivered the key of the box sought out foy and proceeded to tell him the story more perfidious one he handed over a rough draft of the sonnet which he had surreptitiously garnered from the floor to foy who clad in a leather apron and seated on the edge of a casting read it eagerly  i told him to send it went on martin and by st peter i think he will and then if he doesnt have old don diaz after him with a pistol in one hand and a stiletto in the other my name isnt martin roos  of course of course gasped foy kicking his legs into the air with delight why they call the old fellow singe jaloux oh its capital and i only hope that he opens the ladys letters  thus did foy the commonplace and practical make a mock of the poetic efforts of the highsouled and sentimental adrian  meanwhile adrian feeling that he required air after his literary labours fetched his peregrine from its perchfor he was fond of hawkingand setting it on his wrist started out to find a quarry on the marshes near the town  before he was halfway down the street he had forgotten all about the sonnet and the lovely isabella his was a curious temperament and this sentimentality born of vainness and idle hours by no means expressed it all that he was what we should nowadays call a prig we know and also that he possessed his fathers montalvos readiness of speech without his fathers sense of humour in him as martin had hinted the strain of the sire predominated for in all essentials adrian was as spanish in mind as in appearance  for instance the sudden and violent passions into which he was apt to fall if thwarted or overlooked were purely spanish there seemed to be nothing of the patient phlegmatic netherlander about this side of him indeed it was this temper of his perhaps more than any other desire or tendency that made him so dangerous for whereas the impulses of his heart were often good enough they were always liable to be perverted by some access of suddenly provoked rage  from his birth up adrian had mixed little with spaniards and every influence about him especially that of his mother the being whom he most loved on earth had been antispanish yet were he an hidalgo fresh from the court at the escurial he could scarcely have been more castilian thus he had been brought up in what might be called a republican atmosphere yet he was without sympathy for the love of liberty which animated the people of holland the sturdy independence of the netherlanders their perpetual criticism of kings and established rules their vulgar and unheardof assumption that the good things of the world were free to all honest and hardworking citizens and not merely the birthright of blue blood did not appeal to adrian also from childhood he had been a member of the dissenting church one of the new religion yet at heart he rejected this faith with its humble professors and pastors its simple and sometimes squalid rites its long and earnest prayers offered to the almighty in the damp of a cellar or the reek of a cowhouse  like thousands of his spanish fellowcountrymen he was constitutionally unable to appreciate the fact that true religion and true faith are the natural fruits of penitence and effort and that individual repentance and striving are the only sacrifices required of man  for safetys sake like most politic netherlanders adrian was called upon from time to time to attend worship in the catholic churches he did not find the obligation irksome in fact the forms and rites of that stately ceremonial the moving picture of the mass in those dim aisles the pealing of the music and the sweet voices of hidden choristersall these things unsealed a fountain in his bosom and at whiles moved him well nigh to tears the system appealed to him also and he could understand that in it were joy and comfort for here was to be found forgiveness of sins not far off in the heavens but at hand upon the earth forgiveness to all who bent the head and paid the fee here ready made by that prince of armourers a church that claimed to be directly inspired was a harness of proof which after the death he dreaded for he was full of spiritual fears and superstitions would suffice to turn the shafts of satan from his poor shivering soul however steeped in crime was not this a more serviceable and practical faith than that of these loudvoiced rudehanded lutherans among whom he lived men who elected to cast aside this armour and trust instead to a buckler forged by their faith and prayersyes and to give up their evil ways and subdue their own desires that they might forge it better  such were the thoughts of adrians secret heart but as yet he had never acted on them since however much he might wish to do so he had not found the courage to break away from the influence of his surroundings his surroundingsah how he hated them how he hated them for very shames sake indeed he could not live in complete idleness among folk who were always busy therefore he acted as accountant in his stepfathers business keeping the books of the foundry in a scanty and inefficient fashion or writing letters to distant customers for he was a skilled clerk to order the raw materials necessary to the craft but of this occupation he was weary for he had the true spanish dislike and contempt of trade in his heart he held that war was the only occupation worthy of a man successful war of course against foes worth plundering such as cortes and pizarro had waged upon the poor indians of new spain  adrian had read a chronicle of the adventures of these heroes and bitterly regretted that he had come into the world too late to share them the tale of heathen foemen slaughtered by thousands and of the incalculable golden treasures divided among their conquerors fired his imaginationespecially the treasures at times he would see them in his sleep baskets full of gems heaps of barbaric gold and guerdon of fair women slaves all given by heaven to the true soldier whom it had charged with the sacred work of christianising unbelievers by means of massacre and the rack  oh how deeply did he desire such wealth and the power which it would bring with it he who was dependent upon others that looked down upon him as a lazy dreamer who had never a guilder to spare in his pouch who had nothing indeed but more debts than he cared to remember but it never occurred to him to set to work and grow rich like his neighbours by honest toil and commerce no that was the task of slaves like these low hollander fellows among whom his lot was cast  such were the main characteristics of adrian surnamed van goorl adrian the superstitious but unspiritual dreamer the vain sybarite the dull poet the chopper of false logic the weak and passionate selfseeker whose best and deepest cravings such as his love for his mother and another love that shall be told of were really little more than a reflection of his own pride and lusts or at least could be subordinated to their fulfilment not that he was altogether bad somewhere in him there was a better part thus he was capable of good purposes and of bitter remorse under certain circumstances even he might become capable also of a certain spurious spiritual exaltation but if this was to bloom in his heart it must be in a prison strong enough to protect from the blows of temptation adrian tempted would always be adrian overcome he was fashioned by nature to be the tool of others or of his own desires  it may be asked what part had his mother in him where in his weak ignoble nature was the trace of her pure and noble character it seems hard to find was this want to be accounted for by the circumstances connected with his birth in which she had been so unwilling an agent had she given him something of her body but naught of that which was within her own controlher spirit who can say this at least is true that from his mothers stock he had derived nothing beyond a certain dutch doggedness of purpose which when added to his other qualities might in some events make him formidablea thing to fear and flee from    adrian reached the witte poort and paused on this side of the moat to reflect about things in general like most young men of his time and blood as has been said he had military leanings and was convinced that given the opportunity he might become one of the foremost generals of his age now he was engaged in imagining himself besieging leyden at the head of a great army and in fancy disposing his forces after such fashion as would bring about its fall in the shortest possible time little did he guess that within some few years this very question was to exercise the brain of valdez and other great spanish captains  whilst he was thus occupied suddenly a rude voice called  wake up spaniard and a hard objectit was a green applestruck him on his flat cap nearly knocking out the feather adrian leaped round with an oath to catch sight of two lads louts of about fifteen projecting their tongues and jeering at him from behind the angles of the gatehouse now adrian was not popular with the youth of leyden and he knew it well so thinking it wisest to take no notice of this affront he was about to continue on his way when one of the youths made bold by impunity stepped from his corner and bowed before him till the ragged cap in his hand touched the dust saying in a mocking voice  hans why do you disturb the noble hidalgo cannot you see that the noble hidalgo is going for a walk in the country to look for his most high father the honourable duke of the golden fleece to whom he is taking a cockolly bird as a present  adrian heard and winced at the sting of the insult as a highbred horse winces beneath the lash of a sudden rage boiled in his veins like a fountain of fire and drawing the dagger from his girdle he rushed at the boys dragging the hooded hawk which had become dislodged from his wrist fluttering through the air after him at that moment indeed he would have been capable of killing one or both of them if he could have caught them but fortunately for himself and them being prepared for an onslaught they vanished this way and that up the narrow lanes presently he stopped and still shaking with wrath replaced the hawk on his wrist and walked across the bridge  they shall pay for it he muttered oh i will not forget i will not forget  here it may be explained that of the story of his birth adrian had heard something but not all he knew for instance that his fathers name was montalvo that the marriage with his mother for some reason was declared to be illegal and that this montalvo had left the netherlands under a cloud to find his death so he had been told abroad more than this adrian did not know for certain since everybody showed a singular reticence in speaking to him of the matter twice he had plucked up courage to question his mother on the subject and on each occasion her face had turned cold and hard as stone and she answered almost in the same words  son i beg you to be silent when i am dead you will find all the story of your birth written down but if you are wise you will not read  once he had asked the same question of his stepfather dirk van goorl whereupon dirk looked ill at ease and answered  take my advice lad and be content to know that you are here and alive with friends to take care of you remember that those who dig in churchyards find bones  indeed replied adrian haughtily at least i trust that there is nothing against my mothers reputation  at these words to his surprise dirk suddenly turned pale as a sheet and stepped towards him as though he were about to fly at his throat  you dare to doubt your mother he began that angel out of heaven then ceased and added presently go i beg your pardon i should have remembered that you at least are innocent and it is but natural that the matter weighs upon your mind  so adrian went also that proverb about churchyards and bones made such an impression on him that he did no more digging in other words he ceased to ask questions trying to console his mind with the knowledge that however his father might have behaved to his mother at least he was a man of ancient rank and ancient blood which blood was his today the rest would be forgotten although enough of it was still remembered to permit of his being taunted by those street louts and when it was forgotten the blood that precious blue blood of an hidalgo of spain must still remain his heritage    chapter xi  adrian rescues beauty in distress  all that long evening adrian wandered about the causeways which pierced the meadowlands and marshes pondering these things and picturing himself as having attained to the dignity of a grandee of spain perhaps evenwho could tellto the proud rank of a knight of the golden fleece entitled to stand covered in the presence of his sovereign more than one snipe and other bird such as he had come to hawk rose at his feet but so preoccupied was he that they were out of flight before he could unhood his falcon at length after he had passed the church of weddinvliet and following the left bank of the old vliet was opposite to the wood named boshhuyen after the halfruined castle that stood in it he caught sight of a heron winging its homeward way to the heronry and cast off his peregrine out of the hood she saw the quarry at once and dashed towards it whereon the heron becoming aware of the approach of its enemy began to make play rising high into the air in narrow circles swiftly the falcon climbed after it in wider rings till at length she hovered high above and stooped but in vain with a quick turn of the wings the heron avoided her and before the falcon could find her pitch again was far on its path towards the wood  once more the peregrine climbed and stooped with a like result a third time she soared upwards in great circles and a third time rushed downwards now striking the quarry full and binding to it adrian who was following their flight as fast as he could run leaping some of the dykes in his path and splashing through others saw and paused to watch the end for a moment hawk and quarry hung in the air two hundred feet above the tallest tree beneath them for at the instant of its taking the heron had begun to descend to the grove for refuge a struggling black dot against the glow of sunset then still bound together they rushed downward headlong for their spread and fluttering wings did not serve to stay their fall and vanished among the treetops  now my good hawk will be killed in the boughsoh what a fool was i to fly so near the wood thought adrian to himself as again he started forward  pushing on at his best pace soon he was wandering about among the trees as near to that spot where he had seen the birds fall as he could guess it calling to the falcon and searching for her with his eyes but here in the dense grove the fading light grew faint so that at length he was obliged to abandon the quest in despair and turned to find his way to the leyden road when within twenty paces of it suddenly he came upon hawk and heron the heron was stone dead and the brave falcon so injured that it seemed hopeless to try to save her for as he feared they had crashed through the boughs of a tree in their fall adrian looked at her in dismay for he loved this bird which was the best of its kind in the city having trained her himself from a nestling indeed there had always been a curious sympathy between himself and this fierce creature of which he made a companion as another man might of a dog even now he noted with a sort of pride that brokenwinged and shattered though she was her talons remained fixed in the back of the quarry and her beak through the neck  he stroked the falcons head whereon the bird recognising him loosed her grip of the heron and tried to flutter to her accustomed perch upon his wrist only to fall to the ground where she lay watching him with her bright eyes then because there was no help for it although he choked with grief at the deed adrian struck her on the head with his staff until she died  goodbye friend he muttered at least that is the best way to go hence dying with a dead foe beneath and picking up the peregrine he smoothed her ruffled feathers and placed her tenderly in his satchel  then it was just as adrian rose to his feet standing beneath the shadow of the big oak upon which the birds had fallen that coming from the road which was separated from him by a little belt of undergrowth he heard the sound of mens voices growling and threatening and with them a womans cry for help at any other time he would have hesitated and reconnoitred or perhaps have retreated at once for he knew well the dangers of mixing himself up in the quarrels of wayfarers in those rough days but the loss of the hawk had exasperated his nerves making any excitement or adventure welcome to him therefore without pausing to think adrian pushed forward through the brushwood to find himself in the midst of a curious scene  before him ran the grassy road or woodland lane in the midst of it sprawling on his back for he had been pulled from his horse lay a stout burgher whose pockets were being rifled by a heavybrowed footpad who from time to time doubtless to keep him quiet threatened his victim with a knife on the pillion of the burghers thickset flemish horse which was peacefully cropping at the grass sat a middleaged female who seemed to be stricken dumb with terror while a few paces away a second ruffian and a tall bony woman were engaged in dragging a girl from the back of a mule  acting on the impulse of the moment adrian shouted  come on friends here are the thieves whereon the robber woman took to flight and the man wheeled round as he turned snatching a naked knife from his girdle but before he could lift it adrians heavy staff crashed down upon the point of his shoulder causing him to drop the dagger with a howl of pain again the staff rose and fell this time upon his head staggering him and knocking off his cap so that the light such as it was shone upon his villainous fat face the fringe of sandycoloured whisker running from throat to temples and the bald head above which adrian knew at once for that of hague simon or the butcher fortunately for him however the butcher was too surprised or too much confused by the blow which he had received upon his head to recognise his assailant nor having lost his knife and believing doubtless that adrian was only the first of a troop of rescuers did he seem inclined to continue the combat but calling to his companion to follow him he began to run after the woman with a swiftness almost incredible in a man of his build and weight turning presently into the brushwood where he and his two fellow thieves vanished away  adrian dropped the point of his stick and looked round him for the whole affair had been so sudden and the rout of the enemy so complete that he was tempted to believe he must be dreaming not eighty seconds ago he was hiding the dead falcon in his satchel and now behold he was a gallant knight who unarmed except for a dagger which he forgot to draw had conquered two sturdy knaves and a female accomplice bristling with weapons rescuing from their clutches beauty for doubtless the maiden was beautiful and incidentally her wealthy relatives just then the lady who had been dragged from the mule to the ground where she still lay struggled to her knees and looked up thereby causing the hood of her travelling cloak to fall back from her head  thus it was softened and illuminated by the last pale glow of this summer evening that adrian first saw the face of elsa brant the woman upon whom in the name of love he was destined to bring so much sorrow  the hero adrian overthrower of robbers looked at the kneeling elsa and knew that she was lovely as under the circumstances was right and fitting and the rescued elsa gazing at the hero adrian admitted to herself that he was handsome also that his appearance on the scene had been opportune not to say providential  elsa brant the only child of that hendrik brant the friend and cousin of dirk van goorl who was already figured in this history was just nineteen her eyes and her hair which curled were brown her complexion was pale suggesting delicacy of constitution her mouth small with a turn of humour about it and her chin rather large and firm she was of middle height if anything somewhat under it with an exquisitely rounded and graceful figure and perfect hands lacking the stateliness of a spanish beauty and the coarse fulness of outline which has always been admired in the netherlands elsa was still without doubt a beautiful woman though how much of her charm was owing to her bodily attractions and how much to her vivacious mien and to a certain stamp of spirituality that was set upon her face in repose and looked out of her clear large eyes when she was thoughtful it would not be easy to determine at any rate her charms were sufficient to make a powerful impression upon adrian who forgetting all about the marchioness dovanda inspirer of sonnets became enamoured of her then and there partly for her own sake and partly because it was the right kind of thing for a deliverer to do  but it cannot be said however deep her feelings of gratitude that elsa became enamoured of adrian undoubtedly as she had recognised he was handsome and she much admired the readiness and force with which he had smitten that singularly loathsomelooking individual who had dragged her from the mule but as it chanced standing where he did the shadow of his face lay on the grass beside her it was a faint shadow for the light faded still it was there and it fascinated her for seen thus the fine features became sinister and cruel and their smile of courtesy and admiration was transformed into a most unpleasant sneer a trivial accident of light no doubt and foolish enough that elsa should notice it under such circumstances but notice it she did and what is more so quickly are the minds of women turned this way or that and so illogically do they draw a right conclusion from some pure freak of chance it raised her prejudice against him  oh senor said elsa clasping her hands how can i thank you enough  this speech was short and not original yet there were two things about it that adrian noted with satisfaction first that it was uttered in a soft and most attractive voice and secondly that the speaker supposed him to be a spaniard of noble birth  do not thank me at all gracious lady he replied making his lowest bow to put to flight two robber rogues and a woman was no great feat although i had but this staff for weapon he added perhaps with a view to impressing upon the maidens mind that her assailants had been armed while he the deliverer was not  ah she answered i daresay that a brave knight like you thinks nothing of fighting several men at once but when that wretch with the big hands and the flat face caught hold of me i nearly died of fright at the best of times i am a dreadful coward andno i thank you senor i can stand now and alone see here comes the heer van broekhoven under whose escort i am travelling and look he is bleeding oh worthy friend are you hurt  not much elsa gasped the heer for he was still breathless with fright and exhaustion but that ruffianmay the hangman have himgave me a dig in the shoulder with his knife as he rose to run however he added with satisfaction he got nothing from me for i am an old traveller and he never thought to look in my hat  i wonder why they attacked us said elsa  the heer van broekhoven rubbed his head thoughtfully to rob us i suppose for i heard the woman say here they are look for the letter on the girl butcher  as he spoke elsas face turned grave and adrian saw her glance at the animal she had been riding and slip her arm through its rein  worthy sir went on van broekhoven tell us whom we have to thank  i am adrian called van goorl adrian replied with dignity  van goorl said the heer well this is strange providence could not have arranged it better listen wife he went on addressing the stout lady who all this while had sat still upon the horse so alarmed and bewildered that she could not speak here is a son of dirk van goorl to whom we are charged to deliver elsa  indeed answered the good woman recovering herself somewhat i thought from the look of him that he was a spanish nobleman but whoever he is i am sure that we are all very much obliged to him and if he could show us the way out of this dreadful wood which doubtless is full of robbers to the house of our kinsfolk the broekhovens of leyden i should be still more grateful  madam you have only to accept my escort and i assure you that you need fear no more robbers might i in turn ask this ladys name  certainly young sir she is elsa brant the only child of hendrik brant the famous goldsmith of the hague but doubtless now that you know her name you know all that also for she must be some kind of cousin to you husband help elsa on to her mule  let that be my duty said adrian and springing forward he lifted elsa to the saddle gracefully enough then taking her mule by the bridle he walked onwards through the wood praying in his heart that the butcher and his companions would not find courage to attack them again before they were out of its depths  tell me sir are you foy asked elsa in a puzzled voice  no answered adrian shortly i am his brother  ah that explains it you see i was perplexed for i remember foy when i was quite little a beautiful boy with blue eyes and yellow hair who was always very kind to me once he stopped at my fathers house at the hague with his father  indeed said adrian i am glad to hear that foy was ever beautiful i can only remember that he was very stupid for i used to try to teach him at any rate i am afraid you will not think him beautiful nowthat is unless you admire young men who are almost as broad as they are long  oh heer adrian she answered laughing i am afraid that fault can be found with most of us north holland folk and myself among the number you see it is given to very few of us to be tall and noblelooking like highborn spaniardsnot that i should wish to resemble any spaniard however lovely she might be elsa added with a slight hardening of her voice and face but she went on hurriedly as though sorry that the remark had escaped her you sir and foy are strangely unlike to be brothers is it not so  we are halfbrothers said adrian looking straight before him we have the same mother only but please do not call me sir call me cousin  no i cannot do that she replied gaily for foys mother is no relation of mine i think that i must call you sir prince for you see you appeared at exactly the right time just like the prince in the fairytales you know  here was an opening not to be neglected by a young man of adrians stamp  ah he said in a tender voice and looking up at the lady with his dark eyes that is a happy name indeed i would ask no better lot than to be your prince now and always charged to defend you from every danger here it may be explained that however exaggerated his language adrian honestly meant what he said seeing that already he was convinced that to be the husband of the beautiful heiress of one of the wealthiest men in the netherlands would be a very satisfactory walk in life for a young man in his position  oh sir prince broke in elsa hurriedly for her cavaliers ardour was somewhat embarrassing you are telling the story wrong the tale i mean did not go on like that at all dont you remember the hero rescued the lady and handed her overtotoher father  of whom i think he came to claim her afterwards replied adrian with another languishing glance and a smile of conscious vanity at the neatness of his answer their glances met and suddenly adrian became aware that elsas face had undergone a complete change the piquante halfamused smile had passed out of it it was strained and hard and the eyes were frightened  oh now i understand the shadowhow strange she exclaimed in a new voice  what is the matter what is strange he asked  ohonly that your face reminded me so much of a man of whom i am terrified no no i am foolish it is nothing those footpads have upset me praise be to god that we are out of that dreadful wood look neighbour broekhoven here is leyden before us are not those red roofs pretty in the twilight and how big the churches seem see too there is water all round the walls it must be a very strong town i should think that even the spaniards could not take it and oh i am sure that it would be a good thing if we might find a city which we were quite quite certain the spaniards could never takeall all of us and she sighed heavily  if i were a spanish general with a proper army began adrian pompously i would take leyden easily enough only this afternoon i studied its weak spots and made a plan of attack which could scarcely fail seeing that the place would only be defended by a mob of untrained halfarmed burghers  again that curious look returned into elsas eyes  if you were a spanish general she said slowly how can you jest about such a thing as the sacking of a town by spaniards do you know what it means that is how they talk i have heard them and she shuddered then went on you are not a spaniard are you sir that you can speak like that and without waiting for an answer elsa urged her mule forward leaving him a little behind  presently as they passed through the witte poort he was at her side again and chatting to her but although she replied courteously enough he felt that an invisible barrier had arisen between them yes she had read his secret heart it was as though she had been a party to his thoughts when he stood by the bridge this afternoon designing plans for the taking of leyden and half wishing that he might share in its capture she mistrusted him and was half afraid of him and adrian knew that it was so  ten minutes ride through the quiet town for in those days of terror and suspicion unless business took them abroad people did not frequent the streets much after sundown brought the party to the van goorls house in the bree straat here adrian dismounted and tried to open the door only to find that it was locked and barred this seemed to exasperate a temper already somewhat excited by the various events and experiences of the day and more especially by the change in elsas manner at any rate he used the knocker with unnecessary energy after a while with much turning of keys and drawing of bolts the door was opened revealing dirk his stepfather standing in the passage candle in hand while behind as though to be ready for any emergency loomed the great stooping shape of red martin  is that you adrian asked dirk in a voice at once testy and relieved then why did you not come to the side entrance instead of forcing us to unbar here  because i bring you a guest replied adrian pointing to elsa and her companions it did not occur to me that you would wish guests to be smuggled in by a back door as thoughas though they were ministers of our new religion  the bow had been drawn at a venture but the shaft went home for dirk started and whispered be silent fool then he added aloud guest what guest  it is i cousin dirk i elsa hendrik brants daughter she said sliding from her mule  elsa brant ejaculated dirk why how came you here  i will tell you presently she answered i cannot talk in the street and she touched her lips with her finger these are my friends the van broekhovens under whose escort i have travelled from the hague they wish to go on to the house of their relations the other broekhovens if some one will show them the way  then followed greetings and brief explanations after these the broekhovens departed to the house of their relatives under the care of martin while its saddle having been removed and carried into the house at elsas express request adrian led the mule round to the stable    when dirk had kissed and welcomed his young cousin he ushered her still accompanied by the saddle into the room where his wife and foy were at supper and with them the pastor arentz that clergyman who had preached to them on the previous night here he found lysbeth who had risen from the table anxiously awaiting his return so dreadful were the times that a knocking on the door at an unaccustomed hour was enough to throw those within into a paroxysm of fear especially if at the moment they chanced to be harbouring a pastor of the new faith a crime punishable with death that sound might mean nothing more than a visit from a neighbour or it might be the trump of doom to every soul within the house signifying the approach of the familiars of the inquisition and of a martyrs crown therefore lysbeth uttered a sigh of joy when her husband appeared followed only by a girl  wife he said here is our cousin elsa brant come to visit us from the hague though why i know not as yet you remember elsa the little elsa with whom we used to play so many years ago  yes indeed answered lysbeth as she put her arms about her and embraced her saying welcome child though she added glancing at her you should no longer be called child who have grown into so fair a maid but look here is the pastor arentz of whom you may have heard for he is the friend of your father and of us all  in truth yes answered elsa curtseying a salute which arentz acknowledged by saying gravely  daughter i greet you in the name of the lord who has brought you to this house safely for which give thanks  truly pastor i have need to do so since and suddenly she stopped for her eyes met those of foy who was gazing at her with such wonder and admiration stamped upon his open face that elsa coloured at the sight then recovering herself she held out her hand saying surely you are my cousin foy i should have known you again anywhere by your hair and eyes  i am glad he answered simply for it flattered him to think that this beautiful young lady remembered her old playmate whom she had not seen for at least eleven years adding but i do not think i should have known you  why she asked have i changed so much  yes foy answered bluntly you used to be a thin little girl with red arms and now you are the most lovely maiden i ever saw  at this speech everybody laughed including the pastor while elsa reddening still more replied cousin i remember that you used to be rude but now you have learned to flatter which is worse nay i beg of you spare me for foy showed signs of wishing to argue the point then turning from him she slipped off her cloak and sat down on the chair which dirk had placed for her at the table reflecting in her heart that she wished it had been foy who rescued her from the wood thieves and not the more polished adrian  afterwards as the meal went on she told the tale of their adventure scarcely was it done when adrian entered the room the first thing he noticed was that elsa and foy were seated side by side engaged in animated talk and the second that there was no cover for him at the table  have i your permission to sit down mother he asked in a loud voice for no one had seen him come in  certainly son why not answered lysbeth kindly adrians voice warned her that his temper was ruffled  because there is no place for me mother that is all though doubtless it is more worthily filled by the rev pastor arentz still after a man has been fighting for his life with armed thieves wella bit of food and a place to eat it in would have been welcome  fighting for your life son said lysbeth astonished why from what elsa has just been telling us i gathered that the rascals ran away at the first blow which you struck with your staff  indeed mother well doubtless if the lady says that it was so i took no great note at the least they ran and she was saved with the others a small service not worth mentioning still useful in its way  oh take my chair adrian said foy rising and dont make such a stir about a couple of cowardly footpads and an old hag you dont want us to think you a hero because you didnt turn tail and leave elsa and her companions in their hands do you  what you think or do not think is a matter of indifference to me replied adrian seating himself with an injured air  whatever my cousin foy may think heer adrian broke in elsa anxiously i am sure i thank god who sent so brave a gentleman to help us yes yes i mean it for it makes me sick to remember what might have happened if you had not rushed at those wicked men likelike  like david on the philistines suggested foy  you should study your bible lad put in arentz with a grave smile it was samson who slew the philistines david conquered the giant goliath though it is true that he also was a philistine  like samsoni mean davidon goliath continued elsa confusedly oh please cousin foy do not laugh i believe that you would have left me at the mercy of that dreadful man with a flat face and the bald head who was trying to steal my fathers letter by the way cousin dirk i have not given it to you yet but it is quite safe sewn up in the lining of the saddle and i was to tell you that you must read it by the old cypher  man with a flat face said dirk anxiously as he slit away at the stitches of the saddle to find the letter tell me about him what was he like and what makes you think he wished to take the paper from you  so elsa described the appearance of the man and of the blackeyed hag his companion and repeated also the words that the heer van broekhoven had heard the woman utter before the attack took place  that sounds like the spy hague simon him whom they call the butcher and his wife black meg said dirk adrian you must have seen these people was it they  for a moment adrian considered whether he should tell the truth then for certain reasons of his own decided that he would not black meg it may be explained in the intervals of graver business was not averse to serving as an emissary of venus in short she arranged assignations and adrian was fond of assignations hence his reticence  how should i know he answered after a pause the place was gloomy and i have only set eyes upon hague simon and his wife about twice in my life  softly brother said foy and stick to the truth however gloomy the wood may have been you know black meg pretty well at any rate for i have often seen you and he stopped suddenly as though sorry that the words had slipped from his tongue  adrian is this so asked dirk in the silence which followed  no stepfather answered adrian  you hear said dirk addressing foy in future son i trust that you will be more careful with your words it is no charge to bring lightly against a man that he has been seen in the fellowship of one of the most infamous wretches in leyden a creature whose hands are stained red with the blood of innocent men and women and who as your mother knows once brought me near to the scaffold  suddenly the laughing boyish look passed out of the face of foy and it grew stern  i am sorry for my words he said since black meg does other things besides spying and adrian may have had business of his own with her which is no affair of mine but as they are spoke i cant eat them so you must decide which of us isnot truthful  nay foy nay interposed arentz do not put it thus doubtless there is some mistake and have i not told you before that you are over rash of tongue  yes and a great many other things answered foy every one of them true for i am a miserable sinner well all right there is a mistake and it is he added with an air of radiant innocency that somehow was scarcely calculated to deceive that i was merely poking a stick into adrians temper i never saw him talking to black meg now are you satisfied  then the storm broke as elsa who had been watching the face of adrian while he listened to foys artless but somewhat fatuous explanation saw that it must break  there is a conspiracy against me said adrian who had grown white with rage yes everything has conspired against me today first the ragamuffins in the street make a mock of me and then my hawk is killed next it chances that i rescue this lady and her companions from robbers in the wood but do i get any thanks for this no i come home to find that i am so much forgotten that no place is even laid for me at table more to be jeered at for the humble services that i have done lastly i have the lie given to me and without reproach by my brother who were he not my brother should answer for it at the swords point  oh adrian adrian broke in foy dont be a fool stop before you say something you will be sorry for  that isnt all went on adrian taking no heed whom do i find at this table the worthy heer arentz a minister of the new religion well i protest i belong to the new religion myself having been brought up in that faith but it must be well known that the presence of a pastor here in our house exposes everybody to the risk of death if my stepfather and foy choose to take that risk well and good but i maintain that they have no right to lay its consequences upon my mother whose eldest son i am nor even upon myself  now dirk rose and tapped adrian on the shoulder young man he said coldly and with glittering eyes listen to me the risks which i and my son foy and my wife your mother take we run for conscience sake you have nothing to do with them it is our affair but since you have raised the question if your faith is not strong enough to support you i acknowledge that i have no right to bring you into danger look you adrian you are no son of mine in you i have neither part nor lot yet i have cared for you and supported you since you were born under very strange and unhappy circumstances yes you have shared whatever i had to give with my own son without preference or favour and should have shared it even after my death and now if these are your opinions i am tempted to say to you that the world is wide and that instead of idling here upon my bounty you would do well to win your own way through it as far from leyden as may please you  you throw your benefits in my teeth and reproach me with my birth broke in adrian who by now was almost raving with passion as though it were a crime in me to have other blood running in my veins than that of netherlander tradesfolk well if so it would seem that the crime was my mothers and not mine who  adrian adrian cried foy in warning but the madman heeded not  who he went on furiously was content to be the companion for i understand that she was never really married to him of some noble spaniard before she became the wife of a leyden artisan  he ceased and at this moment there broke from lysbeths lips a low wail of such bitter anguish that it chilled even his mad rage to silence  shame on thee my son said the wail who art not ashamed to speak thus of the mother that bore thee  ay echoed dirk in the stillness that followed shame on thee once thou wast warned but now i warn no more  then he stepped to the door opened it and called martin come hither  presently still in that heavy silence which was broken only by the quick breath of adrian panting like some wild beast in a net was heard the sound of heavy feet shuffling down the passage then martin entered the room and stood there gazing about him with his large blue eyes that were like the eyes of a wondering child  your pleasure master he said at length  martin roos replied dirk waving back arentz who rose to speak take that young man my stepson the heer adrian and lead him from my housewithout violence if possible my order is that henceforth you are not to suffer him to set foot within its threshold see that it is not disobeyed go adrian tomorrow your possessions shall be sent to you and with them such money as shall suffice to start you in the world  without comment or any expression of surprise the huge martin shuffled forward towards adrian his hand outstretched as though to take him by the arm  what exclaimed adrian as martin advanced down the room you set your mastiff on me do you then i will show you how a gentleman treats dogs and suddenly a naked dagger shining in his hand he leaped straight at the frisians throat so quick and fierce was the onslaught that only one issue to it seemed possible elsa gasped and closed her eyes thinking when she opened them to see that knife plunged to the hilt in martins breast and foy sprang forward yet in this twinkling of an eye the danger was done with for by some movement too quick to follow martin had dealt his assailant such a blow upon the arm that the poniard jarred from his grasp flew flashing across the room to fall in lysbeths lap another second and the iron grip had closed upon adrians shoulder and although he was strong and struggled furiously yet he could not loose the hold of that single hand  please cease fighting mynheer adrian for it is quite useless said martin to his captive in a voice as calm as though nothing unusual had happened then he turned and walked with him towards the door  on the threshold martin stopped and looking over his shoulder said master i think that the heer is dead do you still wish me to put him into the street  they crowded round and stared it was true adrian seemed to be dead at least his face was like that of a corpse while from the corner of his mouth blood trickled in a thin stream    chapter xii  the summons  wretched man said lysbeth wringing her hands and with a shudder shaking the dagger from her lap as though it had been a serpent you have killed my son  your pardon mistress replied martin placidly but that is not so the master ordered me to remove the heer adrian whereon the heer adrian very naturally tried to stab me but i having been accustomed to such things in my youth and he looked deprecatingly towards the pastor arentz struck the heer adrian upon the bone of his elbow causing the knife to jump from his hand for had i not done so i should have been dead and unable to execute the commands of my master then i took the heer adrian by the shoulder gently as i might and walked away with him whereupon he died of rage for which i am very sorry but not to blame  you are right man said lysbeth it is you who are to blame dirk yes you have murdered my son oh never mind what he said his temper was always fierce and who pays any heed to the talk of a man in a mad passion  why did you let your brother be thus treated cousin foy broke in elsa quivering with indignation it was cowardly of you to stand still and see that great red creature crush the life out of him when you know well that it was because of your taunts that he lost his temper and said things that he did not mean as i do myself sometimes no i will never speak to you againand only this afternoon he saved me from the robbers and she burst into weeping  peace peace this is no time for angry words said the pastor arentz pushing his way through the group of bewildered men and overwrought women he can scarcely be dead let me look at him i am something of a doctor and he knelt by the senseless and bleeding adrian to examine him  take comfort vrouw van goorl he said presently your son is not dead for his heart beats nor has his friend martin injured him in any way by the exercise of his strength but i think that in his fury he has burst a bloodvessel for he bleeds fast my counsel is that he should be put to bed and his head cooled with cold water till the surgeon can be fetched to treat him lift him in your arms martin  so martin carried adrian not to the street but to his bed while foy glad of an excuse to escape the undeserved reproaches of elsa and the painful sight of his mothers grief went to seek the physician in due course he returned with him and to the great relief of all of them the learned man announced that notwithstanding the blood which he had lost he did not think that adrian would die though at the best he must keep his bed for some weeks have skilful nursing and be humoured in all things  while his wife lysbeth and elsa were attending to adrian dirk and his son foy for the pastor arentz had gone sat upstairs talking in the sittingroom that same balconied chamber in which once dirk had been refused while montalvo hid behind the curtain dirk was much disturbed for when his wrath had passed he was a tenderhearted man and his stepsons plight distressed him greatly now he was justifying himself to foy or rather to his own conscience  a man who could speak so of his own mother was not fit to stop in the same house with her he said moreover you heard his words about the pastor i tell you son i am afraid of this adrian  unless that bleeding from his mouth stops soon you will not have cause to fear him much longer replied foy sadly but if you want my opinion about the business father why here it isi think that you have made too much of a small matter adrian isadrian he is not one of us and he should not be judged as though he were you cannot imagine me flying into a fury because the women forgot to set my place at table or trying to stab martin and bursting a blood vessel because you told him to lead me out of the room no i should know better for what is the use of any ordinary man attempting to struggle against martin he might as well try to argue with the inquisition but then i am i and adrian is adrian  but the words he used son remember the words  yes and if i had spoken them they would have meant a great deal but in adrians mouth i think no more of them than if they came from some angry woman why he is always sulking or taking offence or flying into rages over something or other and when he is like that it all meansjust nothing except that he wants to use fine talk and show off and play the don over us he did not really mean to lie to me when he said that i had not seen him talking to black meg he only meant to contradict or perhaps to hide something up as a matter of fact if you want to know the truth i believe that the old witch took notes for him to some young lady and that hague simon supplied him with rats for his hawks  yes foy that may be so but how about his talk of the pastor it makes me suspicious son you know the times we live in and if he should go that wayremember it is in his bloodthe lives of every one of us are in his hand the father tried to burn me once and i do not wish the child to finish the work  then when they come out of his hand you are at liberty to cut off mine answered foy hotly i have been brought up with adrian and i know what he is he is vain and pompous and every time he looks at you and me he thanks god that he was not made like that also he has failings and vices and he is lazy being too fine a gentleman to work like a common flemish burgher and all the rest of it but father he has a good heart and if any man outside this house were to tell me that adrian is capable of playing the traitor and bringing his own family to the scaffold well i would make him swallow his words or try to that is all as regards what he said about my mothers first marriageand foy hung his headof course it is a subject on which i have no right to talk but father speaking as one man to anotherhe is sadly placed and innocent whatever others may have been and i dont wonder that he feels sore about the story  as he spoke the door opened and lysbeth entered  how goes it with adrian wife dirk asked hastily  better husband thank god though the doctor stays with him for this night he has lost much blood and at the best must lie long abed above all none must cross his mood or use him roughly and she looked at her husband with meaning  peace wife dirk answered with irritation foy here has just read me one lecture upon my dealings with your son and i am in no mood to listen to another i served the man as he deserved neither less nor more and if he chose to go mad and vomit blood why it is no fault of mine you should have brought him up to a soberer habit  adrian is not as other men are and ought not to be measured by the same rule said lysbeth almost repeating foys words  so i have been told before wife though i who have but one standard of right and wrong find the saying hard but so be it doubtless the rule for adrian is that which should be used to measure angelsor spaniards and not one suited to us poor hollanders who do our work pay our debts and dont draw knives on unarmed men  have you read the letter from your cousin brant asked lysbeth changing the subject  no answered dirk what with daggers swoonings and scoldings it slipped my mind and drawing the paper from his tunic he cut the silk and broke the seals i had forgotten he went on looking at the sheets of words interspersed with meaningless figures it is in our private cypher as elsa said or at least most of it is get the key from my desk son and let us set to work for our task is likely to be long  foy obeyed returning presently with an old testament of a very scarce edition with the help of this book and an added vocabulary by slow degrees they deciphered the long epistle foy writing it down sentence by sentence as they learned their significance when at length the task was finished which was not till well after midnight dirk read the translation aloud to lysbeth and his son it ran thus   wellbeloved cousin and old friend you will be astonished to see my dear child elsa who brings you this paper sewn in her saddle where i trust none will seek it and wonder why she comes to you without warning i will tell you  you know that here the axe and the stake are very busy for at the hague the devil walks loose yes he is the master in this land well although the blow has not yet fallen on me since for a while i have bought off the informers hour by hour the sword hangs over my head nor can i escape it in the end that i am suspected of the new faith is not my real crime you can guess it cousin they desire my wealth now i have sworn that no spaniard shall have this no not if i must sink it in the sea to save it from them since it has been heaped up to another end yet they desire it sorely and spies are about my path and about my bed worst among them all and at the head of them is a certain ramiro a oneeyed man but lately come from spain it is said as an agent of the inquisition whose manners are those of a person who was once a gentleman and who seems to know this country well this fellow has approached me offering if i will give him threeparts of my wealth to secure my escape with the rest and i have told him that i will consider the offer for this reason only i have a little respite since he desires that my money should go into his pocket and not into that of the government but by the help of god neither of them shall touch it  see you dirk the treasure is not here in the house as they think it is hidden but in a spot where it cannot stay  therefore if you love me and hold that i have been a good friend to you send your son foy with one other strong and trusted manyour frisian servant martin if possibleon the morrow after you receive this when night falls he should have been in the hague some hours and have refreshed himself but let him not come near me or my house half an hour after sunset let him followed by his serving man walk up and down the right side of the broad street in the hague as though seeking adventures till a girl also followed by a servant pushes up against him as if on purpose and whispers in his ear are you from leyden sweetheart then he must say yes and accompany her till he comes to a place where he will learn what must be done and how to do it above all he must follow no woman who may accost him and does not repeat these words the girl who addresses him will be short dark pretty and gaily dressed with a red bow upon her left shoulder but let him not be misled by look or dress unless she speaks the words  if he reaches england or leyden safely with the stuff let him hide it for the present friend till your heart tells you it is needed i care not where nor do i wish to know for if i knew flesh and blood are weak and i might give up the secret when they stretch me on the rack  already you have my will sent to you three months ago and enclosed in it a list of goods open it now and you will find that under it my possessions pass to you and your heirs absolutely as my executors for such especial trusts and purposes as are set out therein elsa has been ailing and it is known that the leech has ordered her a change therefore her journey to leyden will excite no wonder neither or so i hope will even ramiro guess that i should enclose a letter such as this in so frail a casket still there is danger for spies are many but having no choice and my need being urgent i must take the risks if the paper is seized they cannot read it for they will never make out the cypher since even did they know of them no copies of our books can be found in holland moreover were this writing all plain dutch or spanish it tells nothing of the whereabouts of the treasure of its destination or of the purpose to which it is dedicate lastly should any spaniard chance to find that wealth it will vanish and mayhap he with it   what can he mean by that interrupted foy  i know not answered dirk my cousin brant is not a person who speaks at random so perhaps we have misinterpreted the passage then he went on reading   now i have done with the pelf which must take its chance only i pray youi trust it to your honour and to your love of an old friend to bury it burn it cast it to the four winds of heaven before you suffer a spaniard to touch a gem or a piece of gold  i send to you today elsa my only child you will know my reason she will be safer with you in leyden than here at the hague since if they take me they might take her also the priests and their tools do not spare the young especially if their rights stand between them and money also she knows little of my desperate strait she is ignorant even of the contents of this letter and i do not wish that she should share these troubles i am a doomed man and she loves me poor child one day she will hear that it is over and that will be sad for her but it would be worse if she knew all from the beginning when i bid her goodbye tomorrow it will be for the last timegod give me strength to bear the blow  you are her guardian as you deal with hernay i must be crazy with my troubles for none other would think it needful to remind dirk van goorl or his son of their duty to the dead farewell friend and cousin god guard you and yours in these dreadful times with which it has pleased him to visit us for a season that through us perhaps this country and the whole world may be redeemed from priestcraft and tyranny greet your honoured wife lysbeth from me also your son foy who used to be a merry lad and whom i hope to see again within a night or two although it may be fated that we shall not meet my blessing on him especially if he prove faithful in all these things may the almighty who guards us give us a happy meeting in the hereafter which is at hand pray for me farewell farewellhendrik brant  ps i beg the dame lysbeth to see that elsa wears woollen when the weather turns damp or cold since her chest is somewhat delicate this was my wifes last charge and i pass it on to you as regards her marriage should she live i leave that to your judgment with this command only that her inclination shall not be forced beyond what is right and proper when i am dead kiss her for me and tell her that i loved her beyond any creature now living on the earth and that wherever i am from day to day i wait to welcome her as i shall wait to welcome you and yours dirk van goorl in case these presents miscarry i will send duplicates of them also in mixed cypher whenever chance may offer    having finished reading the translation of this cypher document dirk bent his head while he folded it not wishing that his face should be seen foy also turned aside to hide the tears which gathered in his eyes while lysbeth wept openly  a sad letter and sad times said dirk at length  poor elsa muttered foy then added with a return of hopefulness perhaps he is mistaken he may escape after all  lysbeth shook her head as she answered  hendrik brant is not the man to write like that if there was any hope for him nor would he part with his daughter unless he knew that the end must be near at hand  why then does he not fly asked foy  because the moment he stirred the inquisition would pounce upon him as a cat pounces upon a mouse that tries to run from its corner replied his father while the mouse sits still the cat sits also and purrs when it moves  there was a silence in which dirk having fetched the will of hendrik brant from a safe hiding place where it had lain since it reached his hands some months before opened the seals and read it aloud  it proved to be a very short document under the terms of which dirk van goorl and his heirs inherited all the property real and personal of hendrik brant upon trust 1 to make such ample provision for his daughter elsa as might be needful or expedient 2 to apply the remainder of the money for the defence of our country the freedom of religious faith and the destruction of the spaniards in such fashion and at such time or times as god should reveal to them which added the will assuredly he will do  enclosed in this document was an inventory of the property that constituted the treasure at the head came an almost endless list of jewels all of them carefully scheduled these were the first three items  item the necklace of great pearls that i exchanged with the emperor charles when he took a love for sapphires enclosed in a watertight copper box  item a coronet and stomacher of rubies mounted in my own gold work the best that ever i did which three queens have coveted and none was rich enough to buy  item the great emerald that my father left me the biggest known having magic signs of ancients engraved upon the back of it and enclosed in a chased case of gold  then came other long lists of precious stones too numerous to mention but of less individual value and after them this entry  item four casks filled with gold coin i know not the exact weight or number  at the bottom of this schedule was written a very great treasure the greatest of all the netherlands a fruit of three generations of honest trading and saving converted by me for the most part into jewels that it may be easier to move this is the prayer of me hendrik brant who owns it for his life that this gold may prove the earthly doom of any spaniard who tries to steal it and as i write it comes into my mind that god will grant this my petition amen amen amen so say i hendrik brant who stand at the gate of death  all of this inventory dirk read aloud and when he had finished lysbeth gasped with amazement  surely she said this little cousin of ours is richer than many princes yes with such a dowry princes would be glad to take her in marriage  the fortune is large enough answered dirk but oh what a burden has hendrik brant laid upon our backs for under this will the wealth is left not straight to the lawful heiress elsa but to me and my heirs on the trusts started and they are heavy look you wife the spaniards know of this vast hoard and the priests know of it and no stone on earth or hell will they leave unturned to win that money i say that for his own sake my cousin hendrik would have done better to accept the offer of the spanish thief ramiro and give him threefourths and escape to england with the rest but that is not his nature who was ever stubborn and who would die ten times over rather than enrich the men he hates moreover he who is no miser has saved this fortune that the bulk of it may be spent for his country in the hour of her need and alas of that need we are made the judges since he is called away wife i foresee that these gems and gold will breed bloodshed and misery to all our house but the trust is laid upon us and it must be borne foy tomorrow at dawn you and martin will start for the hague to carry out the command of your cousin brant  why should my sons life be risked on this mad errand asked lysbeth  because it is a duty mother answered foy cheerfully although he tried to look depressed he was young and enterprising moreover the adventure promised to be full of novelty  in spite of himself dirk smiled and bade him summon martin  a minute later foy was in the great mans den and kicking at his prostrate form wake up you snoring bull he said awake  martin sat up his red beard showing like a fire in the shine of the taper what is it now master foy he asked yawning are they after us about those two dead soldiers  no you sleepy lump its treasure  i dont care about treasure replied martin indifferently  its spaniards  that sounds better said martin shutting his mouth tell me about it master foy while i pull on my jerkin  so foy told him as much as he could in two minutes  yes it sounds well commented martin critically if i know anything of those spaniards we shant get back to leyden without something happening but i dont like that bit about the women as likely as not they will spoil everything  then he accompanied foy to the upper room and there received his instructions from dirk with a solemn and unmoved countenance  are you listening asked dirk sharply do you understand  i think so master replied martin hear and he repeated sentence by sentence every word that had fallen from dirks lips for when he chose to use it martins memory was good one or two questions master he said this stuff must be brought through at all hazards  at all hazards answered dirk  and if we cannot bring it through it must be hidden in the best way possible  yes  and if people should try to interfere with us i understand that we must fight  of course  and if in the fighting we chance to kill anybody i shall not be reproached and called a murderer by the pastor or others  i think not replied dirk  and if anything should happen to my young master here his blood will not be laid upon my head  lysbeth groaned then she stood up and spoke  martin why do you ask such foolish questions your peril my son must share and if harm should come to him as may chance we shall know well that it is no fault of yours you are not a coward or a traitor martin  well i think not mistress at least not often but you see here are two duties the first to get this money through the second to protect the heer foy i wish to know which of these is the more important  it was dirk who answered  you go to carry out the wishes of my cousin brant they must be attended to before anything else  very good replied martin you quite understand heer foy  oh perfectly replied that young man grinning  then go to bed for an hour or two as you may have to keep awake tomorrow night i will call you at dawn your servant master and mistress i hope to report myself to you within sixty hours but if i do not come within eighty or let us say a hundred it may be well to make inquiries and he shuffled back to his den    youth sleeps well whatever may be behind or before it and it was not until martin had called to him thrice next morning that foy opened his eyes in the grey light and remembering sprang from his bed  theres no hurry said martin but it will be as well to get out of leyden before many people are about  as he spoke lysbeth entered the room fully dressed for she had not slept that night carrying in her hand a little leathern bag  how is adrian mother asked foy as she stooped down to kiss him  he sleeps and the doctor who is still with him says that he does well she answered but see here foy you are about to start upon your first adventure and this is my present to youthis and my blessing then she untied the neck of the bag and poured from it something that lay upon the table in a shining heap no larger than martins fist foy took hold of the thing and held it up whereon the little heap stretched itself out marvellously till it was as large indeed as the body garment of a man  steel shirt exclaimed martin nodding his head in approval and adding good wear for those who mix with spaniards  yes said lysbeth my father brought this from the east on one of his voyages i remember he told me that he paid for it its weight in gold and silver and that even then it was sold to him only by the special favour of the king of that country the shirt they said was ancient and of such work as cannot now be made it had been worn from father to son in one family for three hundred years but no man that wore it ever died by bodycut or thrust since sword or dagger cannot pierce that steel at least son this is the story and strangely enough when i lost all the rest of my heritage and she sighed this shirt was left to me for it lay in its bag in the old oak chest and none noticed it or thought it worth the taking so make the most of it foy it is all that remains of your grandfathers fortune since this house is now your fathers  beyond kissing his mother in thanks foy made no answer he was too much engaged in examining the wonders of the shirt which as a worker in metals he could well appreciate but martin said again  better than money much better than money god knew that and made them leave the mail  i never saw the like of it broke in foy look it runs together like quicksilver and is light as leather see too it has stood sword and dagger stroke before today and holding it in a sunbeam they perceived in many directions faint lines and spots upon the links caused in past years by the cutting edge of swords and the points of daggers yet never a one of those links was severed or broken  i pray that it may stand them again if your body be inside of it said lysbeth yet son remember always that there is one who can guard you better than any human mail however perfect and she left the room  then foy drew on the coat over his woollen jersey and it fitted him well though not so well as in after years when he had grown thicker indeed when his linen shirt and his doublet were over it none could have guessed that he was clothed in armour of proof  it isnt fair martin he said that i should be wrapped in steel and you in nothing  martin smiled do you take me for a fool master he said who have seen some fighting in my day private and public look here and opening his leathern jerkin he showed that he was clothed beneath in a strange garment of thick but supple hide  bullskin said martin tanned as we know how up in friesland not as good as yours but will turn most cuts or arrows i sat up last night making one for you it was almost finished before but the steel is cooler and better for those who can afford it come let us go and eat we should be at the gates at eight when they open    chapter xiii  mothers gifts are good gifts  at a few minutes to eight that morning a small crowd of people had gathered in front of the witte poort at leyden waiting for the gate to be opened they were of all sorts but country folk for the most part returning to their villages leading mules and donkeys slung with empty panniers and shouting greetings through the bars of the gate to acquaintances who led in other mules laden with vegetables and provisions among these stood some priests saturnine and silent bent doubtless upon dark business of their own a squad of spanish soldiers waited also the insolence of the master in their eyes they were marching to some neighbouring city there too appeared foy van goorl and red martin who led a pack mule foy dressed in the grey jerkin of a merchant but armed with a sword and mounted on a good mare martin riding a flemish gelding that nowadays would only have been thought fit for the plough since no lighterboned beast could carry his weight among these moved a dapper little man with sandy whiskers and sly face asking their business and destination of the various travellers and under pretence of guarding against the smuggling of forbidden goods taking count upon his tablets of their merchandise and baggage  presently he came to foy  name he said shortly although he knew him well enough  foy van goorl and martin his fathers servant travelling to the hague with specimens of brassware consigned to the correspondents of our firm answered foy indifferently  you are very glib sneered the sandywhiskered man what is the mule laden with it may be bibles for all i know  nothing half so valuable master replied foy it is a church chandelier in pieces  unpack it and show me the pieces said the officer  foy flushed with anger and set his teeth but martin administering to him a warning nudge in the ribs submitted with prompt obedience  it was a long business for each arm of the chandelier had been carefully wrapped in hay bands and the official would not pass them until every one was undone after which they must be done up again while the pair of them were engaged upon this tedious and unnecessary task two fresh travellers arrived at the gate a long bony person clothed in a priestlike garb with a hood that hid the head and a fierce dissolutelooking individual of military appearance and armed to the teeth catching sight of young van goorl and his servant the long person who seemed to ride very awkwardly with legs thrust forward whispered something to the soldier man and they passed on without question through the gate  when foy and martin followed them twenty minutes later they were out of sight for the pair were well mounted and rode hard  did you recognise them asked martin so soon as they were clear of the crowd  no said foy who are they  the papist witch black meg dressed like a man and the fellow who came here from the hague yesterday whither they are going to report that the heer adrian routed them and that the broekhovens with the jufvrouw elsa got through unsearched  what does it all mean martin  it means master that we shall have a warm welcome yonder it means that some one guesses we know about this treasure and that we shant get the stuff away without trouble  will they waylay us  martin shrugged his shoulders as he answered it is always well to be ready but i think not coming back they may waylay us not going our lives are of little use without the money also they cannot be had for the asking  martin was right for travelling slowly they reached the city without molestation and riding to the house of dirks correspondent put up their horses ate rested delivered the sample chandelier and generally transacted the business which appeared to be the object of their journey in the course of conversation they learned from their host that things were going very ill here at the hague for all who were supposed to favour the new religion tortures burnings abductions and murders were of daily occurrence nor were any brought to judgment for these crimes indeed soldiers spies and government agents were quartered on the citizens doing what they would and none dared to lift a hand against them hendrik brant they heard also was still at large and carrying on business as usual in his shop though rumour said that he was a marked man whose time would be short  foy announced that they would stay the night and a little after sunset called to martin to accompany him as he wished to walk in the broad street to see the sights of the town  be careful mynheer foy said their host in warning for there are many strange characters about men and women oh yes this mere is full of pike and fresh bait is snapped up sharply  we will be wary replied foy with the cheerful air of a young man eager for excitement hague pike dont like leyden perch you know they stick in their throats  i hope so i hope so said the host still i pray you be careful you will remember where to find the horses if you want them they are fed and i will keep them saddled your arrival here is known and for some reason this house is being watched  foy nodded and they started out foy going first and red martin staring round him like a bewildered bumpkin following at his heel with his great sword which was called silence girt about his middle and hidden as much as possible beneath his jerkin  i wish you wouldnt look so big martin foy whispered over his shoulder everybody is staring at you and that red beard of yours which glows like a kitchen fire  i cant help it master said martin my back aches with stooping as it is and as for the beard well god made it so  at least you might dye it answered foy if it were black you would be less like a beacon on a church tower  another day master it is a long business dyeing a beard like mine i think it would be quicker to cut it off then he stopped for they were in the broad street  here they found many people moving to and fro but although the company were so numerous it was difficult to distinguish them for no moon shone and the place was lighted by lanterns set up on poles at long distances from each other foy could see however that they were for the most part folk of bad character disreputable women soldiers of the garrison halfdrunk sailors from every country and gliding in and out among them all priests and other observers of events before they had been long in the crowd a man stumbled against foy rudely at the same time telling him to get out of the path but although his blood leapt at the insult and his hand went to his sword hilt foy took no notice for he understood at once that it was sought to involve him in a quarrel next a woman accosted him a gailydressed woman but she had no bow upon her shoulder so foy merely shook his head and smiled for the rest of that walk however he was aware that this woman was watching him and with her a man whose figure he could not distinguish for he was wrapped in a black cloak  thrice did foy followed by martin thus promenade the right side of the broad street till he was heartily weary of the game indeed and began to wonder if his cousin brants plans had not miscarried  as he turned for the fourth time his doubts were answered for he found himself face to face with a small woman who wore upon her shoulder a large red bow and was followed by another woman a buxom person dressed in a peasants cap the lady with the red bow making pretence to stumble precipitated herself with an affected scream right into his arms and as he caught her whispered are you from leyden sweetheart yes then treat me as i treat you and follow always where i lead first make pretence to be rid of me  as she finished whispering foy heard a warning stamp from martin followed by the footsteps of the pair who he knew were watching them which he could distinguish easily for here at the end of the street there were fewer people so he began to act as best he couldit was not very well but his awkwardness gave him a certain air of sincerity  no no he said why should i pay for your supper come be going my good girl and leave me and my servant to see the town in peace  oh mynheer let me be your guide i beg you answered she of the red bow clasping her hands and looking up into his face just then he heard the first woman who had accosted him speaking to her companion in a loud voice  look she said red bow is trying her best ah my dear do you think that youll get a supper out of a holy leyden ranter or a skin off an eel for the asking  oh he isnt such a selfish fish as he looks answered red bow over her shoulder while her eyes told foy that it was his turn to play  so he played to the best of his ability with the result that ten minutes later any for whom the sight had interest might have observed a yellowhaired young gallant and a blackhaired young woman walking down the broad street with their arms affectionately disposed around each others middles following them was a huge and lumbering serving man with a beard like fire who in a loyal effort to imitate the actions of his master had hooked a great limb about the neck of red bows stout little attendant and held her thus in a chancery which if flattering must have been uncomfortable as martin explained to the poor woman afterwards it was no fault of his since in order to reach her waist he must have carried her under his arm  foy and his companion chatted merrily enough if in a somewhat jerky fashion but martin attempted no talk only as he proceeded he was heard to mutter between his teeth lucky the pastor arentz cant see us now he would never understand he is so onesided so at least foy declared subsequently in leyden  presently at a hint from his lady foy turned down a side street unobserved as he thought till he heard a mocking voice calling after them goodnight red bow hope you will have a fine supper with your leyden shopboy  quick whispered red bow and they turned another corner then another and another now they walked down narrow streets illkept and unsavoury with sharp pitched roofs gabled and overhanging so much that here and there they seemed almost to meet leaving but a ribbon of starspecked sky winding above their heads evidently it was a low quarter of the town and a malodourous quarter for the canals spanned by picturesque and higharched bridges were everywhere and at this summer season the water in them was low rotten and almost stirless  at length red bow halted and knocked upon a small recessed door which instantly was opened by a man who bore no light  come in he whispered and all four of them passed into a darksome passage quick quick said the man i hear footsteps  foy heard them also echoing down the empty street and as the door closed it seemed to him that they stopped in the deep shadow of the houses then holding each other by the hand they crept along black passages and down stairs till at length they saw light shining through the crevices of an illfitting door it opened mysteriously at their approach and when they had all entered shut behind them  foy uttered a sigh of relief for he was weary of this long flight and looked round him to discover that they were in a large windowless cellar well furnished after a fashion by oak benches and a table set out with cold meats and flagons of wine at the foot of this table stood a middleaged man prematurely grey and with a face worn as though by constant care  welcome foy van goorl said the man in a gentle voice many years have passed since last we met still i should have known you anywhere though i think you would not have known me  foy looked at him and shook his head  i thought so went on the man with a smile well i am hendrik brant your cousin once the burgomaster of the hague and its richest citizen but today a hunted rat who must receive his guests in secret cellars tell me now did my daughter elsa reach your good fathers house in safety and is she well  so foy told him all that story  as i thought as i thought said hendrik ramiro knew of her journey and guessed that she might carry some letter oh he went on shaking his fist in a kind of frenzy and addressing the two women who had played the parts of red bow and her servant who among you is the traitor can it be that you whom my bounty has fed betray me nay girls do not weep i know that it is not so and yet in this city the very walls have ears yes even this deep vault gives up its secrets well if only i can save my fortune from those wolves what do i care then they may take my carcase and tear it at least my daughter is safefor a while and now i have but one desire left on earthto rob them of my wealth also  then he turned to the girl decked out in the gay clothes who now that the chase was over sat upon a bench with her face hidden in her hand and said tell me your story gretchen whereon she lifted her head and repeated all that happened  they press us hard muttered brant but friends we will beat them yet eat now and drink while you may  so they sat down and ate and drank while hendrik watched them and the man who had led them to the vault listened without the door  when they had finished brant bade the two women red bow and the other leave the cellar and send in the sentry replacing him as guards he entered a hardfaced grizzled man and taking a seat at the table began to fill himself with food and wine  hearken my cousin foy said brant presently this is the plan a league away near to the mouth of the great canal lie certain boats a score or over of them laden with trading goods and timber in the charge of honest men who know nothing of their cargo but who have orders to fire them if they should be boarded among these boats is one called the swallow small but the swiftest on this coast and handy in a sea her cargo is salt and beneath it eight kegs of powder and between the powder and the salt certain barrels which barrels are filled with treasure now presently if you have the heart for itand if you have not say so and i will go myselfthis man here hans under cover of the darkness will row you down to the boat swallow then you must board her and at the first break of dawn hoist her sail and stand out to sea and away with her where the wind drives tying the skiff behind like enough you will find foes waiting for you at the mouth of the canal or elsewhere then i can give you only one counselget out with the swallow if you can and if you cannot escape in the skiff or by swimming but before you leave her fire the slowmatches that are ready at the bow and the stern and let the powder do its work and blow my wealth to the waters and the winds will you do it think think well before you answer  did we not come from leyden to be at your command cousin said foy smiling then he added but why do you not accompany us on this adventure you are in danger here and even if we get clear with the treasure what use is money without life  to me none any way answered brant but you do not understand i live in the midst of spies i am watched day and night although i came here disguised and secretly it is probable that even my presence in this house is known more there is an order out that if i attempt to leave the town by land or water i am to be seized whereon my house will be searched instantly and it will be found that my bullion is gone think lad how great is this wealth and you will understand why the crows are hungry it is talked of throughout the netherlands it has been reported to the king in spain and i learn that orders have come from him concerning its seizure but there is another band who would get hold of it first ramiro and his crew and that is why i have been left safe so long because the thieves strive one against the other and watch each other most of all however they watch me and everything that is mine for though they do not believe that i should send the treasure away and stay behind yet they are not sure  you think that they will pursue us then asked foy  for certain messengers arrived from leyden to announce your coming two hours before you set foot in the town and it will be wonderful indeed if you leave it without a band of cutthroats at your heels be not deceived lad this business is no light one  you say the little boat sails fast master queried martin  she sails fast but perhaps others are as swift moreover it may happen that you will find the mouth of the canal blocked by the guardship which was sent there a week ago with orders to search every craft that passes from stem to stern oryou may slip past her  my master and i are not afraid of a few blows said martin and we are ready to take our risks like brave men still mynheer brant this seems to me a hazardous business and one in which your money may well get itself lost now i ask you would it not be better to take this treasure out of the boat where you have hidden it and bury it and convey it away by land  brant shook his head i have thought of that he said as i have thought of everything but it cannot now be done also there is no time to make fresh plans  why asked foy  because day and night men are watching the boats which are known to belong to me although they are registered in other names and only this evening an order was signed that they must be searched within an hour of dawn my information is good as it should be since i pay for it dearly  then said foy there is nothing more to be said we will try to get to the boat and try to get her away and if we can get her away we will try to hide the treasure and if we cant we will try to blow her up as you direct and try to escape ourselves or and he shrugged his shoulders  martin said nothing only he shook his great red head nor did the silent pilot at the table speak at all  hendrik brant looked at them and his pale careworn face began to work have i the right he muttered to himself and for an instant or two bent his head as though in prayer when he lifted it again his mind seemed to be made up  foy van goorl he said listen to me and tell your father my cousin and executor what i say since i have no time to write it tell him word for word you are wondering why i do not let this pelf take its chance without risking the lives of men to save it it is because something in my heart pushes me to another path it may be imagination but i am a man standing on the edge of the grave and to such i have known it given to see the future i think that you will win through with the treasure foy and that it will be the means of bringing some wicked ones to their doom yes and more much more but what it is i cannot altogether see yet i am quite certain that thousands and tens of thousands of our folk will live to bless the gold of hendrik brant and that is why i work so hard to save it from the spaniards also that is why i ask you to risk your lives tonight not for the wealths sake for wealth is dross but for what the wealth will buy in days to come  he paused a while then went on i think also cousin that being they tell me unaffianced you will learn to love and not in vain that dear child of mine whom i leave in your fathers keeping and in yours more since time is short and we shall never meet again i say to you plainly that the thought is pleasing to me young cousin foy for i have a good report of you and like your blood and looks remember always however dark may be your sky that before he passed to doom hendrik brant had this vision concerning you and the daughter whom he loves and whom you will learn to love as do all who know her remember also that priceless things are not lightly won and do not woo her for her fortune since i tell you this belongs not to her but to our people and our cause and when the hour comes for them it must be used  foy listened wondering but he made no answer for he knew not what to say yet now on the edge of his first great adventure these words were comfortable to him who had found already that elsas eyes were bright brant next turned towards martin but that worthy shook his red head and stepped back a pace  thank you kindly master he said but i will do without the prophecies which good or ill are things that fasten upon a mans mind once an astrologer cast my nativity and foretold that i should be drowned before i was twentyfive i wasnt but my faith the miles which i have walked round to bridges on account of that astrologer  brant smiled i have no foresight concerning you good friend except that i judge your arm will be always strong in battle that you will love your masters well and use your might to avenge the cause of gods slaughtered saints upon their murderers  martin nodded his head vigorously and fumbled at the handle of the sword silence while brant went on  friend you have entered on a dangerous quarrel on behalf of me and mine and if you live through it you will have earned high pay  then he went to the table and taking writing materials he wrote as follows to the heer dirk van goorl and his heirs the executors of my will and the holders of my fortune which is to be used as god shall show them this is to certify that in payment of this nights work martin called the red the servant of the said dirk van goorl or those heirs whom he may appoint is entitled to a sum of five thousand florins and i constitute such sum a first charge upon my estate to whatever purpose they may put it in their discretion this document he dated signed and caused the pilot hans to sign also as a witness then he gave it to martin who thanked him by touching his forehead remarking at the same time  after all fighting is not a bad trade if you only stick to it long enough five thousand florins i never thought to earn so much  you havent got it yet interrupted foy and now what are you going to do with that paper  martin reflected coat he said no a man takes off his coat if it is hot and it might be left behind bootsno that would wear it out especially if they got wet jerseysewn next the skin no same reason ah i have it and drawing out the great sword silence he took the point of his knife and began to turn a little silver screw in the hilt one of many with which the handle of walrus ivory was fastened to its steel core the screw came out and he touched a spring whereon one quarter of the ivory casing fell away revealing a considerable hollow in the hilt for although martin grasped it with one hand the sword was made to be held by two  what is that hole for asked foy  the executioners drug replied martin which makes a man happy while he does his business with him that is if he can pay the fee he offered his dose to me i remember before here martin stopped and having rolled up the parchment hid it in the hollow  you might lose your sword suggested foy  yes master when i lose my life and exchange the hope of florins for a golden crown replied martin with a grin till then i do not intend to part with silence  meanwhile hendrik brant had been whispering to the quiet man at the table who now rose and said  fosterbrother do not trouble about me i take my chance and i do not wish to survive you my wife is burnt one of my girls out there is married to a man who knows how to protect them both also the dowries you gave them are far away and safe do not trouble about me who have but one desireto snatch the great treasure from the maw of the spaniard that in a day to come it may bring doom upon the spaniard then he relapsed into a silence which spread over the whole company  it is time to be stirring said brant presently hans you will lead the way i must bide here a while before i go abroad and show myself  the pilot nodded ready he asked addressing foy and martin then he went to the door and whistled whereon red bow with her pretended servant entered the vault he spoke a word or two to them and kissed them each upon the brow next he went to hendrik brant and throwing his arms about him embraced him with far more passion than he had shown towards his own daughters  farewell fosterbrother he said till we meet again here or hereafterit matters little which have no fear we will get the stuff through to england if may be or send it to hell with some spaniards to seek it there now comrades come on and stick close to me and if any try to stop us cut them down when we reach the boat do you take the oars and row while i steer her the girls come with us to the canal arminarm with the two of you if anything happens to me either of them can steer you to the skiff called swallow but if naught happens we will put them ashore at the next wharf come and he led the way from the cellar  at the threshold foy turned to look at hendrik brant he was standing by the table the light shining full upon his pale face and grizzled head about which it seemed to cast a halo indeed at that moment wrapped in his long dark cloak his lips moving in prayer and his arms uplifted to bless them as they went he might well have been not a man but some vision of a saint come back to earth the door closed and foy never saw him again for ere long the inquisition seized him and a while afterwards he died beneath their cruel hands one of the charges against him was that more than twenty years before he had been seen reading the bible at leyden by black meg who appeared and gave the evidence but they did not discover where his treasure was hidden away to win an easier death indeed he made them a long confession that took them a still longer journey but of the truth of the matter he knew nothing and therefore could tell them nothing  now this scene so strange and pathetic ended at last the five of them were in the darkness of the street here once more foy and red bow clung to each other and once more the arm of martin was about the neck of her who seemed to be the servingmaid while ahead as though he were paid to show the way went the pilot soon footsteps were heard for folk were after them they turned once they turned twice they reached the bank of a canal and hans followed by red bow and her sister descended some steps and climbed into a boat which lay there ready next came martin and last of all foy as he set foot upon the first step a figure shot out of the gloom towards him a knife gleamed in the air and a blow took him between the shoulders that sent him stumbling headlong for he was balanced upon the edge of the step  but martin had heard and seen he swung round and struck out with the sword silence the assassin was far from him still the tip of the long steel reached the outstretched murderous hand and from it fell a broken knife while he who held it sped on with a screech of pain martin darted back and seized the knife then he leapt into the boat and pushed off at the bottom of it lay foy who had fallen straight into the arms of red bow dragging her down with him  are you hurt master asked martin  not a bit replied foy but i am afraid the lady is she went undermost  mothers gifts are good gifts muttered martin as he pulled him and the girl whose breath had been knocked out of her up to a seat you ought to have an eightinch hole through you but that knife broke upon the shirt look here and he threw the handle of the dagger on to his knees and snatched at the sculls  foy examined it in the faint light and there still hooked above the guard was a single severed finger a long and skinny finger to which the point of the sword silence had played surgeon and on it a gold ring this may be useful thought foy as he slipped handle and finger into the pocket of his cloak  then they all took oars and rowed till presently they drew near a wharf  now daughters make ready said hans and the girls stood up as they touched the wharf red bow bent down and kissed foy  the rest were in play this is in earnest she said and for luck goodnight companion and think of me sometimes  goodnight companion answered foy returning the kiss then she leapt ashore they never met again  you know what to do girls said hans do it and in three days you should be safe in england where perhaps i may meet you though do not count on that whatever happens keep honest and remember me till we come together again here or hereafter but most of all remember your mother and your benefactor hendrik brant farewell  farewell father they answered with a sob and the boat drifted off down the dark canal leaving the two of them alone upon the wharf afterwards foy discovered that it was the short sister who walked with martin that was married gallant little red bow married also but later her husband was a cloth merchant in london and her grandson became lord mayor of that city  and now having played their part in it these two brave girls are out of the story    chapter xiv  sword silence receives the secret  for half an hour or more they glided down the canal unmolested and in silence now it ran into a broader waterway along which they slid towards the sea keeping as much as possible under the shadow of one bank for although the night was moonless a faint grey light lay upon the surface of the stream at length foy became aware that they were bumping against the sides of a long line of barges and river boats laden with timber and other goods to one of theseit was the fourththe pilot hans made fast tying their rowboat to her stern then he climbed to the deck whispering to them to follow  as they scrambled on board two grey figures arose and foy saw the flash of steel then hans whistled like a plover and dropping their swords they came to him and fell into talk presently hans left them and returning to foy and martin said  listen we must lie here a while for the wind is against us and it would be too dangerous for us to try to row or pole so big a boat down to the sea and across the bar in the darkness for most likely we should set her fast upon a shoal before dawn it will turn and if i read the sky aright blow hard off land  what have the bargemen to say asked foy  only that for these four days they have been lying here forbidden to move and that their craft are to be searched tomorrow by a party of soldiers and the cargo taken out of them piecemeal  so said foy well i hope that by then what they seek will be far away now show us this ship  then hans took them down the hatchway for the little vessel was decked being in shape and size not unlike a modern norfolk herring boat though somewhat more slightly built then having lit a lantern he showed them the cargo on the top were bags of salt dragging one or two of these aside hans uncovered the heads of five barrels each of them marked with the initial b in white paint  that is what men will die for before tomorrow night he said  the treasure asked foy  he nodded these five none of the others then still lower down he pointed out other barrels eight of them filled with the best gunpowder and showed them too where the slow matches ran to the little cabin the cooks galley the tiller and the prow by means of any one of which it could be fired after this and such inspection of the ropes and sails as the light would allow they sat in the cabin waiting till the wind should change while the two watching men unmoored the vessel and made her sails ready for hoisting an hour passed and still the breeze blew from the sea but in uncertain chopping gusts then it fell altogether  pray god it comes soon said martin for the owner of that finger in your pocket will have laid the hounds on to our slot long ago and look the east grows red  the silent hardfaced hans leant forward and stared up the darkling water his hand behind his ear  i hear them he said presently  who asked foy  the spaniards and the windboth he answered come up with the mainsail and pole her out to midstream  so the three of them took hold of the tackle and ran aft with it while the rings and booms creaked and rattled as the great canvas climbed the mast presently it was set and after it the jib then assisted by the two watchmen thrusting from another of the boats they pushed the swallow from her place in the line out into midstream but all this made noise and took time and now men appeared upon the bank calling to know who dared to move the boats without leave as no one gave them any answer they fired a shot and presently a beacon began to burn upon a neighbouring mound  bad business said hans shrugging his shoulders they are warning the government ship at the harbour mouth duck masters duck here comes the wind and he sprang to the tiller as the boom swung over and the little vessel began to gather way  yes said martin and here with it come the spaniards  foy looked through the grey mist that was growing lighter every moment for the dawn was breaking he caught sight of a long boat with her canvas spread which was sweeping round the bend of the stream towards them and not much more than a quarter of a mile away  they had had to pole down stream in the dark and that is why they have been so long in coming said hans over his shoulder  well they are here now at any rate answered foy and plenty of them he added as a shout from a score of throats told them that they were discovered  but now the swallow had begun to fly making the water hiss upon either side of her bows  how far is it to the sea asked foy  about three miles hans called back from the tiller with this wind we should be there in fifteen minutes master he added presently bid your man light the fire in the galley  what for asked foy to cook breakfast  the pilot shrugged his shoulders and muttered yes if we live to eat it but foy saw that he was glancing at the slowmatch by his side and understood  ten minutes passed and they had swept round the last bend and were in the stretch of open water which ran down to the sea by now the light was strong and in it they saw that the signal fire had not been lit in vain at the mouth of the cutting just where the bar began the channel was narrowed in with earth to a width of not more than fifty paces and on one bank of it stood a foot armed with culverins out of the little harbour of this fort a large open boat was being poled and in it a dozen or fifteen soldiers were hastily arming themselves  what now cried martin they are going to stop the mouth of the channel  the hardfeatured hans set his teeth and made no answer only he looked backward at his pursuers and onward at those who barred the way presently he called aloud  under hatches both of you they are going to fire from the fort and he flung himself upon his back steering with his uplifted arms  foy and martin tumbled down the hatchway for they could do no good on deck only foy kept one eye above its level  look out he said and ducked  as he spoke there was a puff of white smoke from the fort followed by the scream of a shot which passed ahead of them then came another puff of smoke and a hole appeared in their brown sail after this the fort did not fire again for the gunners found no time to load their pieces only some soldiers who were armed with arquebuses began to shoot as the boat swept past within a few yards of them heedless of their bullets hans the pilot rose to his feet again for such work as was before him could not be done by a man lying on his back by now the large open boat from the fort was within two hundred yards of them and driven by the gathering pale the swallow rushed towards it with the speed of a dart foy and martin crawled from the hatchway and lay down near the steersman under the shelter of the little bulwarks watching the enemys boat which was in midstream just where the channel was narrowest and on the hither side of the broken water of the bar  see said foy they are throwing out anchors fore and aft is there room to go past them  no answered hans the water is too shallow under the bank and they know it bring me a burning brand  foy crept forward and returned with the fire  now light the slowmatch master  foy opened his blue eyes and a cold shiver went down his back then he set his teeth and obeyed martin looked at hans muttering  good for a young one  hans nodded and said have no fear till that match burns to the level of the deck we are safe now mates hold fast i cant go past that boat so i am going through her we may sink on the other side though i am sure that the fire will reach the powder first in that case you can swim for it if you like but i shall go with the swallow  i will think about it when the time comes oh that cursed astrologer growled martin looking back at the pursuing ship which was not more than seven or eight hundred yards away  meanwhile the officer in command of the boat who was armed with a musket was shouting to them to pull down their sail and surrender indeed not until they were within fifty yards of him did he seem to understand their desperate purpose then some one in the boat called out the devils are going to sink us and there was a rush to bow and stern to get up the anchors only the officer stood firm screaming at them like a madman it was too late a strong gust of wind caught the swallow causing her to heel over and sweep down on the boat like a swooping falcon  hans stood and shifted the tiller ever so little calculating all things with his eye foy watched the boat towards which they sprang like a thing alive and martin lying at his side watched the burning match  suddenly the spanish officer when their prow was not more than twenty paces from him ceased to shout and lifting his piece fired martin looking upwards with his left eye thought that he saw hans flinch but the pilot made no sound only he did something to the tiller putting all his strength on to it and it seemed to the pair of them as though the swallow was for an instant checked in her flightcertainly her prow appeared to lift itself from the water suddenly there was a sound of something snappinga sound that could be heard even through the yell of terror from the soldiers in the boat it was the bowsprit which had gone leaving the jib flying loose like a great pennon  then came the crash foy shut his eyes for a moment hanging on with both hands till the scraping and the trembling were done with now he opened again and the first thing he saw was the body of the spanish officer hanging from the jagged stump of the bowsprit he looked behind the boat had vanished but in the water were to be seen the heads of three or four men swimming as for themselves they seemed to be clear and unhurt except for the loss of their bowsprit indeed the little vessel was riding over the seas on the bar like any swan hans glanced at the slowmatch which was smouldering away perilously near to the deck whereon martin stamped upon it saying  if we sink now it will be in deep water so there is no need to fly up before we go down  go and see if she leaks said hans  they went and searched the forehold but could not find that the swallow had taken any harm worth noting indeed her massive oaken prow with the weight of the galedriven ship behind it had crashed through the frail sides of the open spanish boat like a knife through an egg  that was good steering said foy to hans when they returned and nothing seems to be amiss  hans nodded i hit him neatly he muttered look hes gone as he spoke the swallow gave a sharp pitch and the corpse of the spaniard fell with a heavy splash into the sea  i am glad it has sunk said foy and now lets have some breakfast for i am starving shall i bring you some friend hans  no master i want to sleep  something in the tone of the mans voice caused foy to scrutinise his face his lips were turning blue he glanced at his hands although they still grasped the tiller tightly these also were turning blue as though with cold moreover blood was dropping on the deck  you are hit he said martin martin hans is hit  yes replied the man he hit me and i hit him and perhaps presently we shall be talking it over together no dont trouble it is through the body and mortal well i expected nothing less so i cant complain now listen while my strength holds can you lay a course for harwich in england  martin and foy shook their heads like most hollanders they were good sailormen but they only knew their own coasts  then you had best not try it said hans for there is a gale brewing and you will be driven on the goodwin sands or somewhere down that shore and drowned and the treasure lost run up to the haarlem mere comrades you can hug the land with this small boat while that big devil after you and he nodded towards the pursuing vessel which by now was crossing the bar must stand further out beyond the shoals then slip up through the small gutthe ruined farmstead marks itand so into the mere you know mother martha the mad woman who is nicknamed the mare she will be watching at the mouth of it she always is moreover i caused her to be warned that we might pass her way and if you hoist the white flag with a red crossit lies in the lockeror after nightfall hang out four lamps upon your starboard side she will come aboard to pilot you for she knows this boat well to her also you can tell your business without fear for she will help you and be as secret as the dead then bury the treasure or sink it or blow it up or do what you can but in the name of god to whom i go i charge you do not let it fall into the hands of ramiro and his spanish rats who are at your heels  as hans spoke he sank down upon the deck foy ran to support him but he pushed him aside with a feeble hand let me be he whispered i wish to pray i have set you a course follow it to the end  then martin took the tiller while foy watched hans in ten minutes he was dead  now they were running northwards with a fierce wind abeam of them and the larger spanish ship behind but standing further out to sea to avoid the banks half an hour later the wind which was gathering to a gale shifted several points to the north so that they must beat up against it under reefed canvas still they held on without accident foy attending to the sail and martin steering the swallow was a good sea boat and if their progress was slow so was that of their pursuer which dogged them continually sometimes a mile away and sometimes less at length towards evening they caught sight of a ruined house that marked the channel of the little gut one of the outlets of the haarlem mere  the sea runs high upon the bar and it is ebb tide said foy  even so we must try it master answered martin perhaps she will scrape through and he put the swallow about and ran for the mouth of the gut  here the waves were mountainous and much water came aboard moreover three times they bumped upon the bar till at length to their joy they found themselves in the calm stream of the gut and by shifting the sail were able to draw it up though very slowly  at least we have got a start of them said foy for they can never get across until the tide rises  we shall need it all answered martin so now hoist the white flag and let us eat while we may  while they ate the sun sank and the wind blew so that scarcely could they make a knot an hour shift the sail as they might then as there was no sign of mother martha or any other pilot they hung out the four lamps upon the starboard side and with a flapping sail drifted on gradually till at length they reached the mouth of the great mere an infinite waste of watersdeep in some places shallow in others and spotted everywhere with islets now the wind turned against them altogether and the darkness closing in they were forced to drop anchor fearing lest otherwise they should go ashore one comfort they had however as yet nothing could be seen of their pursuers  then for the first time their spirits failed them a little and they stood together near the stern wondering what they should do it was while they rested thus that suddenly a figure appeared before them as though it had risen from the deck of the ship no sound of oars or footsteps had reached their ears yet there outlined against the dim sky was the figure  i think that friend hans has come to life again said martin with a slight quaver in his voice for martin was terribly afraid of ghosts  and i think that a spaniard has found us said foy drawing his knife  then a hoarse voice spoke saying who are you that signal for a pilot on my waters  the question iswho are you answered foy and be so good as to tell us quickly  i am the pilot said the voice and this boat by the rig of her and her signals should be the swallow of the hague but why must i crawl aboard of her across the corpse of a dead man  come into the cabin pilot and we will tell you said foy  very well mynheer so foy led the way to the cabin but martin stopped behind a while  we have found our guide so what is the use of the lamps he said to himself as he extinguished them all except one which he brought with him into the cabin foy was waiting for him by the door and they entered the place together at the end of it the light of the lamp showed them a strange figure clad in skins so shapeless and sacklike that it was impossible to say whether the form beneath were male or female the figure was bareheaded and about the brow locks of grizzled hair hung in tufts the face in which were set a pair of wandering grey eyes was deep cut tanned brown by exposure scarred and very ugly with withered lips and projecting teeth  good even to you dirk van goorls son and to you red martin i am mother martha she whom the spaniards call the mare and the lakewitch  little need to tell us that mother said foy although it is true that many years have gone by since i set eyes on you  martha smiled grimly as she answered yes many years well what have you fat leyden burghers to do with a poor old nighthag except of course in times of trouble not that i blame you for it is not well that you or your parents either should be known to traffic with such as i now what is your business with me for the signals show that you have business and why does the corpse of hendrik brants fosterbrother lie there in the stern  because to be plain we have hendrik brants treasure on board mother and for the rest look yonder and he pointed to what his eye had just caught sight of two or three miles away a faint light too low and too red for a star that could only come from a lantern hung at the masthead of a ship  martha nodded spaniards after you poling through the gut against the wind come on there is no time to lose bring your boat round and we will tow the swallow to where she will lie safe tonight  five minutes later they were all three of them rowing the oar boat in which they had escaped from the hague towards some unknown point in the darkness slowly dragging after them the little ship swallow as they went foy told martha all the story of their mission and escape  i have heard of this treasure before she said all the netherlands has heard of brants hoard also dead hans there let me know that perhaps it might come this way for in such matters he thought that i could be trusted and she smiled grimly and now what would you do  fulfil our orders said foy hide it if we can if not destroy it  better the first than the last interrupted martin hide the treasure say i and destroy the spaniards if mother martha here can think of a plan  we might sink the ship suggested foy  and leave her mast for a beacon added martin sarcastically  or put the stuff into the boat and sink that  and never find it again in this great sea objected martin  all this while martha steered the boat as calmly as though it were daylight they had left the open water and were passing slowly in and out among islets yet she never seemed to be doubtful or to hesitate at length they felt the swallow behind them take the mud gently whereon martha led the way aboard of her and threw out the anchor saying that here was her berth for the night  now she said bring up this gold and lay it in the boat for if you would save it there is much to do before dawn  so foy and martin went down while martha hanging over the hatchway held the lighted lamp above them since they dared not take it near the powder moving the bags of salt soon they came to the five barrels of treasure marked b and strong though they were it was no easy task for the pair of them by the help of a pulley to sling them over the ships side into the boat at last it was done and the place of the barrels having been filled with salt bags they took two iron spades which were provided for such a task as this and started martha steering as before for an hour or more they rowed in and out among endless islands at the dim shores of which martha stared as they passed till at length she motioned to them to ship their oars and they touched ground  leaping from the boat she made it fast and vanished among the reeds to reconnoitre presently she returned again saying that this was the place then began the heavy labour of rolling the casks of treasure for thirty yards or more along otter paths that pierced the dense growth of reeds  now having first carefully cut out reed sods in a place chosen by martha foy and martin set to their task of digging a great hole by the light of the stars hard indeed they toiled at it yet had it not been for the softness of the marshy soil they could not have got done while the night lasted for the grave that would contain those barrels must be both wide and deep after three feet of earth had been removed they came to the level of the lake and for the rest of the time worked in water throwing up shovelfuls of mud still at last it was done and the five barrels standing side by side in the water were covered up with soil and roughly planted over with the reed turf  let us be going said martha there is no time to lose so they straightened their backs and wiped the sweat from their brows  there is earth lying about which may tell its story said martin  yes she replied if any see it within the next ten days after which in this damp place the mosses will have hidden it  well we have done our best said foy as he washed his mudstained boots in the water and now the stuff must take its chance  then once more they entered the boat and rowed away somewhat wearily martha steering them  on they went and on till foy tired out nearly fell asleep at his oar suddenly martha tapped him on the shoulder he looked up and there not two hundred yards away its tapering mast showing dimly against the sky was the vessel that had pursued them from the hague a single lantern burning on its stern martha looked and grunted then she leant forward and whispered to them imperiously  it is madness gasped martin  do as i bid you she hissed and they let the boat drift with the wind till it came to a little island within thirty yards of the anchored vessel an island with a willow tree growing upon its shore hold to the twigs of the tree she muttered and wait till i come again not knowing what else to do they obeyed  then martha rose and they saw that she had slipped off her garment of skins and stood before them a gaunt white figure armed with a gleaming knife next she put the knife to her mouth and nipping it between her teeth slid into the water silently as a diving bird a minute passed not more and they saw that something was climbing up the cable of the ship  what is she going to do whispered foy  god in heaven knows answered martin but if she does not come back goodbye to heer brants treasure for she alone can find it again  they waited holding their breaths till presently a curious choking sound floated to them and the lantern on the ship vanished two minutes later a hand with a knife in it appeared over the gunwale of the boat followed by a grey head martin put out his great arm and lifted and lo the white form slid down between them like a big salmon turned out of a net  put about and row it gasped and they obeyed while the mare clothed herself again in her skin garment  what have you done asked foy  something she replied with a fierce chuckle i have stabbed the watchmanhe thought i was a ghost and was too frightened to call out i have cut the cable and i think that i have fired the ship ah look but rowrow round the corner of the island  they gave way and as they turned the bank of reeds glanced behind them to see a tall tongue of fire shooting up the cordage of the ship and to hear a babel of frightened and angry voices  ten minutes later they were on board the swallow and from her deck watching the fierce flare of the burning spanish vessel nearly a mile away here they ate and drank for they needed food badly  what shall we do now asked foy when they had finished  nothing at present answered martha but give me pen and paper  they found them and having shrouded the little window of the cabin she sat at the table and very slowly but with much skill drew a plan or rather a picture of this portion of the haarlem mere in that plan were marked many islands according to their natural shapes twenty of them perhaps and upon one of these she set a cross  take it and hide it said martha when it was finished so that if i die you may know where to dig for brants gold with this in your hand you cannot fail to find it for i draw well remember that it lies thirty paces due south of the only spot where it is easy to land upon that island  what shall i do with this picture which is worth so much said foy helplessly for in truth i fear to keep the thing  give it to me master said martin the secret of the treasure may as well lie with the legacy that is charged on it then once more he unscrewed the handle of the sword silence and having folded up the paper and wrapped it round with a piece of linen he thrust it away into the hollow hilt  now that sword is worth more than some people might think martin said as he restored it to the scabbard but i hope that those who come to seek its secret may have to travel up its blade well when shall we be moving  listen said martha would you two men dare a great deed upon those spaniards their ship is burnt but there are a score or over of them and they have two large boats now at the dawn they will see the mast of this vessel and attack it in the boats thinking to find the treasure well if as they win aboard we can manage to fire the matches  there may be fewer spaniards left to plague us suggested foy  and believing it to be blown up no one will trouble about that money further added martin oh the plan is good but dangerous come let us talk it over    the dawn broke in a flood of yellow light on the surface of the haarlem mere presently from the direction of the spanish vessel which was still burning sullenly came a sound of beating oars now the three watchers in the swallow saw two boatloads of armed men one of them with a small sail set swooping down towards them when they were within a hundred yards martha muttered it is time and foy ran hither and thither with a candle firing the slowmatches also to make sure he cast the candle among a few handfuls of oilsoaked shreds of canvas that lay ready at the bottom of the hatchway then with the others without the spaniards being able to see them he slipped over the side of the little vessel into the shallow water that was clothed with tall reeds and waded through it to the island  once on firm land they ran a hundred yards or so till they reached a clump of swamp willows and took shelter behind them indeed foy did more for he climbed the trunk of one of the willows high enough to see over the reeds to the ship swallow and the lake beyond by this time the spaniards were alongside the swallow for he could hear their captain hailing him who leant over the taffrail and commanding all on board to surrender under pain of being put to death but from the man in the stern came no answer which was scarcely strange seeing that it was the dead pilot hans to whom they talked in the misty dawn whose body martin had lashed thus to deceive them so they fired at the pilot who took no notice and then began to clamber on board the ship presently all the men were out of the first boatthat with the sail set on itexcept two the steersman and the captain whom from his dress and demeanour foy took to be the oneeyed spaniard ramiro although of this he was too far off to make sure it was certain however that this man did not mean to board the swallow for of a sudden he put his boat about and the wind catching the sail soon drew him clear of her  that fellow is cunning said foy to martin and martha below and i was a fool to light the tarred canvas for he has seen the smoke drawing up the hatchway  and having had enough fire for one night thinks that he will leave his mates to quench it added martin  the second boat is coming alongside went on foy and surely the mine should spring  scarcely time yet answered martin the matches were set for six minutes  then followed a silence in which the three of them watched and listened with beating hearts in it they heard a voice call out that the steersman was dead and the answering voice of the officer in the boat whom foy had been right in supposing to be ramiro warning them to beware of treachery now suddenly arose a shout of a mine a mine for they had found one of the lighted fuses  they are running for their boat said foy and the captain is sailing farther off heavens how they scream  as the words passed his lips a tongue of flame shot to the very skies the island seemed to rock a fierce rush of air struck foy and shook him from the tree then came a dreadful thunderous sound and lo the sky was darkened with fragments of wreck limbs of men a grey cloud of salt and torn shreds of sail and cargo which fell here there and everywhere about and beyond them  in five seconds it was over and the three of them shaken but unhurt were clinging to each other on the ground then as the dark pall of smoke drifted southward foy scrambled up his tree again but now there was little to be seen for the swallow had vanished utterly and for many yards round where she lay the wreckagestrewn water was black as ink with the stirred mud the spaniards had gone also nothing of them was left save the two men and the boat which rode unhurt at a distance foy stared at them the steersman was seated and wringing his hands while the captain on whose armour the rays of the rising sun now shone brightly held to the mast like one stunned and gazed at the place where a minute before had been a ship and a troop of living men presently he seemed to recover himself for he issued an order whereon the boats head went about and she began to glide away  now we had best try to catch him said martha who by standing up could see this also  nay let him be answered foy we have sent enough men to their account and he shuddered  as you will master grumbled martin but i tell you it is not wise that man is too clever to be allowed to live else he would have accompanied the others on board and perished with them  oh i am sick replied foy the wind from that powder has shaken me settle it as you will with mother martha and leave me in peace  so martin turned to speak with martha but she was not there chuckling to herself in the madness of her hate and the glory of this great revenge she had slipped away knife in hand to discover whether perchance any of the powderblasted spaniards still lived fortunately for them they did not the shock had killed them all even those who at the first alarm had thrown themselves into the water at length martin found her clapping her hands and crooning above a dead body so shattered that no one could tell to what manner of man it had belonged and led her away  but although she was keen enough for the chase by now it was too late for travelling before the strong wind ramiro and his boat had vanished    chapter xv  senor ramiro  if foy van goorl by some magic could have seen what was passing in the mind of that fugitive in the boat as he sailed swiftly away from the scene of death and ruin bitterly indeed would he have cursed his folly and inexperience which led him to disregard the advice of red martin  let us look at this man as he goes gnawing his hand in rage and disappointment there is something familiar about his face and bearing still gallant enough in a fashion yet the most observant would find it difficult to recognise in the senor ramiro the handsome and courtly count juan de montalvo of over twenty years before a long spell of the galleys changes the hardiest man and by ill luck montalvo or ramiro to call him by his new name had been forced to serve nearly his full time he would have escaped earlier indeed had he not been foolish enough to join in a mutiny which was discovered and suppressed it was in the course of this savage struggle for freedom that he lost his eye knocked out with a belaying pin by an officer whom he had just stabbed the innocent officer died and the rascal ramiro died but without his good looks  to a person of gentle birth however great a scoundrel he might be the galleys which represented penal servitude in the sixteenth century were a very rough school indeed for the most part the man who went into them blameless became bad and the man who went into them bad became worse for as the proverb says those who have dwelt in hell always smell of brimstone who can imagine the awfulness of itthe chains the arduous and continual labour the whip of the quartermasters the company of thieves and outcast ruffians all dreadful in its squalid sameness  well his strength and constitution coupled with a sort of grim philosophy brought him through and at length ramiro found himself a free man middleaged indeed but intelligent and still strong the world once more before him yet what a world his wife believing him dead or perhaps wishing to believe it had remarried and gone with her husband to new spain taking his children with her and his friends such of them as lived turned their backs upon him but although he had been an unlucky man for with him wickedness had not prospered he still had resource and courage  the count montalvo was a penniless outlaw a byword and a scorn and so the count montalvodied and was buried publicly in the church of his native village strangely enough however about the same time the senor ramiro appeared in another part of spain where with success he practised as a notary and man of affairs some years went by thus till at length having realised a considerable sum of money by the help of an ingenious fraud of which the details are superfluous an inspiration took him and he sailed for the netherlands  in those dreadful days in order to further the ends of religious persecution and of legalised theft informers were rewarded with a portion of the goods of heretics ramiros ideaa great one in its waywas to organise this informing business and by interesting a number of confederates who practically were shareholders in the venture to sweep into his net more fortunes or shares of fortunes than a single individual however industrious could hope to secure as he had expected soon he found plenty of worthy companions and the company was floated for a while with the help of local agencies and spies such as black meg and the butcher with whom forgetting past injuries he had secretly renewed his acquaintance it did very well the dividends being large and regular in such times handsome sums were realised without risk out of the properties of unfortunates who were brought to the stake and still more was secured by a splendid system of blackmail extracted from those who wished to avoid execution and who when they had been sucked dry could either be burnt or let go as might prove most convenient  also there were other methods of making moneyby an intelligent method of robbery by contracts to collect fines and taxes and so forth thus things went well and at length after many years of suffering and poverty the senor ramiro that experienced man of affairs began to grow rich until indeed driven forward by a natural but unwise ambition a fault inherent to daring minds he entered upon a dangerous path  the wealth of hendrik brant the goldsmith was a matter of common report and glorious would be the fortune of him who could secure its reversion this ramiro wished to win indeed there was no ostensible reason why he should not do so since brant was undoubtedly a heretic and therefore legitimate game for any honourable servant of the church and king yet there were lions in the path two large and formidable lions or rather a lion and the ghost of a lion for one was material and the other spiritual the material lion was that the government or in other words his august kingship philip desired the goldsmiths thousands for himself and was therefore likely to be irritated by an interloper the spiritual lion was that brant was connected with lysbeth van goorl once known as lysbeth de montalvo a lady who had brought her reputed husband no luck often and often during dreary hours of reflection beneath tropic suns for which the profession of galleyslave gave great leisure the senor ramiro remembered that very energetic curse which his new affianced wife had bestowed upon him a curse in which she prayed that through her he might live in heavy labour that through her and hers he might be haunted by fears and misfortunes and at the last die in misery looking back upon the past it would certainly seem that there had been virtue in this curse for already through lysbeth and his dealings with her he had suffered the last degradation and the toil which could not be called light of nearly fourteen years of daily occupation in the galleys  well he was clear of them and thenceforward the curse having exhausted itself for the time being he had prosperedat any rate to a moderate extent but if once more he began to interfere with lysbeth van goorl and her relatives might it not reassert its power that was one question was it worth while to take his risk on the chance of securing brants fortune that was another brant it was true was only a cousin of lysbeths husband but when once you meddled with a member of the family it was impossible to know how soon other members would become mixed up in the affair  the end may be guessed the treasure was at hand and enormous whereas the wrath of a heavenly or an earthly king was problematical and far away so greed outstripping caution and superstitious fear won the race and ramiro threw himself into the adventure with a resource and energy which in their way were splendid  now as always he was a man who hated violence for its own sake it was no wish of his that the worthy heer brant should be unnecessarily burnt or tortured therefore through his intermediaries as brant had narrated in his letter he approached him with a proposal which under the circumstances was liberal enoughthat brant should hand over twothirds of his fortune to him and his confederates on condition that he was assisted to escape with the remaining third to his disgust however this obstinate dutchman refused to buy his safety at the price of a single stiver indeed he answered with rude energy that now as always he was in the hands of god and if it pleased god that his life should be sacrificed and his great wealth divided amongst thieves well it must be so but he at least would be no party to the arrangement  the details of the plots and counterplots the attack of the ramiro company the defences of brant the internecine struggles between the members of the company and the agents of the government if set out at length would fill a considerable book of these we already know something and the rest may be divined  in the course of the affair ramiro had made but one mistake and that sprang from what he was wont to consider the weakness of his nature needless to say it was that he had winked at the escape of brants daughter elsa it may have been superstition that prompted him or it may have been pity or perhaps it was a certain oath of mercy which he had taken in an hour of need at any rate he was content that the girl should not share the doom which overshadowed her father he did not think it at all likely that she would take with her any documents of importance and the treasure of course she could not take still to provide against accidents he arranged for her to be searched upon the road  as we know this search was a failure and when on the morrow black meg arrived to make report and to warn him that dirk van goorls son and his great servingman whose strength was known throughout the netherlands were on their road to the hague he was sure that after all the girl had carried with her some paper or message  by this time the whereabouts of brants treasure had been practically solved it was believed to lie in the string of vessels although it was not known that one of these was laden with powder as well as gold the plan of the government agents was to search the vessels as they passed out to sea and seize the treasure as contraband which would save much legal trouble since under the law or the edicts wealth might not be shipped abroad by heretics the plan of ramiro and his friends was to facilitate the escape of the treasure to the open sea where they proposed to swoop down upon it and convey it to more peaceful shores  when foy and his party started down the canal in the boat ramiro knew that his opportunity had come and at once unmoored the big ship and followed the attempted stabbing of foy was not done by his orders as he wished the party to go unmolested and to be kept in sight that was a piece of private malice on the part of black meg for it was she who was dressed as a man on various occasions in leyden foy had made remarks upon megs character which she resented and about her personal appearance which she resented much more and this was an attempt to pay off old scores that in the issue cost her a finger a good knife and a gold ring which had associations connected with her youth  at first everything had gone well by one of the most daring and masterly manoeuvres that ramiro had ever seen in his long and varied experience upon the seas the little swallow with her crew of three men had run the gauntlet of the fort which was warned and waiting for her had sunk and sailed through the big government boat and her crew of lubberly soldiers many of whom he was glad to reflect were drowned had crushed the officer against whom he had a personal grudge like an eggshell and won through to the open sea there he thought he was sure of her for he took it for granted that she would run for the norfolk coast and knew that in the gale of wind which was blowing his larger and wellmanned vessel could pull her down but then the illluckthat ancient illluck which always dogged him when he began to interfere with the affairs of lysbeth and her relativesdeclared itself  instead of attempting to cross the north sea the little swallow hugged the coast where for various nautical reasons connected with the wind the water and the build of their respective ships she had the legs of him next he lost her in the gut and after that we know what happened there was no disguising it it was a most dreadful fiasco to have ones vessel boarded the expensive vessel in which so large a proportion of the gains of his honourable company had been invested not only boarded but fired and the watchman stabbed by a single naked devil of unknown sex or character was bad enough and then the end of it  to have found the goldladen ship to have been gulled into attacking her andandoh he could scarcely bear to think of it there was but one consolation although too late to save the others even through the mist he had seen that wisp of smoke rising from the hold yes he the experienced had smelt a rat and warned by some halfdivine intuition had kept his distance with the result that he was still alive  but the others those gallant comrades in adventure where were they well to be frank he did not greatly care there was another question of more moment where was the treasure now that his brain had cleared after the shock and turmoil it was evident to him that foy van goorl red martin and the white devil who had boarded his ship would not have destroyed so much wealth if they could help it and still less would they have destroyed themselves therefore to pursue the matter to a logical conclusion it seemed probable that they had spent the night in sinking or burying the money and preparing the pretty trap into which he had walked so the secret was in their hands and as they were still alive very possibly means could be found to induce them to reveal its hidingplace there was still hope indeed now that he came to weigh things they were not so bad  to begin with almost all the shareholders in the affair had perished by the stern decree of providence and he was the natural heir of their interests in other words the treasure if it was recovered was henceforth his property further when they came to hear the story the government would set down brants fortune as hopelessly lost so that the galling competition from which he had suffered so much was at an end  under these circumstances what was to be done very soon as he sailed away over the lake in the sweet air of the morning the senor ramiro found an answer to the question  the treasure had left the hague he must leave the hague the secret of its disposal was at leyden henceforth he must live at leyden why not he knew leyden well it was a pleasant place but of course he might be recognised there though after so long this was scarcely probable for was not the count de montalvo notoriously dead and buried time and accident had changed him moreover he could bring art to the assistance of nature in leyden too he had confederatesblack meg to wit for one also he had funds for was he not the treasurer of the company that this very morning had achieved so remarkable and unsoughtfor an ascension  there was only one thing against the scheme in leyden lived lysbeth van goorl and her husband and with them a certain young man whose parentage he could guess more her son foy knew the hidingplace of brants hoard and from him or his servant martin that secret must be won so once again he was destined to match himself against lysbeththe wronged the dreaded the victorious lysbeth whose voice of denunciation still rang in his ear whose eyes of fire still scorched his soul the woman whom he feared above everything on earth he fought her once for money and although he won the money it had done him little good for in the end she worsted him now if he went to leyden he must fight her again for money and what would be the issue of that war was it worth while to take the risk would not history repeat itself if he hurt her would she not crush him but the treasure that mighty treasure which could give him so much and above all could restore to him the rank and station he had forfeited and which he coveted more than anything in life for low as he had fallen montalvo could not forget that he had been born a gentleman  he would take his chance he would go to leyden had he weighed the matter in the gloom of night or even in a dull and stormy hour perhapsnay probablyhe would have decided otherwise but this morning the sun shone brightly the wind made a merry music in the reeds on the rippling surface of the lake the marshbirds sang and from the shore came a cheerful lowing of kine in such surroundings his fears and superstitions vanished he was master of himself and he knew that all depended upon himself the rest was dream and nonsense behind him lay the buried gold before him rose the towers of leyden where he could find its key a god that haunting legend of a god of vengeance in which priests and others affected to believe now that he came to think of it what rubbish was here for as any agent of the inquisition knew well the vengeance always fell upon those who trusted in this same god a hundred torture dens a thousand smoking fires bore witness to the fact and if there was a god why recognising his personal merits only this morning he had selected him out of many to live on and be the inheritor of the wealth of hendrik brant yes he would go to leyden and fight the battle out    at the entry of the gut the senor ramiro landed from his boat at first he had thought of killing his companion so that he might remain the sole survivor of the catastrophe but on reflection he abandoned this idea as the man was a faithful creature of his own who might be useful so he bade him return to the hague to tell the story of the destruction of the ship swallow with the treasure her attackers and her crew whoever they might have been he was to add moreover that so far as he knew the captain ramiro had perished also as he the steersman was left alone in charge of the boat when the vessel blew up then he was to come to leyden bringing with him certain goods and papers belonging to him ramiro  this plan seemed to have advantages no one would continue to hunt for the treasure no one except himself and perhaps black meg would know that foy van goorl and martin had been on board the swallow and escaped indeed as yet he was not quite sure of it himself for the rest he could either lie hidden or if it proved desirable announce that he still lived even if his messenger should prove faithless and tell the truth it would not greatly matter seeing that he knew nothing which could be of service to anybody  and so the steersman sailed away while ramiro filled with memories reflections and hopes walked quietly through the morsch poort into the good city of leyden    that evening but not until dark had fallen two other travellers entered leyden namely foy and martin passing unobserved through the quiet streets they reached the side door of the house in the bree straat it was opened by a servingwoman who told foy that his mother was in adrians room also that adrian was very much better so thither followed more slowly by martin went foy running upstairs three steps at a time for had he not a great story to tell  the interior of the room as he entered it made an attractive picture which even in his hurry caught foys eye and fixed itself so firmly in his mind that he never forgot its details to begin with the place was beautifully furnished for his brother had a really good taste in tapestry pictures and other such adornments adrian himself lay upon a richly carved oak bed pale from loss of blood but otherwise little the worse seated by the side of the bed looking wonderfully sweet in the lamplight which cast shadows from the curling hair about her brows on to the delicate face beneath was elsa brant she had been reading to adrian from a book of spanish chivalry such as his romantic soul loved and he resting on his elbow in the snowy bed was contemplating her beauty with his languishing black eyes yet although he only saw her for a moment before she heard his entry and looked up it was obvious to foy that elsa remained quite unconscious of the handsome adrians admiration indeed that her mind wandered far away from the magnificent adventures and highly coloured love scenes of which she was reading in her sweet low voice nor was he mistaken for in fact the poor child was thinking of her father  at the further end of the room talking together earnestly in the deep and curtained windowplace stood his mother and his father clearly they were as much preoccupied as the younger couple and it was not difficult for foy to guess that fears for his own safety upon his perilous errand were what concerned them most and behind them other unnumbered fears for the dwellers in the netherlands in those days must walk from year to year through a valley of shadows so grim that our imagination can scarcely picture them  sixty hours and he is not back lysbeth was saying  martin said we were not to trouble ourselves before they had been gone for a hundred answered dirk consolingly  just then foy surveying them from the shadowed doorway stepped forward saying in his jovial voice  sixty hours to the very minute  lysbeth uttered a little scream of joy and ran forward elsa let the book fall on to the floor and rose to do the same then remembered and stood still while dirk remained where he was till the women had done their greetings betraying his delight only by a quick rubbing of his hands adrian alone did not look particularly pleased not however because he retained any special grudge against his brother for his share in the fracas of a few nights before since when once his furious gusts of temper had passed he was no malevolently minded man indeed he was glad that foy had come back safe from his dangerous adventure only he wished that he would not blunder into the bedroom and interrupt his delightful occupation of listening while the beautiful elsa read him romance and poetry  since foy was gone upon his mission adrian had been treated with the consideration which he felt to be his due even his stepfather had taken the opportunity to mumble some words of regret for what had happened and to express a hope that nothing more would be said about the matter while his mother was sympathetic and elsa most charming and attentive now as he knew well all this would be changed foy the exuberant unrefined plainspoken nerveshaking foy would become the centre of attention and overwhelm them with long stories of very dull exploits while martin that brutal bull of a man who was only fit to draw a cart would stand behind and play the part of chorus saying ja and neen at proper intervals well he supposed that he must put up with it but oh what a weariness it was  another minute and foy was wringing him by the hand saying in his loud voice how are you old fellow you look as well as possible what are you lying in this bed for and being fed with pap by the women  for the love of heaven foy interrupted adrian stop crushing my fingers and shaking me as though i were a rat you mean it kindly i know but and adrian dropped back upon the pillow coughed and looked hectic and interesting  then both the women fell upon foy upbraiding him for his roughness begging him to remember that if he were not careful he might kill his brother whose arteries were understood to be in a most precarious condition till the poor man covered his ears with his hands and waited till he saw their lips stop moving  i apologise he said i wont touch him i wont speak loud near him adrian do you hear  who could help it moaned the prostrate adrian  cousin foy interrupted elsa clasping her hands and looking up into his face with her big brown eyes forgive me but i can wait no longer tell me did you see or hear anything of my father yonder at the hague  yes cousin i saw him answered foy presently  and how was heoh and all the rest of them  he was well  and free and in no danger  and free but i cannot say in no danger we are all of us in danger nowadays cousin replied foy in the same quiet voice  oh thank god for that said elsa  little enough to thank god for muttered martin who had entered the room and was standing behind foy looking like a giant at a show elsa had turned her face away so foy struck backwards with all his force hitting martin in the pit of the stomach with the point of his elbow martin doubled himself up recoiled a step and took the hint  well son what news said dirk speaking for the first time  news answered foy escaping joyfully from this treacherous ground oh lots of it look here and plunging his hands into his pockets he produced first the half of the broken dagger and secondly a long skinny finger of unwholesome hue with a gold ring on it  bah said adrian take that horrid thing away  oh i beg your pardon answered foy shuffling the finger back into his pocket you dont mind the dagger do you no well then mother that mail shirt of yours is the best that was ever made this knife broke on it like a carrot though by the way its uncommonly sticky wear when you havent changed it for three days and i shall be glad enough to get it off  evidently foy has a story to tell said adrian wearily and the sooner he rids his mind of it the sooner he will be able to wash i suggest foy that you should begin at the beginning  so foy began at the beginning and his tale proved sufficiently moving to interest even the soulworn adrian some portions of it he softened down and some of it he suppressed for the sake of elsanot very successfully indeed for foy was no diplomatist and her quick imagination filled the gaps another partthat which concerned her future and his ownof necessity he omitted altogether he told them very briefly however of the flight from the hague of the sinking of the government boat of the run through the gale to the haarlem mere with the dead pilot on board and the spanish ship behind and of the secret midnight burying of the treasure  where did you bury it asked adrian  i have not the slightest idea said foy i believe there are about three hundred islets in that part of the mere and all i know is that we dug a hole in one of them and stuck it in however he went on in a burst of confidence we made a map of the place that is here he broke off with a howl of pain for an accident had happened  while this narrative was proceeding martin who was standing by him saying ja and neen at intervals as adrian foresaw he would had unbuckled the great sword silence and in an abstracted manner was amusing himself by throwing it towards the ceiling hilt downwards and as it fell catching it in his hand now most unaccountably he looked the other way and missed his catch with the result that the handle of the heavy weapon fell exactly upon foys left foot and then clattered to the ground  you awkward beast roared foy you have crushed my toes and he hopped towards a chair upon one leg  your pardon master said martin i know it was careless my mother always told me that i was careless but so was my father before me  adrian overcome by the fearful crash closed his eyes and sighed  look said lysbeth in a fury he is fainting i knew that would be the end of all your noise if you are not careful we shall have him breaking another vessel go out of the room all of you you can finish telling the story downstairs and she drove them before her as a farmers wife drives fowls  martin said foy on the stairs where they found themselves together for a minute for at the first signs of the storm dirk had preceded them why did you drop that accursed great sword of yours upon my foot  master counted martin imperturbably why did you hit me in the pit of the stomach with your elbow  to keep your tongue quiet  and what is the name of my sword  silence  well then i dropped the sword silence for the same reason i hope it hasnt hurt you much but if it did i cant help it  foy wheeled round what do you mean martin  i mean answered the great man with energy that you have no right to tell what became of that paper which mother martha gave us  why not i have faith in my brother  very likely master but that isnt the point we carry a great secret and this secret is a trust a dangerous trust it would be wrong to lay its burden upon the shoulders of other folk what people dont know they cant tell master  foy still stared at him half in question half in anger but martin made no further reply in words only he went through certain curious motions motions as of a man winding slowly and laboriously at something like a pump wheel foys lips turned pale  the rack he whispered martin nodded and answered beneath his breath  they may all of them be on it yet you let the man in the boat escape and that man was the spanish spy ramiro i am sure of it if they dont know they cant tell and though we know we shant tell we shall die first master  now foy trembled and leaned against the wall what would betray us he asked  who knows master a womans torment a mans and he put a strange meaning into his voice a mansjealousy or pride or vengeance oh bridle your tongue and trust no one no not your father or mother or sweetheart or and again that strange meaning came into martins voice or brother  or you queried foy looking up  i am not sure yes i think you may trust me though there is no knowing how the rack might change a mans mind  if all this be so said foy with a flush of sudden passion i have said too much already  a great deal too much master if i could have managed it i should have dropped the sword silence on your toe long before but i couldnt for the heer adrian was watching me and i had to wait till he closed his eyes which he did to hear the better without seeming to listen  you are unjust to adrian martin as you always have been and i am angry with you say what is to be done now  now master replied martin cheerfully you must forget the teaching of the pastor arentz and tell a lie you must take up your tale where you left it off and say that we made a map of the hidingplace but thatibeing a foolmanaged to drop it while we were lighting the fuses so that it was blown away with the ship i will tell the same story  am i to say this to my father and mother  certainly and they will quite understand why you say it my mistress was getting uneasy already and that was why she drove us from the room you will tell them that the treasure is buried but that the secret of its hidingplace was lost  even so martin it is not lost mother martha knows it and they all will guess that she does know it  why master as it happened you were in such a hurry to get on with your story that i think you forgot to mention that she was present at the burying of the barrels her name was coming when i dropped the sword upon your foot  but she boarded and fired the spanish shipso the man ramiro and his companion would probably have seen her  i doubt master that the only person who saw her was he whose gizzard she split and he will tell no tales probably they think it was you or i who did that deed but if she was seen or if they know that she has the secret then let them get it from mother martha oh mares can gallop and ducks can dive and snakes can hide in the grass when they can catch the wind and make it give up its secrets when they can charm from sword silence the tale of the blood which it has drunk throughout the generations when they can call back the dead saints from heaven and stretch them anew within the torturepit then and not before they will win knowledge of the hoards hidingplace from the lips of the witch of haarlem meer oh master fear not for her the grave is not so safe  why did you not caution me before martin  because master answered martin stolidly i did not think that you would be such a fool but i forgot that you are youngyes i forget that you are young and good too good for the days we live in it is my fault on my head be it    chapter xvi  the master  in the sittingroom speaking more slowly and with greater caution foy continued the story of their adventures when he came to the tale of how the ship swallow was blown up with all the spanish boarders elsa clasped her hands saying horrible horrible think of the poor creatures hurled thus into eternity  and think of the business they were on broke in dirk grimly adding may god forgive me who cannot feel grieved to hear of the death of spanish cutthroats it was well managed foy excellently well managed but go on  i think that is about all said foy shortly except that two of the spaniards got away in a boat one of whom is believed to be the head spy and captain ramiro  but son up in adrians chamber just now you said something about having made a map of the hidingplace of the gold where is it for it should be put in safety  yes i know i did answered foy but didnt i tell you he went on awkwardly martin managed to drop the thing in the cabin of the swallow while we were lighting the fuses so it was blown up with the ship and there is now no record of where the stuff was buried  come come son said dirk martha who knows every island on the great lake must remember the spot  oh no she doesnt answered foy the truth is that she didnt come with us when we buried the barrels she stopped to watch the spanish ship and just told us to land on the first island we came to and dig a hole which we did making a map of the place before we left the same that martin dropped  all this clumsy falsehood foy uttered with a wooden face and in a voice which would not have convinced a threeyearold infant priding himself the while upon his extraordinary cleverness  martin asked dirk suspiciously is this true  absolutely true master replied martin it is wonderful how well he remembers  son said dirk turning white with suppressed anger you have always been a good lad and now you have shown yourself a brave one but i pray god that i may not be forced to add that you are falsetongued do you not see that this looks black the treasure which you have hidden is the greatest in all the netherlands will not folk say it is not wonderful that you should have forgotten its secret untilit suits you to remember  foy took a step forward his face crimson with indignation but the heavy hand of martin fell upon his shoulder and dragged him back as though he were but a little child  i think master foy he said fixing his eyes upon lysbeth that your lady mother wishes to say something  you are right martin i do do you not think husband that in these days of ours a man might have other reasons for hiding the truth than a desire to enrich himself by theft  what do you mean wife asked dirk foy here says that he has buried this great hoard with martin but that he and martin do not know where they buried it and have lost the map they made whatever may be the exact wording of the will that hoard belongs to my cousin here subject to certain trusts which have not yet arisen and may never arise and i am her guardian while hendrik brant lives and his executor when he dies therefore legally it belongs to me also by what right then do my son and my servant hide the truth from me if indeed they are hiding the truth say what you have to say straight out for i am a plain man and cannot read riddles  then i will say it husband though it is but my guess for i have had no words with foy or martin and if i am wrong they can correct me i know their faces and i think with you that they are not speaking the truth i think that they do not wish us to know itnot that they may keep the secret of this treasure for themselves but because such a secret might well bring those who know of it to the torment and the stake is it not so my son  mother answered foy almost in a whisper it is so the paper is not lost but do not seek to learn its hidingplace for there are wolves who would tear your bodies limb from limb to get the knowledge out of you yes even elsas even elsas if the trial must come let it fall on me and martin who are fitter to bear it oh father surely you know that whatever we may be neither of us is a thief  dirk advanced to his son and kissed him on the forehead  my son he said pardon me and you red martin pardon me also i spoke in my haste i spoke as a fool who at my age should have known better but oh i tell you that i wish that this cursed treasure these cases of precious gems and these kegs of hoarded gold had been shivered to the winds of heaven with the timbers of the ship swallow for mark you ramiro has escaped and with him another man and they will know well that having the night to hide it you did not destroy those jewels with the ship they will track you down these spanish sleuthhounds filled with the lust of blood and gold and it will be well if the lives of every one of us do not pay the price of the secret of the buryingplace of the wealth of hendrik brant  he ceased pale and trembling and a silence fell upon the room and all in it a sad and heavy silence for in his voice they caught the note of prophecy martin broke it  it may be so master he said but your pardon you should have thought of that before you undertook this duty there was no call upon you to send the heer foy and myself to the hague to bring away this trash but you did it as would any other honest man well now it is done and we must take our chance but i say thisif you are wise my masters yes and you ladies also before you leave this room you will swear upon the bible every one of you never to whisper the word treasure never to think of it except to believe that it is gonelost beneath the waters of the haarlemer meer never to whisper it no mistress not even to the heer adrian your son who lies sick abed upstairs  you have learnt wisdom somewhere of late years martin since you stopped drinking and fighting said dirk drily and for my part before god i swear it  and so do i and i and i and i echoed the others martin who spoke last adding yes i swear that i will never speak of it no not even to my young master adrian who lies sick abed upstairs    adrian made a good though not a very quick recovery he had lost a great deal of blood but the vessel closed without further complications so that it remained only to renew his strength by rest and ample food for ten days or so after the return of foy and martin he was kept in bed and nursed by the women of the house elsas share in this treatment was to read to him from the spanish romances which he admired very soon however he found that he admired elsa herself even more than the romances and would ask her to shut the book that he might talk to her so long as his conversation was about himself his dreams plans and ambitions she fell into it readily enough but when he began to turn it upon herself and to lard it with compliment and amorous innuendo then she demurred and fled to the romances for refuge  handsome as he might be adrian had no attractions for elsa about him there was something too exaggerated for her taste moreover he was spanish spanish in his beauty spanish in the cast of his mind and all spaniards were hateful to her deep down in her heart also lay a second reason for this repugnance the man reminded her of another man who for months had been a nightmare to her soul the hague spy ramiro this ramiro she had observed closely though she had not seen him very often his terrible reputation was familiar to her she knew also for her father had told her as much that it was he who was drawing the nets about him at the hague and who plotted day and night to rob him of his wealth  at first sight there was no great resemblance between the pair how could there be indeed between a man on the wrong side of middle age oneeyed grizzled battered and bearing about with him an atmosphere of iniquity and a young gentleman handsome distinguished and wayward but assuredly no criminal yet the likeness existed she had seen it first when adrian was pointing out to her how were he a general he would dispose his forces for the capture of leyden and from that moment her nature rose in arms against him also it came out in other ways in little tricks of voice and pomposities of manner which elsa caught at unexpected moments perhaps as she told herself because she had trained her mind to seek these similarities yet all the while she knew that the fancy was ridiculous for what could these two men have in common with each other  in those days however elsa did not think much of adrian or of anybody except her beloved father whose only child she was and whom she adored with all the passion of her heart she knew the terrible danger in which he stood and guessed that she had been sent away that she should not share his perils now she had but one desire and one prayerthat he might escape in safety and that she might return to him again once only a message came from him sent through a woman she had never seen the wife of a fisherman who delivered it by word of mouth this was the message  give my love and blessing to my daughter elsa and tell her that so far i am unharmed to foy van goorl say i have heard the news well done thou good and faithful servant let him remember what i told him and be sure that he will not strive in vain and that he shall not lack for his reward here or hereafter  that was all tidings reached them that the destruction of so many men by the blowing up of the swallow and by her sinking of the government boat as she escaped had caused much excitement and fury among the spaniards but as those who had been blown up were freelances and as the boat was sunk while the swallow was flying from them nothing had been done in the matter indeed nothing could be done for it was not known who manned the swallow and as ramiro had foreseen her crew were supposed to have been destroyed with her in the haarlemer meer  then after a while came other news that filled elsas heart with a wild hope for it was reported that hendrik brant had disappeared and was believed to have escaped from the hague nothing more was heard of him however which is scarcely strange for the doomed man had gone down the path of rich heretics into the silent vaults of the inquisition the net had closed at last and through the net fell the sword  but if elsa thought seldom of adrian except in gusts of spasmodic dislike adrian thought of elsa and little besides so earnestly did he lash his romantic temperament and so deeply did her beauty and charm appeal to him that very soon he was truly in love with her nor did the fact that as he believed she was potentially the greatest heiress in the netherlands cool adrians amorous devotion what could suit him better in his condition than to marry this rich and lovely lady  so adrian made up his mind that he would marry her for in his vanity it never occurred to him that she might object indeed the only thought that gave him trouble was the difficulty of reducing her wealth into possession foy and martin had buried it somewhere in the haarlemer meer but they said for this he had ascertained by repeated inquiries although the information was given grudgingly enough that the map of the hidingplace had been destroyed in the explosion on the swallow adrian did not believe this story for a moment he was convinced that they were keeping the truth from him and as the prospective master of that treasure he resented this reticence bitterly still it had to be overcome and so soon as he was engaged to elsa he intended to speak very clearly upon this point meanwhile the first thing was to find a suitable opportunity to make his declaration in due form which done he would be prepared to deal with foy and martin  towards evening it was elsas custom to walk abroad as at that hour foy left the foundry naturally he accompanied her in these walks martin following at a little distance in case he should be wanted soon those excursions became delightful to both of them to elsa especially it was pleasant to escape from the hot house into the cool evening air and still more pleasant to exchange the laboured tendernesses and highly coloured compliments of adrian for the cheerful honesty of foys conversation  foy admired his cousin as much as did his halfbrother but his attitude towards her was very different he never said sweet things he never gazed up into her eyes and sighed although once or twice perhaps by accident he did squeeze her hand his demeanour towards her was that of a friend and relative and the subject of their talk for the most part was the possibility of her fathers deliverance from the dangers which surrounded him and other matters of the sort  the time came at last when adrian was allowed to leave his room and as it chanced it fell to elsas lot to attend him on this first journey downstairs in a dutch home of the period and of the class of the van goorls all the womenfolk of whatever degree were expected to take a share in the household work at present elsas share was to nurse to adrian who showed so much temper at every attempt which was made to replace her by any other woman that in face of the doctors instructions lysbeth did not dare to cross his whim  it was with no small delight therefore that elsa hailed the prospect of release for the young man with his grandiose bearing and amorous sighs wearied her almost beyond endurance adrian was not equally pleased indeed he had feigned symptoms which caused him to remain in bed an extra week merely in order that he might keep her near him but now the inevitable hour had come and adrian felt that it was incumbent upon him to lift the veil and let elsa see some of the secret of his soul he had prepared for the event indeed the tedium of his confinement had been much relieved by the composition of lofty and heartstirring addresses in which he the noble cavalier laid his precious self and fortune at the feet of this undistinguished but rich and attractive maid  yet now when the moment was with him and when elsa gave him her hand to lead him from the room behold all these beautiful imaginings had vanished and his knees shook with no fancied weakness somehow elsa did not look as a girl ought to look who was about to be proposed to she was too cold and dignified too utterly unconscious of anything unusual it was disconcertingbutit must be done  by a superb effort adrian recovered himself and opened with one of the fine speeches not the best by any means but the only specimen which he could remember  without he began the free air waits to be pressed by my cramped wings but although my heart bounds wild as that of any haggard hawk i tell you fairest elsa that in yonder gilded cage and he pointed to the bed i  heaven above us heer adrian broke in elsa in alarm are youare yougetting giddy  she does not understand poor child how should she he murmured in a stage aside then he started again yes most adorable best beloved i am giddy giddy with gratitude to those fair hands giddy with worship of those lovely eyes  now elsa unable to contain her merriment any longer burst out laughing but seeing that her adorers face was beginning to look as it did in the diningroom before he broke the blood vessel she checked herself and said  oh heer adrian dont waste all this fine poetry upon me i am too stupid to understand it  poetry he exclaimed becoming suddenly natural it isnt poetry  then what is it she asked and next moment could have bitten her tongue out  it isit islove and he sank upon his knees before her where she could not but notice he looked very handsome in the subdued light of the room with his upturned face blanched by sickness and his southern glowing eyes elsa i love you and no other and unless you return that love my heart will break and i shall die  now under ordinary circumstances elsa would have been quite competent to deal with the situation but the fear of overagitating adrian complicated it greatly about the reality of his feelings at the moment at any rate it seemed impossible to be mistaken for the man was shaking like a leaf still she must make an end of these advances  rise heer adrian she said gently holding out her hand to help him to his feet  he obeyed and glancing at her face saw that it was very calm and cold as winter ice  listen heer adrian she said you mean this kindly and doubtless many a maid would be flattered by your words but i must tell you that i am in no mood for lovemaking  because of another man he queried and suddenly becoming theatrical again added speak on let me hear the worst i will not quail  there is no need to replied elsa in the same quiet voice because there is no other man i have never yet thought of marriage i have no wish that way and if i had i should forget it now when from hour to hour i do not know where my dear father may be or what fate awaits him he is my only lover heer adrian and as elsa spoke her soft brown eyes filled with tears  ah said adrian would that i might fly to save him from all dangers as i rescued you lady from the bandits of the wood  i would you might she replied smiling sadly at the double meaning of the words but hark your mother is calling us i know heer adrian she added gently that you will understand and respect my dreadful anxiety and will not trouble me again with poetry and lovetalk for if you do i shall beangry  lady he answered your wishes are my law and until these clouds have rolled from the blue heaven of your life i will be as silent as the watching moon and by the way he added rather nervously perhaps you will be silent alsoabout our talk i mean as we do not want that buffoon foy thrusting his streetboy fun at us  elsa bowed her head she was inclined to resent the we and other things in this speech but above all she did not wish to prolong this foolish and tiresome interview so without more words she took her admirer by the hand and guided him down the stairs    it was but three days after this ridiculous scene on a certain afternoon when adrian had been out for the second time that the evil tidings came dirk had heard them in the town and returned home wellnigh weeping elsa saw his face and knew at once  oh is he dead she gasped  he nodded for he dared not trust himself to speak  how where  in the poort prison at the hague  how do you know  i have seen a man who helped to bury him  she looked up as though to ask for further details but dirk turned away muttering he is dead he is dead let be  then she understood nor did she ever seek to know any more whatever he had suffered at least now he was with the god he worshipped and with the wife he lost only the poor orphan comforted by lysbeth crept from the chamber and for a week was seen no more when she appeared again she seemed to be herself in all things only she never smiled and was very indifferent to what took place about her thus she remained for many days  although this demeanour on elsas part was understood and received with sympathy and more by the rest of the household adrian soon began to find it irksome and even ridiculous so colossal was this young mans vanity that he was unable quite to understand how a girl could be so wrapped up in the memories of a murdered father that no place was left in her mind for the tendernesses of a present adorer after all this father what was he a middleaged and doubtless quite uninteresting burgher who could lay claim to but one distinction that of great wealth most of which had been amassed by his ancestors  now a rich man alive has points of interest but a rich man dead is only interesting to his heirs also this brant was one of these narrowminded fanatical new religion fellows who were so wearisome to men of intellect and refinement true he adrian was himself of that community for circumstances had driven him into the herd but oh he found them a dreary set their bald doctrines of individual effort of personal striving to win a personal redemption did not appeal to him moreover they generally ended at the stake now about the pomp and circumstance of the mother church there was something attractive of course as a matter of prejudice he attended its ceremonials from time to time and found them comfortable and satisfying comfortable also were the dogmas of forgiveness to be obtained by an act of penitential confession and the sense of a great supporting force whose whole weight was at the disposal of the humblest believer  in short there was nothing picturesque about the excellent departed hendrik nothing that could justify the young woman in wrapping herself up in grief for him to the entire exclusion of a person who was picturesque and ready at the first opportunity to wrap himself up in her  after long brooding assisted by a close study of the romances of the period adrian convinced himself that in all this there was something unnatural that the girl must be under a species of spell which in her own interest ought to be broken through but how that was the question try as he would he could do nothing therefore like others in a difficulty he determined to seek the assistance of an expert namely black meg who among her other occupations for a certain fee payable in advance was ready to give advice as a specialist in affairs of the heart  to black meg accordingly he went disguised secretly and by night for he loved mystery and in truth it was hardly safe that he should visit her by the light of day seated in a shadowed chamber he poured out his artless tale to the pythoness of course concealing all names he might have spared himself this trouble as he was an old client of megs a fact that no disguise could keep from her before he opened his lips she knew perfectly what was the name of his inamorata and indeed all the circumstances connected with the pair of them  the wise woman listened in patience and when he had done shook her head saying that the case was too hard for her she proposed however to consult a master more learned than herself who by great good fortune was at that moment in leyden frequenting her house in fact and begged that adrian would return at the same hour on the morrow  now as it chanced oddly enough black meg had been commissioned by the said master to bring about a meeting between himself and this very young man  adrian returned accordingly and was informed that the master after consulting the stars and other sources of divination had become so deeply interested in the affair that for pure love of the thing and not for any temporal purpose of gain he was in attendance to advise in person adrian was overjoyed and prayed that he might be introduced presently a noblelooking form entered the room wrapped in a long cloak adrian bowed and the form after contemplating him earnestlyvery earnestly if he had known the truthacknowledged the salute with dignity adrian cleared his throat and began to speak whereon the sage stopped him  explanations are needless young man he said in a measured and melodious voice for my studies of the matter have already informed me of more than you can tell let me see your name is adrian van goorlno called van goorl the lady you desire to win is elsa brant the daughter of hendrik brant a heretic and wellknown goldsmith who was recently executed at the hague she is a girl of much beauty but one unnaturally insensible to the influence of love and who does not at present recognise your worth there are also unless i am mistaken other important circumstances connected with the case  this lady is a great heiress but her fortune is at present missing it is i have reason to believe hidden in the haarlemer meer she is surrounded with influences that are inimical to you all of which however can be overcome if you will place yourself unreservedly in my hands for young man i accept no halfconfidences nor do i ask for any fee when the fortune is recovered and the maiden is your happy wife then we will talk of payment for services rendered and not before  wonderful wonderful gasped adrian most learned senor every word you say is true  yes friend adrian and i have not told you all the truth for instancebut no this is not the time to speak the question is do you accept my terms  what terms senor  the old terms without which no wonder can be workedfaith absolute faith  adrian hesitated a little absolute faith seemed a large present to give a complete stranger at a first interview  i read your thought and i respect it went on the sage who to tell truth was afraid he had ventured a little too far there is no hurry these affairs cannot be concluded in a day  adrian admitted that they could not but intimated that he would be glad of a little practical and immediate assistance the sage buried his face in his hands and thought  the first thing to do he said presently is to induce a favourable disposition of the maidens mind towards yourself and this i think can best be brought aboutthough the method is one which i do not often useby means of a love philtre carefully compounded to suit the circumstances of the case if you will come here tomorrow at dusk the lady of this housea worthy woman though rough of speech and no true adeptwill hand it to you  it isnt poisonous suggested adrian doubtfully  fool do i deal in poisons it will poison the girls heart in your favour that is all  and how is it to be administered asked adrian  in the water or the wine she drinks and afterwards you must speak to her again as soon as possible now that is settled he went on airily so young friend goodbye  are you sure that there is no fee hesitated adrian  no indeed answered the sage at any rate until all is accomplished ah and he sighed did you but know what a delight it is to a weary and worldworn traveller to help forward the bright ambitions of youth to assist the pure and soaring soul to find the mate destined to it by heavenehemyou wouldnt talk of fees besides i will be frank from the moment that i entered this room and saw you i recognised in you a kindred nature one which under my guidance is capable of great things of things greater than i care to tell ah what a vision do i see you the husband of the beautiful elsa and master of her great wealth and i at your side guiding you with my wisdom and experiencethen what might not be achieved dreams doubtless dreams though how often have my dreams been prophetic still forget them and at least young man we will be friends and he stretched out his hand  with all my heart answered adrian taking those cool agilelooking fingers for years i have sought someone on whom i could rely someone who would understand me as i feel you do  yes yes sighed the sage i do indeed understand you  to think he said to himself after the door had closed behind the delighted and flattered adrian to think that i can be the father of such a fool as that well it bears out my theories about crossbreeding and after all in this case a goodlooking gullible fool will be much more useful to me than a young man of sense let me see the price of the office is paid and i shall have my appointment duly sealed as the new governor of the gevangenhuis by next week at furthest so i may as well begin to collect evidence against my worthy successor dirk van goorl his adventurous son foy and that redheaded ruffian martin once i have them in the gevangenhuis it will go hard if i cant squeeze the secret of old brants money out of one of the three of them the women wouldnt know they wouldnt have told the women besides i dont want to meddle with them indeed nothing would persuade me to thatand he shivered as though at some wretched recollection but there must be evidence there is such noise about these executions and questionings that they wont allow any more of them in leyden without decent evidence even alva and the blood council are getting a bit frightened well who can furnish better testimony than that jackass my worthy son adrian probably however he has a conscience somewhere so it may be as well not to let him know that when he thinks himself engaged in conversation he is really in the witness box let me see we must take the old fellow dirk on the ground of heresy and the youngster and the serving man on a charge of murdering the kings soldiers and assisting the escape of heretics with their goods murder sounds bad and especially in the case of a young man excites less sympathy than common heresy  then he went to the door calling meg hostess mine meg  he might have saved himself the trouble however since on opening it suddenly that lady fell almost into his arms  what he said listening oh fie and all for nothing but there ladies will be curious andthis to himselfi must be more careful lucky i didnt talk aloud  then he called her in and having inspected the chamber narrowly proceeded to make certain arrangements    chapter xvii  betrothed  at nightfall on the morrow adrian returned as appointed and was admitted into the same room where he found black meg who greeted him openly by name and handed to him a tiny phial containing a fluid clear as water this however was scarcely to be wondered at seeing that it was water and nothing else  will it really work upon her heart asked adrian eyeing the stuff  ay answered the hag thats a wondrous medicine and those who drink it go crazed with love for the giver it is compounded according to the masters own receipt from very costly tasteless herbs that grow only in the deserts of arabia  adrian understood and fumbled in his pocket meg stretched out her hand to receive the honorarium it was a long skinny hand with long skinny fingers but there was this peculiarity about it that one of these fingers chanced to be missing she saw his eyes fixed upon the gap and rushed into an explanation  i have met with an accident meg explained in cutting up a pig the chopper caught this finger and severed it  did you wear a ring on it asked adrian  yes she replied with sombre fury  how very strange ejaculated adrian  why  because i have seen a finger a womans long finger with a gold ring on it that might have come off your hand i suppose the porkbutcher picked it up for a keepsake  may be heer adrian but where is it now  oh it is or was in a bottle of spirits tied by a thread to the cork  megs evil face contorted itself get me that bottle she said hoarsely look you heer adrian i am doing much for you do this for me  what do you want it for  to give it christian burial she replied sourly it is not fitting or lucky that a persons finger should stand about in a bottle like a caul or a lizard get it i say get iti ask no question whereor young man you will have little help in your love affairs from me  do you wish the dagger hilt also he asked mischievously  she looked at him out of the corners of her black eyes this adrian knew too much  i want the finger and the ring on it which i lost in chopping up the pig  perhaps mother you would like the pig too are you not making a mistake werent you trying to cut his throat and didnt he bite off the finger  if i want the pig ill search his stye you bring that bottle or  she did not finish her sentence for the door opened and through it came the sage  quarrelling he said in a tone of reproof what about let me guess and he passed his hand over his shadowed brow ah i see there is a finger in it a finger of fate no not that and moved by a fresh inspiration he grasped megs hand and added now i have it bring it back friend adrian bring it back a dead finger is most unlucky to all save its owner as a favour to me  very well said adrian  my gifts grow mused the master i have a vision of this honest hand and of a great swordbut there it is not worth while too small a matter leave us mother it shall be returned my word on it yes gold ring and all and now young friend let us talk you have the philtre well i can promise you that it is a good one it would almost bring galatea from her marble pygmalion must have known that secret but tell me something of your life your daily thoughts and daily deeds for when i give my friendship i love to live in the life of my friends  thus encouraged adrian told him a great deal so much indeed that the senor ramiro nodding in the shadow of his hood began to wonder whether the spy behind the cupboard door expert as he was could possibly make his pen keep pace with these outpourings oh it was a dreary task but he kept to it and by putting in a sentence here and there artfully turned the conversation to matters of faith  no need to fence with me he said presently i know how you have been brought up how through no fault of your own you have wandered out of the warm bosom of the true church to sit at the clay feet of the conventicle you doubt it well let me look again let me look yes only last week you were seated in a whitewashed room overhanging the marketplace i see it allan ugly little man with a harsh voice is preaching preaching what i think blasphemy basketsbaskets what have baskets to do with him  i believe he used to make them interrupted adrian taking the bait  that may be it or perhaps he will be buried in one at any rate he is strangely mixed up with baskets well there are others with you a middleaged heavyfaced man is he not dirk van goorl your stepfather andwaita young fellow with rather a pleasant face also a relation i see his name but i cant spell it ffoi faith in the french tongue odd name for a heretic  foyfoy interrupted adrian again  indeed strange that i should have mistaken the last letter but in the spirit sight and hearing these things chance then there is a great man with a red beard  no master youre wrong said adrian with emphasis martin was not there he stopped behind to watch the house  are you sure asked the seer doubtfully i look and i seem to see him and he stared blankly at the wall  so you might see him often enough but not at last weeks meeting  it is needless to follow the conversation further the seer by aid of a ball of crystal that he produced from the folds of his cloak described his spirit visions and the pupil corrected them from his intimate knowledge of the facts until the senor ramiro and his confederates in the cupboard had enough evidence as evidence was understood in those days to burn dirk foy and martin three times over and if it should suit him adrian also then for that night they parted  next evening adrian was back again with the finger in the bottle which meg grabbed as a pike snatches at a frog and further fascinating conversation ensued indeed adrian found this well of mystic lore tempered with shrewd advice upon love affairs and other worldly matters and with flattery of his own person and gifts singularly attractive  several times did he return thus for as it chanced elsa had been unwell and kept her room so that he discovered no opportunity of administering the magic philtre that was to cause her heart to burn with love for him  at length when even the patient ramiro was almost worn out by the young gentlemans lengthy visits the luck changed elsa appeared one day at dinner and with great adroitness adrian quite unseen of anyone contrived to empty the phial into her goblet of water which as he rejoiced to see she drank to the last drop  but no opportunity such as he sought ensued for elsa overcome doubtless by an unwonted rush of emotion retired to battle it in her own chamber since it was impossible to follow and propose to her there adrian possessing his soul in such patience as he could command sat in the sittingroom to await her return for he knew that it was not her habit to go out until five oclock as it happened however elsa had other arrangements for the afternoon since she had promised to accompany lysbeth upon several visits to the wives of neighbours and then to meet her cousin foy at the factory and walk with him in the meadows beyond the town  so while adrian lost in dreams waited in the sittingroom elsa and lysbeth left the house by the side door  they had paid three of their visits when their path chanced to lead them past the old town prison which was called the gevangenhuis this place formed one of the gateways of the city for it was built in the walls and opened on to the moat water surrounding it on all sides in front of its massive door that was guarded by two soldiers a small crowd had gathered on the drawbridge and in the street beyond apparently in expectation of somebody or something lysbeth looked at the threestoried frowning building and shuddered for it was here that heretics were put upon their trial and here too many of them were done to death after the dreadful fashion of the day  hasten she said to elsa as she pushed through the crowd for doubtless some horror passes here  have no fear answered an elderly and goodnatured woman who overheard her we are only waiting to hear the new governor of the prison read his deed of appointment  as she spoke the doors were thrown open and a manhe was a wellknown executioner named baptistecame out carrying a sword in one hand and a bunch of keys on a salver in the other after him followed the governor gallantly dressed and escorted by a company of soldiers and the officials of the prison drawing a scroll from beneath his cloak he began to read it rapidly and in an almost inaudible voice  it was his commission as governor of the prison signed by alva himself and set out in full his powers which were considerable his responsibilities which were small and other matters excepting only the sum of money that he had paid for the office that given certain conditions was as a matter of fact sold to the highest bidder as may be guessed this post of governor of a gaol in one of the large netherland cities was lucrative enough to those who did not object to such a fashion of growing rich so lucrative was it indeed that the salary supposed to attach to the office was never paid at least its occupant was expected to help himself to it out of heretical pockets  as he finished reading through the paper the new governor looked up to see perhaps what impression he had produced upon his audience now elsa saw his face for the first time and gripped lysbeths arm  it is ramiro she whispered ramiro the spy the man who dogged my father at the hague  as well might she have spoken to a statue indeed of a sudden lysbeth seemed to be smitten into stone for there she stood staring with a blanched and meaningless face at the face of the man opposite to her well might she stare for she also knew him across the gulf of years oneeyed bearded withered scarred as he was by suffering passion and evil thoughts she knew him for there before her stood one whom she deemed dead the wretch whom she had believed to be her husband juan de montalvo some magnetism drew his gaze to her out of all the faces of that crowd it was hers that leapt to his eye he trembled and grew white he turned away and swiftly was gone back into the hell of the gevangenhuis like a demon he had come out of it to survey the human world beyond and search for victims there like a demon he went back into his own place so at least it seemed to lysbeth  come come she muttered and drawing the girl with her passed out of the crowd  elsa began to talk in a strained voice that from time to time broke into a sob  that is the man she said he hounded down my father it was his wealth he wanted but my father swore that he would die before he should win it and he is deaddead in the inquisition and that man is his murderer  lysbeth made no answer never a word she uttered till presently they halted at a mean and humble door then she spoke for the first time in cold and constrained accents  i am going in here to visit the vrouw jansen you have heard of her the wife of him whom they burned she sent to me to say that she is sick i know not of what but there is smallpox about i have heard of four cases of it in the city so cousin it is wisest that you should not enter here give me the basket with the food and wine look yonder is the factory quite close at hand and there you will find foy oh never mind ramiro what is done is done go and walk with foy and for a while forgetramiro  at the door of the factory elsa found foy awaiting her and they walked together through one of the gates of the city into the pleasant meadows that lay beyond at first they did not speak much for each of them was occupied with thoughts which pressed their tongues to silence when they were clear of the town however elsa could contain herself no more indeed the anguish awakened in her mind by the sight of ramiro working upon nerves already overstrung had made her halfhysterical she began to speak the words broke from her like water from a dam which it has breached she told foy that she had seen the man and moremuch more all the misery which she had suffered all the love for the father who was lost to her  at last elsa ceased outworn and standing still there upon the river bank she wrung her hands and wept till now foy had said nothing for his good spirits and cheerful readiness seemed to have forsaken him even now he said nothing all he did was to put his arms about this sweet maids waist and drawing her to him to kiss her upon brow and eyes and lips she did not resist it never seemed to occur to her to show resentment indeed she let her head sink upon his shoulder like the head of a little child and there sobbed herself to silence at last she lifted her face and asked very simply  what do you want with me foy van goorl  what he repeated why i want to be your husband  is this a time for marrying and giving in marriage she asked again but almost as though she were speaking to herself  i dont know that it is he replied but it seems the only thing to do and in such days two are better than one  she drew away and looked at him shaking her head sadly my father she began  yes he interrupted brightening thank you for mentioning him that reminds me he wished this so i hope now that he is gone you will take the same view  it is rather late to talk about that isnt it foy she stammered looking at his shoulder and smoothing her ruffled hair with her small white hand but what do you mean  so word for word as nearly as he could remember it he told her all that hendrik brant had said to him in the cellar at the hague before they had entered upon the desperate adventure of their flight to the haarlemer meer he wished it you see he ended  my thought was always his thought andfoyi wish it also  priceless things are not lightly won said he quoting brants words as though by some afterthought  there he must have been talking of the treasure foy she answered her face lightening to a smile  ay of the treasure sweet the treasure of your dear heart  a poor thing foy but i think thatit rings true  it had need elsa yet the best of coin may crack with rough usage  mine will wear till death foy  i ask no more elsa when i am dead spend it elsewhere i shall find it again above where there is no marrying or giving in marriage  there would be but small change left to spend foy so look to your own gold andsee that you do not alter its image and superscription for metal will melt in the furnace and each queen has her stamp  enough he broke in impatiently why do you talk of such things and in these riddles which puzzle me  because because we are not married yet andthe words are not mineprecious things are dearly won perfect love and perfect peace cannot be bought with a few sweet words and kisses they must be earned in trial and tribulation  of which i have no doubt we shall find plenty foy replied cheerfully meanwhile the kisses make a good road to travel on  after this elsa did not argue any more  at length they turned and walked homeward through the quiet evening twilight hand clasped in hand and were happy in their way it was not a very demonstrative way for the dutch have never been excitable or at least they do not show their excitement moreover the conditions of this betrothal were peculiar it was as though their hands had been joined from a deathbed the deathbed of hendrik brant the martyr of the hague whose newshed blood cried out to heaven for vengeance this sense pressing on both of them did not tend towards rapturous outbursts of youthful passion and even if they could have shaken it off and let their young blood have rein there remained another sensethat of dangers ahead of them  two are better than one foy had said and for her own reasons she had not wished to argue the point still elsa felt that to it there was another side if two could comfort each other could help each other could love each other could they not also suffer for each other in short by doubling their lives did they not also double their anxieties or if children should come treble and quadruple them this is true of all marriage but how much more was it true in such days and in such a case as that of foy and elsa both of them heretics both of them rich and therefore both liable at a moments notice to be haled to the torment and the stake knowing these things and having but just seen the hated face of ramiro it is not wonderful that although she rejoiced as any woman must that the man to whom her soul turned had declared himself her lover elsa could only drink of this joyful cup with a chastened and a fearful spirit nor is it wonderful that even in the hour of his triumph foys buoyant and hopeful nature was chilled by the shadow of her fears and the forebodings of his own heart    when lysbeth parted from elsa that afternoon she went straight to the chamber of the vrouw jansen it was a poor place for after the execution of her husband his wretched widow had been robbed of all her property and now existed upon the charity of her coreligionists lysbeth found her in bed an old woman nursing her who said that she thought the patient was suffering from a fever lysbeth leant over the bed and kissed the sick woman but started back when she saw that the glands of her neck were swollen into great lumps while the face was flushed and the eyes so bloodshot as to be almost red still she knew her visitor for she whispered  what is the matter with me vrouw van goorl is it the smallpox coming on tell me friend the doctor would not speak  i fear that it is worse it is the plague said lysbeth startled into candour  the poor girl laughed hoarsely oh i hoped it she said i am glad i am glad for now i shall die and go to join him but i wish that i had caught it before she rambled on to herself for then i would have taken it to him in prison and they couldnt have treated him as they did suddenly she seemed to come to herself for she added go away vrouw van goorl go quickly or you may catch my sickness  if so i am afraid that the mischief is done for i have kissed you answered lysbeth but i do not fear such things though perhaps if i took it this would save me many a trouble still there are others to think of and i will go so having knelt down to pray awhile by the patient and given the old nurse the basket of soup and food lysbeth went  next morning she heard that the vrouw jansen was dead the pest that struck her being of the most fatal sort  lysbeth knew that she had run great risk for there is no disease more infectious than the plague she determined therefore that so soon as she reached home she would burn her dress and other articles of clothing and purify herself with the fumes of herbs then she dismissed the matter from her mind which was already filled with another thought a dominant soulpossessing thought  oh god montalvo had returned to leyden out of the blackness of the past out of the gloom of the galleys had arisen this evil genius of her life yes and by a strange fatality of the life of elsa brant also since it was her she swore who had dragged down her father lysbeth was a brave woman one who had passed through many dangers but her whole heart turned sick with terror at the sight of this man and sick it must remain till she or he were dead she could well guess what he had come to seek it was that cursed treasure of hendrik brants which had drawn him she knew from elsa that for a year at least the man ramiro had been plotting to steal this money at the hague he had failed there failed with overwhelming and shameful loss through the bravery and resource of her son foy and their henchman red martin now he had discovered their identity he was aware that they held the secret of the hidingplace of that accursed hoard they and no others and he had established himself in leyden to wring it out of them it was clear clear as the setting orb of the red sun before her she knew the manhad she not lived with himand there could be no doubt about it andhe was the new governor of the gevangenhuis doubtless he has purchased that post for his own dark purposes andto be near them  sick and half blind with the intensity of her dread lysbeth staggered home she must tell dirk that was her one thought but no she had been in contact with the plague first she must purify herself so she went to her room and although it was summer lit a great fire on the hearth and in it burned her garments then she bathed and fumigated her hair and body over a brazier of strong herbs such as in those days of frequent and virulent sickness housewives kept at hand after which she dressed herself afresh and went to seek her husband she found him at a desk in his private room reading some paper which at her approach he shuffled into a drawer  what is that dirk she asked with sudden suspicion  he pretended not to hear and she repeated the query  well wife if you wish to know he answered in his blunt fashion it is my will  why are you reading your will she asked again beginning to tremble for her nerves were afire and this simple accident struck her as something awful and ominous  for no particular reason wife he replied quietly only that we all must die early or late there is no escape from that and in these times it is more often early than late so it is as well to be sure that everything is in order for those who come after us now since we are on the subject which i have never cared to speak about listen to me  what about husband  why about my will look you hendrik brant and his treasure have taught me a lesson i am not a man of his substance or a tenth of it but in some countries i should be called rich for i have worked hard and god has prospered me well of late i have been realising where i could also the bulk of my savings is in cash but the cash is not here not in this country at all you know my correspondents munt and brown of norwich in england to whom we ship our goods for the english market they are honest folk and munt owes me everything almost to his life well they have the money it has reached them safely thanks be to god and with it a counterpart of this my will duly attested and here is their letter of acknowledgment stating that they have laid it out carefully at interest upon mortgage on great estates in norfolk where it lies to my order or that of my heirs and that a duplicate acknowledgment has been filed in their english registries in case this should go astray little remains here except this house and the factory and even on those i have raised money meanwhile the business is left to live on and beyond it the rents which will come from england so that whether i be living or dead you need fear no want but what is the matter with you lysbeth you look strange  oh husband husband she gasped juan de montalvo is here again he has appeared as the new governor of the gaol i saw him this afternoon i cannot be mistaken although he has lost an eye and is much changed  dirks jaw dropped and his florid face whitened juan de montalvo he said i heard that he was dead long ago  you are mistaken husband a devil never dies he is seeking brants treasure and he knows that we have its secret you can guess the rest more now that i think of it i have heard that a strange spaniard is lodging with hague simon he whom they call the butcher and black meg of whom we have cause to know doubtless it is he anddirk death overshadows us  why should he know of brants treasure wife  because he is ramiro the man who dogged him down the man who followed the ship swallow to the haarlemer meer elsa was with me this afternoon she knew him again  dirk thought a while resting his head upon his hand then he lifted it and said  i am very glad that i sent the money to munt and brown heaven gave me that thought well wife what is your counsel now  my counsel is that we should fly from leydenall of us yes this very night before worse happens  he smiled that cannot be there are no means of flight and under the new laws we could not pass the gates that trick has been played too often still in a day or two when i have had time to arrange we might escape if you still wish to go  tonight tonight she urged or some of us stay for ever  i tell you wife it is not possible am i a rat that i should be bolted from my hole thus by this ferret of a montalvo i am a man of peace and no longer young but let him beware lest i stop here long enough to pass a sword through him  so be it husband she replied but i think it is through my heart that the sword will pass and she burst out weeping    supper that night was a somewhat melancholy meal dirk and lysbeth sat at the ends of the table in silence on one side of fit were placed foy and elsa who were also silent for a very different reason while opposite to them was adrian who watched elsa with an anxious and inquiring eye  that the love potion worked he was certain for she looked confused and a little flushed also as would be natural under the circumstances she avoided his glance and made pretence to be interested in foy who seemed rather more stupid than usual well so soon as he could find his chance all this would be cleared up but meanwhile the general gloom and silence were affecting his nerves  what have you been doing this afternoon mother adrian asked presently  i son she replied with a start i have been visiting the unhappy vrouw jansen whom i found very sick  what is the matter with her mother  lysbeths mind which had wandered away again returned to the subject at hand with an effort  the matter oh she has the plague  the plague exclaimed adrian springing to his feet do you mean to say you have been consorting with a woman who has the plague  i fear so she answered with a smile but do not be frightened adrian i have burnt my clothes and fumigated myself  still adrian was frightened his recent experience of sickness had been ample and although he was no coward he had a special dislike of infectious diseases which at the time were many  it is horrible he said horrible i only hope that wei mean youmay escape the house is unbearably close i am going to walk in the courtyard and away he went for the moment at any rate forgetting all about elsa and the love potion    chapter xviii  foy sees a vision  never since that day when many years before she had bought the safety of the man she loved by promising herself in marriage to his rival had lysbeth slept so ill as she did upon this night montalvo was alive montalvo was here here to strike down and destroy those whom she loved and triple armed with power authority and desire to do the deed well she knew that when there was plunder to be won he would not step aside or soften until it was in his hands yet there was hope in this he was not a cruel man as she knew also that is to say he had no pleasure in inflicting suffering for its own sake such methods he used only as a means to an end if he could get the money all of it she was sure that he would leave them alone why should he not have it why should all their lives be menaced because of this trust which had been thrust upon them  unable to endure the torments of her doubts and fears lysbeth woke her husband who was sleeping peacefully at her side and told him what was passing in her mind  it is a true saying answered dirk with a smile that even the best of women are never quite honest when their interest pulls the other way what wife would you have us buy our own peace with brants fortune and thus break faith with a dead man and bring down his curse upon us  the lives of men are more than gold and elsa would consent she answered sullenly already this pelf is stained with blood the blood of hendrik brant himself and of hans the pilot  yes wife and since you mention it with the blood of a good many spaniards also who tried to steal the stuff lets see there must have been several drowned at the mouth of the river and quite twenty went up with the swallow so the loss has not been all on our side listen lysbeth listen it was my cousin hendrik brants belief that in the end this great fortune of his would do some service to our people or our country for he wrote as much in his will and repeated it to foy i know not when or in what fashion this may come about how can i know but first will i die before i hand it over to the spaniard moreover i cannot since its secret was never told to me  foy and martin have it  lysbeth said dirk sternly i charge you as you love me not to work upon them to betray their trust no not even to save my life or your ownif we must die let us die with honour do you promise  i promise she answered with dry lips but on this condition only that you fly from leyden with us all tonight if maybe  good answered dirk a halfpenny for a herring you have made your promise and ill give you mine thats fair although i am old to seek a new home in england but it cant be tonight wife for i must make arrangements there is a ship sailing today and we might catch her tomorrow at the rivers mouth after she has passed the officers for her captain is a friend of mine how will that do  i had rather it had been tonight said lysbeth while we are in leyden with that man we are not safe from one hour to the next  wife we are never safe it is all in the hands of god and therefore we should live like soldiers awaiting the hour to march and rejoice exceedingly when it pleases our captain to sound the call  i know she answered but oh dirk it would be hardto part  he turned his head aside for a moment then said in a steady voice yes wife but it will be sweet to meet again and part no more    while it was still early that morning dirk summoned foy and martin to his wifes chamber adrian for his own reasons he did not summon making the excuse that he was still asleep and it would be a pity to disturb him nor elsa since as yet there was no necessity to trouble her then briefly for he was given to few words he set out the gist of the matter telling them that the man ramiro whom they had beaten on the haarlemer meer was in leyden which foy knew already for elsa had told him as much and that he was no other than the spaniard named the count juan de montalvo the villain who had deceived lysbeth into a mock marriage by working on her fears and who was the father of adrian all this time lysbeth sat in a carved oak chair listening with a stony face to the tale of her own shame and betrayal she made no sign at all beyond a little twitching of her fingers till foy guessing what she suffered in her heart suddenly went to his mother and kissed her then she wept a few silent tears for an instant laid her hand upon his head as though in blessing and motioning him back to his place became herself againstern unmoved observant  next dirk taking up his tale spoke of his wifes fears and of her belief that there was a plot to wring out of them the secret of hendrik brants treasure  happily he said addressing foy neither your mother nor i nor adrian nor elsa know that secret you and martin know it alone you and perhaps one other who is far away and cannot be caught we do not know it and we do not wish to know it and whatever happens to any of us it is our earnest hope that neither of you will betray it even if our lives or your lives hang upon the words for we hold it better that we should keep our trust with a dead man at all costs than that we should save ourselves by breaking faith is it not so wife  it is so answered lysbeth hoarsely  have no fear said foy we will die before we betray  we will try to die before we betray grumbled martin in his deep voice but flesh is frail and god knows  oh i have no doubt of you honest man said dirk with a smile for you have no mother and father to think of in this matter  then master you are foolish replied martin for i repeat itflesh is frail and i always hated the look of a rack however i have a handsome legacy charged upon this treasure and perhaps the thought of that would support me alive or dead i should not like to think of my money being spent by any spaniard  while martin spoke the strangeness of the thing came home to foy here were four of them two of whom knew a secret and two who did not while those who did not implored those who did to impart to them nothing of the knowledge which if they had it might serve to save them from a fearful doom then for the first time in his young and inexperienced life he understood how great erring men and women can be and what patient majesty dwells in the human heart that for the sake of a trust it does not seek can yet defy the most hideous terrors of the body and the soul indeed that scene stamped itself upon his mind in such fashion that throughout his long existence he never quite forgot it for a single day his mother clad in her frilled white cap and grey gown seated coldfaced and resolute in the oaken chair his father to whom although he knew it not he was now speaking for the last time standing by her his hand resting upon her shoulder and addressing them in his quiet honest voice martin standing also but a little to one side and behind the light of the morning playing upon his great red beard his round pale eyes glittering as was their fashion when wrathful and himself foy leaning forward to listen every nerve in his body strung tight with excitement love and fear  oh he never forgot it which is not strange for so great was the strain upon him so well did he know that this scene was but the prelude to terrible events that for a moment only for a moment his steady reason was shaken and he saw a vision martin the huge patient oxlike martin was changed into a red vengeance he saw him great sword aloft he heard the roar of his battle cry and lo before him men went down to death and about him the floor seemed purple with their blood his father and his mother too they were no longer human they were saintssee the glory which shone over them and look too the dead hendrik brant was whispering in their ears and he foy he was beside martin playing his part in those red frays as best he might and playing it not in vain  then all passed and a wave of peace rolled over him a great sense of duty done of honour satisfied of reward attained lo the play was finished and its ultimate meaning clear but before he could read and understandit had gone  he gasped and shook himself gripping his hands together  what have you seen son asked lysbeth watching his face  strange things mother foy answered a vision of war for martin and me of glory for my father and you and of eternal peace for us all  it is a good omen foy she said fight your fight and leave us to fight ours through much tribulation we must enter into the kingdom of god where at last there is a rest remaining for us all it is a good omen your father was right and i was wrong now i have no more to fear i am satisfied  none of them seemed to be amazed or to find these words wonderful and out of the common for them the hand of approaching doom had opened the gates of distance and they knew everyone that through these some light had broken on their souls a faint flicker of dawn from beyond the clouds they accepted it in thankfulness  i think that is all i have to say said dirk in his usual voice no it is not all and he told them of his plan for flight they listened and agreed to it yet to them it seemed a thing far off and unreal none of them believed that this escape would ever be carried out all of them believed that here in leyden they would endure the fiery trial of their faith and win each of them its separate crown  when everything was discussed and each had learned the lesson of what he must do that day foy asked if adrian was to be told of the scheme to this his father answered hastily that the less it was spoken of the better therefore he proposed to tell adrian late that night only when he could make up his mind whether he would accompany them or stay in leyden  then he shant go out tonight and will come with us as far as the ship only if i can manage it muttered martin beneath his breath but aloud he said nothing somehow it did not seem to him to be worth while to make trouble about it for he knew that if he did his mistress and foy who believed so heartily in adrian would be angry  father and mother said foy again while we are gathered here there is something i wish to say to you  what is it son asked dirk  yesterday i became affianced to elsa brant and we wish to ask your consent and blessing  that will be gladly given son for i think this very good news bring her here foy answered dirk  but although in his hurry foy did not notice it his mother said nothing she liked elsa well indeedwho would notbut oh this brought them a step nearer to that accursed treasure the treasure which from generation to generation had been hoarded up that it might be a doom to men if foy were affianced to elsa it was his inheritance as well as hers for those trusts of hendrik brants will were to lysbeth things unreal and visionary and its curse would fall upon him as well as upon her moreover it might be said that he was marrying her to win the wealth  this betrothal does not please you you are sad wife said dirk looking at her quickly  yes husband for now i think that we shall never get out of leyden i pray that adrian may not hear of it that is all  why what has he to do with the matter  only that he is madly in love with the girl have you not seen it andyou know his temper  adrian adrian always adrian answered dirk impatiently well it is a very fitting match for if she has a great fortune hidden somewhere in a swamp which in fact she has not since the bulk of it is bequeathed to me to be used for certain purposes he has or will have moneys alsosafe at interest in england hark here they come so wife put on a pleasant face they will think it unlucky if you do not smile  as he spoke foy reentered the room leading elsa by the hand and she looked as sweet a maid as ever the sun shone on so they told their story and kneeling down before dirk received his blessing in the old fashion and very glad were they in the after years to remember that it had been so received then they turned to lysbeth and she also lifted up her hand to bless them but ere it touched their heads do what she would to check it a cry forced its way to her lips and she said  oh children doubtless you love each other well but is this a time for marrying and giving in marriage  my own words my very words exclaimed elsa springing to her feet and turning pale  foy looked vexed then recovering himself and trying to smile he said  and i give them the same answerthat two are better than one moreover this is a betrothal not a marriage  ay muttered martin behind thinking aloud after his fashion betrothal is one thing and marriage another but low as he spoke elsa overheard him  your mother is upset broke in dirk and you can guess why so do not disturb her more at present let us to our business you and martin to the factory to make arrangements there as i have told you and i after i have seen the captain to whatever god shall call me to do so till we meet again farewell my sonand daughter he added smiling at elsa  they left the room but as martin was following them lysbeth called him back  go armed to the factory martin she said and see that your young master wears that steel shirt beneath his jerkin  martin nodded and went    adrian woke up that morning in an ill mood he had it is true administered his love potion with singular dexterity and success but as yet he reaped no fruit from his labours and was desperately afraid lest the effect of the magic draught might wear off when he came downstairs it was to find that foy and martin were already departed to the factory and that his stepfather had gone out whither he knew not this was so much to the good for it left the coast clear still he was none the better off since either his mother and elsa had taken their breakfast upstairs or they had dispensed with that meal his mother he could spare especially after her recent contact with a plague patient but under the circumstances elsas absence was annoying moreover suddenly the house had become uncomfortable for every one in it seemed to be running about carrying articles hither and thither in a fashion so aimless that it struck him as little short of insane once or twice also he saw elsa but she too was carrying things and had no time for conversation  at length adrian wearied of it and departed to the factory with the view of making up his books which to tell the truth had been somewhat neglected of late to find that here too the same confusion reigned instead of attending to his ordinary work martin was marching to and fro bearing choice pieces of brassware which were being packed into crates and he noticed for adrian was an observant young man that he was not wearing his usual artisans dress why he wondered to himself should martin walk about a factory upon a summers day clad in his armour of quilted bulls hide and wearing his great sword silence strapped round his middle why too should foy have removed the books and be engaged in going through them with a clerk was he auditing them if so he wished him joy of the job since to bring them to a satisfactory balance had proved recently quite beyond his own powers not that there was anything wrong with the books for he adrian had kept them quite honestly according to his very imperfect lights only things must have been left out for balance they would not well on the whole he was glad since a man filled with lovers hopes and fears was in no mood for arithmetical exercises so after hanging about for a while he returned home to dinner  the meal was late an unusual occurrence which annoyed him moreover neither his mother nor his stepfather appeared at table at length elsa came in looking pale and worried and they began to eat or rather to go through the form of eating since neither of them seemed to have any appetite nor as the servant was continually in the room and as elsa took her place at one end of the long table while he was at the other had their teteatete any of the usual advantages  at last the waitingwoman went away and after a few moments pause elsa rose to follow by this time adrian was desperate he would bear it no more things must be brought to a head  elsa he said in an irritated voice everything seems to be very uncomfortable here today there is so much disturbance in the house that one might imagine we were going to shut it up and leave leyden  elsa looked at him out of the corners of her eyes probably by this time she had learnt the real cause of the disturbance  i am sorry heer adrian she said but your mother is not very well this morning  indeed i only hope she hasnt caught the plague from the jansen woman but that doesnt account for everybody running about with their hands full like ants in a broken nest especially as it is not the time of year when women turn all the furniture upside down and throw the curtains out of the windows in the pretence that they are cleaning them however we are quiet here for a while so let us talk  elsa became suspicious your mother wants me heer adrian she said turning towards the door  let her rest elsa let her rest there is no medicine like sleep for the sick  elsa pretended not to hear him so as she still headed for the door by a movement too active to be dignified he placed himself in front of it adding i have said that i want to speak with you  and i have said that i am busy heer adrian so please let me pass  adrian remained immovable not until i have spoken to you he said  now as escape was impossible elsa drew herself up and asked in a cold voice  what is your pleasure i pray you be brief  adrian cleared his throat reflecting that she was keeping the workings of the love potion under wonderful control indeed to look at her no one could have guessed that she had recently absorbed this magic eastern medicine however something must be done he had gone too far to draw back  elsa he said boldly though no hare could have been more frightened elsa and he clasped his hands and looked at the ceiling i love you and the time has come to say so  if i remember right it came some time ago heer adrian she replied with sarcasm i thought that by now you had forgotten all about it  forgotten he sighed forgotten with you ever before my eyes how can i forget  i am sure i cannot say she answered but i know that i wish to forget this folly  folly she calls it folly he mused aloud oh heaven folly is the name she gives to the lifelong adoration of my bleeding heart  you have known me exactly five weeks heer adrian  which sweet lady makes me desire to know you for fifty years  elsa sighed for she found the prospect dreary  come he went on with a gush forego this virgin coyness you have done enough and more than enough for honour now throw aside pretence lay down your arms and yield no hour i swear of this long fight will be so happy to you as that of your sweet surrender for remember dear one that i your conqueror am in truth the conquered i abandoning  he got no further for at this point the sorely tried elsa lost control of herself but not in the fashion which he hoped for and expected  are you crazed heer adrian she asked that you should insist thus in pouring this highflown nonsense into my ears when i have told you that it is unwelcome to me i understand that you ask me for my love well once for all i tell you that i have none to give  this was a blow since it was impossible for adrian to put a favourable construction upon language so painfully straightforward his selfconceit was pierced at last and collapsed like a pricked bladder  none to give he gasped none to give you dont mean to tell me that you have given it to anybody else  yes i do she answered for by now elsa was thoroughly angry  indeed he replied loftily let me see last time it was your lamented father who occupied your heart perhaps now it is that excellent giant martin or evenno it is too absurdand he laughed in his jealous rage even the family buffoon my worthy brother foy  yes she replied quietly it is foy  foy foy hear her ye gods my successful rival mine is the yellowheaded muddybrained unlettered foyand they say that women have souls of your courtesy answer me one question tell me when did this strange and monstrous thing happen when did you declare yourself vanquished by the surpassing charms of foy  yesterday afternoon if you want to know she said in the same calm and ominous voice  adrian heard and an inspiration took him he dashed his hand to his brow and thought a moment then he laughed loud and shrilly  i have it he said it is the love charm which has worked perversely elsa you are under a spell poor woman you do not know the truth i gave you the philtre in your drinking water and foy the traitor foy has reaped its fruits dear girl shake yourself free from this delusion it is i whom you really love not that base thief of hearts my brother foy  what do you say you gave me a philtre you dare to doctor my drink with your heathen nastiness out of the way sir stand off and never venture to speak to me again well will it be for you if i do not tell your brother of your infamy  what happened after this adrian could never quite remember but a vision remained of himself crouching to one side and of a door flung back so violently that it threw him against the wall a vision too of a lady sweeping past him with blazing eyes and lips set in scorn that was all  for a while he was crushed quite crushed the blow had gone home adrian was not only a fool he was also the vainest of fools that any young woman on whom he chose to smile should actually reject his advances was bad and unexpected but that the other man should be foyoh this was infamous and inexplicable he was handsomer than foy no one would dream of denying it he was cleverer and better read had he not mastered the contents of every known romancehighsouled works which foy bluntly declared were rubbish and refused even to open was he not a poet but remembering a certain sonnet he did not follow this comparison in short how was it conceivable that a woman looking upon himself a very type of the chivalry of spain silvertongued a followernay a companion of the muses one to whom in every previous adventure of the heart to love had been to conquer could still prefer that broadfaced painfully commonplace if worthy young representative of the dutch middle classes foy van goorl  it never occurred to adrian to ask himself another question namely how it comes about that eight young women out of ten are endowed with an intelligence or instinct sufficiently keen to enable them to discriminate between an emptyheaded popinjay of a man intoxicated with the fumes of his own vanity and an honest young fellow of stable character and sterling worth not that adrian was altogether emptyheaded for in some ways he was clever also beneath all this foam and froth the dutch strain inherited from his mother had given a certain ballast and determination to his nature thus when his heart was thoroughly set upon a thing he could be very dogged and patient now it was set upon elsa brant he did truly desire to win her above any other woman and that he had left a different impression upon her mind was owing largely to the affected air and grandiloquent style of language culled from his precious romances which he thought it right to assume when addressing a lady upon matters of the affections  for a little while he was prostrate his heart seemed swept clean of all hope and feeling then his furious temper the failing that above every other was his curse and bane came to his aid and occupied it like the seven devils of scripture bringing in its train his reawakened vanity hatred jealousy and other maddening passions it could not be true there must be an explanation and of course the explanation was that foy had been so fortunate or so cunning as to make advances to elsa soon after she had swallowed the love philtre adrian like most people in his day was very superstitious and credulous it never even occurred to him to doubt the almost universally accepted power and efficacy of this witchs medicine though even now he understood what a fool he was when in his first outburst of rage he told elsa that he had trusted to such means to win her affections instead of letting his own virtues and graces do their natural work  well the mischief was done the poison was swallowed butmost poisons have their antidotes why was he lingering here he must consult his friend the master and at once  ten minutes later adrian was at black megs house    chapter xix  the fray in the shot tower  the door was opened by hague simon the baldheaded greatpaunched villain who lived with black meg in answer to his visitors anxious inquiries the butcher said searching adrians face with his piglike eyes the while that he could not tell for certain whether meg was or was not at home he rather thought that she was consulting the spirits with the master but they might have passed out without his knowing it for they had great giftsgreat gifts and he wagged his fat head as he showed adrian into the accustomed room  it was an uncomfortable kind of chamber which in some unexplained way always gave adrian the impression that people or presences were stirring in it whom he could not see also in this place there happened odd and unaccountable noises creakings and sighings which seemed to proceed from the walls and ceiling of course such things were to be expected in a house where sojourned one of the great magicians of the day still he was not altogether sorry when the door opened and black meg entered although some might have preferred the society of almost any ghost  what is it that you disturb me at such an hour she asked sharply  what is it what isnt it adrian replied his rage rising at the thought of his injuries that cursed philtre of yours has worked all wrong thats what it is another man has got the benefit of it dont you understand you old hag and by heaven i believe he means to abduct her yes thats the meaning of all the packing and fuss blind fool that i was not to guess it before the masteri will see the master he must give me an antidote another medicine  you certainly look as though you want it interrupted black meg drily well i doubt whether you can see him it is not his hour for receiving visitors moreover i dont think hes here so i shall have to signal for him  i must see him i will see him shouted adrian  i daresay replied black meg squinting significantly at his pocket  enraged as he was adrian took the hint  woman you seek gold he said quoting involuntarily from the last romance he had read and presenting her with a handful of small silver which was all he had  meg took the silver with a sniff on the principle that something is better than nothing and departed gloomily then followed more mysterious noises voices whispered doors opened and shut furniture creaked after which came a period of exasperating and rather disagreeable silence adrian turned his face to the wall for the only window in the room was so far above his head that he was unable to look out of it indeed it was more of a skylight than a window thus he remained a while gnawing at the ends of his moustache and cursing his fortune till presently he felt a hand upon his shoulder  who the devil is that he exclaimed wheeling round to find himself face to face with the draped and majestic form of the master  the devil that is an ill word upon young lips my friend said the sage shaking his head in reproof  i daresay replied adrian but what thei mean how did you get here i never heard the door open  how did i get here well now you mention it i wonder how i did the doorwhat have i to do with doors  i am sure i dont know answered adrian shortly but most people find them useful  enough of such material talk interrupted the sage with sternness your spirit cried to mine and i am here let that suffice  i suppose that black meg fetched you went on adrian sticking to his point for the philtre fiasco had made him suspicious  verily friend adrian you can suppose what you will and now as i have little time to spare be so good as to set out the matter nay what need i know all for have i notis this the case you administered the philtre to the maid and neglected my instructions to offer yourself to her at once another saw it and took advantage of the magic draught while the spell was on her he proposed he was acceptedyes your brother foy oh fool careless fool what else did you expect  at any rate i didnt expect that replied adrian in a fury and now if you have all the power you pretend tell me what i am to do  something glinted ominously beneath the hood it was the sages one eye  young friend he said your manner is brusque yes even rude but i understand and i forgive come we will take counsel together tell me what has happened  adrian told him with much emphasis and the recital of his adventures seemed to move the master deeply at any rate he turned away hiding his face in his hands while his back trembled with the intensity of his feelings  the matter is grave he said solemnly when at length the lovesick and angry swain had finished there is but one thing to be done your treacherous rivaloh what fraud and deceit are hidden beneath that homely countenancehas been well advised by whom i know not though i suspect one a certain practitioner of the black magic named arentz  ah ejaculated adrian  i see you know the man beware of him he is indeed a wolf in sheeps clothing who wraps his devilish incantations in a cloak of seditious doctrine well i have thwarted him before for can darkness stand before light and by the help of those who aid me i may thwart him again now attend and answer my questions clearly slowly and truthfully if the girl is to be saved to you mark this young friend your cunning rival must be removed from leyden for a while until the charm works out its power  you dont mean said adrian and stopped  no no i mean the man no harm i mean only that he must take a journey which he will do fast enough when he learns that his witchcrafts and other crimes are known now answer or make an end for i have more business to attend to than the lovemakings of a fooof a headstrong youth first what you have told me of the attendances of dirk van goorl your stepfather and others of his household namely red martin and your halfbrother foy at the tabernacle of your enemy the wizard arentz is true is it not  yes answered adrian but i do not see what that has to do with the matter  silence thundered the master then he paused a while and adrian seemed to hear certain strange squeakings proceeding from the walls the sage remained lost in thought until the squeakings ceased again he spoke  what you have told me of the part played by the said foy and the said martin as to their sailing away with the treasure of the dead heretic hendrik brant and of the murders committed by them in the course of its hiding in the haarlemer meer is true is it not  of course it is answered adrian but  silence again thundered the sage or by my lord zoroaster i throw up the case  adrian collapsed and there was another pause  you believe he went on again that the said foy and the said dirk van goorl together with the said martin are making preparations to abduct that innocent and unhappy maid the heiress elsa brant for evil purposes of their own  i never told you so said adrian but i think it is a fact at least there is a lot of packing going on  you never told me do you not understand that there is no need for you to tell me anything  then in the name of your lord zoroaster why do you ask exclaimed the exasperated adrian  that you will know presently he answered musing  once more adrian heard the strange squeaking as of young and hungry rats  i think that i will not take up your time any more he said growing thoroughly alarmed for really the proceedings were a little odd and he rose to go  the master made no answer only which was curious conduct for a sage he began to whistle a tune  by your leave said adrian for the magicians back was against the door i have business  and so have i replied the sage and went on whistling  then suddenly the side of one of the walls seemed to fall out and through the opening emerged a man wrapped in a priests robe and after him hague simon black meg and another particularly evillooking fellow  got it all down asked the master in an easy everyday kind of voice  the monk bowed and producing several folios of manuscript laid them on the table together with an inkhorn and a pen  very well and now my young friend be so good as to sign there at the foot of the writing  sign what gasped adrian  explain to him said the master he is quite right a man should know what he puts his name to  then a monk spoke in a low businesslike voice  this is the information of adrian called van goorl as taken down from his own lips wherein among other things he deposes to certain crimes of heresy murder of the kings subjects an attempted escape from the kings dominions committed by his stepfather dirk van goorl his halfbrother foy van goorl and their servant a frisian known as red martin shall i read the papers it will take some time  if the witness so desires said the master  what is that document for whispered adrian in a hoarse voice  to persuade your treacherous rival foy van goorl that it will be desirable in the interests of his health that he should retire from leyden for a while sneered his late mentor while the butcher and black meg sniggered audibly only the monk stood silent like a black watching fate  ill not sign shouted adrian i have been tricked there is treachery and he bent forward to spring for the door  ramiro made a sign and in another instant the butchers fat hands were about adrians throat and his thick thumbs were digging viciously at the victims windpipe still adrian kicked and struggled whereon at a second sign the villainouslooking man drew a great knife and coming up to him pricked him gently on the nose  then ramiro spoke to him very suavely and quietly  young friend he said where is that faith in me which you promised and why when i wish you to sign this quite harmless writing do you so violently refuse  because i wont betray my stepfather and brother gasped adrian i know why you want my signature and he looked at the man in a priests robe  you wont betray them sneered ramiro why you young fool you have already betrayed them fifty times over and what is more which you dont seem to remember you have betrayed yourself now look here if you choose to sign that paper or if you dont choose makes little difference to me for dear pupil i would almost as soon have your evidence by word of mouth  i may be a fool said adrian turning sullen yes i see now that i have been a fool to trust in you and your sham arts but i am not fool enough to give evidence against my own people in any of your courts what i have said i said never thinking that it would do them harm  not caring whether it would do them harm or no corrected ramiro as you had your own object to gainthe young lady whom by the way you were quite ready to doctor with a love medicine  because love blinded me said adrian loftily  ramiro put his hand upon his shoulder and shook him slightly as he answered  and has it not struck you you vain puppy that other things may blind you alsohot irons for instance  what do you mean gasped adrian  i mean that the rack is a wonderful persuader oh it makes the most silent talk and the most solemn sing now take your choice will you sign or will you go to the torture chamber  what right have you to question me asked adrian striving to build up his tottering courage with bold words  just this rightthat i to whom you speak am the captain and governor of the gevangenhuis in this town an official who has certain powers  adrian turned pale but said nothing  our young friend has gone to sleep remarked ramiro reflectively here you simon twist his arm a little no not the right arm he may want that to sign with which will be awkward if it is out of joint the other  with an ugly grin the butcher taking his fingers from adrians throat gripped his captives left wrist and very slowly and deliberately began to screw it round  adrian groaned  painful isnt it said ramiro well i have no more time to waste break his arm  then adrian gave in for he was not fitted to bear torture his imagination was too lively  i will sign he whispered the perspiration pouring from his pale face  are you quite sure you do it willingly queried his tormentor adding another little halfturn please simon and you mistress meg if he begins to faint just prick him in the thigh with your knife  yes yes groaned adrian  very good now here is the pen sign  so adrian signed  i congratulate you upon your discretion pupil remarked ramiro as he scattered sand on the writing and pocketed the paper today you have learned a very useful lesson which life teaches to most of us namely that the inevitable must rule our little fancies let us see i think that by now the soldiers will have executed their task so as you have done what i wished you can go for i shall know where to find you if i want you but if you will take my advice which i offer as that of one friend to another you will hold your tongue about the events of this afternoon unless you speak of it nobody need ever know that you have furnished certain useful information for in the gevangenhuis the names of witnesses are not mentioned to the accused otherwise you may possibly come into trouble with your heretical friends and relatives good afternoon brother be so good as to open the door for this gentleman  a minute later adrian found himself in the street towards which he had been helped by the kick of a heavy boot his first impulse was to run and he ran for half a mile or more without stopping till at length he paused breathless in a deserted street and leaning against the wheel of an unharnessed waggon tried to think think how could he think his mind was one mad whirl rage shame disappointed passion all boiled in it like bones in a knackers cauldron he had been fooled he had lost his love and oh infamy he had betrayed his kindred to the hell of the inquisition they would be tortured and burnt yes even his mother and elsa might be burned since those devils respected neither age nor sex and their blood would be upon his head it was true that he had signed under compulsion but who would believe that for had they not taken down his talk word for word for once adrian saw himself as he was the cloaks of vanity and selflove were stripped from his soul and he knew what others would think when they came to learn the story he thought of suicide there was water here was steel the deed would not be difficult no he could not it was too horrible moreover how dared he enter the other world so unprepared so steeped in every sort of evil what then could he do to save his character and those whom his folly had betrayed he looked round him there not three hundred yards away rose the tall chimney of the factory perhaps there was yet time perhaps he could still warn foy and martin of the fate which awaited them  acting on the impulse of the moment adrian started forward running like a hare as he approached the building he saw that the workmen had left for the big doors were shut he raced round to the small entrance it was openhe was through it and figures were moving in the office god be praised they were foy and martin to them he sped a whitefaced creature with gaping mouth and staring eyes to look at more like a ghost than a human being  martin and foy saw him and shrank back could this be adrian they thought or was it an evil vision  fly he gasped hide yourselves the officers of the inquisition are after you then another thought struck him and he stammered my father and mother i must warn them and before they could speak he had turned and was gone as he went crying fly fly  foy stood astonished till martin struck him on the shoulder and said roughly  come let us get out of this either he is mad or he knows something have you your sword and dagger quick then  they passed through the door which martin paused to lock and into the courtyard foy reached the gate first and looked through its open bars then very deliberately he shot the bolts and turned the great key  are you brainsick asked martin that you lock the gate on us  i think not replied foy as he came back to him it is too late to escape soldiers are marching down the street  martin ran and looked through the bars it was true enough there they came fifty men or more a whole company headed straight for the factory which it was thought might be garrisoned for defence  now i can see no help but to fight for it martin said cheerfully as he hid the keys in the bucket of the well which he let run down to the water  what can two men do against fifty asked foy lifting his steellined cap to scratch his head  not much still with good luck something at least as nothing but a cat can climb the walls and the gateway is stopped i think we may as well die fighting as in the torturechamber of the gevangenhuis for that is where they mean to lodge us  i think so too answered foy taking courage now how can we hurt them most before they quiet us  martin looked round reflectively in the centre of the courtyard stood a building not unlike a pigeonhouse or the shelter that is sometimes set up in the middle of a market beneath which merchants gather in fact it was a shot tower where leaden bullets of different sizes were cast and dropped through an opening in the floor into a shallow tank below to cool for this was part of the trade of the foundry  that would be a good place to hold he said and crossbows hang upon the walls  foy nodded and they ran to the tower but not without being seen for as they set foot upon its stair the officer in command of the soldiers called upon them to surrender in the name of the king they made no answer and as they passed through the doorway a bullet from an arquebus struck its woodwork  the shot tower stood upon oaken piles and the chamber above which was round and about twenty feet in diameter was reached by a broad ladder of fifteen steps such as is often used in stables this ladder ended in a little landing of about six feet square and to the left of the landing opened the door of the chamber where the shot were cast they went up into the place  what shall we do now said foy barricade the door  i can see no use in that answered martin for then they would batter it down or perhaps burn a way through it no let us take it off its hinges and lay it on blocks about eight inches high so that they may catch their shins against it when they try to rush us  a good notion said foy and they lifted off the narrow oaken door and propped it up on four moulds of metal across the threshold weighting it with other moulds also they strewed the floor of the landing with threepound shot so that men in a hurry might step on them and fall another thing they did and this was foys notion at the end of the chamber were the iron baths in which the lead was melted and beneath them furnaces ready laid for the next days founding these foy set alight pulling out the dampers to make them burn quickly and so melt the leaden bars which lay in the troughs  they may come underneath he said pointing to the trap through which the hot shot were dropped into the tank and then molten lead will be useful  martin smiled and nodded then he took down a crossbow from the walls for in those days when every dwelling and warehouse might have to be used as a place of defence it was common to keep a good store of weapons hung somewhere ready to hand and went to the narrow window which overlooked the gate  as i thought he said they cant get in and dont like the look of the iron spikes so they are fetching a smith to burst it open we must wait  very soon foy began to fidget for this waiting to be butchered by an overwhelming force told upon his nerves he thought of elsa and his parents whom he would never see again he thought of death and all the terrors and wonders that might lie beyond it death whose depths he must so soon explore he had looked to his crossbow had tested the string and laid a good store of quarrels on the floor beside him he had taken a pike from the walls and seen to its shaft and point he had stirred the fires beneath the leaden bars till they roared in the sharp draught  is there nothing more to do he asked  yes replied martin we might say our prayers they will be the last and suiting his action to the word the great man knelt down an example which foy followed  do you speak said foy i cant think of anything  so martin began a prayer which is perhaps worthy of record  o lord he said forgive me all my sins which are too many to count or at least i havent the time to try and especially for cutting off the head of the executioner with his own sword although i had no death quarrel with him and for killing a spaniard in a boxing match o lord i thank you very much because you have arranged for us to die fighting instead of being tortured and burnt in the gaol and i pray that we may be able to kill enough spaniards first to make them remember us for years to come o lord protect my dear master and mistress and let the former learn that we have made an end of which he would approve but if may be hide it from the paster arentz who might think that we ought to surrender that is all i have to say amen  then foy did his own praying and it was hearty enough but we need scarcely stop to set down its substance  meanwhile the spaniards had found a blacksmith who was getting to work upon the gate for they could see him through the open upper bars  why dont you shoot asked foy you might catch him with a bolt  because he is a poor dutchman whom they have pressed for the job while they stand upon one side we must wait till they break down the gate also we must fight well when the time comes master foy for see folk are watching us and they will expect it and he pointed upwards  foy looked the foundry courtyard was surrounded by tall gabled houses and of these the windows and balconies were already crowded with spectators word had gone round that the inquisition had sent soldiers to seize one of the young van goorls and red martinthat they were battering at the gates of the factory therefore the citizens some of them their own workmen gathered there for they did not think that red martin and foy van goorl would be taken easily  the hammering at the gate went on but it was very stout and would not give  martin said foy presently i am frightened i feel quite sick i know that i shall be no good to you when the pinch comes  now i am sure that you are a brave man answered martin with a short laugh for otherwise you would never have owned that you feel afraid of course you feel afraid and so do i it is the waiting that does it but when once the first blow has been struck why you will be as happy as a priest look you master so soon as they begin to rush the ladder do you get behind me close behind for i shall want all the room to sweep with my sword and if we stand side by side we shall only hinder each other while with a pike you can thrust past me and be ready to deal with any who win through  you mean that you want to shelter me with your big carcase answered foy but you are captain here at least i will do my best and putting his arms about the great mans middle he hugged him affectionately  look look cried martin the gate is down now first shot to you and he stepped to one side  as he spoke the oaken doors burst open and the spanish soldiers began to stream through them suddenly foys nerve returned to him and he grew steady as a rock lifting his crossbow he aimed and pulled the trigger the string twanged the quarrel rushed forth with a whistling sound and the first soldier pierced through breastplate and through breast sprang into the air and fell forward foy stepped to one side to string his bow  good shot said martin taking his place while from the spectators in the windows went up a sudden shout martin fired and another man fell then foy fired again and missed but martins next bolt struck the last soldier through the arm and pinned him to the timber of the broken gate after this they could shoot no more for the spaniards were beneath them  to the doorway said martin and remember what i told you away with the bows cold steel must do the rest  now they stood by the open door martin a helmet from the walls upon his head tied beneath his chin with a piece of rope because it was too small for him the great sword silence lifted ready to strike and foy behind gripping the long pike with both hands below them from the gathered mob of soldiers came a confused clamour then a voice called out an order and they heard footsteps on the stair  look out they are coming said martin turning his head so that foy caught sight of his face it was transfigured it was terrible the great red beard seemed to bristle the pale blue unshaded eyes rolled and glittered they glittered like the blue steel of the sword silence that wavered above them in that dread instant of expectancy foy remembered his vision of the morning lo it was fulfilled for before him stood martin the peaceful patient giant transformed into a red vengeance  a man reached the head of the ladder stepped upon one of the loose cannonballs and fell with an oath and a crash but behind him came others suddenly they turned the corner suddenly they burst into view three or four of them together gallantly they rushed on the first of them caught his feet in the trap of the door and fell headlong across it of him martin took no heed but foy did for before ever the soldier could rise he had driven his pike down between the mans shoulders so that he died there upon the door at the next martin struck and foy saw this one suddenly grow small and double up which if he had found leisure to examine the nature of that wound would have surprised him very little another man followed so quickly that martin could not lift the sword to meet him but he pointed with it and next instant was shaking his carcase off its blade  after this foy could keep no count martin slashed with the sword and when he found a chance foy thrust with the pike till at length there were none to thrust at for this was more than the spaniards had bargained two of them lay dead in the doorway and others had been dragged or had tumbled down the ladder while from the onlookers at the windows without as they caught sight of them being brought forth slain or sorely wounded went up shout upon shout of joy  so far we have done very well said martin quietly but if they come up again we must be cooler and not waste our strength so much had i not struck so hard i might have killed another man  but the spaniards showed no sign of coming up any more they had seen enough of that narrow way and of the red swordsman who awaited them in the doorway round the corner indeed it was a bad place for attackers since they could not shoot with arquebuses or arrows but must pass in to be slaughtered like sheep at the shambles in the dim room beyond so being cautious men who loved their lives they took a safer counsel  the tank beneath the shottower when it was not in use was closed with a stone cover and around this they piled firewood and peats from a stack in the corner of the yard and standing in the centre out of the reach of arrows set light to it martin lay down watching them through a crack in the floor then he signed to foy and whispered and going to the iron baths foy drew from them two large buckets of molten lead each as much as a man could carry again martin looked through the crack waiting till several of the burners were gathered beneath then with a swift motion he lifted up the trapdoor and as those below stared upwards wondering full into their faces came the buckets of molten lead down went two of them never to speak more while others ran out shrieking and aflame tearing at their hair and garments  after this the spaniards grew more wary and built their fires round the oak piers till the flames eating up them fired the building and the room above grew full of little curling wreaths of smoke  now we must choose said martin whether we will be roasted like fowls in an oven or go down and have our throats cut like pigs in the open  for my part i prefer to die in the air coughed foy  so say i master listen we cant get down the stair for they are watching for us there so we must drop from the trapdoor and charge through the fire then if we are lucky back to back and fight it out  half a minute later two men bearing naked swords in their hands might be seen bursting through the barrier of flaming wood out they came safely enough and there in an open space not far from the gateway halted back to back rubbing the water from their smarting eyes on them a few seconds later like hounds on a wounded boar dashed the mob of soldiers while from every throat of the hundreds who were watching went up shrill cries of encouragement grief and fear men fell before them but others rushed in they were down they were up again once more they were down and this time only one of them rose the great man martin he staggered to his feet shaking off the soldiers who tried to hold him as a dog in the gamepit shakes off rats he was up he stood across the body of his companion and once more that fearful sword was sweeping round bringing death to all it touched they drew back but a soldier old in war creeping behind him suddenly threw a cloak over his head then the end came and slowly very slowly they overmatched his strength and bore him down and bound him while the watching mob groaned and wept with grief    chapter xx  in the gevangenhuis  when adrian left the factory he ran on to the house in the bree straat  oh what has happened said his mother as he burst into the room where she and elsa were at work  they are coming for him he gasped the soldiers from the gevangenhuis where is he let him escape quicklymy stepfather  lysbeth staggered and fell back into her chair  how do you know she asked  at the question adrians head swam and his heart stood still yet his lips found a lie  i overheard it he said the soldiers are attacking foy and martin in the factory and i heard them say that they were coming here for him  elsa moaned aloud then she turned on him like a tiger asking  if so why did you not stay to help them  because he answered with a touch of his old pomposity my first duty was towards my mother and you  he is out of the house broke in lysbeth in a low voice that was dreadful to hear he is out of the house i know not where go son and search for him swift be swift  so adrian went forth not sorry to escape the presence of these tormented women here and there he wandered to one haunt of dirks after another but without success till at length a noise of tumult drew him and he ran towards the sound presently he was round the corner and this was what he saw  advancing down the wide street leading to the gevangenhuis came a body of spanish soldiers and in the centre of them were two figures whom it was easy for adrian to recognisered martin and his brother foy martin although his bullhide jerkin was cut and slashed and his helmet had gone seemed to be little hurt for he was still upright and proud walking along with his arms lashed behind him while a spanish officer held the point of a sword his own sword silence near his throat ready to drive it home should he attempt to escape with foy the case was different at first adrian thought that he was dead for they were carrying him upon a ladder blood fell from his head and legs while his doublet seemed literally to be rent to pieces with swordcuts and daggerthrusts and in truth had it not been for the shirt of mail which he wore beneath he must have been slain several times over but foy was not dead for as adrian watched he saw his head turn upon the ladder and his hand rise up and fall again  but this was not all for behind appeared a cart drawn by a grey horse and in it were the bodies of spanish soldiershow many adrian could not tell but there they lay with their harness still on them after these again in a long and melancholy procession marched other spanish soldiers some of them sorely wounded and like foy carried upon doors or ladders and others limping forward with the help of their comrades no wonder that martin walked proudly to his doom since behind him came the rich harvest of the sword silence also there were other signs to see and hear since about the cavalcade surged and roared a great mob of the citizens of leyden  bravo martin well fought foy van goorl they shouted we are proud of you we are proud of you then from the back of the crowd someone cried rescue them kill the inquisition dogs tear the spaniards to pieces  a stone flew through the air then another and another but at a word of command the soldiers faced about and the mob drew back for they had no leader so it went on till they were within a hundred yards of the gevangenhuis  dont let them be murdered cried the voice a rescue a rescue and with a roar the crowd fell upon the soldiers it was too late for the spaniards trained to arms closed up and fought their way through taking their prisoners with them but they cost them dear for the wounded men and those who supported them were cut off they were cut off they were struck down in a minute they were dead every one of them and although they still held its fortresses and walls from that hour the spaniards lost their grip of leyden nor did they ever win it back again from that hour to this leyden has been free such were the first fruits of the fight of foy and martin against fearful odds  the great doors of oak and iron of the gevangenhuis clashed to behind the prisoners the locks were shot and the bars fell home while outside raved the furious crowd  the place was not large nor very strong merely a drawbridge across the narrow arm of a moat a gateway with a walled courtyard beyond and over it a threestoried house built in the common dutch fashion but with straight barrel windows to the right under the shadow of the archway which space being limited was used as an armoury and hung with weapons lay the courtroom where prisoners were tried and to the left a vaulted place with no window not unlike a large cellar in appearance this was the torturechamber beyond was the courtyard and at the back of it rose the prison in this yard were waiting the new governor of the jail ramiro and with him a little redfaced pigeyed man dressed in a rusty doublet he was the inquisitor of the district especially empowered as delegate of the blood council and under various edicts and laws to try and to butcher heretics  the officer in command of the troops advanced to make his report  what is all that noise asked the inquisitor in a frightened squeaky voice is this city also in rebellion  and where are the rest of you said ramiro scanning the thin files  sir answered the officer saluting the rest of us are dead some were killed by this red rogue and his companion and the mob have the others  then ramiro began to curse and to swear as well he might for he knew that when this story reached headquarters his credit with alva and the blood council would be gone  coward he yelled shaking his fist in the face of the officer coward to lose a score or more of men in taking a brace of heretics  dont blame me sir answered the man sullenly for the word stirred his bile blame the mob and this red devils steel which went through us as though we were wet clay and he handed him the sword silence  it fits the man muttered montalvo for few else could wield such a blade go hang it in the doorway it may be wanted in evidence but to himself he thought bad luck again the luck that follows me whenever i pit myself against lysbeth van hout then he gave an order and the two prisoners were taken away up some narrow stairs  at the top of the first flight was a solid door through which they passed to find themselves in a large and darksome place down the centre of this place ran a passage on either side of the passage dimly lighted by high ironbarred windows were cages built of massive oaken bars and measuring each of them eight or ten feet square very dens such as might have served for wild beasts but filled with human beings charged with offences against the doctrines of the church those who chance to have seen the prison of the inquisition at the hague as it still stands today will know what they were like  into one of these dreadful holes they were thrust foy wounded as he was being thrown roughly upon a heap of dirty straw in the corner then having bolted and locked the door of their den the soldiers left them  as soon as his eyes grew accustomed to the light martin stared about him the conveniences of the dungeon were not many indeed being built above the level of the ground it struck the imagination as even more terrible than any subterranean vault devoted to the same dreadful purpose by good fortune however in one corner of it stood an earthenware basin and a large jug of water  i will take the risk of its being poisoned thought martin to himself as lifting the jug he drank deep of it for what between fighting fire and fury there seemed to be no moisture left in him then his burning thirst satisfied at last he went to where foy lay unconscious and began to pour water little by little into his mouth which senseless as he was he swallowed mechanically and presently groaned a little next as well as he could martin examined his comrades wounds to find that what had made him insensible was a cut upon the right side of the head which had it not been for his steellined cap must certainly have killed him but as it was beyond the shock and bruise seemed in no way serious  his second hurt was a deep wound in the left thigh but being on the outside of the limb although he bled much it had severed no artery other injuries he had also upon the forearms and legs also beneath the chain shirt his body was bruised with the blows of swords and daggers but none of these were dangerous  martin stripped him as tenderly as he might and washed his wounds then he paused for both of them were wearing garments of flannel which is unsuitable for the dressing of hurts  you need linen said a womans voice speaking from the next den wait awhile and i will give you my smock  how can i take your garment lady whoever you may be answered martin to bind about the limbs of a man even if he is wounded  take it and welcome said the unknown in sweet low tones i want it no more they are going to execute me tonight  execute you tonight muttered martin  yes replied the voice in the courtroom or one of the cellars i believe as they dare not do it outside because of the people by beheadingam i not fortunate only by beheading  oh god where art thou groaned martin  dont be sorry for me answered the voice i am very glad there were three of us my father my sister and i andyou can guesswell i wish to join them also it is better to die than to go through what i have suffered again but here is the garment i fear that it is stained about the neck but it will serve if you tear it into strips and a trembling delicate hand which held the linen was thrust between the oaken bars  even in that light however martin saw that the wrist was cut and swollen he saw it and because of that tender merciful hand he registered an oath about priests and spaniards which as it chanced he lived to keep very thoroughly also he paused awhile wondering whether if all this was of any good wondering if it would not be best to let foy die at once or even to kill him  what are you thinking about sir asked the lady on the other side of the bars  i am thinking answered martin that perhaps my young master here would be better dead and that i am a fool to stop the bleeding  no no said the sweet voice do your utmost and leave the rest to god it pleases god that i should die which matters little as i am but a weak girl it may please him that this young man shall live to be of service to his country and his faith i say bind up his wounds good sir  perhaps you are right answered martin who knows theres a key to every lock if only it can be found then he set to work upon foys wounds binding them round with strips of the girls garment dipped in water and when he had done the best he could he clothed him again even to the chain shirt  are you not hurt yourself asked the voice presently  a little nothing to speak of a few cuts and bruises thats all this bulls hide turned their swords  tell me whom you have been fighting she said  so to while away the time while foy still lay senseless martin told her the story of the attack upon the shot tower of how they had driven the spaniards down the ladder of how they had drenched them with molten lead and of their last stand in the courtyard when they were forced from the burning building  oh what a fearful fighttwo against so many said the voice with a ring of admiration in it  yes answered martin it was a good fightthe hottest that ever i was in for myself i dont much care for theyve paid a price for my carcase i didnt tell you did i that the mob set on them as they haled us here and pulled four wounded men and those who carried them to bits oh yes they have paid a price a very good price for a frisian boor and a leyden burgher  god pardon their souls murmured the unknown  thats as he likes said martin and no affair of mine i had only to do with their bodies and at this moment foy groaned sat up and asked for something to drink  martin gave him water from the pitcher  where am i he asked and he told him  martin old fellow said foy in an uncertain voice we are in a very bad way but as we have lived through thishere his characteristic hopefulness asserted itselfi believe i believe that we shall live through the rest  yes young sir echoed the thin faint notes out of the darkness beyond the bars i believe too that you will live through the rest and i am praying that it may be so  who is that asked foy drowsily  another prisoner answered martin  a prisoner who will soon be free murmured the voice again through the blackness for by now night had fallen and no light came from the hole above  then foy fell into sleep or stupor and there was silence for a long while until they heard the bolts and bars of the door of the dungeon creaking and the glint of a lantern appeared floating on the gloom several men tramped down the narrow gangway and one of them unlocking their cage entered filled the jug of water from a leathern jack and threw down some loaves of black bread and pieces of stockfish as food is thrown to dogs having examined the pair of them he grunted and went away little knowing how near he had been to death for the heart of martin was mad but he let him go then the door of the next cell was opened and a man said come out it is time  it is time and i am ready answered the thin voice goodbye friends god be with you  goodbye lady answered martin may you soon be with god then he added by an afterthought what is your name i should like to know  mary she replied and began to sing a hymn and so still singing the hymn she passed away to her death they never saw her face they never learned who she might be this poor girl who was but an item among the countless victims of perhaps the most hideous tyranny that the world has ever knownone of alvas slaughtered sixty thousand but many years afterwards when foy was a rich man in a freer land he built a church and named it marys kirk  the long night wore away in silence broken only by the groans and prayers of prisoners in dens upon the same floor or with the solemn rhythm of hymns sung by those above till at length the light creeping through the dungeon lattices told them that it was morning at its first ray martin awoke much refreshed for even there his health and weariness had brought sleep to him foy also awoke stiff and sore but in his right mind and very hungry then martin found the loaves and the stockfish and they filled themselves washing down the meal with water after which he dressed foys wounds making a poultice for them out of the crumb of the bread and doctored his own bruises as best he could  it must have been ten oclock or later when again the doors were opened and men appeared who commanded that they should follow them  one of us cant walk said martin still perhaps i can manage and lifting foy in his arms as though he had been a baby he passed with the jailers out of the den down the stair and into the courtroom here seated behind a table they found ramiro and the little squeakyvoiced redfaced inquisitor  heaven above us said the inquisitor what a great hairy ruffian it makes me feel nervous to be in the same place with him i beg you governor ramiro instruct your soldiers to be watching and to stab him at the first movement  have no fear noble sir answered ramiro the villain is quite unarmed  i daresay i daresay but let us get on now what is the charge against these people ah i see heresy like the last upon the evidence ofoh well never mind well we will take that as proved and of course it is enough but what more ah here it is escaped from the hague with the goods of a heretic killed sundry of his majestys lieges blew up others on the haarlemer meer and yesterday as we know for ourselves committed a whole series of murders in resisting lawful arrest prisoners have you anything to say  plenty answered foy  then save your trouble and my time since nothing can excuse your godless rebellious and damnable behaviour friend governor into your hands i deliver them and may god have mercy on their souls see by the way that you have a priest at hand to shrive them at last if they will be shriven just for the sake of charity but all the other details i leave to you torment oh of course if you think there is anything to be gained by it or that it will purify their souls and now i will be going on to haarlem for i tell you frankly friend governor that i dont think this town of leyden safe for an honest officer of the law there are too many bad characters here schismatics and resisters of authority what the warrant not ready well i will sign it in blank you can fill it in there god forgive you heretics may your souls find peace which is more i fear than your bodies will for the next few hours bah friend governor i wish that you had not made me assist at the execution of that girl last night especially as i understand she leaves no property worth having her white face haunts my mind i cant be rid of the look of those great eyes oh these heretics to what sorrow do they put us orthodox people farewell friend governor yes i think i will go out by the back way some of those turbulent citizens might be waiting in front farewell and temper justice with mercy if you can and he was gone  presently ramiro who had accompanied him to the gate returned seating himself on the further side of the table he drew his rapier and laid it before him then having first commanded them to bring a chair in which foy might sit since he could not stand because of his wounded leg he told the guard to fall back out of hearing but to be ready should he need them  not much dignity about that fellow he said addressing martin and foy in a cheerful voice quite different from the kind of thing you expected i daresay no hooded dominican priests no clerks taking notes no solemnities nothing but a little redfaced wretch perspiring with terror lest the mob outside should catch him as for my part i hope they may well gentlemen what can you expect seeing that to my knowledge the man is a bankrupt tailor of antwerp however it is the substance we have to deal with not the shadow and thats real enough for his signature on a death warrant is as good as that of the pope or his gracious majesty king philip or for the matter of that of alva himself therefore you aredead men  as you would have been had i not been fool enough to neglect martins advice out in the haarlemer meer and let you escape answered foy  precisely my young friend but you see my guardian angel was too many for you and you did neglect that excellent counsel but as it happens it is just about the haarlemer meer that i want to have a word with you  foy and martin looked at each other for now they understood exactly why they were there and ramiro watching them out of the corners of his eyes went on in a low voice  let us drop this and come to business you hid it and you know where it is and i am in need of a competence for my old age now i am not a cruel man i wish to put no one to pain or death moreover i tell you frankly i admire both of you very much the escape with the treasure on board of your boat swallow and the blowing up were both exceedingly well managed with but one mistake which you young sir have pointed out and he bowed and smiled the fight that you made yesterday too was splendid and i have entered the details of it in my own private diary because they ought not to be forgotten  now it was foys turn to bow while even on martins grim and impassive countenance flickered a faint smile  naturally went on ramiro i wish to save such men i wish you to go hence quite free and unharmed and he paused  how can we after we have been condemned to death asked foy  well it does not seem so difficult my friend the tailori mean the inquisitorwho for all his soft words is a cruel man indeed was in a hurry to be gone andhe signed a blank warrant always an incautious thing to do well a judge can acquit as well as condemn and this oneis no exception what is there to prevent me filling this paper in with an order for your release  and what is there to show us that you would release us after all asked foy  upon the honour of a gentleman answered ramiro laying his hand on his heart tell me what i want to know give me a week to make certain necessary arrangements and so soon as i am back you shall both of you be freed  doubtless said foy angrily upon such honour as gentlemen learn in the galleys senor ramiroi beg your pardon count juan de montalvo  ramiros face grew crimson to the hair  sir he said were i a different sort of man for those words you should die in a fashion from which even the boldest might shrink but you are young and inexperienced so i will overlook them now this bargaining must come to a head which will you have life and safety or the chancewhich under the circumstances is no chance at allthat one day not you of course but somebody interested in it may recover a hoard of money and jewels  then martin spoke for the first time very slowly and respectfully  worshipful sir he said we cannot tell you where the money is because we do not know to be frank with you nobody ever knew except myself i took the stuff and sank it in the water in a narrow channel between two islands and i made a little drawing of them on a piece of paper  exactly my good friend and where is that piece of paper  alas sir when i was lighting the fuses on board the swallow i let it fall in my haste and it isin exactly the same place as are all your worships worthy comrades who were on board that ship i believe however that if you will put yourself under my guidance i could show your excellency the spot and this as i do not want to be killed i should be most happy to do  good simple man said ramiro with a little laugh how charming is the prospect that you paint of a midnight row with you upon those lonely waters the tarantula and the butterfly arm in arm mynheer van goorl what have you to say  only that the story told by martin here is true i do not know where the money is as i was not present at its sinking and the paper has been lost  indeed i am afraid then that it will be necessary for me to refresh your memory but first i have one more argument or rather two has it struck you that another life may hang upon your answer as a rule men are loth to send their fathers to death  foy heard and terrible as was the hint yet it came to him as a relief for he had feared lest he was about to say your mother or elsa brant  that is my first argument a good one i think but i haveanother which may appeal even more forcibly to a young man and prospective heir the day before yesterday you became engaged to elsa brantdont look surprised people in my position have long ears and you neednt be frightened the young lady will not be brought here she is too valuable  be so good as to speak plainly said foy  with pleasure you see this girl is the heiress is she not and whether or no i find out the facts from you sooner or later in this way or that she will doubtless discover where her heritage is hidden well that fortune a husband would have the advantage of sharing i myself labour at present under no matrimonial engagements and am in a position to obtain an introductionah my friend are you beginning to see that there are more ways of killing a dog than by hanging him  weak and wounded as he was foys heart sank in him at the words of this man this devil who had betrayed his mother with a mock marriage and who was the father of adrian the idea of making the heiress his wife was one worthy of his evil ingenuity and why should he not put it into practice elsa of course would rebel but alvas officials in such days had means of overcoming any maidenly reluctance or at least of forcing women to choose between death and degradation was it not common for them even to dissolve marriages in order to give heretics to new husbands who desired their wealth there was no justice left in the land human beings were the chattels and slaves of their oppressors oh god what was there to do except to trust in god why should they be tortured murdered married against their wills for the sake of a miserable pile of pelf why not tell the truth and let the fellow take the money he had measured up his man and believed that he could drive a bargain with him ramiro wanted money not lives he was no fanatic horrors gave him no pleasure he cared nothing about his victims souls as he had betrayed his mother lysbeth for cash so he would be willing to let them all go for cash why not make the exchange  then distinct formidable overwhelming the answer rose up in foys mind because he had sworn to his father that nothing which could be imagined should induce him to reveal this secret and betray this trust and not only to his father to hendrik brant also who already had given his own life to keep his treasure out of the hands of the spaniards believing that in some unforeseen way it would advantage his own land and countrymen no great as was the temptation he must keep the letter of his bond and pay its dreadful price so again foy answered  it is useless to try to bribe me for i do not know where the money is  very well heer foy van goorl now we have a plain issue before us but i will still try to protect you against yourselfthe warrant shall remain blank for a little while  then he called aloud sergeant ask the professor baptiste to be so good as to step this way    chapter xxi  how martin turned coward  the sergeant left the room and presently returned followed by the professor a tall hangdog looking rogue clad in rusty black with broad horny hands and nails bitten down to the quick  good morning to you professor said ramiro here are two subjects for your gentle art you will begin upon the big one and from time to time report progress and be sure if he becomes willing to reveal what i want to knownever mind what it is that is my affaircome to summon me at once  what methods does your excellency wish employed  man i leave that to you am i a master of your filthy trade any method provided it is effective  i dont like the look of him grumbled the professor gnawing at his short nails i have heard about this mad brute he is capable of anything  then take the whole guard with you one naked wretch cant do much against eight armed men and listen take the young gentleman also and let him see what goes on the experience may modify his views but dont touch him without telling me i have reports to write and shall stop here  i dont like the look of him repeated the professor i say that he makes me feel cold down the backhe has the evil eye id rather begin with the young one  begone and do what i tell you said ramiro glaring at him fiercely guard attend upon the executioner baptiste  bring them along grumbled the professor  no need for violence worthy sir muttered martin show the way and we follow and stooping down he lifted foy from his chair  then the procession started first went baptiste and four soldiers next came martin bearing foy and after them four more soldiers they passed out of the courtroom into the passage beneath the archway martin shuffling along slowly glanced down it and saw that on the wall among some other weapons hung his own sword silence the big doors were locked and barred but at the wicket by the side of them stood a sentry whose office it was to let people in and out upon their lawful business making pretence to shift foy in his arms martin scanned this wicket as narrowly as time would allow and observed that it seemed to be secured by means of iron bolts at the top and the bottom but that it was not locked since the socket into which the tongue went was empty doubtless while he was on guard there the porter did not think it necessary to go to the pains of using the great key that hung at his girdle  the sergeant in charge of the victims opened a low and massive door which was almost exactly opposite to that of the courtroom by shooting back a bolt and pushing it ajar evidently the place beyond at some time or other had been used as a prison which accounted for the bolt on the outside a few seconds later and they were locked into the torturechamber of the gevangenhuis which was nothing more than a goodsized vault like that of a cellar lit with lamps for no light of day was suffered to enter here and by a horrid little fire that flickered on the floor the furnitures of the place may be guessed at those that are curious about such things can satisfy themselves by examining the mediaeval prisons at the hague and elsewhere let us pass them over as unfit even for description although these terrors of which we scarcely like to speak today were very familiar to the sight of our ancestors of but three centuries ago  martin sat foy down upon some terrible engine that roughly resembled a chair and once more let his blue eyes wander about him amongst the various implements was one leaning against the wall not very far from the door which excited his especial interest it was made for a dreadful purpose but martin reflected only that it seemed to be a stout bar of iron exactly suited to the breaking of anybodys head  come sneered the professor undress that big gentleman while i make ready his little bed  so the soldiers stripped martin nor did they assault him with sneers and insults for they remembered the mans deeds of yesterday and admired his strength and endurance and the huge muscular frame beneath their hands  now he is ready if you are said the sergeant  the professor rubbed his hands  come on my little man he said  then martins nerve gave way and he began to shiver and to shake  oho laughed the professor even in this stuffy place he is cold without his clothes well we must warm himwe must warm him  who would have thought that a big fellow who can fight well too was such a coward at heart said the sergeant of the guard to his companions after all he will give no more play than a rhine salmon  martin heard the words and was seized with such an intense access of fear that he burst into a sweat all over his body  i cant bear it he said covering his eyeswhich however he did not shutwith his fingers the rack was always my nightmare and now i see why ill tell all i know  oh martin martin broke out foy in a kind of wail i was doing my best to keep my own courage i never dreamt that you would turn coward  every well has a bottom master whined martin and mine is the rack forgive me but i cant abide the sight of it  foy stared at him openmouthed could he believe his ears and if martin was so horribly scared why did his eye glint in that peculiar way between his fingers he had seen this light in it before no later indeed than the last afternoon just as the soldiers tried to rush the stair he gave up the problem as insoluble but from that moment he watched very narrowly  do you hear what this young lady says professor baptiste said the sergeant she says imitating martins whine that shell tell all she knows  then the great cur might have saved me this trouble stop here with him i must go and inform the governor those are my orders no no you neednt give him clothes yetthat cloth is enoughone can never be sure  then he walked to the door and began to unlock it as he went striking martin in the face with the back of his hand and saying  take that cur whereat as foy observed the cowed prisoner perspired more profusely than before and shrank away towards the wall  god in heaven what had happened the door of the torture den was opened and suddenly uttering the words to me foy martin made a movement more quick than he could follow something flew up and fell with a fearful thud upon the executioner in the doorway the guard sprang forward and a great bar of iron hurled with awful force into their faces swept two of them broken to the ground another instant and one arm was about his middle the next they were outside the door martin standing straddlelegged over the body of the dead professor baptiste  they were outside the door but it was not shut for now on the other side of it six men were pushing with all their might and main martin dropped foy take his dagger and look out for the porter he gasped as he hurled himself against the door  in a second foy had drawn the weapon out of the belt of the dead man and wheeled round the porter from the wicket was running on them sword in hand foy forgot that he was woundedfor the moment his leg seemed sound again he doubled himself up and sprang at the man like a wildcat as one springs who has the rack behind him there was no fight yet in that thrust the skill which martin had taught him so patiently served him well for the sword of the spaniard passed over his head whereas foys long dagger went through the porters throat a glance showed foy that from him there was nothing more to fear so he turned  help if you can groaned martin as well he might for with his naked shoulder wedged against one of the cross pieces of the door he was striving to press it to so that the bolt could be shot into its socket  heavens what a struggle was that martins blue eyes seemed to be starting from his head his tongue lolled out and the muscles of his body rose in great knots foy hopped to him and pushed as well as he was able it was little that he could do standing upon one leg only for now the sinews of the other had given way again still that little made the difference for let the soldiers on the further side strive as they might slowly very slowly the thick door quivered to its frame martin glanced at the bolt for he could not speak and with his left hand foy slowly worked it forward it was stiff with disuse it caught upon the edge of the socket  closer he gasped  martin made an effort so fierce that it was hideous to behold for beneath the pressure the blood trickled from his nostrils but the door went in the sixteenth of an inch and the rusty bolt creaked home into its stone notch  martin stepped back and for a moment stood swaying like a man about to fall then recovering himself he leapt at the sword silence which hung upon the wall and passed its thong over his right wrist next he turned towards the door of the courtroom  where are you going asked foy  to bid him farewell hissed martin  youre mad said foy lets fly while we can that door may givethey are shouting  perhaps you are right answered martin doubtfully come on to my back with you  a few seconds later the two soldiers on guard outside the gevangenhuis were amazed to see a huge redbearded man naked save for a loincloth and waving a great bare sword who carried upon his back another man rush straight at them with a roar they never waited his onset they were terrified and thought that he was a devil this way and that they sprang and the man with his burden passed between them over the little drawbridge down the street of the city heading for the morsch poort  finding their wits again the guards started in pursuit but a voice from among the passersby cried out  it is martin red martin and foy van goorl who escape from the gevangenhuis and instantly a stone flew towards the soldiers  then bearing in mind the fate of their comrades on the yesterday those men scuttled back to the friendly shelter of the prison gate when at length ramiro growing weary of waiting came out from an inner chamber beyond the courtroom where he had been writing to find the professor and the porter dead in the passage and the yelling guard locked in his own torturechamber why then those sentries declared that they had seen nothing at all of prisoners clothed or naked  for a while he believed them and mighty was the hunt from the clocktower of the gevangenhuis down to the lowest stone of its cellars yes and even in the waters of the moat but when the governor found out the truth it went very ill with those soldiers and still worse with the guard from whom martin had escaped in the tortureroom like an eel out of the hand of a fishwife for by this time ramiros temper was roused and he began to think that he had done ill to return to leyden  but he had still a card to play in a certain room in the gevangenhuis sat another victim compared to the dreadful dens where foy and martin had been confined this was quite a pleasant chamber upon the first floor being reserved indeed for political prisoners of rank or officers captured upon the field who were held to ransom thus it had a real window secured however by a double set of iron bars which overlooked the little inner courtyard and the gaol kitchen also it was furnished after a fashion and was more or less clean this prisoner was none other than dirk van goorl who had been neatly captured as he returned towards his house after making certain arrangements for the flight of his family and hurried away to the gaol on that morning dirk also had been put upon his trial before the squeakyvoiced and agitated extailor he also had been condemned to death the method of his end as in the case of foy and martin being left in the hands of the governor then they led him back to his room and shot the bolts upon him there  some hours later a man entered his cell to the door of which he was escorted by soldiers bringing him food and drink he was one of the cooks and as it chanced a talkative fellow  what passes in this prison friend asked dirk looking up that i see people running to and fro across the courtyard and hear trampling and shouts in the passages is the prince of orange coming perchance to set all of us poor prisoners free and he smiled sadly  umph grunted the man we have prisoners here who set themselves free without waiting for any prince of orange magicians they must bemagicians and nothing less  dirks interest was excited putting his hand into his pocket he drew out a gold piece which he gave to the man  friend he said you cook my food do you not and look after me well i have a few of these about me and if you prove kind they may as well find their way into your pocket as into those of your betters do you understand  the man nodded took the money and thanked him  now went on dirk while you clean the room tell me about this escape for small things amuse those who hear no tidings  well mynheer answered the man this is the tale of it so far as i can gather yesterday they captured two fellows heretics i suppose who made a good fight and did them much damage in a warehouse i dont know their names for i am a stranger to this town but i saw them brought in a young fellow who seemed to be wounded in the leg and neck and a great redbearded giant of a man they were put upon their trial this morning and afterwards sent across the two of them together with eight men to guard them to call upon the professoryou understand  dirk nodded for this professor was well known in leyden and then he asked  and then why mother in heaven they came out thats allthe big man stripped and carrying the other on his back yes they killed the professor with the branding iron and out they camelike ripe peas from a pod  impossible said dirk  very well perhaps you know better than i do perhaps it is impossible also that they should have pushed the door to let all those spanish cocks inside do what they might and bolted them in perhaps it is impossible that they should have spitted the porter and got clean away through the outside guards the big one still carrying the other upon his back perhaps all these things are impossible but theyre true nevertheless and if you dont believe me after they get away from the whippingpost just ask the bridge guard why they ran so fast when they saw that great naked blueeyed fellow come at them roaring like a lion with his big sword flashing above his head oh theres a pretty todo i can tell you a pretty todo and in meal or malt we shall all pay the price of it from the governor down indeed some backs are paying it now  but friend were they not taken outside the gaol  taken who was to take them when the rascally mob made them an escort five hundred strong as they went down the street no they are far away from leyden now you may swear to that i must be going but if there is anything youd like while youre here just tell me and as you are so liberal ill try and see that you get what you want  as the bolts were shot home behind the man dirk clasped his hands and almost laughed aloud with joy so martin was free and foy was free and until they could be taken again the secret of the treasure remained safe montalvo would never have it of that he was sure and as for his own fate well he cared little about it especially as the inquisitor had decreed that being a man of so much importance he was not to be put to the question this order however was prompted not by mercy but by discretion since the fellow knew that like other of the holland towns leyden was on the verge of open revolt and feared lest should it leak out that one of the wealthiest and most respected of its burghers was actually being tormented for his faiths sake the populace might step over the boundary line    when adrian had seen the wounded spanish soldiers and their bearers torn to pieces by the rabble and had heard the great door of the gevangenhuis close upon foy and martin he turned to go home with his evil news but for a long while the mob would not go home and had it not been that the drawbridge over the moat in front of the prison was up and that they had no means of crossing it probably they would have attacked the building then and there presently however rain began to fall and they melted away wondering not too happily whether in that time of daily slaughter the duke of alva would think a few common soldiers worth while making a stir about  adrian entered the upper room to tell his tidings since they must be told and found it occupied by his mother alone she was sitting straight upright in her chair her hands resting upon her knees staring out of the window with a face like marble  i cannot find him he began but foy and martin are taken after a great fight in which foy was wounded they are in the gevangenhuis  i know all interrupted lysbeth in a cold heavy voice my husband is taken also someone must have betrayed them may god reward him leave me adrian  then adrian turned and crept away to his own chamber his heart so full of remorse and shame that at times he thought that it must burst weak as he was wicked as he was he had never intended this but now oh heaven his brother foy and the man who had been his benefactor whom his mother loved more than her life were through him given over to a death worse than the mind could conceive somehow that night wore away and of this we may be sure that it did not go half as heavily with the victims in their dungeon as with the betrayer in his free comfort thrice during its dark hours indeed adrian was on the point of destroying himself once even he set the hilt of his sword upon the floor and its edge against his breast and then at the prick of steel shrank back  better would it have been for him perhaps could he have kept his courage at least he would have been spared much added shame and misery    so soon as adrian had left her lysbeth rose robed herself and took her way to the house of her cousin van de werff now a successful citizen of middle age and the burgomasterelect of leyden  you have heard the news she said  alas cousin i have he answered and it is very terrible is it true that this treasure of hendrik brants is at the bottom of it all  she nodded and answered i believe so  then could they not bargain for their lives by surrendering its secret  perhaps that is foy and martin mightdirk does not know its whereaboutshe refused to know but they have sworn that they will die first  why cousin  because they promised as much to hendrik brant who believed that if his gold could be kept from the spaniards it would do some mighty service to his country in time to come and who has persuaded them all that is so  then god grant it may be true said van de werff with a sigh for otherwise it is sad to think that more lives should be sacrificed for the sake of a heap of pelf  i know it cousin but i come to you to save those lives  how  how she answered fiercely why by raising the town by attacking the gevangenhuis and rescuing them by driving the spaniards out of leyden  and thereby bringing upon ourselves the fate of mons would you see this place also given over to sack by the soldiers of noircarmes and don frederic  i care not what i see so long as i save my son and my husband she answered desperately  there speaks the woman not the patriot it is better that three men should die than a whole city full  that is a strange argument to find in your mouth cousin the argument of caiaphas the jew  nay lysbeth be not wroth with me for what can i say the spanish troops in leyden are not many it is true but more have been sent for from haarlem and elsewhere after the troubles of yesterday arising out of the capture of foy and martin and in fortyeight hours at the longest they will be here this town is not provisioned for a siege its citizens are not trained to arms and we have little powder stored moreover the city council is divided for the killing of the spanish soldiers we may compound but if we attack the gevangenhuis that is open rebellion and we shall bring the army of don frederic down upon us  what matter cousin it will come sooner or later  then let it come later when we are more prepared to beat it off oh do not reproach me for i can bear it ill i who am working day and night to make ready for the hour of trial i love your husband and your son my heart bleeds for your sorrow and their doom but at present i can do nothing nothing you must bear your burden they must bear theirs i must bear mine we must all wander through the night not knowing where we wander till god causes the dawn to break the dawn of freedom and retribution  lysbeth made no answer only she rose and stumbled from the house while van de werff sat down groaning bitterly and praying for help and light    chapter xxii  a meeting and a parting  lysbeth did not sleep that night for even if her misery would have let her sleep she could not because of the physical fire that burnt in her veins and the strange pangs of agony which pierced her head at first she thought little of them but when at last the cold light of the autumn morning dawned she went to a mirror and examined herself and there upon her neck she found a hard red swelling of the size of a nut then lysbeth knew that she had caught the plague from the vrouw jansen and laughed aloud a dreary little laugh since if all she loved were to die it seemed to her good that she should die also elsa was abed prostrated with grief and shutting herself in her room lysbeth suffered none to come near her except one woman who she knew had recovered from the plague in past years but even to her she said nothing of her sickness  about eleven oclock in the morning this woman rushed into her chamber crying they have escaped they have escaped  who gasped lysbeth springing from her chair  your son foy and red martin and she told the tale of how the naked man with the naked sword carrying the wounded foy upon his back burst his way roaring from the gevangenhuis and protected by the people had run through the town and out of the morsch poort heading for the haarlemer meer  as she listened lysbeths eyes flamed up with a fire of pride  oh good and faithful servant she murmured you have saved my son but alas your master you could not save  another hour passed and the woman appeared again bearing a letter  who brought this she asked  a spanish soldier mistress  then she cut the silk and read it it was unsigned and ran   one in authority sends greetings to the vrouw van goorl if the vrouw van goorl would save the life of the man who is dearest to her she is prayed to veil herself and follow the bearer of this letter for her own safety she need have no fear it is assured hereby   lysbeth thought awhile this might be a trick very probably it was a trick to take her well if so what did it matter since she would rather die with her husband than live on without him moreover why should she turn aside from death she in whose veins the plague was burning but there was another thing worse than that she could guess who had penned this letter it even seemed to her after all these many years that she recognised the writing disguised though it was could she face him well why notfor dirks sake  and if she refused and dirk was done to death would she not reproach herself if she lived to remember it because she had left a stone unturned  give me my cloak and veil she said to the woman and now go tell the man that i am coming  at the door she found the soldier who saluted her and said respectfully follow me lady but at a little distance  so they started and through side streets lysbeth was led to a back entrance of the gevangenhuis which opened and closed behind her mysteriously leaving her wondering whether she would ever pass that gate again within a man was waitingshe did not even notice what kind of manwho also said follow me lady and led her through gloomy passages and various doors into a little empty chamber furnished with a table and two chairs presently the door opened and shut then her whole being shrank and sickened as though beneath the breath of poison for there before her still the same still handsome although so marred by time and scars and evil stood the man who had been her husband juan de montalvo but whatever she felt lysbeth showed nothing of it in her face which remained white and stern moreover even before she looked at him she was aware that he feared her more than she feared him  it was true for from this womans eyes went out a sword of terror that seemed to pierce montalvos heart back flew his mind to the scene of their betrothal and the awful words that she had spoken then reechoed in his ears how strangely things had come round for on that day as on this the stake at issue was the life of dirk van goorl in the old times she had bought it paying as its price herself her fortune and worst of all to a woman her lovers scorn and wonder what would she be prepared to pay now well fortunately he need ask but little of her and yet his soul mistrusted him of these bargainings with lysbeth van hout for the life of dirk van goorl the first had ended ill with a sentence of fourteen years in the galleys most of which he had served how would the second end  by way of answer there seemed to rise before the eye of montalvos mind a measureless black gulf and falling falling falling through its infinite depths one miserable figure a mere tiny point that served to show the vastness it explored the point turned over and he saw its face as in a crystalit was his own  this unpleasant nightmare of the imagination came in an instant and in an instant passed the next montalvo courteous and composed was bowing before his visitor and praying her to be seated  it is most good of you vrouw van goorl he began to have responded so promptly to my invitation  perhaps count de montalvo she replied you will do me the favour to set out your business in as few words as possible  most certainly that is my desire let me free your mind of apprehension the past has mingled memories for both of us some of them bitter some let me hope sweet and he laid his hand upon his heart and sighed but it is a dead past so dear lady let us agree to bury it in a fitting silence  lysbeth made no answer only her mouth grew a trifle more stern  now one word more and i will come to the point let me congratulate you upon the gallant deeds of a gallant son of course his courage and dexterity with that of the red giant martin have told against myself have in short lost me a trick in the game but i am an old soldier and i can assure you that the details of their fight yesterday at the factory and of their marvellous escape fromfromwell painful surroundings this morning have stirred my blood and made my heart beat fast  i have heard the tale do not trouble to repeat it said lysbeth it is only what i expected of them but i thank god that it has pleased him to let them live on so that in due course they may fearfully avenge a beloved father and master  montalvo coughed and turned his head with the idea of avoiding that ghastly nightmare of a pitiful little man falling down a fathomless gulf which had sprung up suddenly in his mind again  well he went on a truce to compliments they escaped and i am glad of it whatever murders they may contemplate in the future yes notwithstanding their great crimes and manslayings in the past i am glad that they escaped although it was my duty to keep them while i couldand if i should catch them it will be my dutybut i neednt talk of that to you of course however you know there is one gentleman who was not quite so fortunate  my husband  yes your worthy husband who happily for my reputation as captain of one of his majestys prisons occupies an upstairs room  what of him asked lysbeth  dear lady dont be over anxious there is nothing so wearing as anxiety i was coming to the matter then with a sudden change of manner he added it is needful lysbeth that i should set out the situation  what situation do you mean  well principally that of the treasure  what treasure  oh woman do not waste time in trying to fool me the treasure the vast the incalculable treasure of hendrik brant which foy van goorl and martin who have escapedand he ground his teeth together at the anguish of the thoughtdisposed of somewhere in the haarlemer meer  well what about this treasure  i want it that is all  then you had best go to seek it  that is my intention and i shall begin the searchin the heart of dirk van goorl he added slowly crushing the handkerchief he held with his long fingers as though it were a living thing that could be choked to death  lysbeth never stirred she had expected this  you will find it a poor mine to dig in she said for he knows nothing of the whereabouts of this money nobody knows anything of it now martin hid it as i understand and lost the paper so it will lie there till the haarlemer meer is drained  dear me do you know i have heard that story before yes from the excellent martin himselfand do you know i dont quite believe it  i cannot help what you believe or do not believe you may remember that it was always my habit to speak the truth  quite so but others may be less conscientious see here and drawing a paper from his doublet he held it before her it was nothing less than the deathwarrant of dirk van goorl signed by the inquisitor duly authorised thereto  mechanically she read it and understood  you will observe he went on that the method of the criminals execution is left to the good wisdom of our wellbelovedetc in plain language to me now might i trouble you so far as to look out of this little window what do you see in front of you a kitchen quite so always a homely and pleasant sight in the eyes of an excellent housewife like yourself anddo you mind bending forward a little what do you see up there a small barred window well let us suppose for the sake of argument that a hungry man a man who grows hungrier and hungrier sat behind that window watching the cooks at their work and seeing the meat carried into this kitchen to come out an hour or two later as hot steaming savoury joints while he wasted wasted wasted and starved starved starved dont you think my dear lady that this would be a very unpleasant experience for that man  are you a devil gasped lysbeth springing back  i have never regarded myself as such but if you seek a definition i should say that i am a hardworking necessitous and somewhat unfortunate gentleman who has been driven to rough methods in order to secure a comfortable old age i can assure you that i do not wish to starve anybody i wish only to find hendrik brants treasure and if your worthy husband wont tell me where it is why i must make him that is all in six or eight days under my treatment i am convinced that he will become quite fluent on the subject for there is nothing that should cause a fat burgher accustomed to good living to open his heart more than a total lack of the victuals which he can see and smell did you ever hear the story of an ancient gentleman called tantalus these old fables have a wonderful way of adapting themselves to the needs and circumstances of us moderns havent they  then lysbeths pride broke down and in the abandonment of her despair flinging herself upon her knees before this monster she begged for her husbands life begged in the name of god yes and even in the name of montalvos son adrian so low had her misery brought her that she pleaded with the man by the son of shame whom she had borne to him  he prayed her to rise i want to save your husbands life he said i give you my word that if only he will tell me what i desire to know i will save it yes although the risk is great i will even manage his escape and i shall ask you to go upstairs presently and explain my amiable intentions to him then he thought a moment and added but you mentioned one adrian pray do you mean the gentleman whose signature appears here and he handed her another document saying read it quietly there is no hurry the good dirk is not starving yet i am informed indeed that he has just made an excellent breakfastnot his last by many thousands let us hope  lysbeth took the sheets and glanced at them then her intelligence awoke and she read on fiercely until her eye came to the wellknown signature at the foot of the last page she cast the roll down with a cry as though a serpent had sprung from its pages and bitten her  i fear that you are pained said montalvo sympathetically and no wonder for myself i have gone through such disillusionments and know how they wound a generous nature thats why i showed you this document because i also am generous and wish to warn you against this young gentleman who i understand you allege is my son you see the person who would betray his brother might even go a step further and betray his mother so if you take my advice you will keep an eye upon the young man also i am bound to remind you that it is more or less your own fault it is a most unlucky thing to curse a child before it is bornyou remember the incident that curse has come home to roost with a vengeance what a warning against giving way to the passion of the moment  lysbeth heeded him no longer she was thinking as she had never thought before at that moment as though by an inspiration there floated into her mind the words of the dead vrouw jansen the plague i wish that i had caught it before for then i would have taken it to him in prison and they couldnt have treated him as they did dirk was in prison and dirk was to be starved to death for whatever montalvo might think he did not know the secret and therefore could not tell it and sheshe had the plague on her she knew its symptoms well and its poison was burning in her every vein although she still could think and speak and walk  well why not it would be no crime indeed if it was a crime she cared little it would be better that he should die of the plague in five days or perhaps in two if it worked quickly as it often did with the fullblooded than that he should linger on starving for twelve or more and perhaps be tormented besides  swiftly very swiftly lysbeth came to her dreadful decision then she spoke in a hoarse voice  what do you wish me to do  i wish you to reason with your husband and to persuade him to cease from his obstinacy and to surrender to me the secret of the hidingplace of brants hoard in that event so soon as i have proved the truth of what he tells me i undertake that he shall be set at liberty unharmed and that meanwhile he shall be well treated  and if i will not or he will not or cannot  then i have told you the alternative and to show you that i am not joking i will now write and sign the order then if you decline this mission or if it is fruitless i will hand it to the officer before your eyesand within the next ten days or so let you know the results or witness them if you wish  i will go she said but i must see him alone  it is unusual he answered but provided you satisfy me that you carry no weapon i do not know that i need object  so when montalvo had written his order and scattered dust on it from the pouncebox for he was a man of neat and methodical habits he himself with every possible courtesy conducted lysbeth to her husbands prison having ushered her into it with a cheerful friend van goorl i bring you a visitor he locked the door upon them and patiently waited outside  it matters not what passed within whether lysbeth told her husband of her dread yet sacred purpose or did not tell him whether he ever learned of the perfidy of adrian or did not learn it what were their parting wordstheir parting prayers all these things matter not indeed the last are too holy to be written let us bow our heads and pass them by in silence and let the reader imagine them as he will    growing impatient at length montalvo unlocked the prison door and opened it to discover lysbeth and her husband kneeling side by side in the centre of the room like the figures on some ancient marble monument they heard him and rose then dirk folded his wife in his arms in a long last embrace and loosing her held one hand above her head in blessing as with the other he pointed to the door  so infinitely pathetic was this dumb show of farewell for no word passed between them while he was present that not only his barbed gibes but the questions that he meant to ask died upon the lips of montalvo try as he might he could not speak them here  come he said and lysbeth passed out  at the door she turned to look and there in the centre of the room still stood her husband tears streaming from his eyes down a face radiant with an unearthly smile and his right hand lifted towards the heavens and so she left him    presently montalvo and lysbeth were together again in the little room  i fear he said from what i saw just now that your mission has failed  it has failed she answered in such a voice as might be dragged by an evil magic from the lips of a corpse he does not know the secret you seek and therefore he cannot tell it  i am sorry that i cannot believe you said montalvo soand he stretched out his hand towards a bell upon the table  stop she said for your own sake stop man will you really commit this awful this useless crime think of the reckoning that must be paid here and hereafter think of me the woman you dishonoured standing before the judgment seat of god and bearing witness against your naked shivering soul think of him the good and harmless man whom you are about cruelly to butcher crying in the ear of christ look upon juan de montalvo my pitiless murderer  silence shouted montalvo yet shrinking back against the wall as though to avoid a swordthrust silence you illomened witch with your talk of god and judgment it is too late i tell you it is too late my hands are too red with blood my heart is too black with sin upon the tablets of my mind is written too long a record what more can this one crime matter anddo you understandi must have money money to buy my pleasures money to make my last years happy and my deathbed soft i have suffered enough i have toiled enough and i will win wealth and peace who am now once more a beggar yes had you twenty husbands i would crush the life out of all of them inch by inch to win the gold that i desire  as he spoke and the passions in him broke through their crust of cunning and reserve his face changed now lysbeth watching for some sign of pity knew that hope was dead for his countenance was as it had been on that day sixandtwenty years ago when she sat at his side while the great race was run there was the same starting eyeball the same shining fangs appeared between the curled lips and above them the moustachios now grown grey touched the high cheekbones it was as in the fable of the weremen who at a magic sign or word put off their human aspect and become beasts so it had chanced to the spirit of montalvo shining through his flesh like some baleful marshlight through the mist it was a thing which god had forgotten a thing that had burst the kindly mould of its humanity and wrapt itself in the robe and mask of such a wolf as might raven about the cliffs of hell only there was fear on the face of the wolf that inhuman face which this side of the grave she was yet destined to see once more  the fit passed and montalvo sank down gasping while even in her woe and agony lysbeth shuddered at this naked vision of a satanhaunted soul  i have one more thing to ask she said since my husband must die suffer that i die with him will you refuse this also and cause the cup of your crimes to flow over and the last angel of gods mercy to flee away  yes he answered you woman with the evil eye do you suppose that i wish you here to bring all the ills you prate of upon my head i say that i am afraid of you why for your sake once years ago i made a vow to the blessed virgin that whatever i worked on men i would never again lift a hand against a woman to that oath i look to help me at the last for i have kept it sacredly and am keeping it now else by this time both you and the girl elsa might have been stretched upon the rack no lysbeth get you gone and take your curses with you and he snatched and rang the bell  a soldier entered the room saluted and asked his commands  take this order he said to the officer in charge of the heretic dirk van goorl it details the method of his execution let it be strictly adhered to and report made to me each morning of the condition of the prisoner stay show this lady from the prison  the man saluted again and went out of the door after him followed lysbeth she spoke no more but as she passed she looked at montalvo and he knew well that though she might be gone yet her curse remained behind  the plague was on her the plague was on her her head and bones were racked with pain and the swords of sorrow pierced her poor heart but lysbeths mind was still clear and her limbs still supported her she reached her home and walked upstairs to the sitting room commanding the servant to find the heer adrian and bid him join her there  in the room was elsa who ran to her crying  is it true is it true  it is true daughter that foy and martin have escaped  oh god is good wept the girl  and that my husband is a prisoner and condemned to death  ah gasped elsa i am selfish  it is natural that a woman should think first of the man she loves no do not come near me i fear that i am stricken with the pest  i am not afraid of that answered elsa did i never tell you as a child i had it in the hague  that at least is good news among much that is very ill but be silent here comes adrian to whom i wish to speak nay you need not leave us it is best that you should learn the truth  presently adrian entered and elsa watching everything noticed that he looked sadly changed and ill  you sent for me mother he began with some attempt at his old pompous air then he caught sight of her face and was silent  i have been to the gevangenhuis adrian she said and i have news to tell you as you may have heard your brother foy and our servant martin have escaped i know not whither they escaped out of the very jaws of worse than death out of the torturechamber indeed by killing that wretch who was known as the professor and the warden of the gate martin carrying foy who is wounded upon his back  i am indeed rejoiced cried adrian excitedly  hypocrite be silent hissed his mother and he knew that the worst had overtaken him  my husband your stepfather has not escaped he is in the prison still for there i have just bidden him farewell and the sentence upon him is that he shall be starved to death in a cell overlooking the kitchen  oh oh cried elsa and adrian groaned  it was my good or my evil fortune went on lysbeth in a voice of ice to see the written evidence upon which my husband your brother foy and martin were condemned to death on the grounds of heresy rebellion and the killing of the kings servants at the foot of it duly witnessed stands the signature ofadrian van goorl  elsas jaw fell she stared at the traitor like one paralysed while adrian seizing the back of a chair rested upon it and rocked his body to and fro  have you anything to say asked lysbeth  there was still one chance for the wretched manhad he been more dishonest than he was he might have denied all knowledge of the signature but to do this never occurred to him instead he plunged into a wandering scarcely intelligible explanation for even in his dreadful plight his vanity would not permit him to tell all the truth before elsa moreover in that fearful silence soon he became utterly bewildered till at length he hardly knew what he was saying and in the end came to a full stop  i understand you to admit that you signed this paper in the house of hague simon and in the presence of a man called ramiro who is governor of the prison and who showed it to me said lysbeth lifting her head which had sunk upon her breast  yes mother i signed something but  i wish to hear no more interrupted lysbeth whether your motive was jealousy or greed or wickedness of heart or fear you signed that which had you been a man you would not have yourself to be torn to pieces with redhot pincers you put a pen to it moreover you gave your evidence fully and freely for i have read it and supported it with the severed finger of the woman meg which you stole from foys room you are the murderer of your benefactor and of your mothers heart and the wouldbe murderer of your brother and of martin roos when you were born the mad wife martha who nursed me counselled that you should be put to death lest you should live to bring evil upon me and mine i refused and you have brought the evil upon us all but most i think upon your own soul i do not curse you i call down no ill upon you adrian i give you over into the hands of god to deal with as he sees fit here is moneyand going to her desk she took from it a heavy purse of gold which had been prepared for their flight and thrust it into the pocket of his doublet wiping her fingers upon her kerchief after she had touched him go hence and never let me see your face again you were born of my body you are my flesh and blood but for this world and the next i renounce you adrian bastard i know you not murderer get you gone  adrian fell upon the ground he grovelled before his mother trying to kiss the hem of her dress while elsa sobbed aloud hysterically but lysbeth spurned him in the face with her foot saying  get you gone before i call up such servants as are left to me to thrust you to the street  then adrian rose and with great gasps of agony like some sorewounded thing crept from that awful and majestic presence of outraged motherhood crept down the stairs and away into the city  when he had gone lysbeth took pen and paper and wrote in large letters these words   notice to all the good citizens of leyden adrian called van goorl upon whose written evidence his stepfather dirk van goorl his halfbrother foy van goorl and the servingman martin roos have been condemned to death in the gevangenhuis by torment starvation water fire and sword is known here no longer lysbeth van goorl   then she called a servant and gave orders that this paper should be nailed upon the front door of the house where every passerby might read it  it is done she said cease weeping elsa and lead me to my bed whence i pray god that i may never rise again    two days went by and a fugitive rode into the city a worn and wounded man of leyden with horror stamped upon his face  what news cried the people in the marketplace recognising him  mechlin mechlin he gasped i come from mechlin  what of mechlin and its citizens asked pieter van de werff stepping forward  don frederic has taken it the spaniards have butchered them everyone old and young men women and children they are all butchered i escaped but for two leagues and more i heard the sound of the deathwail of mechlin give me wine  they gave him wine and by slow degrees in broken sentences he told the tale of one of the most awful crimes ever committed in the name of christ by cruel man against god and his own fellows it was written large in history we need not repeat it here  then when they knew the truth up from that multitude of the men of leyden went a roar of wrath and a cry to vengeance for their slaughtered kin they took arms each what he had the burgher his sword the fisherman his fishspear the boor his oxgoad or his pick leaders sprang up to command them and there arose a shout of to the gates to the gevangenhuis free the prisoners  they surged round the hateful place thousands of them the drawbridge was up but they bridged the moat some shots were fired at them then the defence ceased they battered in the massive doors and when these fell rushed to the dens and loosed those who remained alive within them  but they found no spaniards for by now ramiro and his garrison had vanished away whither they knew not a voice cried dirk van goorl seek for dirk van goorl and they came to the chamber overlooking the courtyard shouting van goorl we are here  they broke in the door and there they found him lying upon his pallet his hands clasped his face upturned smitten suddenly dead not by man but by the poison of the plague  unfed and untended the end had overtaken him very swiftly     book the third  the harvesting    chapter xxiii  father and son  when adrian left his mothers house in the bree straat he wandered away at hazard for so utterly miserable was he that he could form no plans as to what he was to do or whither he should go presently he found himself at the foot of that great mound which in leyden is still known as the burg a strange place with a circular wall upon the top of it said to have been constructed by the romans up this mound he climbed and throwing himself upon the grass under an oak which grew in one of the little recesses of those ancient walls he buried his face in his hands and tried to think  think how could he think whenever he shut his eyes there arose before them a vision of his mothers face a face so fearful in its awesome and unnatural calm that vaguely he wondered how he the outcast son upon whom it had been turned like the stare of the medusas head withering his very soul could have seen it and still live why did he live why was he not dead he who had a sword at his side was it because of his innocence he was not guilty of this dreadful crime he had never intended to hand over dirk van goorl and foy and martin to the inquisition he had only talked about them to a man whom he believed to be a professor of judicial astrology and who said that he could compound draughts which would bend the wills of women could he help it if this fellow was really an officer of the blood council of course not but oh why had he talked so much oh why had he signed that paper why did he not let them kill him first he had signed and explain as he would he could never look an honest man in the face again and less still a woman if she knew the truth so he was not still alive because he was innocent since for all the good that this very doubtful innocence of his was likely to be even to his own conscience he might almost as well have been guilty nor was he alive because he feared to die he did fear to die horribly but to the young and impressionable at any rate there are situations in which death seems the lesser of two evils that situation had been wellnigh reached by him last night when he set the hilt of his sword against the floor and shrank back at the prick of its point today it was overpast  no he lived on because before he died he had a hate to satisfy a revenge to work he would kill this dog ramiro who had tricked him with his crystal gazing and his talk of friendship who had frightened him with the threat of death until he became like some poor girl and for fear signed away his honouroh heaven for very fear he who prided himself upon his noble spanish blood the blood of warriorsthis treacherous dog who having used him had not hesitated to betray his shame to her from whom most of all it should have been hidden and for aught he knew to the others also yes if ever he met himhis own brotherfoy would spit upon him in the street foy who was so hatefully open and honest who could not understand into what degradation a mans nerves may drag him and martin who had always mistrusted and despised him why if he found the chance he would tear him limb from limb as a kite tears a partridge and worse still dirk van goorl the man who had befriended him who had bred him up although he was no son of his but the child of some rival he would sit there in his prison cell and while his face fell in and his bones grew daily plainer till at length his portly presence was as that of a living skeleton he would sit there by the window watching the dishes of savoury food pass in and out beneath him and between the pangs of his longdrawn hideous agony put up his prayer to god to pay back to him adrian all the woe that he had caused  oh it was too much under the crushing weight of his suffering his senses left him and he found such peace as today is won by those who are about to pass beneath the surgeons knife the peace that but too often wakes to a livelier agony  when adrian came to himself again he felt cold for already the autumn evening had begun to fall and there was a feel in the clear still air as of approaching frost also he was hungry dirk van goorl too must be growing hungry now he remembered for he had eaten nothing since the yesterday he would go into the town get food and then make up his mind what he should do  accordingly descending from the burg adrian went to the best inn in leyden and seating himself at a table under the trees that grew outside of it bade the waitingman bring him food and beer unconsciously for he was thinking of other things in speaking to him adrian had assumed the haughty spanish hidalgo manner that was customary with him when addressing his inferiors even then he noticed with the indignation of one who dwells upon his dignity that this server made him no bow but merely called his order to someone in the house and turning his back upon him began to speak to a man who was loitering near soon adrian became aware that he was the subject of that conversation for the two of them looked at him out of the corners of their eyes and jerked their thumbs towards him moreover first one then two then quite a number of passersby stopped and joined in the conversation which appeared to interest them very much boys came also a dozen or more of them and women of the fishwife stamp and all of these looked at him out of the corner of their eyes and from time to time jerked their thumbs towards him adrian began to feel uneasy and angered but drawing down his bonnet and folding his arms upon his breast he took no notice presently the server thrust his meal and flagon of beer before him with such clattering clumsiness that some of the liquor splashed over upon the table  be more careful and wipe that up said adrian  wipe it yourself answered the man rudely turning upon his heel  now adrian was minded to be gone but he was hungry and thirsty so first thought he he would satisfy himself accordingly he lifted the tankard and took a long pull at it when suddenly something struck the bottom of the vessel jerking liquor over his face and doublet he set it down with an oath and laying his hand upon his sword hilt asked who had done this but the mob which by now numbered fifty or sixty and was gathered about him in a triple circle made no answer they stood there staring sullenly and in the fading light their faces seemed dangerous and hostile  he was frightened what could they mean yes he was frightened but he determined to brave it out and lifted the cover from his meat when something passed over his shoulder and fell into the dish something stinking and abominableto be particular a dead cat this was too much adrian sprang to his feet and asked who dared thus to foul his food the crowd did not jeer did not even mock it seemed too much in earnest for gibes but a voice at the back called out  take it to dirk van goorl hell be glad of it soon  now adrian understood all these people knew of his infamy the whole of leyden knew that tale his lips turned dry and the sweat broke out upon his body what should he do brave it out he sat down and the fierce ring of silent faces drew a pace or two nearer he tried to bid the man to bring more meat but the words stuck in his throat now the mob saw his fear and of a sudden seemed to augur his guilt from it and to pass sentence on him in their hearts at least they who had been so dumb broke out into yells and hoots  traitor spanish spy murderer they screamed who gave evidence against our dirk who sold his brother to the rack  then came another shriller note kill him hang him up by the heels and stone him twist off his tongue and so forth out shot a hand a long skinny female hand and a harsh voice cried give us a keepsake my pretty boy then there was a sharp wrench at his head and he knew that from it a lock of hair was missing this was too much he ought to have stopped there and let them kill him if they would but a terror of these human wolves entered his soul and mastered him to be trodden beneath those mirestained feet to be rent by those filthy hands to be swung up living by the ankles to some pole and then carved piecemealhe could not bear it he drew his sword and turned to fly  stop him yelled the mob whereon he lunged at them wildly running a small boy through the arm  the sight of blood and the screech of the wounded lad settled the question and those who were foremost came at him with a spring but adrian was swifter than they and before a hand could be laid upon him amidst a shower of stones and filth he was speeding down the street after him came the mob and then began one of the finest manhunts ever known in leyden  from one street to another round this turn and round that sped the quarry and after him a swiftly growing pack came the hounds some women drew a washingline across the street to trip him adrian jumped it like a deer four men got ahead and tried to cut him off he dodged them down the bree straat he went and on his mothers door he saw a paper and guessed what was written there they were gaining they were gaining for always fresh ones took the place of those who grew weary there was but one chance for him now near by ran the rhine and here it was wide and unbridged perhaps they would not follow him through the water in he went having no choice and swam for his life they threw stones and bits of wood at him and called for bows but luckily for him by now the night was falling fast so that soon he vanished from their sight and heard them crying to each other that he was drowned  but adrian was not drowned for at that moment he was dragging himself painfully through the deep greasy mud of the opposing bank and hiding among the old boats and lumber which were piled there till his breath came to him again but he could not stay long for even if he had not been afraid that they would come and find him it was too cold so he crept away into the darkness    half an hour later as resting from their daily labours hague simon and his consort meg were seated at their evening meal a knock came at the door causing them to drop their knives and to look at each other suspiciously  who can it be marvelled meg  simon shook his fat head i have no appointment he murmured and i dont like strange visitors theres a nasty spirit abroad in the town a very nasty spirit  go and see said meg  go and see yourself you and he added an epithet calculated to anger the meekest woman  she answered it with an oath and a metal plate which struck him in the face but before the quarrel could go farther again came the sound of raps this time louder and more hurried then black meg went to open the door while simon took a knife and hid himself behind a curtain after some whispering meg bade the visitor enter and ushered him into the room that same fateful room where the evidence was signed now he was in the light and she saw him  oh come here she gasped simon come and look at our little grandee so simon came whereon the pair of them clapping their hands to their ribs burst into screams of laughter  its the don mother of heaven it is the don gurgled simon  well might they laugh they who had known adrian in his pride and rich attire for before them crouching against the wall was a miserable bareheaded object his hair stained with mud and rotten eggs blood running from his temple where a stone had caught him his garments a mass of filth and dripping water one boot gone and his hose burst to tatters for a while the fugitive bore it then suddenly without a word he drew the sword that still remained to him and rushed at the bestial looking simon who skipped away round the table  stop laughing he said or i will put this through you i am a desperate man  you look it said simon but he laughed no more for the joke had become risky what do you want heer adrian  i want food and lodging for so long as i please to stop here dont be afraid i have money to pay you  i am thinking that you are a dangerous guest broke in meg  i am replied adrian but i tell you that i shall be more dangerous outside i was not the only one concerned in that matter of the evidence and if they get me they will have you too you understand  meg nodded she understood perfectly for those of her trade leyden was growing a risky habitation  we will accommodate you with our best mynheer she said come upstairs to the masters room and put on some of his clothes they will fit you well you are much of the same figure  adrians breath caught in his throat  is he here he asked  no but he keeps his room  is he coming back  i suppose so sometime as he keeps his room do you want to see him  very much but you neednt mention it my business can wait till we meet get my clothes washed and dried as quickly as you can will you i dont care about wearing other mens garments  a quarter of an hour later adrian cleaned and clothed different indeed to look on from the torn and hunted fugitive reentered the sittingroom as he came clad in ramiros suit meg nudged her husband and whispered like aint they  like as two devils in hell simon answered critically then added your food is ready come mynheer and eat  so adrian ate and drank heartily enough for the meat and wine were good and he needed them also it rejoiced him in a dull way to find that there was something left in which he could take pleasure even if it were but eating and drinking when he had finished he told his story or so much of it as he wished to tell and afterwards went to bed wondering whether his hosts would murder him in his sleep for the purse of gold he carried half hoping that they might indeed and slept for twelve hours without stirring  all that day and until the evening of the next adrian sat in the home of his spy hosts recovering his strength and brooding over his fearful fall black meg brought in news of what passed without thus he learned that his mother had sickened with the plague and that the sentence of starvation was being carried out upon the body of her husband dirk van goorl he learned also the details of the escape of foy and martin which were the talk of all the city in the eyes of the common people they had become heroes and some local poet had made a song about them which men were singing in the streets two verses of that song were devoted to him adrian indeed black meg repeated them to him word by word with a suppressed but malignant joy yes this was what had happened his brother had become a popular hero and he adrian who in every way was so infinitely that brothers superior an object of popular execration and of all this the man ramiro was the cause  well he was waiting for ramiro that was why he risked his life by staying in leyden sooner or later ramiro would be bound to visit this haunt of his and thenhere adrian drew his rapier and lunged and parried and finally with hissing breath drove it down into the wood of the flooring picturing in a kind of luxury of the imagination that the throat of ramiro was between its point and the ground of course in the struggle that must come the said ramiro who doubtless was a skilful swordsman might get the upper hand it might be his adrians throat which was between the point and the ground well if so it scarcely mattered he did not care at any rate for this once he would play the man and then let the devil take his own himself or ramiro or both of them  on the afternoon of the second day adrian heard shouting in the streets and hague simon came in and told him that a man had arrived with bad news from mechlin what it was he could not say he was going to find out a couple of hours went by and there was more shouting this time of a determined and ordered nature then black meg appeared and informed him that the news from mechlin was that everyone in that unhappy town had been slain by the spaniards that further the people of leyden had risen and were marching to attack the gevangenhuis out she hurried again for when the waters were stormy then black meg must go afishing  another hour went by and once more the street door was opened with a key to be carefully shut when the visitor had entered  simon or meg thought adrian but as he could not be sure he took the precaution of hiding himself behind the curtain the door of the room opened and not meg or simon but ramiro entered so his opportunity had come  the master seemed disturbed he sat down upon a chair and wiped his brow with a silk handkerchief then aloud and shaking his fist in the air he uttered a most comprehensive curse upon everybody and everything but especially upon the citizens of leyden after this once more he lapsed into silence sitting his one eye fixed upon vacancy and twisting his waxed moustaches with his hand  now was adrians chance he had only to step out from behind the curtain and run him through before he could rise from his seat the plan had great charms and doubtless he might have put it into execution had not adrians histrionic instincts stayed his hand if he killed ramiro thus he would never know why he had been killed and above all things adrian desired that he should know he wanted not only to wreak his wrongs but to let his adversary learn why they were wreaked also to do him justice he preferred a fair fight to a secret stab delivered from behind for gentlemen fought but assassins stabbed  still as there were no witnesses he might have been willing to waive this point if only he could make sure that ramiro should learn the truth before he died he thought of springing out and wounding him and then after he had explained matters finishing him off at his leisure but how could he be sure of his swordthrust which might do too much or too little no come what would the matter must be concluded in the proper fashion  choosing his opportunity adrian stepped from behind the hanging and placed himself between ramiro and the door the bolt of which he shot adroitly that no one might interrupt their interview at the sound ramiro started and looked up in an instant he grasped the situation and though his bronzed face paled for he knew that his danger was great rose to it as might have been expected from a gentleman of his long and varied experience  the heer adrian called van goorl as i live he said my friend and pupil i am glad to see you but if i might ask although the times are rough why in this narrow room do you wave about a naked rapier in that dangerous fashion  villain answered adrian you know why you have betrayed me and mine and i am dishonoured and now i am going to kill you in payment  i see said ramiro the van goorl affair again i can never be clear of it for half an hour even well before you begin it may interest you to know that your worthy stepfather after a couple of days fasting is by now i suppose free for the rabble have stormed the gevangenhuis truth however compels me to add that he is suffering badly from the plague which your excellent mother with a resource that does her credit managed to communicate to him thinking this end less disagreeable on the whole than that which the law had appointed  thus spoke ramiro slowly and with purpose for all the while he was so manoeuvring that the light from the lattice fell full upon his antagonist leaving himself in the shadow a position which experience taught him would prove of advantage in emergency  adrian made no answer but lifted his sword  one moment young gentleman went on ramiro drawing his own weapon and putting himself on guard are you in earnest do you really wish to fight  yes answered adrian  what a fool you must be mused ramiro why at your age should you seek to be rid of life seeing that you have no more chance against me than a rat in a corner against a terrier dog look and suddenly he lunged most viciously straight at his heart but adrian was watching and parried the thrust  ah continued ramiro i knew you would do that otherwise i should not have let fly for all the angels know i do not wish to hurt you but to himself he added the lad is more dangerous than i thoughtmy life hangs on it the old fault friend too high too high  then adrian came at him like a tiger and for the next thirty seconds nothing was heard in the room but the raspings of steel and the hard breathing of the two men  at first adrian had somewhat the better of it for his assault was fierce and he forced the older and cooler man to be satisfied with guarding himself he did more indeed for presently thrusting over ramiros guard he wounded him slightly in the left arm the sting of his hurt seemed to stir ramiros blood at any rate he changed his tactics and began to attack in turn now moreover his skill and seasoned strength came to his aid slowly but surely adrian was driven back before him till his retreat in the narrow confines of the room became continuous suddenly half from exhaustion and half because of a stumble he reeled right across it to the further wall indeed with a guttural sound of triumph ramiro sprang after him to make an end of him while his guard was down caught his foot on a joined stool which had been overset in the struggle and fell prone to the ground  this was adrians chance in an instant he was on him and had the point of his rapier at his throat but he did not stab at once not from any compunction but because he wished his enemy to feel a little before he died for like all his race adrian could be vindictive and bloodthirsty enough when his hate was roused rapidly ramiro considered the position in a physical sense he was helpless for adrian had one foot upon his breast the other upon his swordarm and the steel at his throat therefore if time were given him he must trust to his wit  make ready you are about to die said adrian  i think not replied the prostrate ramiro  why not asked adrian astonished  if you will be so kind as to move that swordpoint a littleit is pricking methank you now i will tell you why because it is not usual for a son to stick his father as though he were a farmyard pig  son father said adrian do you mean  yes i do mean that we have the happiness of filling those sacred relationships to each other  you lie said adrian  let me stand up and give me my sword young sir and you shall pay for that never yet did a man tell the count juan de montalvo that he lied and live  prove it said adrian  in this position to which misfortune not skill has reduced me i can prove nothing but if you doubt it ask your mother or your hosts or consult the registers of the groote kerke and see whether on a date which i will give you juan de montalvo was or was not married to lysbeth van hout of which marriage was born one adrian man i will prove it to you had i not been your father would you have been saved from the inquisition with others and should i not within the last five minutes had run you through twice over for though you fought well your swordsmanship is no match for mine  even if you are my father why should i not kill you who have forced me to your will by threats of death you who wronged and shamed me you because of whom i have been hunted through the streets like a mad dog and made an outcast and adrian looked so fierce and brought down his sword so close that hope sank very low in ramiros heart  there are reasons which might occur to the religious he said but i will give you one that will appeal to your own selfinterest if you kill me the curse which follows the parricide will follow you to your last hourof the beyond i say nothing  it would need to be a heavy one answered adrian if it was worse than that of which i know but there was hesitation in his voice for ramiro the skilful player upon human hearts had struck the right string and adrians superstitious nature answered to the note  son went on ramiro be wise and hold your hand before you do that for which all hell itself would cry shame upon you you think that i have been your enemy but it is not so all this while i have striven to work you good but how can i talk lying thus like a calf before its butcher take the swords both of them and let me sit up and i will tell you all my plans for the advantage of us both or if you wish it thrust on and make an end i will not plead for my life with you it is not worthy of an hidalgo of spain moreover what is life to me who have known so many sorrows that i should seek to cling to it oh god who seest all receive my soul and i pray thee pardon this youth his horrible crime for he is mad and foolish and will live to sorrow for the deed  since it was no further use to him ramiro had let the sword fall from his hand drawing it towards him with the point of his own weapon adrian stooped and picked it up  rise he said lifting his foot i can kill you afterwards if i wish  could he have looked into the heart of his newfound parent as stiff and aching he staggered to his feet the execution would not have been long delayed  oh my young friend you have given me a nasty fright thought ramiro to himself but it is over now and if i dont pay you out before i have done with you my sweet boy your name is not adrian  ramiro rose dusted his garments seated himself deliberately and began to talk with great earnestness it will be sufficient to summarise his arguments first of all with the most convincing sincerity he explained that when he had made use of him adrian he had no idea that he was his son of course this was a statement that will not bear a moments examination but ramiros object was to gain time and adrian let it pass then he explained that it was only after his mother had not by his wish but accidentally seen the written evidence upon which her husband was convicted that he found out that adrian van goorl was her child and his own however as he hurried to point out all these things were now ancient history that had no bearing on the present owing to the turbulent violence of the mob which had driven him from his post and fortress he ramiro was in temporary difficulties and owing to other circumstances he adrian was so far as his own party and people were concerned an absolutely dishonoured person in this state of affairs he had a suggestion to make let them join forces let the natural relationship that existed between them and which had been so nearly severed by a sword thrust that both must have regretted become real and tender he the father had rank although it suited him to sink it he had wide experience friends intelligence and the prospect of enormous wealth which of course he could not expect to enjoy for ever on the other side he the son had youth great beauty of person agreeable and distinguished manners a high heart the education of a young man of the world ambition and powers of mind that would carry him far and for the immediate future an object to gain the affection of a lady whom all acknowledged to be as good as she was charming and as charming as she was personally attractive  she hates me broke in adrian  ah laughed ramiro there speaks the voice of small experience oh youth so easily exalted and so easily depressed joyous chequered youth how many happy marriages have i not known begin with such hate as this well there it is you must take my word for it if you want to marry elsa brant i can manage it for you and if not why you can leave it alone  adrian reflected then as his mind had a practical side he put a question  you spoke of the prospect of enormous wealth what is it  i will tell you i will tell you whispered his parent looking about him cautiously it is the vast hoard of hendrik brant which i intend to recover indeed my search for it has been at the root of all this trouble and now son you can see how open i have been with you for if you marry elsa that money will legally be your property and i can only claim whatever it may please you to give me well as to that question in the spirit of the glorious motto of our race trust to god and me i shall leave it to your sense of honour which whatever its troubles has never yet failed the house of montalvo what does it matter to me who is the legal owner of the stuff so long as it remains in the family  of course not replied adrian loftily especially as i am not mercenary  ah well went on ramiro we have talked for a long while and if i continue to live there are affairs to which i ought to attend you have heard all i have to say and you have the swords in your hand and of course i amonly your prisoner on parole so now my son be so good as to settle this matter without further delay only if you make up your mind to use the steel allow me to show you where to thrust as i do not wish to undergo any unnecessary discomfortand he stood before him and bowed in a very courtly and dignified fashion  adrian looked at him and hesitated i dont trust you he said you have tricked me once and i daresay that you will trick me again also i dont think much of people who masquerade under false names and lay such traps as you laid to get my evidence against the rest of them but i am in a bad place and without friends i want to marry elsa and recover my position in the world also as you know well i cant cut the throat of my own father in cold blood and he threw down one of the swords  your decision is just such as i would have expected from my knowledge of your noble nature son adrian remarked ramiro as he picked up his weapon and restored it to the scabbard but now before we enter upon this perfect accord i have two little stipulations to make on my side  what are they asked adrian  first that our friendship should be complete such as ought to exist between a loving father and son a friendship without reservations secondlythis is a condition that i fear you may find harderbut although fortune has led me into stony paths and i fear some doubtful expedients there was always one thing which i have striven to cherish and keep pure and that in turn has rewarded me for my devotion in many a dangerous hour my religious belief now i am catholic and i could wish that my son should be catholic also these horrible errors believe me are as dangerous to the soul as just now they happen to be fatal to the body may i hope that you who were brought up but not born in heresy will consent to receive instruction in the right faith  certainly you may answered adrian almost with enthusiasm i have had enough of conventicles psalmsinging and the daily chance of being burned indeed from the time when i could think for myself i always wished to be a catholic  your words make me a happy man answered ramiro allow me to unbolt the door i hear our hosts worthy simon and vrouw i make you parties to a solemn and joyful celebration this young man is my son and in token of my fatherly love which he has been pleased to desire i now take him in my arms and embrace him before you and he suited the action to the word  but black meg watching his face in astonishment from over adrians shoulder saw its one bright eye suddenly become eclipsed could it be that the noble master had winked    chapter xxiv  martha preaches a sermon and tells a secret  two days after his reconciliation with his father adrian was admitted as a member of the catholic church his preparation had been short indeed it consisted of three interviews with a priest who was brought to the house at night the good man found in his pupil so excellent a disposition and a mind so open to his teaching that acting on a hint given him by ramiro who for reasons of his own not altogether connected with religion was really anxious to see his son a member of the true and catholic church he declared it unnecessary to prolong the period of probation therefore on the third day as the dusk of evening was closing for in the present state of public feeling they dared not go out while it was light adrian was taken to the baptistry of the groote kerke here he made confession of his sins to a certain abbe known as father dominic a simple ceremony for although the list of them which he had prepared was long its hearing proved short thus all his offences against his family such as his betrayal of his stepfather were waived aside by the priest as matters of no account indeed crimes of this nature he discovered to the sacerdotal eye wore the face of virtue other misdoings also such as a young man might have upon his mind were not thought weighty what really was considered important proved to be the earnestness of his recantation of heretical errors and when once his confessor was satisfied upon that point the penitent soul was relieved by absolution full and free  after this came the service of his baptism which because ramiro wished it for a certain secret reason was carried out with as much formal publicity as the circumstances would allow indeed several priests officiated at the rite adrians sponsors being his father and the estimable hague simon who was paid a gold piece for his pains while the sacrament was still in progress an untoward incident occurred from its commencement the trampling and voices of a mob had been heard in the open space in front of the church and now they began to hammer on the great doors and to cast stones at the painted windows breaking the beautiful and ancient glass presently a beadle hurried into the baptistery and whispered something in the ear of the abbe which caused that ecclesiastic to turn pale and to conclude the service in a somewhat hasty fashion  what is it asked ramiro  alas my son said the priest these heretic dogs saw you or our newfound brother i know not whichenter this holy place and a great mob of them have surrounded it ravening for our blood  then we had best begone said ramiro  senor it is impossible broke in the sacristan they watch every door hark hark hark and as he spoke there came the sound of battering on the oaken portals  can your reverences make any suggestions asked ramiro for if not and he shrugged his shoulders  let us pray said one of them in a trembling voice  by all means but i should prefer to do so as i go fool is there any hiding place in this church or must we stop here to have our throats cut  then the sacristan with white lips and knocking knees whispered  follow me all of you stay blow out the lights  so the candles were extinguished and in the darkness they grasped each others hands and were led by the verger whither they knew not across the wide spaces of the empty church they crawled its echoing silence contrasting strangely with the muffled roar of angry voices without and the dull sound of battering on the doors one of their number the fat abbe dominic became separated from them in the gloom and wandered away down an arm of the vast transept whence they could hear him calling to them the sacristan called back but ramiro fiercely bade him to be silent adding  are we all to be snared for the sake of one priest  so they went on till presently in that great place his shouts grew fainter and were lost in the roar of the multitude without  here is the spot muttered the sacristan after feeling the floor with his hands and by a dim ray of moonlight which just then pierced the windows of the choir adrian saw that there was a hole in the pavement before him  descend there are steps said their guide i will shut the stone and one by one they passed down six or seven narrow steps into some darksome place  where are we asked a priest of the verger when he had pulled the stone close and joined them  in the family vault of the noble count van valkenburg whom your reverence buried three days ago fortunately the masons have not yet come to cement down the stone if your excellencies find it close you can get air by standing upon the coffin of the noble count  adrian did find it close and took the hint to discover that in a line with his head was some filigree stonework pierced with small apertures the front doubtless of the marble tomb in the church above for through them he could see the pale moon rays wavering on the pavement of the choir as he looked the priest at his side muttered  hark the doors are down aid us st pancras and falling upon his knees he began to pray very earnestly  yielding at last to the blows of the batteringbeam the great portals had flown open with a crash and now through them poured the mob on they came with a rush and a roar like that of the sea breaking through a dyke carrying in their hands torches lanterns hung on poles axes swords and staves till at length they reached the screen of wonderful carved oak on the top of which rising to a height of sixty feet above the floor of the church stood the great rood with the images of the virgin and st john on either side here of a sudden the vastness and the silence of the holy place which they had known every one from childhood with its echoing aisles the moonlit pictured windows its consecrated lamps twinkling here and there like fisher lights upon the darkling waters seemed to take hold of them as at the sound of the voice divine sweeping down the wild waves at night the winds ceased their raving and the seas were still so now beneath the silent reproach of the effigy of the white christ standing with uplifted hand above the altar hanging thorncrowned upon the rood kneeling agonised within the garden seated at the holy supper on his lips the new commandment as i have loved you so ye also love one another their passions flickered down and their wrath slept  they are not here let us be going said a voice  they are here answered another voice a womans voice with a note of vengeance in it i tracked them to the doors the spanish murderer ramiro the spy hague simon the traitor adrian called van goorl and the priests the priests the priests who butcher us  let god deal with them said the first voice which to adrian sounded familiar we have done enough go home in peace  now muttering the pastor is right obey the pastor arentz the more orderly of the multitude turned to depart when suddenly from the far end of the transept arose a cry  heres one of them catch him catch him a minute more and into the circle of the torchlight rushed the abbe dominic his eyes starting from his head with terror his rent robe flapping on the ground exhausted and bewildered he cast himself down and grasping the pedestal of an image began to cry for mercy till a dozen fierce hands dragged him to his feet again  let him go said the voice of the pastor arentz we fight the church not its ministers  hear me first she answered who had spoken before and men turned to see standing above them in the great pulpit of the church a fierceeyed yellowtoothed hag greyhaired skinnyarmed longfaced like a horse and behind her two other women each of whom held a torch in her right hand  it is the mare roared the multitude it is martha of the mere preach on martha whats your text  whoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed she answered in a ringing solemn voice and instantly a deep silence fell upon the place  you call me the mare she went on do you know how i got that name they gave it me after they had shrivelled up my lips and marred the beauty of my face with irons and do you know what they made me do they made me carry my husband to the stake upon my back because they said that a horse must be ridden and do you know who said this that priest who stands before you  as the words left her lips a yell of rage beat against the roof martha held up her thin hand and again there was silence  he said itthe holy father dominic let him deny it if he can what he does not know me perchance not for time and grief and madness and hot pincers have changed the face of vrouw martha van muyden who was called the lily of brussels ah look at him now he remembers the lily of brussels he remembers her husband and her son also for he burned them o god judge between us o people deal with that devil as god shall teach you  who are the others he who is called ramiro the governor of the gevangenhuis the man who years ago would have thrust me beneath the ice to drown had not the vrouw van goorl bought my life he who set her husband dirk van goorl the man you loved to starve to death sniffing the steam of kitchens o people deal with that devil as god shall teach you  and the third the halfspaniard the traitor adrian called van goorl he who has come here tonight to be baptised anew into the bosom of the holy church he who signed the evidence upon which dirk was murderedhere again the roar of hate and rage went up and beat along the roofupon which too his brother foy was taken to the torture whence red martin saved him o people do with that devil also as god shall teach you  and the fourth hague simon the spy the man whose hands for years have smoked with innocent blood simon the butchersimon the false witness  enough enough roared the crowd a rope a rope up with him to the arm of the rood  my friends cried arentz let the man go vengeance is mine saith the lord and i will repay  yes but we will give him something on account shouted a voice in bitter blasphemy well climbed jan well climbed and they looked up to see sixty feet above their heads seated upon the arm of the lofty rood a man with a candle bound upon his brow and a coil of rope upon his back  hell fall said one  pish answered another it is steeplejack jan who can hang on a wall like a fly  look out for the ends of the rope cried the thin voice above and down they came  spare me screamed the wretched priest as his executioners caught hold of him  yes yes as you spared the heer jansen a few months ago  it was to save his soul groaned dominic  quite so and now we are going to save yours your own medicine father your own medicine  spare me and i will tell you where the others are  well where are they asked the ringleader pushing his companions away  hidden in the church hidden in the church  we knew that you traitorous dog now then for the soulsaving catch hold there and run away with it a horse should be ridden fatheryour own sayingand an angel must learn to fly  thus ended the life of the abbe dominic at the hands of avenging men without a doubt they were fierce and bloodyminded for the reader must not suppose that all the wickedness of those days lies on the heads of the inquisition and the spaniards the adherents of the new religion did evil things also things that sound dreadful in our ears in excuse of them however this can be urged that compared to those of their oppressors they were as single trees to a forest full also that they who worked them had been maddened by their sufferings if our fathers husbands and brothers had been burned at the stake or done to death under the name of jesus in the dens of the inquisition or slaughtered by thousands in the sack of towns if our wives and daughters had been shamed if our houses had been burned our goods taken our liberties trampled upon and our homes made a desolation then my reader is it not possible that even in these different days you and i might have been cruel when our hour came god knows alone and god be thanked that so far as we can foresee except under the pressure perhaps of invasion by semibarbarian hordes or of dreadful and sudden social revolutions civilized human nature will never be put to such a test again  far aloft in the gloom there swinging from the arm of the cross whose teachings his life had mocked like some mutinous sailor at the yard of the vessel he had striven to betray the priest hung dead but his life did not appease the fury of the triumphant mob  the others they cried find the others and with torches and lanterns they hunted round the great church they ascended the belfry they rummaged the chapels they explored the crypt then baffled drew together in a countless crowd in the nave shouting gesticulating suggesting  get dogs cried a voice dogs will smell them out and dogs were brought which yapped and ran to and fro but confused by the multitude and not knowing what to seek found nothing then some one threw an image from a niche and next minute with a cry of down with the idols the work of destruction began  fanatics sprang at the screens and the altars all the carved work thereof they break down with hatchet and hammer they tore the hangings from the shrines they found the sacred cups and filling them with sacramental wine drank with gusts of ribald laughter in the centre of the choir they built a bonfire and fed it with pictures carvings and oaken benches so that it blazed and roared furiously on to itfor this mob did not come to steal but to work vengeancethey threw utensils of gold and silver the priceless jewelled offerings of generations and danced around its flames in triumph while from every side came the crash of falling statues and the tinkling of shattered glass  the light of that furnace shone through the lattice stonework of the tomb and in its lurid and ominous glare adrian beheld the faces of those who refuged with him what a picture it was the niches filled with mouldering boxes the white gleam of human bones that here and there had fallen from them the bright furnishings and velvet pall of the coffin of the newcomer on which he stoodand then those faces the priests still crouched in corners rolling on the ground their white lips muttering who knows what the sacristan in a swoon hague simon hugging a coffin in a niche as a drowning man hugs a plank and standing in the midst of them calm sardonic and watchful a drawn rapier in his hand his father ramiro  we are lost moaned a priest losing control of himself we are lost they will kill us as they have killed the holy abbe  we are not lost hissed ramiro we are quite safe but friend if you open that cursed mouth of yours again it shall be for the last time and he lifted his sword adding silence he who speaks dies  how long did it last was it one hour or two or three none of them knew but at length the imagebreaking was done and it came to an end the interior of the church with all its wealth and adornments was utterly destroyed but happily the flames did not reach the roof and the walls could not catch fire  by degrees the iconoclasts wearied there seemed to be nothing more to break and the smoke choked them two or three at a time they left the ravaged place and once more it became solemn and empty a symbol of eternity mocking time of peace conquering tumult of the patience and purpose of god triumphant over the passions and ravings of man little curls of smoke went up from the smouldering fire now and again a fragment of shattered stonework fell with an echoing crash and the cold wind of the coming winter sighed through the gaping windows the deed was done the revenge of a tortured multitude had set its seal upon the ancient fane in which their forefathers worshipped for a score of generations and once more quiet brooded upon the place and the shafts of the sweet moonlight pierced its desecrated solitudes  one by one like ghosts arising at a summons of the spirit the fugitives crept from the shelter of the tomb crept across the transepts to the little door of the baptistery and with infinite peeping and precaution out into the night to vanish this way and that hugging their hearts as though to feel whether they still beat safely in their bosoms  as he passed the rood adrian looked up and there above the broken carvings and the shattered statue of the virgin hung the calm face of the saviour crowned with thorns there too not far from it looking small and infinitely piteous at that great height and revolving slowly in the sharp draught from the broken windows hung another dead face the horrid face of the abbe dominic lately the envied prosperous dignitary and pluralist who not four hours since had baptised him into the bosom of the church and who now himself had been born again into the bosom of whatever world awaited him beyond the gates it terrified adrian no ghost could have frightened him more but he set his teeth and staggered on guided by the light gleaming faintly on the sword of ramiroto whatever haven that sword should lead him  before dawn broke it had led him out of leyden    it was after ten oclock that night when a woman wrapped in a rough frieze coat knocked at the door of the house in the bree straat and asked for the vrouw van goorl  my mistress lies between life and death with the plague answered the servant get you gone from this pesthouse whoever you are  i do not fear the plague said the visitor is the jufvrouw elsa brant still up then tell her that martha called the mare would speak with her  she can see none at such an hour answered the servant  tell her i come from foy van goorl  enter said the servant wondering and shut the door behind her  a minute later elsa palefaced worn but still beautiful rushed into the room gasping what news does he live is he well  he lives lady but he is not well for the wound in his thigh has festered and he cannot walk or even stand nay have no fear time and clean dressing will heal him and he lies in a safe place  in the rapture of her relief elsa seized the womans hand and would have kissed it  touch it not it is bloodstained said martha drawing her hand away  blood whose blood is on it asked elsa shrinking back  whose blood answered martha with a hollow laugh why that of many a spanish man where think you lady that the mare gallops of nights ask it of the spaniards who travel by the haarlemer meer aye and now red martin is with me and we run together taking our tithe where we can gather it  oh tell me no more said elsa from day to day it is ever the same tale a tale of death nay i know your wrongs have driven you mad but that a woman should slay  a woman i am no woman my womanhood died with my husband and my son girl i tell you that i am no woman i am a sword of god myself appointed to the sword and so to the end i kill and kill and kill till the hour when i am killed go look in the church yonder and see who hangs to the high arm of the roodthe fat abbe dominic well i sent him there tonight tomorrow you will hear how i turned parson and preached a sermonaye and ramiro and adrian called van goorl and simon the spy should have joined him there only i could not find them because their hour has not come but the idols are down and the paintings burnt and the gold and silver and jewels are cast upon the dungheap swept and garnished is the temple made clean and fit for the lord to dwell in  made clean with the blood of murdered priests and fit by the smoke of sacrilege broke in elsa oh woman how can you do such wicked things and not be afraid  afraid she answered those who have passed through hell have no more fear death i seek and when judgment comes i will say to the lord what have i done that the voice which speaks to me at night did not tell me to do look down the blood of my husband and my son still smokes upon the ground hearken lord god it cries to thee for vengeance and as she spoke she lifted her blackened hands and shook them then she went on  they murdered your father why do you not kill them also you are small and weak and timid and could not run by night and use the knife as i do but there is poison i can brew it and bring it to you made from marsh herbs white as water and deadly as death itself what you shrink from such things well girl once i was beautiful as you and as loving and beloved and i can do them for my loves sakefor my loves sake nay i do not do them they are done through me the sword am i the sword and you too are a sword though you know it not though you see it not you maiden so soft and white and sweet are a sword of vengeance working the death of men i in my way you in yours paying back back back full measure pressed down and running over to those appointed to die the treasure of hendrik brant your treasure it is red with blood every piece of it i tell you that the deaths that i have done are but as a grain of sand to a bowlful compared to those which your treasure shall do there maid i fright you have no fear it is but mad martha who when she sees must speak and through the flames in the kirk tonight i saw visions such as i have not seen for years  tell me more of foy and martin said elsa who was frightened and bewildered  at her words a change seemed to come over this woman at once an object of pity and of terror for the scream went out of her voice and she answered quietly  they reached me safe enough five days ago red martin carrying foy upon his back from afar i saw him a naked man with a named sword and knew him by his size and beard and oh when i heard his tale i laughed as i have not laughed since i was young  tell it me said elsa  and she told it while the girl listened with clasped hands  oh it was brave brave she murmured red martin forcing to the door and foy weak and wounded slaying the warder was there ever such a story  men are brave and desperate with the torture pit behind them answered martha grimly but they did well and now they are safe with me where no spaniard can find them unless they hunt in great companies after the ice forms and the reeds are dead  would that i could be there also said elsa but i tend his mother who is very sick so sick that i do not know whether she will live or die  nay you are best here among your people answered martha and now that the spaniards are driven out here foy shall return also so soon as it is safe for him to travel but as yet he cannot stir and red martin stays to watch him before long however he must move for i have tidings that the spaniards are about to besiege haarlem with a great army and then the mere will be no longer safe for us and i shall leave it to fight with the haarlem folk  and foy and martin will return  i think so if they are not stopped  stoppedand she put her hand upon her heart  the times are rough jufvrouw elsa who that breathes the air one morning can know what breath will pass his nostrils at the nightfall the times are rough and death is king of them the hoard of hendrik brant is not forgotten nor those who have its key ramiro slipped through my hands tonight and doubtless by now is far away from leyden seeking the treasure  the treasure oh that thrice accursed treasure broke in elsa shivering as though beneath an icy wind would that we were rid of it  that you cannot be until it is appointed for is this not the heritage which your father died to save listen do you know lady where it lies hid and she dropped her voice to a whisper  elsa shook her head saying  i neither know nor wish to know  still it is best that you should be told for we three who have the secret may be killed every one of usno not the place but where to seek a clue to the place  elsa looked at her questioningly and martha leaning forward whispered in her ear  it lies in the hilt of the sword silence if red martin should be taken or killed seek out his sword and open the hilt do you understand  elsa nodded and answered but if aught happens to martin the sword may be lost  martha shrugged her shoulders then the treasure will be lost also that is if i am gone it is as god wills but at least in name you are the heiress and you should know where to find its secret which may serve you or your country in good stead in time to come i give you no paper i tell you only where to seek a paper and now i must be gone to reach the borders of the mere by daybreak have you any message for your love lady  i would write a word if you can wait they will bring you food  good write on and i will eat love for the young and meat for the old and for both let god be thanked    chapter xxv  the red mill  after a weeks experience of that delectable dwelling and its neighbourhood adrian began to grow weary of the red mill nine or ten dutch miles to the norwest of haarlem is a place called velsen situated on the borders of the sanddunes to the south of what is known today as the north sea canal in the times of which this page of history tells however the canal was represented by a great drainage dyke and velsen was but a deserted village indeed hereabouts all the country was deserted for some years before a spanish force had passed through it burning slaying laying waste so that few were left to tend the windmills and repair the dyke holland is a country won from swamps and seas and if the water is not pumped out of it and the ditches are not cleaned very quickly it relapses into primeval marsh indeed it is fortunate if the ocean bursting through the feeble barriers reared by the industry of man does not turn it into vast lagoons of salt water  once the red mill had been a pumping station which when the huge sails worked delivered the water from the fertile meadows into the great dyke whence it ran through sluice gates to the north sea now although the embankment of this dyke still held the meadows had gone back into swamps rising out of thesefor it was situated upon a low mound of earth raised doubtless as a point of refuge by marshdwellers who lived and died before history began towered the wreck of a narrowwaisted windmill built of brick below and wood above of very lonesome and commanding appearance in its gaunt solitude there were no houses near it no cattle grazed about its foot it was a dead thing in a dead landscape to the left but separated from it by a wide and slimy dyke whence in times of flood the thick brackish water trickled to the plain stretched an arid area of sanddunes clothed with sparse grass that grew like bristles upon the back of a wild hog beyond these dunes the ocean roared and moaned and whispered hungrily as the wind and weather stirred its depths in front not fifty paces away ran the big dyke like a raised road secured by embankments and discharging day by day its millions of gallons of water into the sea but these embankments were weakening now and here and there could be seen a spot which looked as though a giant ploughshare had been drawn up them for a groove of brown earth scarred the face of green where in some winter flood the water had poured over to find its level cutting them like cheese but when its volume sank leaving them still standing and as yet sufficient for their purpose  to the right again and behind were more marshes broken only in the distance by the towers of haarlem and the spires of village churches marshes where the snipe and bittern boomed the herons fed and in summer the frogs croaked all night long  such was the refuge to which ramiro and his son adrian had been led by hague simon and black meg after they had escaped with their lives from leyden upon the night of the imagebreaking in the church that ominous night when the abbe dominic gave up the ghost on the arm of the lofty rood and adrian had received absolution and baptism from his consecrated hand  on the journey hither adrian asked no questions as to their destination he was too broken in heart and too shaken in body to be curious life in those days was for him too much of a hideous phantasmagoria of waste and blackness out of which appeared vengeful redhanded figures out of which echoed dismal despairing voices calling him to doom  they came to the place and found its great basement and the floors above or some of them furnished after a fashion the mill had been inhabited and recently as adrian gathered by smugglers or thieves with whom meg and simon were in alliance or some such outcast evildoers who knew that here the arm of the law could not reach them though indeed while alva ruled in the netherlands there was little law to be feared by those who were rich or who dared to worship god after their own manner  why have we come herefather adrian was about to add but the word stuck in his throat  ramiro shrugged his shoulders and looked round him with his one criticising eye  because our guides and friends the worthy simon and his wife assure me that in this spot alone our throats are for the present safe and by st pancras after what we saw in the church yonder i am inclined to agree with them he looked a poor thing up under the roof there the holy father dominic didnt he hanging up like a black spider from the end of his cord bah my backbone aches when i think of him  and how long are we to stop here  tilltill don frederic has taken haarlem and these fat hollanders or those who are left of them lick our boots for mercy and he ground his teeth then added son do you play cards good well let us have a game here are dice it will serve to turn our thoughts now then a hundred guilders on it  so they played and adrian won whereon to his amazement his father paid him the money  what is the use of that asked adrian  gentlemen should always pay their debts at cards  and if they cannot  then they must keep score of the amount and discharge it when they are able look you young man everything else you may forget but what you lose over the dice is a debt of honour there lives no man who can say that i cheated him of a guilder at cards though i fear some others have my name standing in their books  when they rose from their game that night adrian had won between three and four hundred florins next day his winnings amounted to a thousand florins for which his father gave him a carefullyexecuted note of hand but at the third sitting the luck changed or perhaps skill began to tell and he lost two thousand florins these he paid up by returning his fathers note his own winnings and all the balance of the purse of gold which his mother had given to him when he was driven from the house so that now he was practically penniless  the rest of the history may be guessed at every game the stakes were increased for since adrian could not pay it was a matter of indifference to him how much he wagered moreover he found a kind of mild excitement in playing at the handling of such great sums of money by the end of a week he had lost a queens dowry as they rose from the table that night his father filled in the usual form requested him to be so good as to sign it and a sourfaced woman who had arrived at the mill adrian knew not whence to do the household work to put her name as witness  what is the use of this farce asked adrian brants treasure would scarcely pay that bill  his father pricked his ears  indeed i lay it at as much again what is the use who knowsone day you might become rich for as the great emperor said fortune is a woman who reserves her favours for the young and then doubtless being the man of honour that you are you would wish to pay your old gambling debts  oh yes i should pay if i could answered adrian with a yawn but it seems hardly worthy while talking about does it and he sauntered out of the place into the open air  his father rose and standing by the great peat fire watched him depart thoughtfully  let me take stock of the position he said to himself the dear child hasnt a farthing left therefore although he is getting bored he cant run away moreover he owes me more money than i ever saw therefore if he should chance to become the husband of the jufvrouw brant and the legal owner of her parents wealth whatever disagreements may ensue between him and me i shall have earned my share of it in a clean and gentlemanly fashion if on the other hand it should become necessary for me to marry the young lady which god forbid at least no harm is done and he will have had the advantage of some valuable lessons from the most accomplished cardplayer in spain  and now what we need to enliven this detestable place is the presence of beauty herself our worthy friends should be back soonbringing their sheaves with them let us hope for otherwise matters will be complicated let me see have i thought of everything for in such affairs one oversighthe is a catholic therefore can contract a legal marriage under the proclamationsit was lucky i remembered that point of law though it nearly cost us all our livesand the priest i can lay my hands on him a discreet man who wont hear if the lady says no but filled beyond a question with the power and virtue of his holy office no i have nothing to reproach myself with in the way of precaution nothing at all i have sown the seed well and truly it remains only for providence to give the increase or shall i sayno i think not for between the general and the private familiarity is always odious well it is time that you met with a little success and settled down for you have worked hard juan my friend and you are getting oldyes juan you are getting old bah what a hole and what weather and montalvo established himself by the fireside to doze away his ennui  when adrian shut the door behind him the late november day was drawing to its close and between the rifts in the sullen snow clouds now and again an arrow from the westering sun struck upon the tall skeletonlike sails of the mill through which the wind rushed with a screaming noise adrian had intended to walk on the marsh but finding it too sodden he crossed the western dyke by means of a board laid from bank to bank and struck into the sanddunes beyond even in the summer when the air was still and flowers bloomed and larks sang these dunes were fantastic and almost unnatural in appearance with their deep windscooped hollows of pallid sand their sharp angles miniature cliffs and their crests crowned with coarse grasses but now beneath the dull pall of the winter sky no spot in the world could have been more lonesome or more desolate for never a sign of man was to be seen upon them and save for a solitary curlew whose sad note reached adrians ears as it beat up wind from the sea even the beasts and birds that dwelt there had hidden themselves away only the voices of nature remained in all their majesty the drear screams and moan of the rushing wind and above it now low and now voluminous as the gale veered the deep and constant roar of the ocean  adrian reached the highest crest of the ridge whence the sea hidden hitherto became suddenly visible a vast slatecoloured expanse twisted here and there into heaps hollowed here and there into valleys and broken everywhere with angry lines and areas of white in such trouble for after its own fashion his heart was troubled some temperaments might have found a kind of consolation in this sight for while we witness them at any rate the throes and moods of nature in their greatness declare a mastery of our senses and stun or hush to silence the petty turmoil of our souls this at least is so with those who have eyes to read the lesson written on natures face and ears to hear the message which day by day she delivers with her lips gifts given only to such as hold the cypherkey of imagination and pray for grace to use it  in adrians case however the weirdness of the sandhills and the grandeur of the seascape with the bitter wind that blew between and the solitude which brooded over all served only to exasperate nerves that already were strained well nigh to breaking  why had his father brought him to this hideous swamp bordered by a sailless sea to save their lives from the fury of the mob this he understood but there was more in it than that some plot which he did not understand and which the ruffian hague simon and that shefiend his companion had gone away to execute meanwhile he must sit here day after day playing cards with the wretch ramiro whom for no fault of his own god had chosen out to be his parent by the way why was the man so fond of playing cards and what was the meaning of all that nonsense about notes of hand yes here he must sit and for company he had the sense of his unalterable shame the memory of his mothers face as she spurned and rejected him the vision of the woman whom he loved and had lost andthe ghost of dirk van goorl  he shivered as he thought of it yes his hair lifted and his lip twitched involuntarily for to adrians racked nerves and distorted vision this ghost of the good man whom he had betrayed was no child of phantasy he had woken in the night and seen it standing at his bedside plaguedefiled and hungerwasted and because of it he dreaded to sleep alone especially in that creaking rathaunted mill whose very board seemed charged with some tale of death and blood heavens at this very moment he thought he could hear that dead voice calling down the gale no it must be the curlew but at least he would be going home homethat place homewith not even a priest near to confess to and be comforted  thanks be to the saints the wind had dropped a little but now in place of it came the snow dense whirling white so dense indeed that he could scarcely see his path what an end that would be to be frozen to death in the snow on these sandhills while the spirit of dirk van goorl sat near and watched him die with those hollow hungry eyes the sweat came upon adrians forehead at the thought and he broke into a run heading for the bank of the great dyke that pierced the dunes half a mile or so away which bank must he knew lead him to the mill he reached it and trudged along what had been the towpath though now it was overgrown with weeds and rushes it was not a pleasant journey for the twilight had closed in with speed and the thick flakes that seemed to heap into his face and sting him turned it into a darkness mottled with faint white still he stumbled forward with bent head and closewrapped cloak till he judged that he must be near to the mill and halted staring through the gloom  just then the snow ceased for a while and light crept back to the cold face of the earth showing adrian that he had done well to halt in front of where he stood within a few paces of his feet indeed for a distance of quite twenty yards the lower part of the bank had slipped away washed from the stone core with which it was faced at this point by a slow and neglected percolation of water had he walked on therefore he would have fallen his own height or more into a slough of mud whence he might or might not have been able to extricate himself as it was however by such light as remained he could crawl upon the coping of the stonework which was still held in place with old struts of timber that until they had been denuded by the slow and constant leakage were buried and supported in the vanished earthwork it was not a pleasant bridge for to the right lay the mudbottomed gulf and to the left almost level with his feet were the black and peaty waters of the rainfed dyke pouring onwards to the sea  next flood this will go thought adrian to himself and then the marsh must become a mere which will be bad for whomever happens to be living in the red mill he was on firm ground again now and there looming tall and spectral against the gloom not five hundred yards away rose the gaunt sails of the mill to reach it he walked on six score paces or more to the little landingquay where a raised path ran to the building as he drew near to it he was astonished to hear the rattle of oars working in rollocks and a mans voice say  steady here is the place praise the saints now then out passengers and let us be gone  adrian whom events had made timid drew beneath the shadow of the bank and watched while from the dim outline of the boat arose three figures or rather two figures arose dragging the third between them  hold her said a voice that seemed familiar while i give these men their hire and there followed a noise of clinking coin mingled with some oaths and grumbling about the weather and the distance which were abated with more coin then again the oars rattled and the boat was pushed off whereon a sweet voice cried in agonised tones  sirs you who have wives and daughters will you leave me in the hands of these wretches in the name of god take pity upon my helplessness  it is a shame and she so fair a maid grumbled another thick and raucous voice but the steersman cried mind your business marsh jan we have done our job and got our pay so leave the gentry to settle their own love affairs good night to you passengers give way give way and the boat swung round and vanished into the gloom  for a moment adrians heart stood still then he sprang forward to see before him hague simon the butcher black meg his wife and between them a bundle wrapped in shawls  what is this he asked  you ought to know heer adrian answered black meg with a chuckle seeing that this charming piece of goods has been brought all the way from leyden regardless of expense for your especial benefit  the bundle lifted its head and the faint light shone upon the white and terrified face ofelsa brant  may god reward you for this evil deed adrian called van goorl said the pitiful voice  this deed what deed he stammered in answer i know nothing of it elsa brant  you know nothing of it yet it was done in your name and you are here to receive me who was kidnapped as i walked outside leyden to be dragged hither with force by these monsters oh have you no heart and no fear of judgment that you can speak thus  free her roared adrian rushing at the butcher to see a knife gleaming in his hand and another in that of black meg  stop your nonsense master adrian and stand back if you have anything to say say it to your father the count come let us pass for we are cold and weary and taking elsa by the elbows they brushed past him nor indeed even had he not been too bewildered to interfere could adrian have stayed them for he was unarmed besides where would be the use seeing that the boat had gone and that they were alone on a winters night in the windswept wilderness with no refuge for miles save such as the mill house could afford so adrian bent his head for the snow had begun to fall again and sick at heart followed them along the path now he understood at length why they had come to the red mill  simon opened the door and entered but elsa hung back at its illomened threshold she even tried to struggle a little poor girl whereon the ruffian in front jerked her towards him with an oath so that she caught her foot and fell upon her face this was too much for adrian springing forward he struck the butcher full in the mouth with his fist and next moment they were rolling over and over each other upon the floor struggling fiercely for the knife which simon held  during all her life elsa never forgot that scene behind her the howling blackness of the night and the open door through which flake by flake the snow leapt into the light in front the large round room fashioned from the basement of the mill lit only by the great fire of turfs and a single horn lantern hung from the ceiling that was ribbed with beams of black and massive oak and there in this forbidding nakedlooking place that rocked and quivered as the gale caught the tall arms of the mill above seated by the hearth in a rude chair of wood and sleeping one man ramiro the spanish sleuthhound who had hunted down her father he whom above every other she held in horror and in hate and two adrian and the spy at deathgrips on the floor between them the sheen of a naked knife  such was the picture  ramiro awoke at the noise and there was fear on his face as though some ill dream lingered in his brain next instant he saw and understood  i will run the man through who strikes another blow he said in a cold clear voice as he drew his sword stand up you fools and tell me what this means  it means that this brute beast but now threw elsa brant upon her face gasped adrian as he rose and i punished him  it is a lie hissed the other i pulled the minx on that is all and so would you have done if you had been cursed with such a wildcat for fourandtwenty hours why when we took her she was more trouble to hold than any man  oh i understand interrupted ramiro who had recovered his composure a little maidenly reluctance that is all my worthy simon and as for this young gentleman a little loverlike anxietydoubtless in bygone years you have felt the same and he glanced mockingly at black meg so do not be too ready to take offence good simon youth will be youth  and youth will get a knife between its ribs if it is not careful grumbled hague simon as he spat out a piece of broken tooth  why am i brought here senor broke in elsa in defiance of laws and justice  laws mejufvrouw i did not know that there were any left in the netherlands justice well all is fair in love and war as any lady will admit and the reason whyi think you must ask adrian he knows more about it than i do  he says that he knows nothing senor  does he the rogue does he indeed well it would be rude to contradict him wouldnt it so i for one unreservedly accept his statement that he knows nothing and i advise you to do the same no no my boy do not trouble to explain we all quite understand now my good dame he went on addressing the servingwoman who had entered the place take this young lady to the best room you have above and listen both of you she is to be treated with all kindness do you hear for if any harm comes to her either at your hands or her own by heaven you shall pay for it to the last drop of your blood now no excuses andno mistakes  the two women meg and the other nodded and motioned to elsa to accompany them she considered a moment looking first at ramiro and next at adrian then her head dropped upon her breast and turning without a word she followed them up the creaking oaken stair that rose from a niche near the wall of the inglenook  father said adrian when the massive door had closed behind her and they were left alonefatherfor i suppose that i must call you so  there is not the slightest necessity broke in ramiro facts my dear son need not always be paraded in the cold light of dayfortunately but proceed  what does all this mean  i wish i could tell you it appears to mean however that without any effort upon your part for you seem to me a young man singularly devoid of resource your love affairs are prospering beyond expectation  i have had nothing to do with the business i wash my hands of it  that is as well some sensitive people might think they need a deal of washing you young fool he went on dropping his mocking manner listen to me you are in love with this pink and white piece of goods and i have brought her here for you to marry  and i refuse to marry her against her will  as to that you can please yourself but somebody has got to marry heryou or i  youyou gasped adrian  quite so the adventure is not one to be frank that attracts me at my age memories are sufficient but material interests must be attended to so if you declinewell i am still eligible and hearty do you see the point  no what is it  it is a sound title to the inheritance of the departed hendrik brant that wealth we might it is true obtain by artifice or by arms but how much better that it should come into the family in a regular fashion thereby ousting the claim of the crown things in this country are disturbed at present but they will not always be disturbed for in the end somebody must give way and order will prevail then questions might be asked for persons in possession of great riches are always the mark of envy but if the heiress is married to a good catholic and loyal subject of the king who can cavil at rights sanctified by the laws of god and man think it over my dear adrian think it over stepmother or wifeyou can take your choice  with impotent rage with turmoil of heart and torment of conscience adrian did think it over all that night he thought tossing on his rathaunted pallet while without the snow whirled and the wind beat if he did not marry elsa his father would and there could be no doubt as to which of these alternatives would be best and happiest for her elsa married to that wicked cynical devilpossessed battered fortunehunting adventurer with a nameless past this must be prevented at any cost with his father her lot must be a hell with himselfafter a period of storm and doubt perhapsit could scarcely be other than happy for was he not young handsome sympathetic anddevoted ah there was the real point he loved this lady with all the earnestness of which his nature was capable and the thought of her passing into the possession of another man gave him the acutest anguish that the man should be foy his halfbrother was bad enough that it should be ramiro his father was insupportable  at breakfast the following morning when elsa did not appear the pair met  you look pale adrian said his father presently i fear that this wild weather kept you awake last night as it did me although at your age i have slept through the roar of a battle well have you thought over our conversation i do not wish to trouble you with these incessant family matters but times presses and it is necessary to decide  adrian looked out of the lattice at the snow which fell and fell without pause then he turned and said  yes of the two it is best that she should marry me though i think that such a crime will bring its own reward  wise young man answered his father under all your cloakings of vagary i observe that you have a foundation of commonsense just as the giddiest weathercock is bedded on a stone as for the reward considered properly it seems to be one upon which i can heartily congratulate you  peace to that talk said adrian angrily you forget that there are two parties to such a contract her consent must be gained and i will not ask it  no then i will a few arguments occur to me now look here friend we have struck a bargain and you will be so good as to keep it or to take the consequencesoh never mind what they are i will bring this lady to the altaror rather to that table and you will marry her after which you can settle matters just exactly as you please live with her as your wife or make your bow and walk away which i care nothing so long as you are married now i am weary of all this talk so be so good as to leave me in peace on the subject  adrian looked at him opened his lips to speak then changed his mind and marched out of the house into the blinding snow  thank heaven he is gone at last reflected his father and called for hague simon with whom he held a long and careful interview  you understand he ended  i understand answered simon sulkily i am to find this priest who should be waiting at the place you name and to bring him here by nightfall tomorrow which is a rough job for a christian man in such weather as this  the pay friend simon remember the pay  oh yes it all sounds well enough but i should like something on account  you shall have itis not such a labourer worthy of his hire replied his employer with enthusiasm and producing from his pocket the purse which lysbeth had given adrian with a smile of peculiar satisfaction for really the thing had a comic side he counted a handsome sum into the hand of this emissary of venus  simon looked at the money concluded after some reflection that it would scarcely do to stand out for more at present pouched it and having wrapped himself in a thick frieze coat opened the door and vanished into the falling snow    chapter xxvi  the bridegroom and the bride  the day passed and through every hour of it the snow fell incessantly night came and it was still falling in large soft flakes that floated to the earth gently as thistledown for now there was no wind adrian met his father at meals only the rest of the day he preferred to spend out of doors in the snow or hanging about the old sheds at the back of the mill rather than endure the society of this terrible man this man of mocking words and iron purpose who was forcing him into the commission of a great crime  it was at breakfast on the following morning that ramiro inquired of black mag whether the jufvrouw brant had sufficiently recovered from the fatigues of her journey to honour them with her presence the woman replied that she absolutely refused to leave her room or even to speak more than was necessary  then said ramiro as it is important that i should have a few words with her be so good as to tell the young lady with my homage that i will do myself the honour of waiting on her in the course of the forenoon  meg departed on her errand and adrian looked up suspiciously  calm yourself young friend said his father although the interview will be private you have really no cause for jealousy at present remember i am but the second string in the bowcase the understudy who has learnt the part a humble position but one which may prove useful  at all of which gibes adrian winced but he did not reply for by now he had learned that he was no match for his fathers bitter wit  elsa received the message as she received everything else in silence  three days before as after a fearful illness during which on several occasions she was at the very doors of death lysbeth van goorl had been declared out of danger elsa her nurse ventured to leave her for a few hours that evening the town seemed to stifle her and feeling that she needed the air of the country she passed the morsch poort and walked a little way along the banks of the canal never noticing poor girl that her footsteps were dogged when it began to grow dusk she halted and stood a while gazing towards the haarlemer meer letting her heart go out to the lover who as she thought and hoped within a day or two would be at her side  then it was that something was thrown over her head and for a while all was black she awoke to find herself lying in a boat and watching her two wretches whom she recognised as those who had assailed her when first she came to leyden from the hague  why have you kidnapped me and where am i going she asked  because we are paid to do it and you are going to adrian van goorl was the answer  then she understood and was silent  thus they brought her to this lonesome murderouslooking place where sure enough adrian was waiting for her waiting with a lie upon his lips now doubtless the end was at hand she who loved his brother with all her heart and soul was to be given forcibly in marriage to a man whom she despised and loathed the vain furioustempered traitor who for revenge jealousy or greed she knew not which had not hesitated to send his benefactor and mothers husband to perish in the fires of the inquisition  what was she to do escape seemed out of the question imprisoned as she was on the third story of a lofty mill standing in a lonely snowshrouded wilderness cut off from the sight of every friendly face and spied on hour after hour by two fierceeyed women no there was only one escape for herthrough the gate of death even this would be difficult for she had no weapon and day and night the women kept guard over her one standing sentinel while the other slept moreover she had no mind to die being young and healthy with a love to live for and from her childhood up she had been taught that selfslaughter is a sin no she would trust in god and overwhelming though it was fight her way through this trouble as best she might the helpless find friends sometimes therefore that her strength might be preserved elsa rested and ate of her food and drank the wine which they brought to her refusing to leave the room or to speak more than she was obliged but watching everything that passed  on the second morning of her imprisonment ramiros message reached her to which as usual she made no answer in due course also ramiro himself arrived and stood bowing in the doorway  have i your permission to enter jufvrouw he asked then elsa knowing that the moment of trial had come steeled herself for the encounter  you are master here she answered in a voice cold as the falling snow without why then do you mock me  he motioned to the women to leave the room and when they had gone replied  i have little thought of such a thing lady the matter in hand is too serious for smart sayings and with another bow he sat himself down on a chair near the hearth where a fire was burning whereon elsa rose and stood over against him for upon her feet she seemed to feel stronger  will you be so good as to set out this matter senor ramiro am i brought here to be tried for heresy  even so for heresy against the god of love and the sentence of the court is that you must expiate your sin not at the stake but at the altar  i do not understand  then i will explain my son adrian a worthy young man on the wholeyou know that he is my son do you nothas had the misfortune or i should say the good fortune to fall earnestly in love with you whereas you have the bad tasteor perhaps the good tasteto give your affections elsewhere under the circumstances adrian being a youth of spirit and resource has fallen back upon primitive methods in order to bring his suit to a successful conclusion he is here you are here and this evening i understand that the priest will be here i need not dwell upon the obvious issue indeed it is a private matter upon which i have no right to intrude except of course as a relative and a wellwisher  elsa made an impatient movement with her hand as though to brush aside all this web of words  why do you take so much trouble to force an unhappy girl into a hateful marriage she asked how can such a thing advantage you  ah answered ramiro briskly i perceive i have to do with a woman of business one who has that rarest of giftscommon sense i will be frank your esteemed father died possessed of a very large fortune which today is your property as his sole issue and heiress under the marriage laws which i myself think unjust that fortune will pass into the power of any husband whom you choose to take therefore so soon as you are made his wife it will pass to adrian i am adrians father and as it happens he is pecuniarily indebted to me to a considerable amount so that in the upshot as he himself has pointed out more than once this alliance will provide for both of us but business details are wearisome so i need not enlarge  the fortune you speak of senor ramiro is lost  it is lost but i have reason to hope that it will be found  you mean that this is purely a matter of money  so far as i am concerned purely for adrians feelings i cannot speak since who knows the mystery of anothers heart  then if the money were forthcomingor a clue to itthere need be no marriage  so far as i am concerned none at all  and if the money is not forthcoming and i refuse to marry the heer adrian or he to marry mewhat then  that is a riddle but i think i see an answer at any rate to half of it then the marriage would still take place but with another bridegroom  another bridegroom who  your humble and devoted adorer  elsa shuddered and recoiled a step  ah he said i should not have bowed you saw my white hairsto the young a hateful sight  elsas indignation rose and she answered  it is not your white hair that i shrink from senor which in some would be a crown of honour but  in my case suggests to you other reflections be gentle and spare me them in a world of rough actions what need to emphasise them with rough words  for a few minutes there was silence which ramiro glancing out of the lattice broke by remarking that the snowfall was extraordinarily heavy for the time of year then followed another silence  i understood you just now dear lady to make some sort of suggestion which might lead to an arrangement satisfactory to both of us the exact locality of this wealth is at present obscureyou mentioned some clue are you in a position to furnish such a clue  if i am in a position what then  then perhaps after a few days visit to an interesting but little explored part of holland you might return to your friends as you left themin short as a single woman  a struggle shook elsa and do what she would some trace of it appeared in her face  do you swear that she whispered  most certainly  do you swear before god that if you have this clue you will not force me into a marriage with the heer adrian or with yourselfthat you will let me go unharmed  i swear itbefore god  knowing that god will be revenged upon you if you break the oath you still swear  i still swear why these needless repetitions  thenthen and she leant towards him speaking in a hoarse whisper believing that you even you will not dare to be false to such an oath for you even you must fear death a miserable death and vengeance eternal vengeance i give you the clue it lies in the hilt of the sword silence  the sword silence what sword is that  the great sword of red martin  stirred out of his selfcontrol ramiro struck his hand upon his knee  and to think he said that for over twelve hours i had it hanging on the wall of the gevangenhuis well i fear that i must ask you to be more explicit where is this sword  wherever red martin is that is all i know i can tell you no more the plan of the hidingplace is there  or was there well i believe you but to win a secret from the hilt of the sword of the man who broke his way out of the torturechamber of the gevangenhuis is a labour that would have been not unworthy of hercules first red martin must be found then his sword must be taken which i think will cost men their lives dear lady i am obliged for your information but i fear that the marriage must still go through  you swore you swore she gasped you swore before god  quite so and i shall leavethe power you refer toto manage the matter doubtless he can attend to his own affairsi must attend to mine i hope that about seven oclock this evening will suit you by which time the priest anda bridegroom will be ready  then elsa broke down  devil she cried in the torment of her despair to save my honour i have betrayed my fathers trust i have betrayed the secret for which martin was ready to die by torment and given him over to be hunted like a wild beast oh god forgive me and god help me  doubtless dear young lady he will do the first for your temptations were really considerable i who have more experience outwitted you that was all possibly also he may do the second though many have uttered that cry unheard for my own sake i trust that he was sleeping when you uttered yours but it is your affair and his i leave it to be arranged between you till this evening jufvrouw and he bowed himself from the room  but elsa shamed and brokenhearted threw herself upon the bed and wept  at midday she arose hearing upon the stair the step of the woman who brought her food and to hide her tearstained face went to the barred lattice and looked out the scene was dismal indeed for the wind had veered suddenly the snow had ceased and in place of it rain was falling with a steady persistence when the woman had gone elsa washed her face and although her appetite turned from it ate of the food knowing how necessary it was that she should keep her strength  another hour passed and there came a knock on the door elsa shuddered for she thought that ramiro had returned to torment her indeed it was almost a relief when instead of him appeared his son once glance at adrians nervous shaken face yes and even the sound of his uncertain step brought hope to her heart her womans instinct told her that now she had no longer to do with the merciless and terrible ramiro to whose eyes she was but a pretty pawn in a game that he must win but with a young man who loved her and whom she held therefore at a disadvantagewith one moreover who was harassed and ashamed and upon whose conscience therefore she might work she turned upon him drawing herself up and although she was short and adrian was tall of a sudden he felt as though she towered over him  your pleasure asked elsa  in the old days adrian would have answered with some magnificent compliment or farfetched simile lifted from the pages of romancers in truth he had thought of several such while like a halfstarved dog seeking a home he wandered round and round the millhouse in the snow but he was now far beyond all rhetoric or gallantries  my father wished he began humblyi mean that i have come to speak to you aboutour marriage  of a sudden elsas delicate features seemed to turn to ice while to his fancy at any rate her brown eyes became fire  marriage she said in a strange voice oh what an unutterable coward you must be to speak that word call what is proposed by any foul title which you will but at least leave the holy name of marriage undefiled  it is not my fault he answered sullenly but shrinking beneath her words you know elsa that i wished to wed you honourably enough  yes she broke in and because i would not listen because you do not please me and you could not win me as a man wins a maid youyou laid a trap and kidnapped me thinking to get by brute force that which my heart withheld oh in all the netherlands lives there another such an abject as adrian called van goorl the baseborn son of ramiro the galley slave  i have told you that it is false he replied furiously i had nothing to do with your capture i knew nothing of it till i saw you here  elsa laughed a very bitter laugh spare your breath she said for if you swore it before the face of the recording angel i would not believe you remember that you are the man who betrayed your brother and your benefactor and then guess if you can what worth i put upon your words  in the bitterness of his heart adrian groaned aloud and from that groan elsa listening eagerly gathered some kind of hope  surely she went on with a changed and softened manner surely you will not do this wickedness the blood of dirk van goorl lies on your head will you add mine to his for be sure of this i swear it by my maker that before i am indeed a wife to you i shall be deador mayhap you will be dead or both of us do you understand  i understand but  but what where is the use of this wickedness for your souls sake refuse to have aught to do with such a sin  but if so my father will marry you  it was a chance arrow but it went home for of a sudden elsas strength and eloquence seemed to leave her she ran to him with her hands clasped she flung herself upon her knees  oh help me to escape she moaned and i will bless you all my life  it is impossible he answered escape from this guarded place through those leagues of melting snow i tell you that it is impossible  then and her eyes grew wild then kill him and free me he is a devil he is your evil genius it would be a righteous deed kill him and free me  i should like to answered adrian i nearly did once but for my souls sake i cant put a sword through my own father it is the most horrible of crimes when i confessed  then she broke in if this farce this infamy must be gone through swear at least that you will treat it as such that you will respect me  it is a hard thing to ask of a husband who loves you more than any woman in the world he answered turning aside his head  remember she went on with another flash of defiant spirit that if you do not you will soon love me better than any woman out of the world or perhaps we shall both settle what lies between us before the judgment seat of god will you swear  he hesitated  oh she reflected what if he should answerrather than this i hand you over to ramiro what if he should think of that argument happily for her at the moment he did not  swear she implored swear clinging with her hands to the lappet of his coat and lifting to him her white and piteous face  i make it an offering in expiation of my sins he groaned you shall go free of me  elsa uttered a sigh of relief she put no faith whatever in adrians promises but at the worst it would give her time  i thought that i should not appeal in vain  to so amusing and egregious a donkey said ramiros mocking voice speaking from the gloom of the doorway which now elsa observed for the first time had swung open mysteriously  my dear son and daughterinlaw how can i thank you sufficiently for the entertainment with which you have enlivened one of the most dreary afternoons i remember dont look dangerous my boy recall what you have just told this young lady that the crime of removing a parent is one which though agreeable is not lightly to be indulged then as to your future arrangements how touching the soul of a diana i declare and the selfsacrifice of ano i fear that the heroes of antiquity can furnish no suitable example and now adieu i go to welcome the gentleman you both of you so eagerly expect  he went and a minute later without speaking for the situation seemed beyond words adrian crept down the stairs after him more miserable and crushed even than he had crept up them half an hour before    another two hours went by elsa was in her apartment with black meg for company who watched her as a cat watches a mouse in a trap adrian had taken refuge in the place where he slept above it was a dreary vacuous chamber that once had held stones and other machinery of the mill now removed the home of spiders and halfstarved rats that a lean black cat hunted continually across its ceiling ran great beams whereof the interlacing ends among which sharp draughts whistled lost themselves in gloom while with an endless and exasperating sound as of a knuckle upon a board the water dripped from the leaky roof  in the round livingchamber below ramiro was alone no lamp had been lit but the glow from the great turf fire played upon his face as he sat there watching waiting and scheming in the chair of black oak presently a noise from without caught his quick ear and calling to the serving woman to light the lamp he went to the door opened it and saw a lantern floating towards him through the thick steam of falling rain another minute and the bearer of the lantern hague simon arrived followed by two other men  here he is said simon nodding at the figure behind him a short round figure wrapped in a thick frieze cloak from which water ran the other is the head boatman  good said ramiro tell him and his companions to wait in the shed without where liquor will be sent to them they may be wanted later on  then followed talk and oaths and at length the man retreated grumbling  enter father thomas said ramiro you have had a wet journey i fear enter and give us your blessing  before he answered the priest threw off his dripping hooded cape of frisian cloth revealing a coarse wicked face red and bleareyed from intemperance  my blessing he said in a raucous voice here it is senor ramiro or whatever you call yourself now curse you all for bringing out a holy priest upon one of your devils errands in weather which is only fit for a baldheaded coot to travel through there is going to be a flood already the water is running over the banks of the dam and it gathers every moment as the snow melts i tell you there is going to be such a flood as we have not seen for years  the more reason father for getting through this little business quickly but first you will wish for something to drink  father thomas nodded and ramiro filling a small mug with brandy gave it to him he gulped it off  another he said dont be afraid a chosen vessel should also be a seasoned vessel at any rate this one is ah thats better now then whats the exact job  ramiro took him apart and they talked together for a while  very good said the priest at length i will take the risk and do it for where heretics are concerned such things are not too closely inquired into nowadays but first down with the money no paper or promises if you please  ah you churchmen said ramiro with a faint smile in things spiritual or temporal how much have we poor laity to learn of you with a sigh he produced the required sum then paused and added no with your leave we will see the papers first you have them with you  here they are answered the priest drawing some documents from his pocket but they havent been married yet the rule is marry first then certify until the ceremony is actually performed anything might happen you know  quite so father anything might happen either before or after but still with your leave i think that in this case we may as well certify first you might want to be getting away and it will save so much trouble later will you be so kind as to write your certificate  father thomas hesitated while ramiro gently clinked the gold coins in his hand and murmured  i should be sorry to think father that you had taken such a rough journey for nothing  what trick are you at now growled the priest well after all it is a mere form give me the names  ramiro gave them father thomas scrawled them down adding some words and his own signature then said there you are that will hold good against anyone except the pope  a mere form repeated ramiro of course but the world attaches so much importance to forms so i think that we will have this one witnessedno not by myself who am an interested partyby someone independent and calling hague simon and the waitingwoman he bade them set their names at the foot of the documents  papers signed in advancefees paid in advance he went on handing over the money and now just one more glass to drink the health of the bride and bridegroom also in advance you will not refuse nor you worthy simon nor you most excellent abigail ah i thought not the night is cold  and the brandy strong muttered the priest thickly as this third dose of raw spirit took effect upon him now get on with the business for i want to be out of this hole before the flood comes  quite so friends will you be so good as to summon my son and the lady the lady first i thinkand all three of you might go to escort her brides sometimes consider it right to fain a slight reluctanceyou understand on second thoughts you need not trouble the senor adrian i have a new words of antenuptial advice to offer so i will go to him  a minute later father and son stood face to face adrian leaped up he shook his fist he raved and stormed at the cold impassive man before him  you fool you contemptible fool said ramiro when he had done heavens to think that such a creature should have sprung from me a human jackass only fit to bear the blows and burdens of others to fill the field with empty brayings and wear himself out by kicking at the air oh dont twist up your face at me for i am your master as well as your father however much you may hate me you are mine body and soul dont you understand a bondslave nothing more you lost the only chance you ever had in the game when you got me down at leyden you darent draw a sword on me again for your souls sake dear adrian for your souls sake and if you dared i would run you through now are you coming  no answered adrian  think a minute if you dont marry her i shall and before she is half an hour older also and he leant forward and whispered into his sons ear  oh you devil you devil adrian gasped then he moved towards the door  what changed your mind have you mr weathercock well it is the prerogative of all feminine naturesbut your doublet is awry and allow me to suggest that you should brush your hair there thats better now come on no you go first if you please id rather have you in front of me  when they reached the room below the bride was already there gripped on either side by black meg and the other woman white as death and trembling but still defiant stood elsa  lets get through with this growled the halfdrunken ruffian priest i take the willingness of the parties for granted  i am not willing cried elsa i have been brought here by force i call everyone present to witness that whatever is done is against my will i appeal to god to help me  the priest turned upon ramiro  how am i to marry them in the face of this he asked if only she were silent it might be done  the difficulty has occurred to me answered ramiro he made a sign whereon simon seized elsas wrists and black meg slipping behind her deftly fastened a handkerchief over her mouth in such fashion that she was gagged but could still breathe through the nostrils  elsa struggled a little then was quiet and turned her piteous eyes on adrian who stepped forward and opened his lips  you remember the alternative said his father in a low voice and he stopped  i suppose broke in father thomas that we may at any rate reckon upon the consent or at least upon the silence of the heer bridegroom  you may reckon on his silence father thomas replied ramiro  then the ceremony began they dragged elsa to the table thrice she flung herself to the ground and thrice they lifted her to her feet but at length weary of the weight of her body suffered her to rest upon her knees where she remained as though in prayer gagged like some victim on the scaffold it was a strange and brutal scene and every detail of it burned itself into adrians mind the round rude room with its glowing fire of turfs and its rough oaken furniture half in light and half in dense shadow as the lamprays chanced to fall the deathlike kneeling bride with a white cloth across her tortured face the redchopped hanginglipped hedge priest gabbling from a book his back almost turned that he might not see her attitude and struggles the horrible unsexed women the flatfaced villain simon grinning by the hearth ramiro cynical mocking triumphant and yet somewhat anxious his one bright eye fixed in mingled contempt and amusement upon him adrianthose were its outlines there was something else also that caught and oppressed his sense a sound which at the time adrian thought he heard in his head alone a soft heavy sound with a moan in it not unlike that of the wind which grew gradually to a dull roar  it was over a ring had been forced on to elsas unwilling hand and until the thing was undone by some competent and authorised court she was in name the wife of adrian the handkerchief was unbound her hands were loosed physically elsa was free again but in that day and land of outrage tied as the poor girl knew well by a chain more terrible than any that hemp or steel could fashion  congratulations senora muttered father thomas eyeing her nervously i fear you felt a little faint during the service but a sacrament  cease your mockings you false priest cried elsa oh let the swift vengeance of god fall upon every one of you and first of all upon you false priest  drawing the ring from her finger as she spoke she cast it down upon the oaken table whence it sprang up to drop again and rattle itself to silence then with one tragic motion of despair elsa turned and fled back to her chamber  the red face of father thomas went white and his yellow teeth chattered a virgins curse he muttered crossing himself misfortune always follows and it is sometimes deathyes by st thomas death and you you brought me here to do this wickedness you dog you galley slave  father broke in ramiro you know i have warned you against it before at the hague sooner or later it always breaks up the nerves and he nodded towards the flagon of spirits bread and water father bread and water for forty days that is what i prescribe and  as he spoke the door was burst open and two men rushed in their eyes starting their very beards bristling with terror  come forth they cried  what has chanced screamed the priest  the great dyke has bursthark hark hark the floods are upon you the mill will be swept away  god in heavenit was true now through the open doorway they heard the roar of waters whose note adrian had caught before yes and in the gloom appeared their foaming crest as they rushed through the great and everwidening breach in the lofty dyke down upon the flooded lowland  father thomas bounded through the door yelling the boat the boat for a moment ramiro thought considering the situation then he said  fetch the jufvrouw no not you adrian she would die rather than come with you you simon and you meg swift obey  they departed on their errand  men went on ramiro take this gentleman and lead him to the boat hold him if he tries to escape i will follow with the lady go you fool go there is not a second to be lost and adrian hanging back and protesting was dragged away by the boatmen  now ramiro was alone and though as he had said there was little time to spare again for a few moments he thought deeply his face flushed and went pale then entered into it a great resolve i dont like doing it for it is against my vow but the chance is good she is safely married and at best she would be very troublesome hereafter and might bring us to justice or to the galleys since others seek her wealth he muttered with a shiver adding as for the spies we are well rid of them and their evidence then with swift resolution stepping to the door at the foot of the stairs ramiro shut it and shot the great iron bolt  he ran from the mill the raised path was already three feet deep in water he could scarcely make his way along it ah there lay the boat now he was in it and now they were flying before the crest of a huge wave the dam of the cutting had given altogether and fed from sea and land at once by snow by rain and by the inrush of the high tide its waters were pouring in a measureless volume over the doomed marshes  where is elsa screamed adrian  i dont know i couldnt find her answered ramiro row row for your lives we can take her off in the morning and the priest too if he won back    at length the cold winter sun rose over the watery waste calm enough now for the floods were out in places ten and fifteen feet deep through the mists that brooded on the face of them ramiro and his crew groped their way back to where the red mill should be it was gone  there stood the brick walls of the bottom story rising above the flood level but the wooden upper part had snapped before the first great wave when the bank went bodily and afterwards been swept away by the rushing current swept away with those within  what is that said one of the boatmen pointing to a dark object which floated among the tangled debris of sere weeds and woodwork collected against the base of the mill  they rowed to the thing it was the body of father thomas who must have missed his footing as he ran along the pathway and fallen into deep water  um said ramiro a virgins curse observe friends how the merest coincidences may give rise to superstition allow me and holding the dead man by one hand he felt in his pockets with the other till with a smile of satisfaction he found the purse containing the gold which he had paid him on the previous evening  oh elsa elsa moaned adrian  comfort yourself my son said ramiro as the boat put about leaving the dead father thomas bobbing up and down in the ripple you have indeed lost a wife whose temper gave you little prospect of happiness but at least i have your marriage papers duly signed and witnessed andyou are her heir  he did not add that he in turn was adrians but adrian thought of it and even in the midst of his shame and misery wondered with a shiver how long he who was ramiros next of kin was likely to adorn this world  till he had something that was worth inheriting perhaps    chapter xxvii  what elsa saw in the moonlight  it will be remembered that some weeks before elsas forced marriage in the red mill foy on their escape from the gevangenhuis had been carried upon the naked back of martin to the shelter of mother marthas lair in the haarlemer meer here he lay sick many days for the sword cut in his thigh festered so badly that at one time his life was threatened by gangrene but in the end his own strength and healthy constitution helped with marthas simples cured him so soon as he was strong again accompanied by martin he travelled into leyden which now it was safe enough for him to visit since the spaniards were driven from the town  how his young heart swelled as still limping a little and somewhat pale from recent illness he approached the wellknown house in the bree straat the home that sheltered his mother and his love presently he would see them again for the news had been brought to him that lysbeth was out of danger and elsa must still be nursing her  lysbeth he found indeed turned into an old woman by grief and sore sickness but elsa he did not find she had vanished on the previous night she had gone out to take the air and returned no more what had become of her none could say all the town talked of it and his mother was halfcrazed with anxiety and fear fear of the worst  hither and thither they went inquiring seeking tracking but no trace of elsa could they discover she had been seen to pass the morsch poort then she disappeared for a while foy was mad at length he grew calmer and began to think drawing from his pocket the letter which martha had brought to him on the night of the churchburning he reread it in the hope of finding a clue since it was just possible that for private reasons elsa might have set out on some journey of her own it was a very sweet letter telling him of her deep joy and gratitude at his escape of the events that had happened in the town of the death of his father in the gevangenhuis and ending thus   dear foy my betrothed i cannot come to you because of your mothers sickness for i am sure that it would be your wish as it is my desire and duty that i should stay to nurse her soon however i hope that you will be able to come to her and me yet in these dreadful times who can tell what may happen therefore foy whatever chances i am sure you will remember that in life or in death i am yours onlyyes to you dead or living you dead and i living or you living and i dead while or wherever i have sense or memory i will be true through life through death through whatever may lie beyond our deaths i will be true as woman may be to man so dear foy for this present fare you well until we meet again in the days to come or after all earthly days are done with for you and me my love be with you the blessing of god be with you and when you lie down at night and when you wake at morn think of me and put up a prayer for me as your true lover elsa does for you martha waits most loved most dear most desired fare you well   here was no hint of any journey so if such had been taken it must be without elsas own consent  martin what do you make of it asked foy staring at him with anxious hollow eyes  ramiroadrianstolen away answered martin  why do you say that  hague simon was seen hanging about outside the town yesterday and there was a strange boat upon the river last night the jufvrouw went through the morsch poort the rest you can guess  why would they take her asked foy hoarsely  who can tell said martin shrugging his great shoulders yet i see two reasons hendrik brants wealth is supposed to be hers when it can be found therefore being a thief ramiro would want her adrian is in love with her therefore being a man of course he would want her these seem enough the pair being what they are  when i find them i will kill them both said foy grinding his teeth  of course so will i but first we have got to find themand her which is the same thing  how martin how  i dont know  cant you think man  i am trying to master its you who dont think you talk too much be silent a while  well asked foy thirty seconds later have you finished thinking  no master its no use there is nothing to think about we must leave this and go back to martha if anyone can track her out she can here we can learn no more  so they returned to the haarlemer meer and told martha their sad tale  bide here a day or two and be patient she said i will go out and search  never answered foy we will come with you  if you choose but it will make matters more difficult martin get ready the big boat    two nights had gone by and it was an hour or more past noon on the third day the day of elsas forced marriage the snow had ceased falling and the rain had come instead rain pitiless bitter and continual hidden in a nook at the north end of the haarlemer meer and almost buried beneath bundles of reeds partly as a protection from the weather and partly to escape the eyes of spaniards of whom companies were gathering from every direction to besiege haarlem lay the big boat in it were red martin and foy van goorl mother martha was not there for she had gone alone to an inn at a distance to gather information if she could to hundreds of the boers in these parts she was a known and trusted friend although many of them might not choose to recognise her openly and from among them unless indeed she had been taken right away to flanders or even to spain she hoped to gather tidings of elsas whereabouts  for two weary nights and days the mare had been employed thus but as yet without a shadow of success foy and martin sat in the boat staring at each other gloomily indeed foys face was piteous to see  what are you thinking of master asked martin presently  i am thinking he answered that even if we find her now it will be too late whatever was to be done murder or marriage will be done  time to trouble about that when we have found her said martin for he knew not what else to say and added listen i hear footsteps  foy drew apart two of the bundles of reeds and looked out into the driving rain  all right he said it is martha and a man  martin let his hand fall from the hilt of the sword silence for in those days hand and sword must be near together another minute and martha and her companion were in the boat  who is this man asked foy  he is a friend of mine named marsh jan  have you news  yes at least marsh jan has  speak and be swift said foy turning on the man fiercely  am i safe from vengeance asked marsh jan who was a good fellow enough although he had drifted into evil company looking doubtfully at foy and martin  have i not said so answered martha and does the mare break her word  then marsh jan told his tale how he was one of the party that two nights before had rowed elsa or at least a young woman who answered to her description to the red mill not far from velzen and how she was in the immediate charge of a man and a woman who could be no other than hague simon and black meg also he told of her piteous appeal to the boatmen in the names of their wives and daughters and at the telling of it foy wept with fear and rage and even martha gnashed her teeth only martin cast off the boat and began to punt her out into deep water  is that all asked foy  that is all mynheer i know nothing more but i can explain to you where the place is  you can show us you mean said foy  the man expostulated the weather was bad there would be a flood his wife was ill and expected him and so forth then he tried to get out of the boat whereon catching hold of him suddenly martin threw him into the sternsheets saying  you could travel to this mill once taking with you a girl whom you knew to be kidnapped now you can travel there again to get her out sit still and steer straight or i will make you food for fishes  then marsh jan professed himself quite willing to sail to the red mill which he said they ought to reach by nightfall  all that afternoon they sailed and rowed till with the darkness before ever the mill was in sight the great flood came down upon them and drove them hither and thither such a flood as had not been seen in those districts for a dozen years but marsh jan knew his bearings well he had the instinct of locality that is bred in those whose forefathers for generations have won a living from the fens and through it all he held upon a straight course  once foy thought that he heard a voice calling for help in the darkness but it was not repeated and they went forward at last the sky cleared and the moon shone out upon such a waste of waters as noah might have beheld from the ark only there were things floating in them that noah would scarcely have seen hayricks dead and drowning cattle household furniture and once even a coffin washed from some graveyard while beyond stretched the dreary outline of the sand dunes  the mill should be near said marsh jan let us put about so they turned rowing with weary arms for the wind had fallen    let us go back a little elsa on escaping from the scene of her mock marriage fled to her room and bolted its door a few seconds later she heard hands hammering at it and the voices of hague simon and black meg calling to her to open she took no note the hammering ceased and then it was that for the first time she became aware of a dreadful roaring noise a noise of many waters time passed as it passes in a nightmare till suddenly above the dull roar came sharp sounds as of wood cracking and splitting and elsa felt that the whole fabric of the mill had tilted beneath the pressure of the flood it had given where it was weakest at its narrow waist and now its red cap hung over like a windlaid tree  terror took hold of elsa and running to the door she opened it hoping to escape down the stairs behold water was creeping up them she could see it by the lantern in her handher retreat was cut off but there were other stairs leading to the top storey of the mill that now lay at a steep angle and along these she climbed since the water was pouring through her doorway and there was nowhere else to go in the very roof of the place was a manhole with a rotten hatch she passed through this to find herself upon the top of the mill just where one of the great naked arms of the sails projected from it her lantern was blown out by now but she clung to the arm and became aware that the wooden cap of the structure still anchored to its brick foundation lay upon its side rocking to and fro like a boat upon an angry sea the water was near her that she knew by its seethe and rush although she could not see it but as yet it did not even wet her feet  the hours went by how many she never learned till at length the clouds cleared the moon became visible and by its light she saw an awful scene everywhere around was water it lapped within a yard and it was rising still now elsa saw that in the great beam she clasped were placed short spokes for the use of those who set the sails above up these she climbed as best she might till she was able to pass her body between two of the vanes and support her breast upon the flat surface of one of them as a person does who leans out of a window from her window there was something to see quite near to her but separated by fifteen or twenty feet of yellow frothing water a little portion of the swelling shape of the mill stood clear of the flood to this foamlapped island clung two human beingshague simon and black meg they saw her also and screamed for help but she had none to give surely it was a dreamnothing so awful could happen outside a dream  the fabric of the mill tilted more and more the space to which the two vile creatures hung grew less and less there was no longer room for both of them they began to quarrel to curse and jibber at each other their fierce bestial faces not an inch apart as they crouched there on hands and knees the water rose a little they were kneeling in it now and the man putting down his bald head butted at the woman almost thrusting her from her perch but she was strong and active she struggled back again she did more with an eellike wriggle she climbed upon his back weighing him down he strove to shake her off but could not for on that heaving rolling surface he dared not loose his handgrip so he turned his flat and florid face and seizing her leg between his teeth bit and worried at it in her pain and rage meg screeched aloudthat was the cry which foy had heard then suddenly she drew a knife from her bosomelsa saw it flash in the moonlightand stabbed downwards once twice thrice  elsa shut her eyes when she opened them again the woman was alone upon the little patch of red boarding her body splayed out over it like that of a dead frog so she lay a while till suddenly the cap of the red mill dipped slowly like a lady who makes a court curtsey and she vanished it rose again and meg was still there moaning in her terror and water running from her dress then again it dipped this time more deeply and when the patch of rusty boarding slowly reappeared it was empty no not quite for clinging to it yowling and spitting was the halfwild black cat which elsa had seen wandering about the mill but of black meg there was no trace  it was dreadfully cold up there hanging to the sailbar for now that the rain had finished it began to freeze indeed had it not chanced that elsa was dressed in her warm winter gown with fur upon it and dry from her head to her feet it is probable that she would have fallen off and perished in the water as it was gradually her body became numb and her senses faded she seemed to know that all this matter of her forced marriage of the flood and of the end of simon and meg was nothing but a dream a very evil nightmare from which she would awake presently to find herself snug and warm in her own bed in the bree straat of course it must be a nightmare for look there on the bare patch of boarding beneath the hideous struggle repeated itself there lay hague simon gnawing at his wifes foot only his fat white face was gone and in place of it he wore the head of a cat for she the watcher could see its glowing eyes fixed upon her and meglook how her lean limbs gripped him round the body listen to the thudding noise as the great knife fell between his shoulders and now seeshe was growing tall she had become a giantess her face shot across the gulf of water and swam upwards through the shadows till it was within a foot of her oh she must fall but first she would scream for helpsurely the dead themselves could hear that cry better not have uttered it it might bring ramiro back better go to join the dead what did the voice say megs voice but how changed that she was not to be afraid that the thudding was the sound of oars not of knife thrusts this would be ramiros boat coming to seize her of him and adrian she could bear no more she would throw herself into the water and trust to god one two threethen utter darkness  elsa became aware that light was shining about her also that somebody was kissing her upon the face and lips a horrible doubt struck her that it might be adrian and she opened her eyes ever so little to look no no how very strange it was not adrian it was foy well doubtless this must be all part of her vision and as in dream or out of it foy had a perfect right to kiss her if he chose she saw no reason to interfere now she seemed to hear a familiar voice that of red martin asking someone how long it would take them to make haarlem with this wind to which another voice answered about threequarters of an hour  it was very odd and why did he say haarlem and not leyden next the second voice which also seemed familiar said  look out foy shes coming to herself then someone poured wine down her throat whereupon unable to bear this bewilderment any longer elsa sat up and opened her eyes wide to see before her foy and none other than foy in the flesh  she gasped and began to sink back again with joy and weakness whereon he cast his arms about her and drew her to his breast then she remembered everything  oh foy foy she cried you must not kiss me  why not he asked  becausebecause i am married  of a sudden his happy face became ghastly married he stammered who to  toyour brother adrian  he stared at her in amazement then asked slowly  did you run away from leyden to marry him  how dare you ask such a question replied elsa with a flash of spirit  perhaps then you would explain  what is there to explain i thought that you knew they dragged me away and last night just before the flood burst i was gagged and married by force  oh adrian my friend groaned foy wait till i catch you my friend adrian  to be just explained elsa i dont think adrian wanted to marry me much but he had to choose between marrying me himself or seeing his father ramiro marry me  so he sacrificed himselfthe good kindhearted man interrupted foy grinding his teeth  yes said elsa  and where is your selfdenyingoh i cant say the word  i dont know i suppose that he and ramiro escaped in the boat or perhaps he was drowned  in which case you are a widow sooner than you could have expected said foy more cheerfully edging himself towards her  but elsa moved a little away and foy saw with a sinking of the heart that however distasteful it might be to her clearly she attached some weight to this marriage  i do not know she answered how can i tell i suppose that we shall hear sometime and then if he is still alive i must set to work to get free of him but till then foy she added warningly i suppose that i am his wife in law although i will never speak to him again where are we going  to haarlem the spaniards are closing in upon the city and we dare not try to break through their lines those are spanish boats behind us but eat and drink a little elsa then tell us your story  one question first foy how did you find me  we heard a woman scream twice once far away and once near at hand and rowing to the sound saw someone hanging to the arm of an overturned windmill only three or four feet above the water of course we knew that you had been taken to the mill that man there told us do you remember him but at first we could not find it in the darkness and the flood  then after she had swallowed something elsa told her story while the three of them clustered round her forward of the sail and marsh jan managed the helm when she had finished it martin whispered to foy and as though by a common impulse all four of them kneeled down upon the boards in the bottom of the boat and returned thanks to the almighty that this maiden quite unharmed had been delivered out of such manifold and terrible dangers and this by the hands of her own friends and of the man to whom she was affianced when they had finished their service of thanksgiving which was as simple as it was solemn and heartfelt they rose and now elsa did not forbid that foy should hold her hand  say sweetheart he asked is it true that you think anything of this forced marriage  hear me before you answer broke in martha it is no marriage at all for none can be wed without the consent of their own will and you gave no such consent  it is no marriage echoed martin and if it be and i live then the sword shall cut its knot  it is no marriage said foy for although we have not stood together before the altar yet our hearts are wed so how can you be made the wife of another man  dearest replied elsa when they had all spoken i too am sure that it is no marriage yet a priest spoke the marriage words over me and a ring was thrust upon my hand so to the law if there be any law left in the netherlands i am perhaps in some sort a wife therefore before i can become wife to you these facts must be made public and i must appeal to the law to free me lest in days to come others should be troubled  and if the law cannot or will not elsa what then  then dear our consciences being clean we will be a law to ourselves but first we must wait a while are you satisfied now foy  no answered foy sulkily for it is monstrous that such devils work should keep us apart even for an hour yet in this as in all i will obey you dear  marrying and giving in marriage broke in martha in a shrill voice talk no more of such things for there is other work before us look yonder girl what do you see and she pointed to the dry land the hosts of the amalekites marching in their thousands to slaughter us and our brethren the children of the lord look behind you what do you see the ships of the tyrant sailing up to encompass the city of the children of the lord it is the day of death and desolation the day of armageddon and ere the sun sets red upon it many a thousand must pass through the gates of doom we mayhap among them then up with the flag of freedom out with the steel of truth gird on the buckler of righteousness and snatch the shield of hope fight fight for the liberty of the land that bore you for the memory of christ the king who died for you for the faith to which you are born fight fight and when the fray is done then and not before think of peace and love  nay children look not so fearful for i the mad merewife tell you by the grace of god that you have naught to fear who preserved you in the torture den foy van goorl what hand was it that held your life and honour safe when you sojourned among devils in the red mill yonder and kept your head above the waters of the flood elsa brant you know well and i martha tell you that this same hand shall hold you safe until the end yes i know it i know it thousands shall fall upon your right hand and tens of thousands upon your left but you shall live through the hunger the arrows of pestilence shall pass you by the sword of the wicked shall not harm you for me it is otherwise at length my doom draws near and i am well content but for you twain foy and elsa i foretell many years of earthly joy  thus spoke martha and it seemed to those who watched her that her wild disfigured face shone with a light of inspiration nor did they who knew her story and still believed that the spirit of prophecy could open the eyes of chosen seers deem it strange that vision of the things to be should visit her at the least they took comfort from her words and for a while were no more afraid  yet they had much to fear by a fateful accident they had been delivered from great dangers only to fall into dangers greater still for as it chanced on this tenth of december 1572 they sailed straight into the grasp of the thousands of the spanish armies which had been drawn like a net round the doomed city of haarlem there was no escape for them nothing that had not wings could pass those lines of ships and soldiers their only refuge was the city and in that city they must bide till the struggle one of the most fearful of all that hideous war was ended but at least they had this comfort they would face the foe together and with them were two who loved them martha the spanish scourge and red martin the free frisian the mighty man of war whom god had appointed to them as a shield of defence  so they smiled on each other these two lovers of long ago and sailed bravely on to the closing gates of haarlem    chapter xxviii  atonement  seven months had gone by seven of the most dreadful months ever lived through by human beings for all this space of time through the frosts and snows and fogs of winter through the icy winds of spring and now deep into the heart of summer the city of haarlem had been closely beleaguered by an army of thirty thousand spaniards most of them veteran troops under the command of don frederic the son of alva and other generals against this disciplined host were opposed the little garrison of four thousand hollanders and germans aided by a few scotch and english soldiers together with a population of about twenty thousand old men women and children from day to day from week to week from month to month the struggle was waged between these unequal forces marked on either side by the most heroic efforts and by cruelties that would strike our age as monstrous for in those times the captive prisoner of war could expect no mercy indeed he was fortunate if he was not hung from a gibbet by the leg to die slowly within eyeshot of his friends  there were battles without number men perished in hecatombs among the besieging armies alone over twelve thousand lost their lives so that the neighbourhood of haarlem became one vast graveyard and the fish in the lake were poisoned by the dead assault sortie ambuscade artifice of war combats to the death upon the ice between skateshod soldiers desperate sea fights attempts to storm the explosion of mines and countermines that brought death to hundredsall these became the familiar incidents of daily life  then there were other horrors cold from insufficient fuel pestilences of various sorts such as always attend a siege and worse of all for the beleaguered hunger week by week as the summer aged the food grew less and less till at length there was nothing the weeds that grew in the street the refuse of tanneries the last ounce of offal the mice and the cats all had been devoured on the lofty steeple of st bavon for days and days had floated a black flag to tell the prince of orange in leyden that below it was despair as black the last attempt at succour had been made batenburg had been defeated and slain together with the seigneurs of clotingen and carloo and five or six hundred men now there was no more hope  desperate expedients were suggested that the women children aged and sick should be left in the city while the ablebodied men cut a way through the battalions of their besiegers on these noncombatants it was hoped that the spaniard would have mercyas though the spaniard could have mercy he who afterwards dragged the wounded and the ailing to the door of the hospital and there slaughtered them in cold blood aye and here and elsewhere did other things too dreadful to write down says the old chronicler but this being understood by the women they assembled all together making the most pitiful cries and lamentations that could be heard the which would have moved a heart of flint so as it was not possible to abandon them  next another plan was formed that all the females and helpless should be set in the centre of a square of the fighting men to march out and give battle to the foe till everyone was slain then the spaniards hearing this and growing afraid of what these desperate men might do fell back on guile if they would surrender the citizens of haarlem were told and pay two hundred and forty thousand florins no punishment should be inflicted so having neither food nor hope they listened to the voice of the tempter and surrendered they who had fought until their garrison of four thousand was reduced to eighteen hundred men    it was noon and past on the fatal twelfth of july the gates were open the spaniards those who were left alive of them don frederic at their head with drums beating banners flying and swords sharpened for murder were marching into the city of haarlem in a deep niche between two great brick piers of the cathedral were gathered four people whom we know war and famine had left them all alive yet they had borne their share of both in every enterprise however desperate foy and martin had marched or stood or watched side by side and well did the spaniards know the weight of the great sword silence and the redheaded giant who wielded it mother martha too had not been idle throughout the siege she had served as the lieutenant of the widow hasselaer who with a band of three hundred women fought day and night alongside of their husbands and brothers even elsa who although she was too delicate and by nature timid and unfitted to go out to battle had done her part for she laboured at the digging of mines and the building of walls till her soft hands were rough and scarred  how changed they were foy whose face had been so youthful looked now like a man on the wrong side of middle age the huge martin might have been a great skeleton on which hung clothes or rather rags and a rent bulls hide with his blue eyes shining in deep pits beneath the massive projecting skull elsa too had become quite small like a child her sweet face was no longer pretty only pitiful and all the roundness of her figure had vanishedshe might have been an emaciated boy of the four of them martha the mare who was dressed like a man showed the least change indeed except that now her hair was snowy that her features were rather more horselike that the yellow lipless teeth projected even further and the thin nervous hands had become almost like those of an egyptian mummy she was much as she always had been  martin leaned upon the great sword and groaned curses on them the cowards he muttered why did they not let us go out and die fighting fools mad fools who would trust to the mercy of the spaniard  oh foy said elsa throwing her thin arms about his neck you will not let them take me will you if it comes to the worst you will kill me wont you otherwise i must kill myself and foy i am a coward i am afraidto do that  i suppose so he answered in a harsh unnatural voice but oh god if thou art have pity upon her oh god have pity  blaspheme not doubt not broke in the shrill voice of martha has it not been as i told you last winter in the boat have you not been protected and shall you not be protected to the end only blaspheme not doubt not  the niche in which they were standing was out of sight of the great square and those who thronged it but as martha spoke a band of victorious spaniards seven or eight of them came round the corner and caught sight of the party in the nook  theres a girl said the sergeant in command of them who isnt bad looking pull her out men  some fellows stepped forward to do his bidding now foy went mad he did not kill elsa as she had prayed him he flew straight at the throat of the brute who had spoken and next instant his sword was standing out a foot behind his neck then after him with a kind of low cry came martin plying the great blade silence and martha after him with her long knife it was all over in a minute but before it was done there were five men down three dead and two sore wounded  a tithe and an offering muttered martha as bounding forward she bent over the wounded men and their comrades fled round the corner of the cathedral  there was a minutes pause the bright summer sunlight shone upon the faces and armour of the dead spaniards upon the naked sword of foy who stood over elsa crouched to the ground in a corner of the niche her face hidden in her hands upon the terrible blue eyes of martin alight with a dreadful fire of rage then there came the sound of marching men and a company of spaniards appeared before them and at their headramiro and adrian called van goorl  there they are captain said a soldier one of those who had fled shall we shoot them  ramiro looked carelessly enough at first then again a long scrutinising look so he had caught them at last months ago he had learned that elsa had been rescued from the red mill by foy and martin and now after much seeking the birds were in his net  no he said i think not such desperate characters must be reserved for separate trial  where can they be kept captain asked the sergeant sulkily  i observed friend that the house which my son and i have taken as our quarters has excellent cellars they can be imprisoned there for the presentthat is except the young lady whom the senor adrian will look after as it chances she is his wife  at this the soldiers laughed openly  i repeathis wife for whom he has been searching these many months said ramiro and therefore to be respected do you understand men  apparently they did understand at least no one made any answer their captain as they had found was not a man who loved argument  now then you fellows went on ramiro give up your arms  martin thought a while evidently he was wondering whether it would not be best to rush at them and die fighting at that moment as he said afterwards indeed the old saying came into his mind a game is not lost until it is won and remembering that dead men can never have another chance of winning games he gave up the sword  hand that to me said ramiro it is a curious weapon to which i have taken a fancy  so sword silence was handed to him and he slung it over his shoulder foy looked at the kneeling elsa and he looked at his sword then an idea struck him and he looked at the face of adrian his brother whom he had last seen when the said adrian ran to warn him and martin at the factory for though he knew that he was fighting with his father among the spaniards during the siege they had never met even then in that dire extremity with a sudden flash of thought he wondered how it happened that adrian being the villain that he was had taken the trouble to come and warn them yonder in leyden thereby giving them time to make a very good defence in the shot tower  foy looked up at his brother adrian was dressed in the uniform of a spanish officer with a breastplate over his quilted doublet and a steel cap from the front of which rose a frayed and weatherworn plume of feathers the face had changed there was none of the old pomposity about those handsome features it looked worn and cowed like that of an animal which has been trained to do tricks by hunger and the use of the whip yet through all the shame and degradation foy seemed to catch the glint of some kind of light a light of good desire shining behind that piteous mask as the sun sometimes shines through a sullen cloud could it be that adrian was not quite so bad after all that he was in fact the adrian that he foy had always believed him to be vain silly passionate exaggerated born to be a tool and think himself the master but beneath everything wellmeaning who could say at the worst too was it not better that elsa should become the wife of adrian than that her life should cease there and then and by her lovers hand  these things passed through his brain as the lightning passes through the sky in an instant his mind was made up and foy flung down his sword at the feet of a soldier as he did so his eyes met the eyes of adrian and to his imagination they seemed to be full of thanks and promise  they took them all with gibes and blows the soldiers haled them away through the tumult and the agony of the fallen town and its doomed defenders out of the rich sunlight they led them into a house that still stood not greatly harmed by the cannonshot but a little way from the shattered ravelin and the gate which had been the scene of such fearful conflicta house that was the home of one of the wealthiest merchants in haarlem here foy and elsa were parted she struggled to his arms whence they tore her and dragged her away up the stairs but martin martha and foy were thrust into a dark cellar locked in and left  a while later the door of the cellar was unbarred and some hand they could not see whose passed through it water and food good food such as they had not tasted for months meat and bread and dried herrings more than they could eat of them  perhaps it is poisoned said foy smelling at it hungrily  what need to take the trouble to poison us answered martin let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die  so like starving animals they devoured the food with thankfulness and then they slept yes in the midst of all their misery and doubts they slept  it seemed but a few minutes laterin fact it was eight hourswhen the door opened again and there entered adrian carrying a lantern in his hand  foy martin he said get up and follow me if you would save your lives  instantly they were wide awake  follow youyou stammered foy in a choked voice  yes adrian answered quietly of course you may not escape but if you stop here what chance have you ramiro my father will be back presently and then  it is madness to trust ourselves to you interrupted martin and adrian seemed to wince at the contempt in his voice  i knew that you would think that he answered humbly but what else is to be done i can pass you out of the city i have made a boat ready for you to escape in all at the risk of my own life what more can i do why do you hesitate  because we do not believe you said foy besides there is elsa i will not go without elsa  i have thought of that answered adrian elsa is here come elsa show yourself  then from the stairs elsa crept into the cellar a new elsa for she too had been fed and in her eyes there shone a light of hope a wild jealousy filled foys heart why did she look thus but she she ran to him she flung her arms about his neck and kissed him and adrian did nothing he only turned his head aside  foy she gasped he is honest after all he has only been unfortunate come quickly there is a chance for us come before that devil returns now he is at a council of the officers settling with don frederic who are to be killed but soon he will be back and then  so they hesitated no more but went  they passed out of the house none stopping themthe guard had gone to the sack at the gate by the ruined ravelin there stood a sentry but the man was careless or drunken or bribed who knows at least adrian gave him a password and nodding his head he let them by a few minutes later they were at the mere side and there among some reeds lay the boat  enter and be gone said adrian  they scrambled into the boat and took the oars while martha began to push off  adrian said elsa what is to become of you  why do you trouble about that he asked with a bitter laugh i go back to my death my blood is the price of your freedom well i owe it to you  oh no she cried come with us  yes echoed foy although again that bitter pang of jealousy gripped his heart come with usbrother  do you really mean it adrian asked hesitating think i might betray you  if so young man why did you not do it before growled martin and stretching out his great bony arm he gripped him by the collar and dragged him into the boat  then they rowed away  where are we going asked martin  to leyden i suppose said foy if we can get there which without a sail or weapons seems unlikely  i have put some arms in the boat interrupted adrian the best i could get and from a locker he drew out a common heavy axe a couple of spanish swords a knife a smaller axe a crossbow and some bolts  not so bad said martin rowing with his left hand as he handled the big axe with his right but i wish that i had my sword silence which that accursed ramiro took from me and hung about his neck i wonder why he troubled himself with the thing it is too long for a man of his inches  i dont know said adrian but when last i saw him he was working at its hilt with a chisel which seemed strange he always wanted that sword during the siege he offered a large reward to any soldier who could kill you and bring it to him  working at the hilt with a chisel gasped martin by heaven i had forgotten the map the map some wicked villain must have told him that the map of the treasure was therethat is why he wanted the sword  who could have told him asked foy it was only known to you and me and martha and we are not of the sort to tell what give away the secret of hendrik brants treasure which he could die for and we were sworn to keep to save our miserable lives shame upon the thought  martha heard and looked at elsa a questioning look beneath which the poor girl turned a fiery red though by good fortune in that light none could see her blushes still she must speak lest the suspicion should lie on others  i ought to have told you before she said in a low voice but i forgoti mean that i have always been so dreadfully ashamed it was i who betrayed the secret of the sword silence  you how did you know it asked foy  mother martha told me on the night of the church burning after you escaped from leyden  martin grunted one woman to trust another and at her age too what a fool  fool yourself you thickbrained frisian broke in martha angrily where did you learn to teach your betters wisdom i told the jufvrouw because i knew that we might all of us be swept away and i thought it well that then she should know where to look for a key to the treasure  a womans kind of reason answered martin imperturbably and a bad one at that for if we had been finished off she must have found it difficult to get hold of the sword but all this is done with the point is why did the jufvrouw tell ramiro  because i am a coward answered elsa with a sob you know foy i always was a coward and i never shall be anything else i told him to save myself  from what  from being married  adrian winced palpably and foy noting it could not resist pushing the point  from being married but i understanddoubtless adrian will explain the thing he added grimlythat you were forced through some ceremony  yes answered elsa feebly iiwas i tried to buy myself off by telling ramiro the secret which will show you all how mad i was with terror at the thought of this hateful marriagehere a groan burst from the lips of adrian and something like a chuckle from those of red martin oh i am so sorry went on elsa in confusion i am sure that i did not wish to hurt adrians feelings especially after he has been so good to us  never mind adrians feelings and his goodness but go on with the story interrupted foy  there isnt much more to tell ramiro swore before god that if i gave him the clue he would let me go and thenthen well then after i had fallen into the pit and disgraced myself he said that it was not sufficient and that the marriage must take place  at this point foy and martin laughed outright yes even there they laughed  why you silly child said foy what else did you expect him to say  oh martin do you forgive me said elsa immediately after i had done it i knew how shameful it was and that he would try to hunt you down and that is why i have been afraid to tell you ever since but i pray you believe me i only spoke because between shame and fear i did not know right from wrong do you forgive me  lady answered the frisian smiling in his slow fashion if i had been there unknown to ramiro and you had offered him this head of mine on a dish as a bribe not only would i have forgiven you but i would have said that you did right you are a maid and you had to protect yourself from a very dreadful thing therefore who can blame you  i can said martha ramiro might have torn me to pieces with redhot pincers before i told him  yes said martin who felt that he had a debt to pay ramiro might but i doubt whether he would have gone to that trouble to persuade you to take a husband no dont be angry frisian thick of head frisian free of speech goes the saying  not being able to think of any appropriate rejoinder martha turned again upon elsa  your father died for that treasure she said and dirk van goorl died for it and your lover and his servingman there went to the tortureden for it and iwell i have done a thing or two but you girl why at the first pinch you betray the secret but as martin says i was fool enough to tell you  oh you are hard said elsa beginning to weep under marthas bitter reproaches but you forget that at least none of you were asked to marryoh i mustnt say that i mean to become the wife of one man then her eyes fell upon foy and an inspiration seized her here at least was one of whom she could make a friendwhen you happen to be very much in love with another  of course not said foy there is no need for you to explain  i think there is a great deal to explain went on martha for you cannot fool me with pretty words but now hark you foy van goorl what is to be done we have striven hard to save that treasure all of us is it to be lost at the last  aye echoed martin growing very serious is it to be lost at the last remember what the worshipful hendrik brant said to us yonder on that night at the haguethat he believed that in a day to come thousands and tens of thousands of our people would bless the gold he entrusted to us  i remember it all answered foy and other things too his will for instance and he thought of his father and of those hours which martin and he had spent in the gevangenhuis then he looked up at martha and said briefly mother though they call you mad you are the wisest among us what is your counsel  she pondered awhile and answered this is certain that so soon as ramiro finds that we have escaped having the key to it he will take boat and sail to the place where the barrels are buried knowing well that otherwise we shall be off with them yes i tell you that by dawn or within an hour of it he will be there and she stopped  you mean said foy that we ought to be there before him  martha nodded and answered if we can but i think that at best there must be a fight for it  yes said martin a fight well i should like another fight with ramiro that forktongued adder has got my sword and i want to get it back again  oh broke in elsa is there to be more fighting i hoped that at last we were safe and going straight to leyden where the prince is i hate this bloodshed i tell you foy it frightens me to death i believe that i shall die of it  you hear what she says asked foy  we hear answered martha take no heed of her the child has suffered much she is weak and squeamish now i although i believe that my death lies before me i say go on and fear not  but i do take heed said foy not for all the treasures in the world shall elsa be put in danger again if she does not wish it she shall decide and she alone  how good you are to me she murmured then she mused a moment foy she said will you promise something to me  after your experience of ramiros oaths i wonder that you ask he answered trying to be cheerful  will you promise she went on taking no note that if i say yes and we go not to leyden but to seek the treasure and live through it that you will take me away from this land of bloodshed and murder and torments to some country where folk may live at peace and see no one killed except it be now and again an evildoer it is much to ask but oh foy will you promise  yes i promise said foy for he too was weary of this daily terror who would not have been that had passed through the siege of haarlem  foy was steering but now martha slipped aft and took the tiller from his hand for a moment she studied the stars that grew clearer in the light of the sinking moon then shifted the helm a point or two to port and sat still  i am hungry again said martin presently i feel as though i could eat for a week without stopping  adrian looked up from over his oar at which he was labouring dejectedly and said  there are food and wine in the locker i hid them there perhaps elsa could serve them to those who wish to eat  so elsa who was doing nothing found the drink and victuals and handed them round to the rowers who ate and drank as best they might with a thankful heart but without ceasing from their task to men who have starved for months the taste of wholesome provender and sound wine is a delight that cannot be written in words  when at length they had filled themselves adrian spoke  if it is your good will brother he said addressing foy as we do not know what lies in front nor how long any of us have to live i who am an outcast and a scorn among you wish to tell you a story  speak on said foy  so adrian began from the beginning and told them all his tale he told them how at the first he had been led astray by superstitions vanity and love how his foolish confidences had been written down by spies how he had been startled and terrified into signing them with results of which they knew then he told them how he was hunted like a mad dog through the streets of leyden after his mother had turned him from her door how he took refuge in the den of hague simon and there had fought with ramiro and been conquered by the mans address and his own horror of shedding a fathers blood he told them of his admission into the roman faith of the dreadful scene in the church when martha had denounced him of their flight to the red mill he told them of the kidnapping of elsa and how he had been quite innocent of it although he loved her dearly of how at last he was driven into marrying her meaning her no harm to save her from the grip of ramiro and knowing at heart that it was no marriage of how when the flood burst upon them he had been hustled from the mill where since she could no longer be of service to him and might work him injury as he discovered afterwards ramiro had left elsa to her fate lastly in a broken voice he told them of his life during the long siege which so he said was as the life of a damned spirit and of how when death thinned the ranks of the spaniards he had been made an officer among them and by the special malice of ramiro forced to conduct the executions and murders of such hollanders as they took  then at last his chance had come ramiro thinking that now he could never turn against him had given him elsa and left him with her while he went about his duties and to secure a share of the plunder meaning to deal with his prisoners on the morrow so he adrian a man in authority had provided the boat and freed them that was all he had to say except to renounce any claim upon her who was called his wife and to beg their forgiveness  foy listened to the end then dropping his oar for a moment he put his arm about adrians waist and hugged him saying in his old cheery voice  i was right after all you know adrian i always stood up for you notwithstanding your temper and queer ways no i never would believe that you were a villain but neither could i ever have believed that you were quite such an ass  to this outspoken estimate of his character so fallen and crushed was he his brother had not the spirit to reply he could merely tug at his oar and groan while the tears of shame and repentance ran down his pale and handsome face  never mind old fellow said foy consolingly it all went wrong thanks to you and thanks to you i believe that it will all come right again so we will cry quits and forget the rest  poor adrian glanced up at foy and at elsa sitting on the thwart of the boat by his side  yes brother he answered for you and elsa it may come right but not for me in this world for ii have sold myself to the devil andgot no pay  after that for a while no one spoke all felt that the situation was too tragic for speech even the follies and indeed the wickedness of adrian were covered up were blotted out in the tragedy of his utter failure yes and redeemed by the depth of his atonement    the grey light of the summer morning began to grow on the surface of the great inland sea far behind them they beheld the suns rays breaking upon the gilt crown that is set above the tower of st bavons church soaring over the lost city of haarlem and the doomed patriots who lay there presently to meet their death at the murderers sword they looked and shuddered had it not been for adrian they would be prisoners now and what that meant they knew if they had been in any doubt what they saw around must have enlightened them for here and there upon the misty surface of the lake or stranded in its shallows were the halfburnt out hulls of ships the remains of the conquered fleet of william the silent a poor record of the last desperate effort to relieve the starving city now and again too something limp and soft would cumber their oars the corpse of a drowned or slaughtered man still clad perchance in its armour  at length they passed out of these dismal remains of lost men and elsa could look about her without shuddering now they were in fleet water and in among the islands whereon the lush summer growth of weeds and the beautiful marsh flowers grew as greenly and bloomed as bright as though no spaniard had trampled their roots under foot during all those winter months of siege and death these islets scores and hundreds of them appeared on every side but between them all martha steered an unerring path as the sun rose she stood up in the boat and shading her eyes with her hand to shut out its level rays looked before her  there is the place she said pointing to a little bulrushclad isle from which a kind of natural causeway not more than six feet wide projected like a tongue among muddy shallows peopled by coots and waterhens with their redbeaked young  martin rose too then he looked back behind him and said  i see the cap of a sail upon the skyline it is ramiro  without doubt answered martha calmly well we have the half of an hour to work in pull bow oar pull we will go round the island and beach her in the mud on the further side they will be less likely to see us there and i know a place whence we can push off in a hurry    chapter xxix  adrian comes home again  they landed on the island wading to it through the mud which at this spot had a gravelly bottom all of them except elsa who remained on the boat to keep watch following otterpaths through the thick rushes they came to the centre of the islet some thirty yards away here at a spot which martha ascertained by a few hurried pacings grew a dense tuft of reeds in the midst of these reeds was a ducks nest with the young just hatching out off which the old bird flew with terrified quackings  beneath this nest lay the treasure if it were still there  at any rate the place has not been disturbed lately said foy then even in his frantic haste lifting the little fledglingsfor he loved all things that had life and did not wish to see them hurthe deposited them where they might be found again by the mother  nothing to dig with muttered martin not even a stone thereon martha pushed her way to a willow bush that grew near and with the smaller of the two axes which she held in her hand cut down the thickest of its stems and ran back with them by the help of these sharpened stakes and with their axes they began to dig furiously till at length the point of foys implement struck upon the head of a barrel  the stuff is still here keep to it friends he said and they worked on with a will till three of the five barrels were almost free from the mud  best make sure of these said martin help me master and between them one by one they rolled them to the waters edge and with great efforts elsa aiding them lifted them into the boat as they approached with the third cask they found her staring whitefaced over the tops of the feathery reeds  what is it sweet asked foy  the sail the following sail she answered  they rested the barrel of gold upon the gunwale and looked back across the little island yes there it came sure enough a tall white sail not eight hundred yards away and bearing down straight upon the place martin rolled the barrel into position  i hoped that they would not find it he said but martha draws maps well too well once before she married she painted pictures and that is why  what is to be done asked elsa  i dont know he answered and as he spoke martha ran up for she also had seen the boat you see he went on if we try to escape they will catch us for oars cant race a sail  oh said elsa must we be taken after all  i hope not girl said martha but it is as god wills listen martin and she whispered in his ear  good he said if it can be done but you must watch your chance come now there is no time to lose and you lady come also for you can help to roll the last two barrels  then they ran back to the hole whence foy and adrian with great toil had just dragged the last of the tubs for they too had seen the sail and knew that time was short  heer adrian said martin you have the crossbow and the bolts and you used to be the best shot of all three of us will you help me to hold the causeway  now adrian knew that martin said this not because he was a good shot with the crossbow but because he did not trust him and wished to have him close to his hand but he answered  with all my heart as well as i am able  very good said martin now let the rest of you get those two casks into the boat leaving the jufvrouw hidden in the reeds to watch by it while you foy and martha come back to help us lady if they sail round the island call and let us know  so martin and adrian went down to the end of the little gravelly tongue and crouched among the tall meadowsweet and grasses while the others working furiously rolled the two barrels to the wateredge and shipped them throwing rushes over them that they might not catch the eye of the spaniards  the sailing boat drew on in the sternsheets of it sat ramiro an open paper which he was studying upon his knee and still slung about his body the great sword silence  before i am half an hour older reflected martin for even now he did not like to trust his thoughts to adrian either i will have that sword back again or i shall be a dead man but the odds are great eleven of them all tough fellows and we but three and two women  just then ramiros voice reached them across the stillness of the water  down with the sail he cried cheerily for without a doubt that is the placethere are the six islets in a line there in front the other island shaped like a herring and there the little promontory marked landing place how well this artist draws to be sure  the rest of his remarks were lost in the creaking of the blocks as the sail came down  shallow water ahead senor said a man in the bows sounding with a boat hook  good answered ramiro throwing out the little anchor we will wade ashore  as he spoke the spanish soldier with the boathook suddenly pitched head first into the water a quarrel from adrians crossbow through his heart  ah said ramiro so they are here before us well there cant be many of them now then prepare to land  another quarrel whistled through the air and stuck in the mast doing no hurt after this no more bolts came for in his eagerness adrian had broken the mechanism of the bow by overwinding it so that it became useless they leaped into the water ramiro with them and charged for the land when of a sudden almost at the tip of the little promontory from among the reeds rose the gigantic shape of red martin clad in his tattered jerkin and bearing in his hand a heavy axe while behind him appeared foy and adrian  why by the saints cried ramiro theres my weathercock son again fighting against us this time well weathercock this is your last veer then he began to wade towards the promontory charge he cried but not a man would advance within reach of that axe they stood here and there in the water looking at it doubtfully for although they were brave enough there was none of them but knew of the strength and deeds of the red frisian giant and halfstarved as he was feared to meet him face to face moreover he had a position of advantage of that there could be no doubt  can i help you to land friends said martin mocking them no it is no use looking right or left the mud there is very deep  an arquebus shoot him with an arquebus shouted the men in front but there was no such weapon in the boat for the spaniards who had left in a hurry and without expecting to meet red martin had nothing but their swords and knives  ramiro considered a moment for he saw that to attempt to storm this little landingplace would cost many lives even if it were possible then he gave an order back aboard the men obeyed with alacrity out oars and up anchor he cried  he is clever said foy he knows that our boat must be somewhere and he is going to seek for it  martin nodded and for the first time looked afraid then as soon as ramiro had begun to row round the islet leaving martha to watch that he did not return and rush the landingstage they crossed through the reeds to the other side and climbed into their boat scarcely were they there when ramiro and his men appeared and a shout announced that they were discovered  on crept the spaniards as near as they dared that is to within a dozen fathoms of them and anchored for they were afraid to run their own heavy sailing cutter upon the mud lest they might be unable to get her off again also for evident reasons being without firearms and knowing the character of the defenders they feared to make a direct attack the position was curious and threatened to be prolonged at last ramiro rose and addressed them across the water  gentlemen and lady of the enemy he said for i think that i see my little captive of the red mill among you let us take counsel together we have both of us made this expedition for a purpose have we notnamely to secure certain filthy lucre which after all would be of slight value to dead men now as you or some of you know i am a man opposed to violence i wish to hurry the end of none nor even to inflict suffering if it can be avoided but there is money in the question to secure which i have already gone through a great deal of inconvenience and anxiety and to be brief that money i must have while you on the other hand are doubtless anxious to escape hence with your lives so i make you an offer let one of our party come under safe conduct on board your boat and search it just to see if anything lies beneath those rushes for instance then if it is found empty we will withdraw to a distance and let you go or the same if full that is upon its contents being unladen into the mud  are those all your terms asked foy  not quite all worthy heer van goorl among you i observe a young gentleman whom doubtless you have managed to carry off against his will to wit my beloved son adrian in his own interests for he will scarcely be a welcome guest in leyden i ask that before you depart you should place this noble cavalier ashore in a position where we can see him now what is your answer  that you may go back to hell to look for it replied martin rudely while foy added  what other answer do you expect from folk who have escaped out of your clutches in haarlem  as he said the words at a nod from martin martha who by now had crept up to them under cover of his great form and of surrounding reeds let go the stern of the boat and vanished  plain words from plain uncultivated people not unnaturally irritated by the course of political events with which although fortune has mixed me up in them i have nothing whatever to do answered ramiro but once more i beg of you to consider it is probable that you have no food upon your boat whereas we have plenty also in due course darkness will fall which must give us a certain advantage moreover i have reason to hope for assistance therefore in a waiting game like this the cards are with me and as i think your poor prisoner adrian will tell you i know how to play a hand at cards  about eight yards from the cutter in a thick patch of waterlilies just at this moment an otter rose to take airan old dogotter for it was greyheaded one of the spaniards in the boat caught sight of the ring it made and picking up a stone from the ballast threw it at it idly the otter vanished  we have been seeking each other a long while but have never come to blows yet although being a brave man i know you would wish it said red martin modestly senor ramiro will you do me the honour to overlook my humble birth and come ashore with me for a few minutes man against man the odds would be in your favour for you have armour and i have nothing but a worn bulls hide also you have my good sword silence and i only a woodmans axe still i will risk it and what is more trusting to your good faith we are willing to wager the treasure of hendrik brant upon the issue  so soon as they understood this challenge a roar of laughter went up from the spaniards in the boat in which ramiro himself joined heartily the idea of anyone voluntarily entering upon a single combat with the terrible frisian giant who for months had been a name of fear among the thousands that beleaguered haarlem struck them as really ludicrous  but of a sudden they ceased laughing and one and all stared with a strange anxiety at the bottom of their boat much as terrier dogs stare at the earth beneath which they hear invisible vermin on the move then a great shouting arose among them and they looked eagerly over the gunwales yes and began to stab at the water with their swords but all the while through the tumult and voices came a steady regular sound as of a person knocking heavily on the further side of a thick door  mother of heaven screamed someone in the cutter we are scuttled and they began to tear at the false bottom of their boat while others stabbed still more furiously at the surface of the mere  now rising one by one to the face of that quiet water could be seen bubbles and the line of them ran from the cutter towards the rowing boat presently within six feet of it axe in hand rose the strange and dreadful figure of a naked skeletonlike woman covered with mud and green weeds and bleeding from great wounds in the back and sides  there it stood shaking an axe at the terrorstricken spaniards and screaming in short gasps  paid back paid back ramiro now sink and drown you dog or come visit red martin on the shore  well done martha roared martin as he dragged her dying into the boat while he spoke lo the cutter began to fill and sink  there is but one chance for it cried ramiro overboard and at them it is not deep and springing into the water which reached to his neck he began to wade towards the shore  push off cried foy and they thrust and pulled but the gold was heavy and their boat had settled far into the mud do what they might she would not stir then uttering some strange frisian oath martin sprang over her stern and putting out all his mighty strength thrust at it to loose her still she would not move the spaniards came up now the water reached only to their thighs and their bright swords flashed in the sunlight  cut them down yelled ramiro at them for your lives sake  the boat trembled but she would not stir  too heavy in the bows screamed martha and struggling to her feet with one wild scream she launched herself straight at the throat of the nearest spaniard she gripped him with her long arms and down they went together once they rose then fell again and through a cloud of mud might be seen struggling upon the bottom of the mere till presently they lay still both of them  the lightened boat lifted and in answer to martins mighty efforts glided forward through the clinging mud again he thrust and she was clear  climb in martin climb in shouted foy as he stabbed at a spaniard  by heaven no roared ramiro splashing towards him with the face of a devil  for a second martin stood still then he bent and the swordcut fell harmless upon his leather jerkin now very suddenly his great arms shot out yes he seized ramiro by the thighs and lifted and there was seen the sight of a man thrown into the air as though he were a ball tossed by a child at play to fall headlong upon the casks of treasure in the skiff prow where he lay still  martin sprang forward and gripped the tiller with his outstretched hand as it glided away from him  row master row he cried and foy rowed madly until they were clear of the last spaniard clear by ten yards even elsa snatched a rollock and with it struck a soldier on the hand who tried to stay them forcing him to loose his grip a deed of valour she boasted of with pride all her life through then they dragged martin into the boat  now you spanish dogs the great man roared back at them as he shook the water from his flaming hair and beard go dig for brants treasure and live on ducks eggs here till don frederic sends to fetch you    the island had melted away into a mist of other islands no living thing was to be seen save the wild creatures and birds of the great lake and no sound was to be heard except their calling and the voices of the wind and water they were alonealone and safe and there at a distance towards the skyline rose the church towers of leyden for which they headed  jufvrouw said martin presently there is another flagon of wine in that locker and we should be glad of a pull at it  elsa who was steering the boat rose and found the wine and a horn mug which she filled and handed first to foy  heres a health said foy as he drank to the memory of mother martha who saved us all well she died as she would have wished to die taking a spaniard for company and her story will live on  amen said martin then a thought struck him and leaving his oars for a minute for he rowed two as against foys and adrians one he went forward to where ramiro lay stricken senseless on the kegs of specie and jewels in the bows and took from him the great sword silence but he strapped the spaniards legs together with his belt  that crack on the head keeps him quiet enough he said in explanation but he might come to and give trouble or try to swim for it since such cats have many lives ah senor ramiro i told you i would have my sword back before i was half an hour older or go where i shouldnt want one then he touched the spring in the hilt and examined the cavity why he said heres my legacy left in it safe and sound no wonder my good angel made me mad to get that sword again  no wonder echoed foy especially as you got ramiro with it and he glanced at adrian who was labouring at the bow oar looking now that the excitement of the fight had gone by most downcast and wretched well he might seeing the welcome that as he feared awaited him in leyden  for a while they rowed on in silence all that they had gone through during the last four and twenty hours and the seven preceding months of war and privation had broken their nerve even now although they had escaped the danger and won back the buried gold capturing the archvillain who had brought them so much death and misery and their home which for the present moment at any rate was a strong place of refuge lay before them still they could not be at ease where so many had died where the risks had been so fearful it seemed almost incredible that they four should be living and hale though weary with a prospect of continuing to live for many years  that the girl whom he loved so dearly and whom he had so nearly lost should be sitting before him safe and sound ready to become his wife whensoever he might wish it seemed to foy also a thing too good to be true too good to be true was it moreover that his brother the wayward passionate weak poeticalminded adrian made by nature to be the tool of others and bear the burden of their evil doing should have been dragged before it was over late out of the net of the fowler have repented of his sins and follies and at the risk of his own life shown that he was still a man no longer the base slave of passion and selflove for foy always loved his brother and knowing him better than any others knew him had found it hard to believe that however black things might look against him he was at heart a villain  thus he thought and elsa too had her thoughts which may be guessed they were silent all of them till of a sudden elsa seated in the sternsheets saw adrian suddenly let fall his oar throw his arms wide and pitch forward against the back of martin yes and in place of where he had sat appeared the dreadful countenance of ramiro stamped with a grin of hideous hate such as satan might wear when souls escape him at the last ramiro recovered and sitting up for to his feet he could not rise because of the sword strap in his hand a thin deadlylooking knife  habet he said with a short laugh habes weathercock and he turned the knife against himself  but martin was on him and in five more seconds he lay trussed like a fowl in the bottom of the boat  shall i kill him said martin to foy who with elsa was bending over adrian  no answered foy grimly let him take his trial in leyden oh what accursed fools were we not to search him  ramiros face turned a shade more ghastly  it is your hour he said in a hoarse voice you have won thanks to that dog of a son of mine who i trust may linger long before he dies as die he must ah well this is what comes of breaking my oath to the virgin and again lifting my hand against a woman he looked at elsa and shuddered then went on it is your hour make an end of me at once i do not wish to appear thus before those boors  gag him said foy to martin lest our ears be poisoned and martin obeyed with good will then he flung him down and there the man lay his back supported by the kegs of treasure he had worked so hard and sinned so deeply to win making as he knew well his last journey to death and to whatever may lie beyond that solemn gate  they were passing the island that many years ago had formed the turning post of the great sledge race in which his passenger had been the fair leyden heiress lysbeth van hout ramiro could see her now as she was that day he could see also how that race which he just failed to win had been for him an augury of disaster had not the hollander again beaten him at the post and that hollanderlysbeths own son by another fatherhelped to it by her son born of himself who now lay there deathstricken by him that gave him life    they would take him to lysbeth he knew it she would be his judge that woman against whom he had piled up injury after injury whom even when she seemed to be in his power he had feared more than any living being    and after he had met her eyes for the last time then would come the end what sort of an end would it be for the captain redhanded from the siege of haarlem for the man who had brought dirk van goorl to his death for the father who had just planted a dagger between the shoulders of his son because at the last that son had chosen to be true to his own people and to deliver them from a dreadful doom    why did it come back to him that horrible dream which had risen in his mind when for the first time after many years he met lysbeth face to face there in the gevangenhuis that dream of the pitiful little man falling falling through endless space and at the bottom of the gulf two great hands hands hideous and suggestive reaching through the shadows to receive him    like his son adrian ramiro was superstitious more his intellect his reading which in youth had been considerable his observation of men and women all led him to the conclusion that death is a wall with many doors in it that on this side of the wall we may not linger or sleep but must pass each of us through his appointed portal straight to the domain prepared for us if so what would be his lot and who would be waiting to greet him yonder oh terrors may attend the wicked after death but in the case of some they do not tarry until death they leap forward to him whom it is decreed must die forcing attention with their eager craving hands with their obscure and ominous voices    about him the sweet breath of the summer afternoon the skimming swallows the meadows starred with flowers within him every hell at which the imagination can so much as hint  before he passed the gates of leyden in those few short hours ramiro to elsas eyes had aged by twenty years  their little boat was heavy laden the wind was against them and they had a dying man and a prisoner aboard so it came about that the day was closing before the soldiers challenged them from the watergate asking who they were and whither they went foy stood up and said  we are foy van goorl red martin elsa brant a wounded man and a prisoner escaped from haarlem and we go to the house of lysbeth van goorl in the bree straat  then they let them through the watergate and there on the further side were many gathered who thanked god for their deliverance and begged tidings of them  come to the house in the bree straat and we will tell you from the balcony answered foy  so they rowed from one cut and canal to another till at last they came to the private boathouse of the van goorls and entered it and thus by the small door into the house    lysbeth van goorl recovered from her illness now but aged and grown stern with suffering sat in an armchair in the great parlour of her home in the bree straat the room where as a girl she had cursed montalvo where too not a year ago she had driven his son the traitor adrian from her presence at her side was a table on which stood a silver bell and two brass holders with candles ready to be lighted she rang the bell and a womanservant entered the same who with elsa had nursed her in the plague  what is that murmuring in the street lysbeth asked i hear the sound of many voices is there more news from haarlem  alas yes answered the woman a fugitive says that the executioners there are weary so now they tie the poor prisoners back to back and throw them into the mere to drown  a groan burst from lysbeths lips foy my son is there she muttered and elsa brant his affianced wife and martin his servant and many another friend oh god how long how long and her head sank upon her bosom  soon she raised it again and said light the candles woman this place grows dark and in its gloom i see the ghosts of all my dead  they burned uptwo stars of light in the great room  whose feet are those upon the stairs asked lysbeth the feet of men who bear burdens open the large doors woman and let that enter which it pleases god to send us  so the doors were flung wide and through them came people carrying a wounded man then following him foy and elsa and lastly towering above them all red martin who thrust before him another man lysbeth rose from her chair to look  do i dream she said or son foy hath the angel of the lord delivered you out of the hell of haarlem  we are here mother he answered  and whom she said pointing to the figure covered with a cloak do you bring with you  adrian mother who is dying  then son foy take him hence alive dying or dead i have done with here her eyes fell upon red martin and the man he held martin the frisian she muttered but who  martin heard and by way of answer lifted up his prisoner so that the fading light from the balcony windows fell full upon his face  what she cried juan de montalvo as well as his son adrian and in this room then she checked herself and added foy tell me your story  in few words and brief he told it or so much as she need know to understand his last words were mother be merciful to adrian from the first he meant no ill he saved all our lives and he lies dying by that mans dagger  lift him up she said  so they lifted him up and adrian who since the knife pierced him had uttered no word spoke for the first and last time muttering hoarsely  mother take back your words and forgive mebefore i die  now the sorrowfrozen heart of lysbeth melted and she bent over him and said speaking so that all might hear  welcome to your home again adrian you who once were led astray have done bravely and i am proud to call you son though you have left the faith in which you were bred here and hereafter may god bless you and reward you beloved adrian then she bent down and kissed his dying lips foy and elsa kissed him also in farewell before they bore him smiling happily to himself to the chamber his own chamber where within some few hours death found him  adrian had been borne away and for a little while there was silence then none commanding him but as though an instinct pushed him forward red martin began to move up the length of the long room half dragging half carrying his captive ramiro it was as if some automaton had suddenly been put in motion some machine of gigantic strength that nothing could stop the man in his grip set his heels in the floor and hung back but martin scarcely seemed to heed his resistance on he came and the victim with him till they stood together before the oaken chair and the sternfaced whitehaired woman who sat in it her cold countenance lit by the light of the two candles she looked and shuddered then she spoke asking  why do you bring this man to me martin  for judgment lysbeth van goorl he answered  who made me a judge over him she asked  my master dirk van goorl your son adrian and hendrik brant their blood makes you judge of his blood  i will have none of it lysbeth said passionately let the people judge him as she spoke from the crowd in the street below there swelled a sudden clamour  good said martin the people shall judge and he began to turn towards the window when suddenly by a desperate effort ramiro wrenched his doublet from his hand and flung himself at lysbeths feet and grovelled there  what do you seek she asked drawing back her dress so that he should not touch it  mercy he gasped  mercy look son and daughter this man asks for mercy who for many a year has given none well juan de montalvo take your prayer to god and to the people i have done with you  mercy mercy he cried again  eight months ago she said i uttered that prayer to you begging of you in the name of christ to spare the life of an innocent man and what was your answer juan de montalvo  once you were my wife he pleaded being a woman does not that weigh with you  once he was my husband being a man did that weigh with you the last word is said take him martin to those who deal with murderers  then that look came upon montalvo which twice or thrice before lysbeth has seen written in his faceonce when the race was run and lost and once when in after years she had petitioned for the life of her husband lo it was no longer the face of a man but such a countenance as might have been worn by a devil or a beast the eyeball started the grey moustache curled upwards the cheekbones grew high and sharp  night after night he gasped you lay at my side and i might have killed you as i have killed that brat of yoursand i spared you i spared you  god spared me juan de montalvo that he might bring us to this hour let him spare you also if he will i do not judge he judges and the people and lysbeth rose from her chair  stay he cried gnashing his teeth  no i stay not i go to receive the last breath of him you have murdered my son and yours  he raised himself upon his knees and for a moment their eyes met for the last time  do you remember she said in a quiet voice many years ago in this very room after you had bought me at the cost of dirks life certain words i spoke to you now i do not think that it was i who spoke juan de montalvo  and she swept past him and though the wide doorway    red martin stood upon the balcony gripping the man ramiro beneath him the broad street was packed with people hundreds and thousands of them a dense mass seething in the shadows save here and again where a torch or a lantern flared showing their white faces for the moon which shone upon martin and his captive scarcely reached those down below as gaunt haggard and longhaired he stepped upon the balcony they saw him and his burden and there went up such a yell as shook the very roofs of leyden martin held up his hand and there was silence deep silence through which the breath of all that multitude rose in sighs like the sighing of a little wind  citizens my leyden my masters the frisian cried in a great deep voice that echoed down the street i have a word to say to you this man heredo you know him  back came an answering yell of aye  he is a spaniard went on martin the noble count juan de montalvo who many years past forced one lysbeth van hout of this city into a false marriage buying her at the price of the life of her affianced husband dirk van goorl that he might win her fortune  we know it they shouted  afterwards he was sent to the galleys for his crimes he came back and was made governor of the gevangenhuis by the bloody alva where he brought to death your brother and past burgomaster dirk van goorl afterwards he kidnapped the person of elsa brant the daughter of hendrik brant whom the inquisition murdered at the hague we rescued her from him my master foy van goorl and i afterwards he served with the spaniards as a captain of their forces in the siege of haarlem yonderhaarlem that fell three days ago and whose citizens they are murdering tonight throwing them two by two to drown in the waters of the mere  kill him cast him down roared the mob give him to us red martin  again the frisian lifted his hand and again there was silence a sudden terrible silence  this man had a son my mistress lysbeth van goorl to her shame and sorrow was the mother of him that son repenting saved us from the sack of haarlem yea through him the three of us foy van goorl elsa brant and i martin roos their servant are alive tonight this man and his spaniards overtook us on the lake and there we conquered him by the help of martha the mare martha whom they made to carry her own husband to the fire we conquered him but sheshe died in the fray they stabbed her to death in the water as men stab an otter well that son the heer adrian he was murdered in the boat with a knifeblow given by his own father from behind and he lies here in this house dead or dying  my master and i we brought this man who today is called ramiro to be judged by the woman whose husband and son he slew but she would not judge him she said take him to the people let them judge so judge now ye people and with an effort of his mighty strength martin swung the struggling body of ramiro over the parapet of the balcony and let him hang there above their heads  they yelled they screamed in their ravenous hate and rage they leapt up as hounds leap at a wolf upon a wall  give him to us give him to us that was their cry  martin laughed aloud take him then he said take him ye people and judge him as you will and with one great heave he hurled the thing that writhed between his hands far out into the centre of the street  the crowd below gathered themselves into a heap like water above a boat sinking in the heart of a whirlpool for a minute or more they snarled and surged and twisted then they broke up and went away talking in short eager sentences and there small and dreadful on the stones lay something that once had been a man    thus did the burghers of leyden pass judgment and execute it upon that noble spaniard the count juan de montalvo    chapter xxx  two scenes   scene the first  some months had gone by and alkmaar that heroic little city of the north had turned the flood of spanish victory full of shame and rage the armies of philip and of valdez marched upon leyden and from november 1573 to the end of march 1574 the town was besieged then the soldiers were called away to fight louis of nassau and the leaguer was raised till on the fatal field of mook heath the gallant louis with his brother henry and four thousand of their soldiers perished defeated by davila now once more the victorious spaniards threatened leyden  in a large bare room of the stadthuis of that city at the beginning of the month of may a man of middleage might have been seen one morning walking up and down muttering to himself as he walked he was not a tall man and rather thin in figure with brown eyes and beard hair tinged with grey and a wide brow lined by thought this was william of orange called the silent one of the greatest and most noble of human beings who ever lived in any age the man called forth by god to whom holland owes its liberties and who for ever broke the hideous yoke of religious fanaticism among the teuton races  sore was his trouble on this may morning but last month two more of his brothers had found death beneath the sword of the spaniard and now this same spaniard with whom he had struggled for all these weary years was marching in his thousands upon leyden  money he was muttering to himself give me money and i will save the city yet with money ships can be built more men can be raised powder can be bought money money moneyand i have not a ducat all gone everything even to my mothers trinkets and the plate upon my table nothing is left no not the credit to buy a dozen geldings  as he thought thus one of his secretaries entered the room  well count said the prince have you been to them all  yes sir  and with what success  the burgomaster van de werff promises to do everything he can and will for he is a man to lean on but money is short it has all left the country and there is not much to get  i know it groaned orange you cant make a loaf from the crumbs beneath the table is the proclamation put up inviting all good citizens to give or lend in this hour of their countrys need  yes sir  thank you count you can go there is nothing more to do we will ride for delft tonight  sir said the secretary there are two men in the courtyard who wish to see you  are they known  oh yes perfectly one is foy van goorl who went through the siege of haarlem and escaped the son of the worthy burgher dirk van goorl whom they did to death yonder in the gevangenhuis and the other a friesland giant of a man called red martin his servant of whose feats of arms you may have heard the two of them held a shot tower in this town against forty or fifty spaniards and killed i dont know how many  the prince nodded i know this red martin is a goliath a brave fellow what do they want  i am not sure said the secretary with a smile but they have brought a herringcart here the frisian in the shafts for a horse and the heer van goorl pushing behind they say that it is laden with ammunition for the service of their country  then why do they not take it to the burgomaster or somebody in authority  i dont know but they declare that they will only deliver it to you in person  you are sure of your men count you know he added with a smile i have to be careful  quite they were identified by several of the people in the other room  then admit them they may have something to say  but sir they wish to bring in their cart  very well let them bring it in if it will come through the door answered the prince with a sigh for his thoughts were far from these worthy citizens and their cart  presently the wide double doors were opened and red martin appeared not as he was after the siege of haarlem but as he used to be wellcovered and bland with a beard even longer and more fiery than of yore at the moment he was strangely employed for across his great breast lay the broad bellyband of a horse and by its means harnessed between the shafts he dragged a laden cart covered with an old sail moreover the load must have been heavy for notwithstanding his strength and that of foy no weakling who pushed behind they had trouble in getting the wheels up a little rise at the threshold  foy shut the doors then they trundled their cart into the middle of the great room halted and saluted so curious was the sight and so inexplicable that the prince forgetting his troubles for a minute burst out laughing  i daresay it looks strange sir said foy hotly the colour rising to the roots of his fair hair but when you have heard our story i am not sure that you will laugh at us  mynheer van goorl said the prince with grave courtesy be assured that i laugh at no true men such as yourself and your servant martin the frisian and least of all at men who could hold yonder shot tower against fifty spaniards who could escape out of haarlem and bring home with them the greatest devil in don frederics army it was your equipage i laughed at not yourselves and he bowed slightly first to the one and then to the other  his highness thinks perhaps said martin that the man who does an asss work must necessarily be an ass at which sally the prince laughed again  sir said foy i crave your patience for a while and on no mean matter your highness has heard perhaps of one hendrik brant who perished in the inquisition  do you mean the goldsmith and banker who was said to be the richest man in the netherlands  yes sir the man whose treasure was lost  i rememberwhose treasure was lostthough it was reported that some of our own people got away with it and his eyes wandered wonderingly to the sail which hid the burden on the cart  sir went on foy you heard right red martin and i with a pilot man who was killed were they who got away with it and by the help of the waterwife who now is dead and who was known as mother martha or the mare we hid it in haarlemer meer whence we recovered it after we escaped from haarlem if you care to know how i will tell you later but the tale is long and strange elsa brant was with us at the time  she is hendrik brants only child and therefore the owner of his wealth i believe interrupted the prince  yes sir and my affianced wife  i have heard of the young lady and i congratulate you is she in leyden  no sir her strength and mind were much broken by the horrors which she passed through in the siege of haarlem and by other events more personal to her therefore when the spaniards threatened their first leaguer of this place i sent her and my mother to norwich in england where they may sleep in peace  you were wise indeed heer van goorl replied the prince with a sigh but it seems that you stopped behind  yes sir martin and i thought it our duty to see this war out when leyden is safe from the spaniards then we go to england not before  when leyden is safe from the spaniards and again the prince sighed adding well you have a true heart young sir and a right spirit for which i honour both of you but i fear that things being thus the jufvrouw cannot sleep so very peacefully in norwich after all  we must each bear our share of the basket answered foy sadly i must do the fighting and she the watching  it is so i know it who have both fought and watched well i hope that a time will come when you will both of you do the loving and now for the rest of the story  sir it is very short we read your proclamation in the streets this morning and learned from it for certain what we have heard before that you are in sore want of money for the defence of leyden and the war at large therefore hearing that you were still in the city and believing this proclamation of yours to be the summons and clear command for which we waited we have brought you hendrik brants treasure it is there upon the cart  the prince put his hand to his forehead and reeled back a step  you do not jest with me foy van goorl he said  indeed no  but stay this treasure is not yours to give it belongs to elsa brant  sir the legal title to it is in myself for my father was brants lawful heir and executor and i inherit his rights moreover although a provision for her is charged upon it it is elsas desirei have it written here under her hand and witnessedthat the money should be used every ducat of it for the service of the country in such way as i might find good lastly her father hendrik brant always believed that this wealth of his would in due season be of such service here is a copy of his will in which he directs that we are to apply the money for the defence of our country the freedom of religious faith and the destruction of the spaniards in such fashion and at such time or times as god shall reveal to us when he gave us charge of it also his words to me were i am certain that thousands and tens of thousands of our folk will live to bless the gold of hendrik brant on that belief too thinking that god put it into his mind and would reveal his purpose in his own hour we have acted all of us and therefore for the sake of this stuff we have gone to death and torture now it has come about as brant foretold now we understand why all these things have happened and why we live this man and i to stand before you sir today with the hoard unminished by a single florin no not even by martins legacy  man you jest you jest said orange  foy made a sign and martin going to the cart pulled off the sailcloth revealing the five mudstained barrels painted each of them with the mark b there too ready for the purpose were a hammer mallet and chisel resting the shafts of the cart upon a table martin climbed into it and with a few great blows of the mallet drove in the head of a cask selected at hazard beneath appeared wool which he removed not without fear lest there might be some mistake then as he could wait no longer he tilted the barrel up and shot its contents out upon the floor  as it chanced this was the keg that contained the jewels into which foreseeing troublous days from time to time brant had converted the most of his vast wealth now in one glittering stream of red and white and blue and green breaking from their cases and wrappings that the damp had rotted save for those pearls the most valuable of them all which were in the watertight copper boxthey fell jingling to the open floor where they rolled hither and thither like beans shot from a sack in the steading  i think there is only this one tub of jewels said foy quietly the rest which are much heavier are full of gold coin here sir is the inventory so that you may check the list and see that we have kept back nothing  but william of orange heeded him not only he looked at the priceless gems and muttered fleets of ships armies of men convoys of food means to bribe the great and buy goodwillaye and the netherlands themselves wrung from the grip of spain the netherlands free and rich and happy o god i thank thee who thus hast moved the hearts of men to the salvation of this thy people from sore danger  then in the sudden ecstasy of relief and joy the great prince hid his face in his hands and wept    thus it came about that the riches of hendrik brant when leyden lay at her last gasp paid the soldiers and built the fleets which in due time driven by a great wind sent suddenly from heaven across the flooded meadows raised the dreadful siege and signed the doom of spanish rule in holland therefore it would seem that not in vain was hendrik brant stubborn and foresighted that his blood and the blood of dirk van goorl were not shed in vain that not in vain also did elsa suffer the worst torments of a womans fear in the red mill on the marshes and foy and martin play their parts like men in the shottower the gevangenhuis and the siege and mother martha the sword find a grave and rest in the waters of the haarlem meer  there are other morals to this story also applicable perhaps to our life today but the reader is left to guess them   scene the second  leyden is safe at last and through the broken dykes foy and martin with the rescuing ships have sailed shouting and redhanded into her faminestricken streets for the spaniards those that are left of them are broken and have fled away from their forts and flooded trenches  so the scene changes from warring bloodstained triumphant holland to the quiet city of norwich and a quaint gabled house in tombland almost beneath the shadow of the tall spire of the cathedral which now for about a year had been the home of lysbeth van goorl and elsa brant here to norwich they had come in safety in the autumn of 1573 just before the first siege of leyden was begun and here they had dwelt for twelve long doubtful anxious months news or rather rumours of what was passing in the netherlands reached them from time to time twice even there came letters from foy himself but the last of these had been received many weeks ago just as the iron grip of the second leaguer was closing round the city then foy and martin so they learned from the letter were not in the town but with the prince of orange in delft working hard at the fleet which was being built and armed for its relief  after this there was a long silence and none could tell what had happened although a horrible report reached them that leyden had been taken sacked and burnt and all its inhabitants massacred they lived in comfort here in norwich for the firm of munt and brown dirk van goorls agents were honest and the fortune which he had sent over when the clouds were gathering thick had been well invested by them and produced an ample revenue but what comfort could there be for their poor hearts thus agonised by doubts and sickening fears  one evening they sat in the parlour on the ground floor of the house or rather lysbeth sat for elsa knelt by her her head resting upon the arm of the chair and wept  oh it is cruel she sobbed it is too much to bear how can you be so calm mother when perhaps foy is dead  if my son is dead elsa that is gods will and i am calm because now as many a time before i resign myself to the will of god not because i do not suffer mothers can feel girl as well as sweethearts  would that i had never left him moaned elsa  you asked to leave child for my part i should have bided the best or the worst in leyden  it is true it is because i am a coward also he wished it  he wished it elsa therefore it is for the best let us await the issue in patience come our meal is set  they sat themselves down to eat these two lonely women but at their board were laid four covers as though they expected guests yet none were biddenonly this was elsas fancy  foy and martin might come she said and be vexed if it seemed that we did not expect them so for the last three months or more she had always set four covers at the table and lysbeth did not gainsay her in her heart she too hoped that foy might come    that very night foy came and with him red martin the great sword silence still strapped about his middle  hark said lysbeth suddenly i hear my sons footsteps at the door it seems elsa that after all the ears of a mother are quicker than those of a lover  but elsa never heard her for nownow at length she was wrapped in the arms of foy the same foy but grown older and with a long pale scar across his forehead  yet went on lysbeth to herself with a faint smile on her white and stately face the sons lips are for the lover first  an hour later or two or three for who reckoned time that night when there was so much to hear and tell while the others knelt before her foy and elsa hand in hand and behind them martin like a guardian giant lysbeth put up her evening prayer of praise and thanksgiving  almighty god she said in her slow sonorous voice thy awful hand that by my own faithless sin took from me my husband hath given back his son and mine who shall be to this child a husband and for us as for our country over sea out of the night of desolation is arisen a dawn of peace above us throughout the years is thy everlasting will beneath us when our years are done shall by thy everlasting arms so for the bitter and the sweet for the evil and the good for the past and for the present we thy servants render thee glory thanks and praise o god of our fathers that fashioneth us and all according to thy desire remembering those things which we have forgotten and foreknowing those things which are not yet therefore to thee who through so many dreadful days hast led us to this hour of joy be glory and thanks o lord of the living and the dead amen  and the others echoed to thee be glory and thanks o lord of the living and the dead amen    then their prayer ended the living rose and with separations done and fears appeased at last leant towards each other in the love and hope of their beautiful youth  but lysbeth sat silent in the new home far from the land where she was born and turned her stricken heart towards the dead    finis
