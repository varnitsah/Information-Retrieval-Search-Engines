chapter 1  less bread  more taxes  and then all the people cheered again and one man who was more excited than the rest flung his hat high into the air and shouted as well as i could make out who roar for the subwarden  everybody roared but whether it was for the subwarden or not did not clearly appear some were shouting bread and some taxes but no one seemed to know what it was they really wanted  all this i saw from the open window of the wardens breakfastsaloon looking across the shoulder of the lord chancellor who had sprung to his feet the moment the shouting began almost as if he had been expecting it and had rushed to the window which commanded the best view of the marketplace  what can it all mean he kept repeating to himself as with his hands clasped behind him and his gown floating in the air he paced rapidly up and down the room  i never heard such shouting before and at this time of the morning too  and with such unanimity doesnt it strike you as very remarkable  i represented modestly that to my ears it appeared that they were shouting for different things but the chancellor would not listen to my suggestion for a moment  they all shout the same words i assure you he said then leaning well out of the window he whispered to a man who was standing close underneath keepem together cant you the warden will be here directly  giveem the signal for the march up all this was evidently not meant for my ears but i could scarcely help hearing it considering that my chin was almost on the chancellors shoulder  the march up was a very curious sight  imagethe marchup  a straggling procession of men marching two and two began from the other side of the marketplace and advanced in an irregular zigzag fashion towards the palace wildly tacking from side to side like a sailing vessel making way against an unfavourable wind so that the head of the procession was often further from us at the end of one tack than it had been at the end of the previous one  yet it was evident that all was being done under orders for i noticed that all eyes were fixed on the man who stood just under the window and to whom the chancellor was continually whispering  this man held his hat in one hand and a little green flag in the other whenever he waved the flag the procession advanced a little nearer when he dipped it they sidled a little farther off and whenever he waved his hat they all raised a hoarse cheer  hooroah they cried carefully keeping time with the hat as it bobbed up and down  hooroah noo consti tooshun less bread more taxes  thatll do thatll do the chancellor whispered  let em rest a bit till i give you the word  hes not here yet  but at this moment the great foldingdoors of the saloon were flung open and he turned with a guilty start to receive his high excellency  however it was only bruno and the chancellor gave a little gasp of relieved anxiety  morning said the little fellow addressing the remark in a general sort of way to the chancellor and the waiters  doos oo know where sylvie is  is looking for sylvie  shes with the warden i believe yreince the chancellor replied with a low bow  there was no doubt a certain amount of absurdity in applying this title which as of course you see without my telling you was nothing but your royal highness condensed into one syllable to a small creature whose father was merely the warden of outland still large excuse must be made for a man who had passed several years at the court of fairyland and had there acquired the almost impossible art of pronouncing five syllables as one  but the bow was lost upon bruno who had run out of the room even while the great feat of the unpronounceable monosyllable was being triumphantly performed  just then a single voice in the distance was understood to shout a speech from the chancellor  certainly my friends the chancellor replied with extraordinary promptitude  you shall have a speech here one of the waiters who had been for some minutes busy making a queerlooking mixture of egg and sherry respectfully presented it on a large silver salver  the chancellor took it haughtily drank it off thoughtfully smiled benevolently on the happy waiter as he set down the empty glass and began  to the best of my recollection this is what he said  ahem ahem ahem fellowsufferers or rather suffering fellows dont call em names muttered the man under the window i didnt say felons the chancellor explained you may be sure that i always sympa ear ear shouted the crowd so loudly as quite to drown the orators thin squeaky voice that i always sympa he repeated dont simper quite so much said the man under the window it makes yer look a hidiot  and all this time ear ear went rumbling round the marketplace like a peal of thunder that i always sympathise yelled the chancellor the first moment there was silence  but your true friend is the subwarden day and night he is brooding on your wrongsi should say your rights that is to say your wrongsno i mean your rights dont talk no more growled the man under the window youre making a mess of it at this moment the subwarden entered the saloon  he was a thin man with a mean and crafty face and a greenishyellow complexion and he crossed the room very slowly looking suspiciously about him as if be thought there might be a savage dog hidden somewhere  bravo he cried patting the chancellor on the back  you did that speech very well indeed why youre a born orator man  oh thats nothing the chancellor replied modestly with downcast eyes  most orators are born you know  the subwarden thoughtfully rubbed his chin  why so they are he admitted  i never considered it in that light  still you did it very well  a word in your ear  the rest of their conversation was all in whispers so as i could hear no more i thought i would go and find bruno  i found the little fellow standing in the passage and being addressed by one of the men in livery who stood before him nearly bent double from extreme respectfulness with his hands hanging in front of him like the fins of a fish  his high excellency this respectful man was saying is in his study yreince  he didnt pronounce this quite so well as the chancellor thither bruno trotted and i thought it well to follow him  the warden a tall dignified man with a grave but very pleasant face was seated before a writingtable which was covered with papers and holding on his knee one of the sweetest and loveliest little maidens it has ever been my lot to see  she looked four or five years older than bruno but she had the same rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes and the same wealth of curly brown hair  her eager smiling face was turned upwards towards her fathers and it was a pretty sight to see the mutual love with which the two facesone in the spring of life the other in its late autumnwere gazing on each other  no youve never seen him the old man was saying you couldnt you know hes been away so longtraveling from land to land and seeking for health more years than youve been alive little sylvie here bruno climbed upon his other knee and a good deal of kissing on a rather complicated system was the result  he only came back last night said the warden when the kissing was over hes been traveling posthaste for the last thousand miles or so in order to be here on sylvies birthday  but hes a very early riser and i dare say hes in the library already  come with me and see him  hes always kind to children  youll be sure to like him  has the other professor come too  bruno asked in an awestruck voice  yes they arrived together  the other professor iswell you wont like him quite so much perhaps  hes a little more dreamy you know  i wiss sylvie was a little more dreamy said bruno  what do you mean bruno said sylvie  bruno went on addressing his father  she says she cant oo know but i thinks it isnt cant its wont  says she cant dream the puzzled warden repeated  she do say it bruno persisted  when i says to her lets stop lessons she says oh i cant dream of letting oo stop yet  he always wants to stop lessons sylvie explained five minutes after we begin  five minutes lessons a day said the warden  you wont learn much at that rate little man  thats just what sylvie says bruno rejoined  she says i wont learn my lessons  and i tells her over and over i cant learn em and what doos oo think she says  she says it isnt cant its wont  lets go and see the professor the warden said wisely avoiding further discussion  the children got down off his knees each secured a hand and the happy trio set off for the libraryfollowed by me i had come to the conclusion by this time that none of the party except for a few moments the lord chancellor was in the least able to see me  whats the matter with him  sylvie asked walking with a little extra sedateness by way of example to bruno at the other side who never ceased jumping up and down  imagevisiting the profesor  what was the matterbut i hope hes all right nowwas lumbago and rheumatism and that kind of thing  hes been curing himself you know hes a very learned doctor  why hes actually invented three new diseases besides a new way of breaking your collarbone  is it a nice way said bruno  well hum not very the warden said as we entered the library and here is the professor  good morning professor  hope youre quite rested after your journey  a jollylooking fat little man in a flowery dressinggown with a large book under each arm came trotting in at the other end of the room and was going straight across without taking any notice of the children  im looking for vol  three he said do you happen to have seen it  you dont see my children professor the warden exclaimed taking him by the shoulders and turning him round to face them  the professor laughed violently then he gazed at them through his great spectacles for a minute or two without speaking  at last he addressed bruno  i hope you have had a good night my child bruno looked puzzled  is had the same night oove had he replied theres only been one night since yesterday  it was the professors turn to look puzzled now he took off his spectacles and rubbed them with his handkerchief then he gazed at them again  then he turned to the warden are they bound he enquired  no we arent said bruno who thought himself quite able to answer this question  the professor shook his head sadly  not even halfbound  why would we be halfbound said bruno  were not prisoners  but the professor had forgotten all about them by this time and was speaking to the warden again  youll be glad to hear he was saying that the barometers beginning to move  well which way said the wardenadding to the children not that i care you know  only he thinks it affects the weather hes a wonderfully clever man you know  sometimes he says things that only the other professor can understand  sometimes he says things that nobody can understand  which way is it professor  up or down  neither said the professor gently clapping his hands  its going sidewaysif i may so express myself  and what kind of weather does that produce said the warden listen children  now youll hear something worth knowing  horizontal weather said the professor and made straight for the door very nearly trampling on bruno who had only just time to get out of his way  isnt he learned the warden said looking after him with admiring eyes  positively he runs over with learning  but he neednt run over me said bruno  the professor was back in a moment he had changed his dressinggown for a frockcoat and had put on a pair of very strangelooking boots the tops of which were open umbrellas  i thought youd like to see them he said  these are the boots for horizontal weather  imageboots for horizontal weather  but whats the use of wearing umbrellas round ones knees  in ordinary rain the professor admitted they would not be of much use  but if ever it rained horizontally you know they would be invaluablesimply invaluable  take the professor to the breakfastsaloon children said the warden  and tell them not to wait for me  i had breakfast early as ive some business to attend to the children seized the professors hands as familiarly as if they had known him for years and hurried him away  i followed respectfully behind   chapter 2  lamie inconnue  as we entered the breakfastsaloon the professor was saying and he had breakfast by himself early so he begged you wouldnt wait for him my lady  this way my lady he added this way  and then with as it seemed to me most superfluous politeness he flung open the door of my compartment and ushered in a young and lovely lady i muttered to myself with some bitterness  and this is of course the opening scene of vol i  she is the heroine  and i am one of those subordinate characters that only turn up when needed for the development of her destiny and whose final appearance is outside the church waiting to greet the happy pair  yes my lady change at fayfield were the next words i heard oh that too obsequious guard next station but one and the door closed and the lady settled down into her corner and the monotonous throb of the engine making one feel as if the train were some gigantic monster whose very circulation we could feel proclaimed that we were once more speeding on our way  the lady had a perfectly formed nose i caught myself saying to myself hazel eyes and lips and here it occurred to me that to see for myself what the lady was really like would be more satisfactory than much speculation  i looked round cautiously andwas entirely disappointed of my hope  the veil which shrouded her whole face was too thick for me to see more than the glitter of bright eyes and the hazy outline of what might be a lovely oval face but might also unfortunately be an equally unlovely one  i closed my eyes again saying to myself couldnt have a better chance for an experiment in telepathy ill think out her face and afterwards test the portrait with the original  at first no result at all crowned my efforts though i divided my swift mind now hither now thither in a way that i felt sure would have made aeneas green with envy but the dimlyseen oval remained as provokingly blank as evera mere ellipse as if in some mathematical diagram without even the foci that might be made to do duty as a nose and a mouth  gradually however the conviction came upon me that i could by a certain concentration of thought think the veil away and so get a glimpse of the mysterious faceas to which the two questions is she pretty and is she plain still hung suspended in my mind in beautiful equipoise  success was partialand fitfulstill there was a result ever and anon the veil seemed to vanish in a sudden flash of light but before i could fully realise the face all was dark again  in each such glimpse the face seemed to grow more childish and more innocent and when i had at last thought the veil entirely away it was unmistakeably the sweet face of little sylvie  so either ive been dreaming about sylvie i said to myself and this is the reality  or else ive really been with sylvie and this is a dream  is life itself a dream i wonder  to occupy the time i got out the letter which had caused me to take this sudden railwayjourney from my london home down to a strange fishingtown on the north coast and read it over again      dear old friend      im sure it will be as great a pleasure to me as it can possibly     be to you to meet once more after so many years and of course i     shall be ready to give you all the benefit of such medical skill as     i have only you know one mustnt violate professional etiquette     and you are already in the hands of a firstrate london doctor     with whom it would be utter affectation for me to pretend to compete        i make no doubt he is right in saying the heart is affected     all your symptoms point that way one thing at any rate i have     already done in my doctorial capacitysecured you a bedroom on the     groundfloor so that you will not need to ascend the stairs at all      i shalt expect you by last train on friday in accordance with your     letter and till then i shalt say in the words of the old song     oh for friday nicht  fridays lang acoming      yours always      arthur forester      ps  do you believe in fate  this postscript puzzled me sorely  he is far too sensible a man i thought to have become a fatalist  and yet what else can he mean by it  and as i folded up the letter and put it away i inadvertently repeated the words aloud  do you believe in fate  the fair incognita turned her head quickly at the sudden question no i dont she said with a smile  do you  ii didnt mean to ask the question  i stammered a little taken aback at having begun a conversation in so unconventional a fashion  the ladys smile became a laughnot a mocking laugh but the laugh of a happy child who is perfectly at her ease  didnt you she said then it was a case of what you doctors call unconscious cerebration  i am no doctor i replied  do i look so like one  or what makes you think it  she pointed to the book i had been reading which was so lying that its title diseases of the heart was plainly visible  one neednt be a doctor i said to take an interest in medical books  theres another class of readers who are yet more deeply interested  you mean the patients she interrupted while a look of tender pity gave new sweetness to her face  but with an evident wish to avoid a possibly painful topic one neednt be either to take an interest in books of science  which contain the greatest amount of science do you think the books or the minds  rather a profound question for a lady  i said to myself holding with the conceit so natural to man that womans intellect is essentially shallow  and i considered a minute before replying if you mean living minds i dont think its possible to decide there is so much written science that no living person has ever read and there is so much thoughtout science that hasnt yet been written but if you mean the whole human race then i think the minds have it everything recorded in books must have once been in some mind you know  isnt that rather like one of the rules in algebra my lady enquired algebra too  i thought with increasing wonder i mean if we consider thoughts as factors may we not say that the least common multiple of all the minds contains that of all the books but not the other way  certainly we may  i replied delighted with the illustration and what a grand thing it would be i went on dreamily thinking aloud rather than talking if we could only apply that rule to books you know in finding the least common multiple we strike out a quantity wherever it occurs except in the term where it is raised to its highest power  so we should have to erase every recorded thought except in the sentence where it is expressed with the greatest intensity  my lady laughed merrily  some books would be reduced to blank paper im afraid she said  they would  most libraries would be terribly diminished in bulk but just think what they would gain in quality  when will it be done she eagerly asked  if theres any chance of it in my time i think ill leave off reading and wait for it  well perhaps in another thousand years or so  then theres no use waiting said my lady  lets sit down uggug my pet come and sit by me  anywhere but by me growled the subwarden  the little wretch always manages to upset his coffee  i guessed at once as perhaps the reader will also have guessed if like myself he is very clever at drawing conclusions that my lady was the subwardens wife and that uggug a hideous fat boy about the same age as sylvie with the expression of a prizepig was their son sylvie and bruno with the lord chancellor made up a party of seven  imagea portable plungebath  and you actually got a plungebath every morning said the subwarden seemingly in continuation of a conversation with the professor even at the little roadsideinns  oh certainly certainly the professor replied with a smile on his jolly face  allow me to explain  it is in fact a very simple problem in hydrodynamics  that means a combination of water and strength if we take a plungebath and a man of great strength such as myself about to plunge into it we have a perfect example of this science i am bound to admit the professor continued in a lower tone and with downcast eyes that we need a man of remarkable strength  he must be able to spring from the floor to about twice his own height gradually turning over as he rises so as to come down again head first  why you need a flea not a man exclaimed the subwarden  pardon me said the professor  this particular kind of bath is not adapted for a flea  let us suppose he continued folding his tablenapkin into a graceful festoon that this represents what is perhaps the necessity of this agethe active tourists portable bath  you may describe it briefly if you like looking at the chancellor by the letters atpb  the chancellor much disconcerted at finding everybody looking at him could only murmur in a shy whisper precisely so  one great advantage of this plungebath continued the professor is that it requires only halfagallon of water  i dont call it a plungebath his subexcellency remarked unless your active tourist goes right under  but he does go right under the old man gently replied  the at hangs up the p b on a nailthus  he then empties the waterjug into itplaces the empty jug below the bagleaps into the airdescends headfirst into the bagthe water rises round him to the top of the bagand there you are he triumphantly concluded the at is as much under water as if hed gone a mile or two down into the atlantic  and hes drowned let us say in about four minutes  by no means the professor answered with a proud smile  after about a minute he quietly turns a tap at the lower end of the p ball the water runs back into the jug and there you are again  but how in the world is he to get out of the bag again  that i take it said the professor is the most beautiful part of the whole invention  all the way up the pb inside are loops for the thumbs so its something like going upstairs only perhaps less comfortable and by the time the a t has risen out of the bag all but his head hes sure to topple over one way or the otherthe law of gravity secures that  and there he is on the floor again  a little bruised perhaps  well yes a little bruised but having had his plungebath thats the great thing  wonderful  its almost beyond belief murmured the subwarden the professor took it as a compliment and bowed with a gratified smile  quite beyond belief my lady addedmeaning no doubt to be more complimentary still  the professor bowed but he didnt smile this time  i can assure you he said earnestly that provided the bath was made i used it every morning  i certainly ordered itthat i am clear aboutmy only doubt is whether the man ever finished making it  its difficult to remember after so many years  at this moment the door very slowly and creakingly began to open and sylvie and bruno jumped up and ran to meet the wellknown footstep   chapter 3  birthdaypresents  its my brother the subwarden exclaimed in a warning whisper speak out and be quick about it  the appeal was evidently addressed to the lord chancellor who instantly replied in a shrill monotone like a little boy repeating the alphabet as i was remarking your subexcellency this portentous movement  you began too soon the other interrupted scarcely able to restrain himself to a whisper so great was his excitement  he couldnt have heard you  begin again  as i was remarking chanted the obedient lord chancellor this portentous movement has already assumed the dimensions of a revolution  and what are the dimensions of a revolution  the voice was genial and mellow and the face of the tall dignified old man who had just entered the room leading sylvie by the hand and with bruno riding triumphantly on his shoulder was too noble and gentle to have scared a less guilty man but the lord chancellor turned pale instantly and could hardly articulate the words the dimensions your your high excellency  iiscarcely comprehend  well the length breadth and thickness if you like it better and the old man smiled halfcontemptuously  the lord chancellor recovered himself with a great effort and pointed to the open window  if your high excellency will listen for a moment to the shouts of the exasperated populace of the exasperated populace the subwarden repeated in a louder tone as the lord chancellor being in a state of abject terror had dropped almost into a whisper you will understand what it is they want   and at that moment there surged into the room a hoarse confused cry in which the only clearly audible words were lessbreadmoretaxes the old man laughed heartily  what in the world he was beginning but the chancellor heard him not  some mistake he muttered hurrying to the window from which he shortly returned with an air of relief  now listen he exclaimed holding up his hand impressively and now the words came quite distinctly and with the regularity of the ticking of a clock morebreadless taxes  more bread the warden repeated in astonishment  why the new government bakery was opened only last week and i gave orders to sell the bread at costprice during the present scarcity  what can they expect more  the bakerys closed yreince the chancellor said more loudly and clearly than he had spoken yet  he was emboldened by the consciousness that here at least he had evidence to produce and he placed in the wardens hands a few printed notices that were lying ready with some open ledgers on a sidetable  yes yes i see the warden muttered glancing carelessly through them  order countermanded by my brother and supposed to be my doing rather sharp practice  its all right he added in a louder tone my name is signed to it so i take it on myself  but what do they mean by less taxes  how can they be less  i abolished the last of them a month ago  its been put on again yreince and by yreinces own orders and other printed notices were submitted for inspection  the warden whilst looking them over glanced once or twice at the subwarden who had seated himself before one of the open ledgers and was quite absorbed in adding it up but he merely repeated its all right  i accept it as my doing  and they do say the chancellor went on sheepishlylooking much more like a convicted thief than an officer of state that a change of government by the abolition of the subwardeni mean he hastily added on seeing the wardens look of astonishment the abolition of the office of subwarden and giving the present holder the right to act as vicewarden whenever the warden is absent would appease all this seedling discontent i mean he added glancing at a paper he held in his hand all this seething discontent  for fifteen years put in a deep but very harsh voice my husband has been acting as subwarden  it is too long  it is much too long my lady was a vast creature at all times but when she frowned and folded her arms as now she looked more gigantic than ever and made one try to fancy what a haystack would look like if out of temper  he would distinguish himself as a vice my lady proceeded being far too stupid to see the double meaning of her words  there has been no such vice in outland for many a long year as he would be  what course would you suggest sister the warden mildly enquired  my lady stamped which was undignified and snorted which was ungraceful  this is no jesting matter she bellowed  i will consult my brother said the warden  brother  and seven makes a hundred and ninetyfour which is sixteen and twopence the subwarden replied  put down two and carry sixteen  the chancellor raised his hands and eyebrows lost in admiration such a man of business he murmured  brother could i have a word with you in my study the warden said in a louder tone  the subwarden rose with alacrity and the two left the room together  my lady turned to the professor who had uncovered the urn and was taking its temperature with his pocketthermometer  professor she began so loudly and suddenly that even uggug who had gone to sleep in his chair left off snoring and opened one eye  the professor pocketed his thermometer in a moment clasped his hands and put his head on one side with a meek smile  you were teaching my son before breakfast i believe my lady loftily remarked  i hope he strikes you as having talent  oh very much so indeed my lady the professor hastily replied unconsciously rubbing his ear while some painful recollection seemed to cross his mind  i was very forcibly struck by his magnificence i assure you  he is a charming boy my lady exclaimed  even his snores are more musical than those of other boys  if that were so the professor seemed to think the snores of other boys must be something too awful to be endured but he was a cautious man and he said nothing  and hes so clever my lady continued  no one will enjoy your lecture more by the way have you fixed the time for it yet youve never given one you know and it was promised years ago before you  yes yes my lady i know  perhaps next tuesday or tuesday week  that will do very well said my lady graciously  of course you will let the other professor lecture as well  i think not my lady  the professor said with some hesitation you see he always stands with his back to the audience it does very well for reciting but for lecturing  you are quite right said my lady  and now i come to think of it there would hardly be time for more than one lecture  and it will go off all the better if we begin with a banquet and a fancydress ball  it will indeed the professor cried with enthusiasm  i shall come as a grasshopper my lady calmly proceeded what shall you come as professor  the professor smiled feebly  i shall come asas early as i can my lady  you mustnt come in before the doors are opened said my lady  i cant said the professor  excuse me a moment  as this is lady sylvies birthday i would like to and he rushed away  bruno began feeling in his pockets looking more and more melancholy as he did so then he put his thumb in his mouth and considered for a minute then he quietly left the room  he had hardly done so before the professor was back again quite out of breath  wishing you many happy returns of the day my dear child he went on addressing the smiling little girl who had run to meet him allow me to give you a birthdaypresent  its a secondhand pincushion my dear  and it only cost fourpencehalfpenny  thank you its very pretty  and sylvie rewarded the old man with a hearty kiss  and the pins they gave me for nothing the professor added in high glee  fifteen of em and only one bent  ill make the bent one into a hook said sylvie  to catch bruno with when he runs away from his lessons  you cant guess what my present is said uggug who had taken the butterdish from the table and was standing behind her with a wicked leer on his face  no i cant guess sylvie said without looking up  she was still examining the professors pincushion  its this cried the bad boy exultingly as he emptied the dish over her and then with a grin of delight at his own cleverness looked round for applause  sylvie coloured crimson as she shook off the butter from her frock but she kept her lips tight shut and walked away to the window where she stood looking out and trying to recover her temper  uggugs triumph was a very short one the subwarden had returned just in time to be a witness of his dear childs playfulness and in another moment a skilfullyapplied box on the ear had changed the grin of delight into a howl of pain  my darling cried his mother enfolding him in her fat arms did they box his ears for nothing  a precious pet  its not for nothing growled the angry father  are you aware madam that i pay the housebills out of a fixed annual sum the loss of all that wasted butter falls on me  do you hear madam  hold your tongue sir  my lady spoke very quietlyalmost in a whisper  but there was something in her look which silenced him dont you see it was only a joke  and a very clever one too he only meant that he loved nobody but her  and instead of being pleased with the compliment the spiteful little thing has gone away in a huff  the subwarden was a very good hand at changing a subject  he walked across to the window  my dear he said is that a pig that i see down below rooting about among your flowerbeds  a pig shrieked my lady rushing madly to the window and almost pushing her husband out in her anxiety to see for herself  whose pig is it  how did it get in  wheres that crazy gardener gone  at this moment bruno reentered the room and passing uggug who was blubbering his loudest in the hope of attracting notice as if he was quite used to that sort of thing he ran up to sylvie and threw his arms round her  i went to my toycupboard he said with a very sorrowful face to see if there were somefin fit for a present for oo and there isnt nuffin  theys all broken every one and i havent got no money left to buy oo a birthdaypresent and i cant give oo nuffin but this this was a very earnest hug and a kiss  oh thank you darling cried sylvie  i like your present best of all but if so why did she give it back so quickly  his subexcellency turned and patted the two children on the head with his long lean hands  go away dears he said  theres business to talk over   sylvie and bruno went away hand in hand but on reaching the door sylvie came back again and went up to uggug timidly  i dont mind about the butter she said and iim sorry he hurt you  and she tried to shake hands with the little ruffian but uggug only blubbered louder and wouldnt make friends  sylvie left the room with a sigh  the subwarden glared angrily at his weeping son  leave the room sirrah he said as loud as he dared  his wife was still leaning out of the window and kept repeating i cant see that pig  where is it  its moved to the right now its gone a little to the left said the subwarden but he had his back to the window and was making signals to the lord chancellor pointing to uggug and the door with many a cunning nod and wink  imageremoval of uggug  the chancellor caught his meaning at last and crossing the room took that interesting child by the ear the next moment he and uggug were out of the room and the door shut behind them but not before one piercing yell had rung through the room and reached the ears of the fond mother  what is that hideous noise she fiercely asked turning upon her startled husband  its some hyaenaor other replied the subwarden looking vaguely up to the ceiling as if that was where they usually were to be found let us to business my dear  here comes the warden and he picked up from the floor a wandering scrap of manuscript on which i just caught the words after which election duly holden the said sibimet and tabikat his wife may at their pleasure assume imperial before with a guilty look he crumpled it up in his hand   chapter 4  a cunning conspiracy  the warden entered at this moment and close behind him came the lord chancellor a little flushed and out of breath and adjusting his wig which appeared to have been dragged partly off his head  but where is my precious child my lady enquired as the four took their seats at the small sidetable devoted to ledgers and bundles and bills  he left the room a few minutes ago with the lord chancellor the subwarden briefly explained  ah said my lady graciously smiling on that high official your lordship has a very taking way with children  i doubt if any one could gain the ear of my darling uggug so quickly as you can for an entirely stupid woman my ladys remarks were curiously full of meaning of which she herself was wholly unconscious  the chancellor bowed but with a very uneasy air  i think the warden was about to speak he remarked evidently anxious to change the subject  but my lady would not be checked  he is a clever boy she continued with enthusiasm but he needs a man like your lordship to draw him out  the chancellor bit his lip and was silent  he evidently feared that stupid as she looked she understood what she said this time and was having a joke at his expense  he might have spared himself all anxiety whatever accidental meaning her words might have she herself never meant anything at all  it is all settled the warden announced wasting no time over preliminaries  the subwardenship is abolished and my brother is appointed to act as vicewarden whenever i am absent  so as i am going abroad for a while he will enter on his new duties at once  and there will really be a vice after all my lady enquired  i hope so the warden smilingly replied  my lady looked much pleased and tried to clap her hands but you might as well have knocked two featherbeds together for any noise it made when my husband is vice she said it will be the same as if we had a hundred vices  hear hear cried the subwarden  you seem to think it very remarkable my lady remarked with some severity that your wife should speak the truth  no not remarkable at all her husband anxiously explained nothing is remarkable that you say sweet one  my lady smiled approval of the sentiment and went on and am i vicewardeness  if you choose to use that title said the warden but your excellency will be the proper style of address and i trust that both his excellency and her excellency will observe the agreement i have drawn up  the provision i am most anxious about is this he unrolled a large parchment scroll and read aloud the words item that we will be kind to the poor the chancellor worded it for me he added glancing at that great functionary i suppose now that word item has some deep legal meaning  undoubtedly replied the chancellor as articulately as he could with a pen between his lips  he was nervously rolling and unrolling several other scrolls and making room among them for the one the warden had just handed to him  these are merely the rough copies he explained and as soon as i have put in the final corrections making a great commotion among the different parchments a semicolon or two that i have accidentally omitted here he darted about pen in hand from one part of the scroll to another spreading sheets of blottingpaper over his corrections all will be ready for signing  should it not be read out first my lady enquired  no need no need the subwarden and the chancellor exclaimed at the same moment with feverish eagerness  no need at all the warden gently assented  your husband and i have gone through it together  it provides that he shall exercise the full authority of warden and shall have the disposal of the annual revenue attached to the office until my return or failing that until bruno comes of age and that he shall then hand over to myself or to bruno as the case may be the wardenship the unspent revenue and the contents of the treasury which are to be preserved intact under his guardianship  all this time the subwarden was busy with the chancellors help shifting the papers from side to side and pointing out to the warden the place whew he was to sign  he then signed it himself and my lady and the chancellor added their names as witnesses  short partings are best said the warden  all is ready for my journey  my children are waiting below to see me off he gravely kissed my lady shook hands with his brother and the chancellor and left the room  imagewhat a game  the three waited in silence till the sound of wheels announced that the warden was out of hearing then to my surprise they broke into peals of uncontrollable laughter  what a game oh what a game cried the chancellor and he and the vicewarden joined hands and skipped wildly about the room  my lady was too dignified to skip but she laughed like the neighing of a horse and waved her handkerchief above her head it was clear to her very limited understanding that something very clever had been done but what it was she had yet to learn  you said i should hear all about it when the warden had gone she remarked as soon as she could make herself heard  and so you shall tabby her husband graciously replied as he removed the blottingpaper and showed the two parchments lying side by side  this is the one he read but didnt sign and this is the one he signed but didnt read  you see it was all covered up except the place for signing the names  yes yes my lady interrupted eagerly and began comparing the two agreements  item that he shall exercise the authority of warden in the wardens absence why thats been changed into shall be absolute governor for life with the title of emperor if elected to that office by the people what  are you emperor darling  not yet dear the vicewarden replied  it wont do to let this paper be seen just at present  all in good time  my lady nodded and read on  item that we will be kind to the poor why thats omitted altogether  course it is said her husband  were not going to bother about the wretches  good said my lady with emphasis and read on again  item that the contents of the treasury be preserved intact why thats altered into shall be at the absolute disposal of the vicewarden well sibby that was a clever trick  all the jewels only think may i go and put them on directly  well not just yet lovey her husband uneasily replied you see the public mind isnt quite ripe for it yet  we must feel our way  of course well have the coachandfour out at once and ill take the title of emperor as soon as we can safely hold an election  but theyll hardly stand our using the jewels as long as they know the wardens alive  we must spread a report of his death a little conspiracy  a conspiracy cried the delighted lady clapping her hands of all things i do like a conspiracy  its so interesting  the vicewarden and the chancellor interchanged a wink or two  let her conspire to her hearts content the cunning chancellor whispered itll do no harm  and when will the conspiracy  hist her husband hastily interrupted her as the door opened and sylvie and bruno came in with their arms twined lovingly round each otherbruno sobbing convulsively with his face hidden on his sisters shoulder and sylvie more grave and quiet but with tears streaming down her cheeks  mustnt cry like that the vicewarden said sharply but without any effect on the weeping children  cheer em up a bit he hinted to my lady  cake my lady muttered to herself with great decision crossing the room and opening a cupboard from which she presently returned with two slices of plumcake  eat and dont cry were her short and simple orders and the poor children sat down side by side but seemed in no mood for eating  for the second time the door openedor rather was burst open this time as uggug rushed violently into the room shouting that old beggars come again  hes not to have any food the vicewarden was beginning but the chancellor interrupted him  its all right he said in a low voice the servants have their orders  hes just under here said uggug who had gone to the window and was looking down into the courtyard  where my darling said his fond mother flinging her arms round the neck of the little monster  all of us except sylvie and bruno who took no notice of what was going on followed her to the window the old beggar looked up at us with hungry eyes  only a crust of bread your highness he pleaded  imagedrink this  he was a fine old man but looked sadly ill and worn a crust of bread is what i crave he repeated  a single crust and a little water  heres some water drink this  uggug bellowed emptying a jug of water over his head  well done my boy cried the vicewarden  thats the way to settle such folk  clever boy the wardeness chimed in  hasnt he good spirits  take a stick to him shouted the vicewarden as the old beggar shook the water from his ragged cloak and again gazed meekly upwards  take a redhot poker to him my lady again chimed in  possibly there was no redhot poker handy but some sticks were forthcoming in a moment and threatening faces surrounded the poor old wanderer who waved them back with quiet dignity  no need to break my old bones he said  i am going  not even a crust  poor poor old man exclaimed a little voice at my side half choked with sobs  bruno was at the window trying to throw out his slice of plumcake but sylvie held him back  he shalt have my cake  bruno cried passionately struggling out of sylvies arms  yes yes darling  sylvie gently pleaded  but dont throw it out hes gone away dont you see  lets go after him and she led him out of the room unnoticed by the rest of the party who were wholly absorbed in watching the old beggar  the conspirators returned to their seats and continued their conversation in an undertone so as not to be heard by uggug who was still standing at the window  by the way there was something about bruno succeeding to the wrardenship said my lady  how does that stand in the new agreement  the chancellor chuckled  just the same word for word he said with one exception my lady  instead of bruno ive taken the liberty to put in he dropped his voice to a whisper to put in uggug you know  uggug indeed  i exclaimed in a burst of indignation i could no longer control  to bring out even that one word seemed a gigantic effort but the cry once uttered all effort ceased at once a sudden gust swept away the whole scene and i found myself sitting up staring at the young lady in the opposite corner of the carriage who had now thrown back her veil and was looking at me with an expression of amused surprise   chapter 5  a beggars palace  that i had said something in the act of waking i felt sure the hoarse stifled cry was still ringing in my ears even if the startled look of my fellowtraveler had not been evidence enough but what could i possibly say by way of apology  i hope i didnt frighten you  i stammered out at last i have no idea what i said  i was dreaming  you said uggug indeed the young lady replied with quivering lips that would curve themselves into a smile in spite of all her efforts to look grave  at leastyou didnt say ityou shouted it  im very sorry was all i could say feeling very penitent and helpless  she has sylvies eyes  i thought to myself halfdoubting whether even now i were fairly awake  and that sweet look of innocent wonder is all sylvies too  but sylvie hasnt got that calm resolute mouth nor that faraway look of dreamy sadness like one that has had some deep sorrow very long ago and the thickcoming fancies almost prevented my hearing the ladys next words  if you had had a shilling dreadful in your hand she proceeded something about ghosts or dynamite or midnight murderone could understand it those things arent worth the shilling unless they give one a nightmare  but reallywith only a medical treatise you know and she glanced with a pretty shrug of contempt at the book over which i had fallen asleep  her friendliness and utter unreserve took me aback for a moment yet there was no touch of forwardness or boldness about the child for child almost she seemed to be i guessed her at scarcely over twentyall was the innocent frankness of some angelic visitant new to the ways of earth and the conventionalisms or if you will the barbarismsof society  even so i mused will sylvie look and speak in another ten years  you dont care for ghosts then i ventured to suggest unless they are really terrifying  quite so the lady assented  the regular railwayghostsi mean the ghosts of ordinary railwayliteratureare very poor affairs i feel inclined to say with alexander selkirk their tameness is shocking to me  and they never do any midnight murders they couldnt welter in gore to save their lives  weltering in gore  is a very expressive phrase certainly can it be done in any fluid i wonder  i think not the lady readily repliedquite as if she had thought it out long ago  it has to be something thick  for instance you might welter in breadsauce  that being white would be more suitable for a ghost supposing it wished to welter  you have a real good terrifying ghost in that book  i hinted  how could you guess she exclaimed with the most engaging frankness and placed the volume in my hands  i opened it eagerly with a not unpleasant thrill like what a good ghoststory gives one at the uncanny coincidence of my having so unexpectedly divined the subject of her studies  it was a book of domestic cookery open at the article bread sauce  i returned the book looking i suppose a little blank as the lady laughed merrily at my discomfiture  its far more exciting than some of the modern ghosts i assure you  now there was a ghost last monthi dont mean a real ghost in in supernaturebut in a magazine  it was a perfectly flavourless ghost  it wouldnt have frightened a mouse  it wasnt a ghost that one would even offer a chair to  three score years and ten baldness and spectacles have their advantages after all i said to myself  instead of a bashful youth and maiden gasping out monosyllables at awful intervals here we have an old man and a child quite at their ease talking as if they had known each other for years  then you think i continued aloud that we ought sometimes to ask a ghost to sit down  but have we any authority for it  in shakespeare for instancethere are plenty of ghosts theredoes shakespeare ever give the stagedirection hands chair to ghost  the lady looked puzzled and thoughtful for a moment then she almost clapped her hands  yes yes he does she cried he makes hamlet say rest rest perturbed spirit  and that i suppose means an easychair  an american rockingchair i think  fayfield junction my lady change for elveston the guard announced flinging open the door of the carriage and we soon found ourselves with all our portable property around us on the platform  the accommodation provided for passengers waiting at this junction was distinctly inadequatea single wooden bench apparently intended for three sitters only and even this was already partially occupied by a very old man in a smock frock who sat with rounded shoulders and drooping head and with hands clasped on the top of his stick so as to make a sort of pillow for that wrinkled face with its look of patient weariness  come you be off the stationmaster roughly accosted the poor old man  you be off and make way for your betters  this way my lady he added in a perfectly different tone  if your ladyship will take a seat the train will be up in a few minutes the cringing servility of his manner was due no doubt to the address legible on the pile of luggage which announced their owner to be lady muriel orme passenger to elveston via fayfield junction  as i watched the old man slowly rise to his feet and hobble a few paces down the platform the lines came to my lips      from sackcloth couch the monk arose     with toil his stiffend limbs he reard     a hundred years had flung their snows     on his thin locks and floating beard  imagecome you be off  but the lady scarcely noticed the little incident  after one glance at the banished man who stood tremulously leaning on his stick she turned to me  this is not an american rockingchair by any means  yet may i say slightly changing her place so as to make room for me beside her may i say in hamlets words rest rest she broke off with a silvery laugh  perturbed spirit i finished the sentence for her  yes that describes a railwaytraveler exactly  and here is an instance of it i added as the tiny local train drew up alongside the platform and the porters bustled about opening carriagedoorsone of them helping the poor old man to hoist himself into a thirdclass carriage while another of them obsequiously conducted the lady and myself into a firstclass  she paused before following him to watch the progress of the other passenger  poor old man she said  how weak and ill he looks it was a shame to let him be turned away like that  im very sorry at this moment it dawned on me that these words were not addressed to me but that she was unconsciously thinking aloud  i moved away a few steps and waited to follow her into the carriage where i resumed the conversation  shakespeare must have traveled by rail if only in a dream perturbed spirit is such a happy phrase  perturbed referring no doubt she rejoined to the sensational booklets peculiar to the rail  if steam has done nothing else it has at least added a whole new species to english literature  no doubt of it i echoed  the true origin of all our medical booksand all our cookerybooks  no no she broke in merrily  i didnt mean our literature we are quite abnormal  but the bookletsthe little thrilling romances where the murder comes at page fifteen and the wedding at page forty surely they are due to steam  and when we travel by electricity if i may venture to develop your theory we shall have leaflets instead of booklets and the murder and the wedding will come on the same page  a development worthy of darwin the lady exclaimed enthusiastically only you reverse his theory  instead of developing a mouse into an elephant you would develop an elephant into a mouse  but here we plunged into a tunnel and i leaned back and closed my eyes for a moment trying to recall a few of the incidents of my recent dream  i thought i saw i murmured sleepily and then the phrase insisted on conjugating itself and ran into you thought you sawhe thought he saw and then it suddenly went off into a song       he thought he saw an elephant     that practised on a fife     he looked again and found it was     a letter from his wife     at length i realise he said     the bitterness of life  and what a wild being it was who sang these wild words  a gardener he seemed to be yet surely a mad one by the way he brandished his rakemadder by the way he broke ever and anon into a frantic jigmaddest of all by the shriek in which he brought out the last words of the stanza  imagethe gardener  it was so far a description of himself that he had the feet of an elephant but the rest of him was skin and bone and the wisps of loose straw that bristled all about him suggested that he had been originally stuffed with it and that nearly all the stuffing had come out  sylvie and bruno waited patiently till the end of the first verse then sylvie advanced alone bruno having suddenly turned shy and timidly introduced herself with the words please im sylvie  and whos that other thing said the gardener  what thing said sylvie looking round  oh thats bruno hes my brother  was he your brother yesterday the gardener anxiously enquired  course i were cried bruno who had gradually crept nearer and didnt at all like being talked about without having his share in the conversation  ah well the gardener said with a kind of groan  things change so here  whenever i look again its sure to be something different yet i does my duty  i gets up wriggleearly at five  if i was oo said bruno i wouldnt wriggle so early  its as bad as being a worm he added in an undertone to sylvie  but you shouldnt be lazy in the morning bruno said sylvie remember its the early bird that picks up the worm  it may if it likes  bruno said with a slight yawn  i dont like eating worms one bit  i always stop in bed till the early bird has picked them up  i wonder youve the face to tell me such fibs cried the gardener  to which bruno wisely replied oo dont want a face to tell fibs wizonly a mouf  sylvie discreetly changed the subject  and did you plant all these flowers she said  what a lovely  garden youve made  do you know id like to live here always  in the winternights the gardener was beginning  but id nearly forgotten what we came about  sylvie interrupted would you please let us through into the road  theres a poor old beggar just gone outand hes very hungryand bruno wants to give him his cake you know  its as much as my place is worth the gardener muttered taking a key from his pocket and beginning to unlock a door in the gardenwall  how much are it wurf  bruno innocently enquired  but the gardener only grinned  thats a secret he said  mind you come back quick he called after the children as they passed out into the road  i had just time to follow them before he shut the door again  we hurried down the road and very soon caught sight of the old beggar about a quarter of a mile ahead of us and the children at once set off running to overtake him  lightly and swiftly they skimmed over the ground and i could not in the least understand how it was i kept up with them so easily  but the unsolved problem did not worry me so much as at another time it might have done there were so many other things to attend to  the old beggar must have been very deaf as he paid no attention whatever to brunos eager shouting but trudged wearily on never pausing until the child got in front of him and held up the slice of cake  the poor little fellow was quite out of breath and could only utter the one word cake not with the gloomy decision with which her excellency had so lately pronounced it but with a sweet childish timidity looking up into the old mans face with eyes that loved all things both great and small  the old man snatched it from him and devoured it greedily as some hungry wild beast might have done but never a word of thanks did he give his little benefactoronly growled more more and glared at the halffrightened children  there is no more sylvie said with tears in her eyes id eaten mine  it was a shame to let you be turned away like that im very sorry  i lost the rest of the sentence for my mind had recurred with a great shock of surprise to lady muriel orme who had so lately uttered these very words of sylviesyes and in sylvies own voice and with sylvies gentle pleading eyes  follow me were the next words i heard as the old man waved his hand with a dignified grace that ill suited his ragged dress over a bush that stood by the road side which began instantly to sink into the earth  at another time i might have doubted the evidence of my eyes or at least have felt some astonishment but in this strange scene my whole being seemed absorbed in strong curiosity as to what would happen next  when the bush had sunk quite out of our sight marble steps were seen leading downwards into darkness  the old man led the way and we eagerly followed  the staircase was so dark at first that i could only just see the forms of the children as handinhand they groped their way down after their guide but it got lighter every moment with a strange silvery brightness that seemed to exist in the air as there were no lamps visible and when at last we reached a level floor the room in which we found ourselves was almost as light as day  it was eightsided having in each angle a slender pillar round which silken draperies were twined  the wall between the pillars was entirely covered to the height of six or seven feet with creepers from which hung quantities of ripe fruit and of brilliant flowers that almost hid the leaves  in another place perchance i might have wondered to see fruit and flowers growing together here my chief wonder was that neither fruit nor flowers were such as i had ever seen before higher up each wall contained a circular window of coloured glass and over all was an arched roof that seemed to be spangled all over with jewels  with hardly less wonder i turned this way and that trying to make out how in the world we had come in for there was no door and all the walls were thickly covered with the lovely creepers  we are safe here my darlings said the old man laying a hand on sylvies shoulder and bending down to kiss her  sylvie drew back hastily with an offended air but in another moment with a glad cry of why its father she had run into his arms  imagea beggars palace  father  father  bruno repeated and while the happy children were being hugged and kissed i could but rub my eyes and say where then are the rags gone to for the old man was now dressed in royal robes that glittered with jewels and gold embroidery and wore a circlet of gold around his head   chapter 6  the magic locket  where are we father  sylvie whispered with her arms twined closely around the old mans neck and with her rosy cheek lovingly pressed to his  in elfland darling  its one of the provinces of fairyland  but i thought elfland was ever so far from outland and weve come such a tiny little way  you came by the royal road sweet one  only those of royal blood can travel along it but youve been royal ever since i was made king of elfland thats nearly a month ago  they sent two ambassadors to make sure that their invitation to me to be their new king should reach me one was a prince so he was able to come by the royal road and to come invisibly to all but me the other was a baron so he had to come by the common road and i dare say he hasnt even arrived yet  then how far have we come  sylvie enquired  just a thousand miles sweet one since the gardener unlocked that door for you  a thousand miles  bruno repeated  and may i eat one  eat a mile little rogue  no said bruno  i mean may i eat one of that fruits  yes child said his father and then youll find out what pleasure is likethe pleasure we all seek so madly and enjoy so mournfully  bruno ran eagerly to the wall and picked a fruit that was shaped something like a banana but had the colour of a strawberry  he ate it with beaming looks that became gradually more gloomy and were very blank indeed by the time he had finished  it hasnt got no taste at all he complained  i couldnt feel nuffin in my mouf  its awhats that hard word sylvie  it was a phlizz sylvie gravely replied  are they all like that father  theyre all like that to you darling because you dont belong to elflandyet  but to me they are real  bruno looked puzzled  ill try anuvver kind of fruits he said and jumped down off the kings knee  theres some lovely striped ones just like a rainbow  and off he ran  meanwhile the fairyking and sylvie were talking together but in such low tones that i could not catch the words so i followed bruno who was picking and eating other kinds of fruit in the vain hope of finding some that had a taste  i tried to pick so me myselfbut it was like grasping air and i soon gave up the attempt and returned to sylvie  look well at it my darling the old man was saying and tell me how you like it  its just lovely cried sylvie delightedly  bruno come and look and she held up so that he might see the light through it a heartshaped locket apparently cut out of a single jewel of a rich blue colour with a slender gold chain attached to it  it are welly pretty bruno more soberly remarked and he began spelling out some words inscribed on it  allwilllovesylvie he made them out at last  and so they doos he cried clasping his arms round her neck  everybody loves sylvie  but we love her best dont we bruno said the old king as he took possession of the locket  now sylvie look at this and he showed her lying on the palm of his hand a locket of a deep crimson colour the same shape as the blue one and like it attached to a slender golden chain  lovelier and lovelier exclaimed sylvie clasping her hands in ecstasy  look bruno  and theres words on this one too said bruno sylviewillloveall  now you see the difference said the old man different colours and different words  choose one of them darling  ill give you which ever you like best  imagethe crimson locket  sylvie whispered the words several times over with a thoughtful smile and then made her decision  its very nice to be loved she said but its nicer to love other people  may i have the red one father  the old man said nothing but i could see his eyes fill with tears as he bent his head and pressed his lips to her forehead in a long loving kiss  then he undid the chain and showed her how to fasten it round her neck and to hide it away under the edge of her frock  its for you to keep you know he said in a low voice not for other people to see youll remember how to use it  yes ill remember said sylvie  and now darlings its time for you to go back or theyll be missing you and then that poor gardener will get into trouble  once more a feeling of wonder rose in my mind as to how in the world we were to get back againsince i took it for granted that wherever the children went i was to gobut no shadow of doubt seemed to cross their minds as they hugged and kissed him murmuring over and over again goodbye darling father  and then suddenly and swiftly the darkness of midnight seemed to close in upon us and through the darkness harshly rang a strange wild song      he thought he saw a buffalo     upon the chimneypiece     he looked again and found it was     his sisters husbands niece     unless you leave this house he said     ill send for the police  imagehe thought he saw a buffalo  that was me he added looking out at us through the halfopened door as we stood waiting in the road and thats what id have doneas sure as potatoes arent radishesif she hadnt have tooken herself off  but i always loves my payrints like anything  who are oor payrints said bruno  them as pay rint for me a course the gardener replied you can come in now if you like  he flung the door open as he spoke and we got out a little dazzled and stupefied at least i felt so at the sudden transition from the halfdarkness of the railwaycarriage to the brilliantlylighted platform of elveston station  a footman in a handsome livery came forwards and respectfully touched his hat  the carriage is here my lady he said taking from her the wraps and small articles she was carrying and lady muriel after shaking hands and bidding me goodnight with a pleasant smile followed him  it was with a somewhat blank and lonely feeling that i betook myself to the van from which the luggage was being taken out and after giving directions to have my boxes sent after me i made my way on foot to arthurs lodgings and soon lost my lonely feeling in the hearty welcome my old friend gave me and the cozy warmth and cheerful light of the little sittingroom into which he led me  little as you see but quite enough for us two  now take the easychair old fellow and lets have another look at you  well you do look a bit pulled down and he put on a solemn professional air i prescribe ozone quant suff  social dissipation fiant pilulae quam plurimae to be taken feasting three times a day  but doctor  i remonstrated  society doesnt receive three times a day  thats all you know about it the young doctor gaily replied at home lawntennis 3 pm  at home kettledrum 5 pm at home music elveston doesnt give dinners 8 pm  carriages at 10 there you are  it sounded very pleasant i was obliged to admit  and i know some of the ladysociety already i added  one of them came in the same carriage with me  what was she like  then perhaps i can identify her  the name was lady muriel orme  as to what she was likewell i thought her very beautiful  do you know her  yesi do know her and the grave doctor coloured slightly as he added yes i agree with you  she is beautiful  i quite lost my heart to her  i went on mischievously  we talked  have some supper  arthur interrupted with an air of relief as the maid entered with the tray  and he steadily resisted all my attempts to return to the subject of lady muriel until the evening had almost worn itself away  then as we sat gazing into the fire and conversation was lapsing into silence he made a hurried confession  i hadnt meant to tell you anything about her he said naming no names as if there were only one she in the world till you had seen more of her and formed your own judgment of her but somehow you surprised it out of me  and ive not breathed a word of it to any one else  but i can trust you with a secret old friend  yes  its true of me what i suppose you said in jest  in the merest jest believe me  i said earnestly  why man im three times her age  but if shes your choice then im sure shes all that is good and  and sweet arthur went on and pure and selfdenying and truehearted and he broke off hastily as if he could not trust himself to say more on a subject so sacred and so precious silence followed and i leaned back drowsily in my easychair filled with bright and beautiful imaginings of arthur and his ladylove and of all the peace and happiness in store for them  i pictured them to myself walking together lingeringly and lovingly under arching trees in a sweet garden of their own and welcomed back by their faithful gardener on their return from some brief excursion  it seemed natural enough that the gardener should be filled with exuberant delight at the return of so gracious a master and mistress and how strangely childlike they looked  i could have taken them for sylvie and bruno less natural that he should show it by such wild dances such crazy songs      he thought he saw a rattlesnake     that questioned him in greek     he looked again and found it was     the middle of next week     the one thing i regret he said     is that it cannot speak  least natural of all that the vicewarden and my lady should be standing close beside me discussing an open letter which had just been handed to him by the professor who stood meekly waiting a few yards off  if it were not for those two brats i heard him mutter glancing savagely at sylvie and bruno who were courteously listening to the gardeners song there would be no difficulty whatever  lets hear that bit of the letter again said my lady and the vicewarden read aloud  and we therefore entreat you graciously to accept the kingship to which you have been unanimously elected by the council of elfland and that you will allow your son bruno of whose goodness cleverness and beauty reports have reached usto be regarded as heirapparent  but whats the difficulty said my lady  why dont you see  the ambassador that brought this is waiting in the house and hes sure to see sylvie and bruno and then when he sees uggug and remembers all that about goodness cleverness and beauty why hes sure to  and where will you find a better boy than uggug my lady indignantly interrupted  or a wittier or a lovelier  to all of which the vicewarden simply replied dont you be a great blethering goose  our only chance is to keep those two brats out of sight  if you can manage that you may leave the rest to me ill make him believe uggug to be a model of cleverness and all that  we must change his name to bruno of course said my lady  the vicewarden rubbed his chin  humph  no he said musingly wouldnt do  the boys such an utter idiot hed never learn to answer to it  idiot indeed cried my lady  hes no more an idiot than i am  youre right my dear the vicewarden soothingly i replied he isnt indeed  my lady was appeased  lets go in and receive the ambassador she said and beckoned to the professor  which room is he waiting in she inquired  in the library madam  and what did you say his name was said the vicewarden  the professor referred to a card he held in his hand his adiposity the baron doppelgeist  why does he come with such a funny name said my lady  he couldnt well change it on the journey the professor meekly replied because of the luggage  you go and receive him my lady said to the vicewarden and ill attend to the children   chapter 7  the barons embassy  i was following the vicewarden but on second thoughts went after my lady being curious to see how she would manage to keep the children out of sight  i found her holding sylvies hand and with her other hand stroking brunos hair in a most tender and motherly fashion both children were looking bewildered and halffrightened  my own darlings she was saying ive been planning a little treat for you  the professor shall take you a long walk into the woods this beautiful evening and you shall take a basket of food with you and have a little picnic down by the river  bruno jumped and clapped his hands  that are nice he cried arent it sylvie  sylvie who hadnt quite lost her surprised look put up her mouth for a kiss  thank you very much she said earnestly  my lady turned her head away to conceal the broad grin of triumph that spread over her vast face like a ripple on a lake  little simpletons she muttered to herself as she marched up to the house i followed her in  quite so your excellency the baron was saying as we entered the library  all the infantry were under my command he turned and was duly presented to my lady  a military hero said my lady  the fat little man simpered well yes he replied modestly casting down his eyes my ancestors were all famous for military genius  my lady smiled graciously  it often runs in families she remarked just as a love for pastry does  the baron looked slightly offended and the vicewarden discreetly changed the subject  dinner will soon be ready he said  may i have the honour of conducting your adiposity to the guestchamber  certainly certainly the baron eagerly assented  it would never do to keep dinner waiting  and he almost trotted out of the room after the vicewarden  he was back again so speedily that the vicewarden had barely time to explain to my lady that her remark about a love for pastry was unfortunate  you might have seen with half an eye he added that thats his line  military genius indeed  pooh  dinner ready yet the baron enquired as he hurried into the room  will be in a few minutes the vicewarden replied  meanwhile lets take a turn in the garden  you were telling me he continued  as the trio left the house something about a great battle in which you had the command of the infantry  true said the baron  the enemy as i was saying far outnumbered us but i marched my men right into the middle ofwhats that the military hero exclaimed in agitated tones drawing back behind the vicewarden as a strange creature rushed wildly upon them brandishing a spade  its only the gardener the vicewarden replied in an encouraging tone quite harmless i assure you  hark hes singing its his favorite amusement  and once more those shrill discordant tones rang out      he thought he saw a bankers clerk     descending from the bus     he looked again and found it was     a hippopotamus     if this should stay to dine he said     there wont be mutch for us  throwing away the spade he broke into a frantic jig snapping his fingers and repeating again and again      there wont be much for us     there wont be much for us  imageit was a hippoptamus  once more the baron looked slightly offended but the vicewarden hastily explained that the song had no allusion to him and in fact had no meaning at all  you didnt mean anything by it now did you  he appealed to the gardener who had finished his song and stood balancing himself on one leg and looking at them with his mouth open  i never means nothing said the gardener and uggug luckily came up at the moment and gave the conversation a new turn  allow me to present my son said the vicewarden adding in a whisper one of the best and cleverest boys that ever lived ill contrive for you to see some of his cleverness  he knows everything that other boys dont know and in archery in fishing in painting and in music his skill isbut you shall judge for yourself you see that target over there  he shall shoot an arrow at it dear boyhe went on aloud his adiposity would like to see you shoot bring his highness bow and arrows  uggug looked very sulky as he received the bow and arrow and prepared to shoot  just as the arrow left the bow the vicewarden trod heavily on the toe of the baron who yelled with the pain  ten thousand pardons he exclaimed  i stepped back in my excitement see  it is a bullseye  the baron gazed in astonishment  he held the bow so awkwardly it seemed impossible he muttered  but there was no room for doubt there was the arrow right in the centre of the bullseye  the lake is close by continued the vicewarden  bring his highness fishingrod  and uggug most unwillingly held the rod and dangled the fly over the water  a beetle on your arm cried my lady pinching the poor barons arm worse than if ten lobsters had seized it at once that kind is poisonous she explained  but what a pity you missed seeing the fish pulled out  an enormous dead codfish was lying on the bank with the hook in its mouth  i had always fancied the baron faltered that cod were saltwater fish  not in this country said the vicewarden  shall we go in ask my son some question on the way any subject you like and the sulky boy was violently shoved forwards to walk at the barons side  could your highness tell me the baron cautiously began how much seven times nine would come to  turn to the left cried the vicewarden hastily stepping forwards to show the wayso hastily that he ran against his unfortunate guest who fell heavily on his face  so sorry my lady exclaimed as she and her husband helped him to his feet again  my son was in the act of saying sixtythree as you fell  the baron said nothing he was covered with dust and seemed much hurt both in body and mind  however when they had got him into the house and given him a good brushing matters looked a little better  dinner was served in due course and every fresh dish seemed to increase the goodhumour of the baron but all efforts to get him to express his opinion as to uggugs cleverness were in vain until that interesting youth had left the room and was seen from the open window prowling about the lawn with a little basket which he was filling with frogs  so fond of natural history as he is dear boy said the doting mother  now do tell us baron what you think of him  to be perfectly candid said the cautious baron i would like a little more evidence  i think you mentioned his skill in  music said the vicewarden  why hes simply a prodigy you shall hear him play the piano  and he walked to the window ugi mean my boy  come in for a minute and bring the musicmaster with you  to turn over the music for him he added as an explanation  uggug having filled his basket with frogs had no objection to obey and soon appeared in the room followed by a fiercelooking little man who asked the vicewarden vot music vill you haf  the sonata that his highness plays so charmingly said the vicewarden his highness haf not the musicmaster began but was sharply stopped by the vicewarden  silence sir  go and turn over the music for his highness my dear to the wardeness will you show him what to do and meanwhile baron ill just show you a most interesting map we haveof outland and fairyland and that sort of thing  by the time my lady had returned from explaining things to the musicmaster the map had been hung up and the baron was already much bewildered by the vicewardens habit of pointing to one place while he shouted out the name of another  imagethe map of fairyland  my lady joining in pointing out other places and shouting other names only made matters worse and at last the baron in despair took to pointing out places for himself and feebly asked is that great yellow splotch fairyland  yes thats fairyland said the vicewarden and you might as well give him a hint he muttered to my lady about going back tomorrow he eats like a shark  it would hardly do for me to mention it  his wife caught the idea and at once began giving hints of the most subtle and delicate kind  just see what a short way it is back to fairyland  why if you started tomorrow morning youd get there in very little more than a week  the baron looked incredulous  it took me a full month to come he said  but its ever so much shorter going back you know  the baron looked appealingly to the vicewarden who chimed in readily you can go back five times in the time it took you to come here onceif you start tomorrow morning  all this time the sonata was pealing through the room  the baron could not help admitting to himself that it was being magnificently played but he tried in vain to get a glimpse of the youthful performer every time he had nearly succeeded in catching sight of him either the vicewarden or his wife was sure to get in the way pointing out some new place on the map and deafening him with some new name  he gave in at last wished a hasty goodnight and left the room while his host and hostess interchanged looks of triumph  deftly done cried the vicewarden  craftily contrived but what means all that tramping on the stairs  he halfopened the door looked out and added in a tone of dismay the barons boxes are being carried down  and what means all that rumbling of wheels cried my lady  she peeped through the window curtains  the barons carriage has come round she groaned  at this moment the door opened a fat furious face looked in a voice hoarse with passion thundered out the words my room is full of frogsi leave you and the door closed again  and still the noble sonata went pealing through the room but it was arthurs masterly touch that roused the echoes and thrilled my very soul with the tender music of the immortal sonata pathetique and it was not till the last note had died away that the tired but happy traveler could bring himself to utter the words goodnight and to seek his muchneeded pillow   chapter 8  a ride on a lion  the next day glided away pleasantly enough partly in settling myself in my new quarters and partly in strolling round the neighbourhood under arthurs guidance and trying to form a general idea of elveston and its inhabitants  when five oclock arrived arthur proposed without any embarrassment this timeto take me with him up to the hall in order that i might make acquaintance with the earl of ainslie who had taken it for the season and renew acquaintance with his daughter lady muriel  my first impressions of the gentle dignified and yet genial old man were entirely favourable and the real satisfaction that showed itself on his daughters face as she met me with the words this is indeed an unlookedfor pleasure was very soothing for whatever remains of personal vanity the failures and disappointments of many long years and much buffeting with a rough world had left in me  yet i noted and was glad to note evidence of a far deeper feeling than mere friendly regard in her meeting with arthur though this was as i gathered an almost daily occurrenceand the conversation between them in which the earl and i were only occasional sharers had an ease and a spontaneity rarely met with except between very old friends and as i knew that they had not known each other for a longer period than the summer which was now rounding into autumn i felt certain that love and love alone could explain the phenomenon  how convenient it would be lady muriel laughingly remarked a propos of my having insisted on saving her the trouble of carrying a cup of tea across the room to the earl if cups of tea had no weight at all  then perhaps ladies would sometimes be permitted to carry them for short distances  one can easily imagine a situation said arthur where things would necessarily have no weight relatively to each other though each would have its usual weight looked at by itself  some desperate paradox said the earl  tell us how it could be we shall never guess it  well suppose this house just as it is placed a few billion miles above a planet and with nothing else near enough to disturb it of course it falls to the planet  the earl nodded  of course though it might take some centuries to do it  and is fiveoclocktea to be going on all the while said lady muriel  that and other things said arthur  the inhabitants would live their lives grow up and die and still the house would be falling falling falling  but now as to the relative weight of things nothing can be heavy you know except by trying to fall and being prevented from doing so  you all grant that  we all granted that  well now if i take this book and hold it out at arms length of course i feel its weight  it is trying to fall and i prevent it and if i let go it fails to the floor  but if we were all falling together it couldnt be trying to fall any quicker you know for if i let go what more could it do than fall  and as my hand would be falling tooat the same rateit would never leave it for that would be to get ahead of it in the race  and it could never overtake the failing floor  i see it clearly said lady muriel  but it makes one dizzy to think of such things  how can you make us do it  there is a more curious idea yet i ventured to say  suppose a cord fastened to the house from below and pulled down by some one on the planet  then of course the house goes faster than its natural rate of falling but the furniturewith our noble selveswould go on failing at their old pace and would therefore be left behind  practically we should rise to the ceiling said the earl the inevitable result of which would be concussion of brain  to avoid that said arthur let us have the furniture fixed to the floor and ourselves tied down to the furniture  then the fiveoclocktea could go on in peace  with one little drawback lady muriel gaily interrupted we should take the cups down with us but what about the tea  i had forgotten the tea arthur confessed  that no doubt would rise to the ceiling unless you chose to drink it on the way  which i think is quite nonsense enough for one while said the earl  what news does this gentleman bring us from the great world of london  this drew me into the conversation which now took a more conventional tone  after a while arthur gave the signal for our departure and in the cool of the evening we strolled down to the beach enjoying the silence broken only by the murmur of the sea and the faraway music of some fishermens song almost as much as our late pleasant talk  we sat down among the rocks by a little pool so rich in animal vegetable and zoophytic or whatever is the right wordlife that i became entranced in the study of it and when arthur proposed returning to our lodgings i begged to be left there for a while to watch and muse alone  the fishermens song grew ever nearer and clearer as their boat stood in for the beach and i would have gone down to see them land their cargo of fish had not the microcosm at my feet stirred my curiosity yet more keenly  one ancient crab that was for ever shuffling frantically from side to side of the pool had particularly fascinated me there was a vacancy in its stare and an aimless violence in its behaviour that irresistibly recalled the gardener who had befriended sylvie and bruno and as i gazed i caught the concluding notes of the tune of his crazy song  the silence that followed was broken by the sweet voice of sylvie would you please let us out into the road  what  after that old beggar again the gardener yelled and began singing       he thought he saw a kangaroo     that worked a coffeemill     he looked again and found it was     a vegetablepill     were i to swallow this he said     i should be very ill  imagehe thought he saw a kangaroo  we dont want him to swallow anything sylvie explained hes not hungry  but we want to see him  so will you please  certainly the gardener promptly replied  i always please never displeases nobody  there you are  and he flung the door open and let us out upon the dusty highroad  we soon found our way to the bush which had so mysteriously sunk into the ground and here sylvie drew the magic locket from its hidingplace turned it over with a thoughtful air and at last appealed to bruno in a rather helpless way  what was it we had to do with it bruno its all gone out of my head  kiss it was brunos invariable recipe in cases of doubt and difficulty sylvie kissed it but no result followed  rub it the wrong way was brunos next suggestion  which is the wrong way sylvie most reasonably enquired the obvious plan was to try both ways  rubbing from left to right had no visible effect whatever  from right to left oh stop sylvie  bruno cried in sudden alarm whatever is going to happen  for a number of trees on the neighbouring hillside were moving slowly upwards in solemn procession while a mild little brook that had been rippling at our feet a moment before began to swell and foam and hiss and bubble in a truly alarming fashion  rub it some other way cried bruno  try upanddown  quick  it was a happy thought  upanddown did it and the landscape which had been showing signs of mental aberration in various directions returned to its normal condition of sobriety with the exception of a small yellowishbrown mouse which continued to run wildly up and down the road lashing its tail like a little lion  lets follow it said sylvie and this also turned out a happy thought  the mouse at once settled down into a businesslike jogtrot with which we could easily keep pace  the only phenomenon that gave me any uneasiness was the rapid increase in the size of the little creature we were following which became every moment more and more like a real lion  soon the transformation was complete and a noble lion stood patiently waiting for us to come up with it  no thought of fear seemed to occur to the children who patted and stroked it as if it had been a shetlandpony  imagethe mouselion  help me up cried bruno  and in another moment sylvie had lifted him upon the broad back of the gentle beast and seated herself behind him pillionfashion  bruno took a good handful of mane in each hand and made believe to guide this new kind of steed  geeup seemed quite sufficient by way of verbal direction the lion at once broke into an easy canter and we soon found ourselves in the depths of the forest i say we for i am certain that i accompanied them though how i managed to keep up with a cantering lion i am wholly unable to explain but i was certainly one of the party when we came upon an old beggarman cutting sticks at whose feet the lion made a profound obeisance sylvie and bruno at the same moment dismounting and leaping in to the arms of their father  from bad to worse the old man said to himself dreamily when the children had finished their rather confused account of the ambassadors visit gathered no doubt from general report as they had not seen him themselves  from bad to worse  that is their destiny  i see it but i cannot alter it  the selfishness of a mean and crafty manthe selfishness of an ambitious and silly woman the selfishness of a spiteful and loveless child all tend one way from bad to worse and you my darlings must suffer it awhile i fear  yet when things are at their worst you can come to me  i can do but little as yet  gathering up a handful of dust and scattering it in the air he slowly and solemnly pronounced some words that sounded like a charm the children looking on in awestruck silence      let craft ambition spite     be quenched in reasons night     till weakness turn to might     till what is dark be light     till what is wrong be right  the cloud of dust spread itself out through the air as if it were alive forming curious shapes that were for ever changing into others  it makes letters  it makes words  bruno whispered as he clung halffrightened to sylvie  only i cant make them out  read them sylvie  ill try sylvie gravely replied  wait a minuteif only i could see that word  i should be very ill a discordant voice yelled in our ears      were i to swallow this he said     i should be very ill   chapter 9  a jester and a bear  yes we were in the garden once more and to escape that horrid discordant voice we hurried indoors and found ourselves in the libraryuggug blubbering the professor standing by with a bewildered air and my lady with her arms clasped round her sons neck repeating over and over again and did they give him nasty lessons to learn  my own pretty pet  whats all this noise about the vicewarden angrily enquired as he strode into the room  and who put the hatstand here  and he hung his hat up on bruno who was standing in the middle of the room too much astonished by the sudden change of scene to make any attempt at removing it though it came down to his shoulders making him look something like a small candle with a large extinguisher over it  the professor mildly explained that his highness had been graciously pleased to say he wouldnt do his lessons  do your lessons this instant you young cub thundered the vicewarden and take this and a resounding box on the ear made the unfortunate professor reel across the room  save me faltered the poor old man as he sank halffainting at my ladys feet  shave you  of course i will my lady replied as she lifted him into a chair and pinned an antimacassar round his neck wheres the razor  the vicewarden meanwhile had got hold of uggug and was belabouring him with his umbrella who left this loose nail in the floor he shouted hammer it in i say  hammer it in  blow after blow fell on the writhing uggug till he dropped howling to the floor  imagehammer it in  then his father turned to the shaving scene which was being enacted and roared with laughter  excuse me dear i cant help it he said as soon as he could speak  you are such an utter donkey kiss me tabby  and he flung his arms round the neck of the terrified professor who raised a wild shriek but whether he received the threatened kiss or not i was unable to see as bruno who had by this time released himself from his extinguisher rushed headlong out of the room followed by sylvie and i was so fearful of being left alone among all these crazy creatures that i hurried after them  we must go to father  sylvie panted as they ran down the garden im sure things are at their worst  ill ask the gardener to let us out again  but we cant walk all the way  bruno whimpered  how i wiss we had a coachandfour like uncle  and shrill and wild rang through the air the familiar voice      he thought he saw a coachandfour     that stood beside his bed     he looked again and found it was     a bear without a head     poor thing he said poor silly thing     its waiting to be fed  imagea bear without a head  no i cant let you out again he said before the children could speak  the vicewarden gave it me he did for letting you out last time  so be off with you  and turning away from them he began digging frantically in the middle of a gravelwalk singing over and over again poor thing he said poor silly thing  its waiting to be fed but in a more musical tone than the shrill screech in which he had begun  the music grew fuller and richer at every moment other manly voices joined in the refrain and soon i heard the heavy thud that told me the boat had touched the beach and the harsh grating of the shingle as the men dragged it up  i roused myself and after lending them a hand in hauling up their boat i lingered yet awhile to watch them disembark a goodly assortment of the hardwon treasures of the deep  when at last i reached our lodgings i was tired and sleepy and glad enough to settle down again into the easychair while arthur hospitably went to his cupboard to get me out some cake and wine without which he declared he could not as a doctor permit my going to bed  and how that cupboarddoor did creak  it surely could not be arthur who was opening and shutting it so often moving so restlessly about and muttering like the soliloquy of a tragedyqueen  no it was a female voice  also the figure halfhidden by the cupboarddoorwas a female figure massive and in flowing robes  could it be the landlady  the door opened and a strange man entered the room  what is that donkey doing he said to himself pausing aghast on the threshold  the lady thus rudely referred to was his wife  she had got one of the cupboards open and stood with her back to him smoothing down a sheet of brown paper on one of the shelves and whispering to herself so so  deftly done  craftily contrived  her loving husband stole behind her on tiptoe and tapped her on the head  boh he playfully shouted at her ear  never tell me again i cant say boh to a goose  my lady wrung her hands  discovered she groaned  yet nohe is one of us  reveal it not oh man  let it bide its time  reveal what not her husband testily replied dragging out the sheet of brown paper  what are you hiding here my lady  i insist upon knowing  my lady cast down her eyes and spoke in the littlest of little voices dont make fun of it benjamin she pleaded  itsitsdont you understand  its a dagger  and whats that for sneered his excellency  weve only got to make people think hes dead  we havent got to kill him  and made of tin too he snarled contemptuously bending the blade round his thumb now madam youll be good enough to explain  first what do you call me benjamin for  its part of the conspiracy love  one must have an alias you know  oh an alias is it  well  and next what did you get this dagger for come no evasions  you cant deceive me  i got it forforfor the detected conspirator stammered trying her best to put on the assassinexpression that she had been practising at the lookingglass  for  for what madam  well for eighteenpence if you must know dearest  thats what i got it for on my  now dont say your word and honour groaned the other conspirator why they arent worth half the money put together  on my birthday my lady concluded in a meek whisper one must have a dagger you know  its part of the  oh dont talk of conspiracies her husband savagely interrupted as he tossed the dagger into the cupboard  you know about as much how to manage a conspiracy as if you were a chicken  why the first thing is to get a disguise  now just look at this  and with pardonable pride he fitted on the cap and bells and the rest of the fools dress and winked at her and put his tongue in his cheek is that the sort of thing now he demanded  my ladys eyes flashed with all a conspirators enthusiasm the very thing she exclaimed clapping her hands you do look oh such a perfect fool  the fool smiled a doubtful smile  he was not quite clear whether it was a compliment or not to express it so plainly  you mean a jester yes thats what i intended  and what do you think your disguise is to be  and he proceeded to unfold the parcel the lady watching him in rapture  oh how lovely she cried when at last the dress was unfolded what a splendid disguise  an esquimaux peasantwoman  an esquimaux peasant indeed growled the other  here put it on and look at yourself in the glass  why its a bear cant you use your eyes  he checked himself suddenly as a harsh voice yelled through the room      he looked again and found it was     a bear without a head  but it was only the gardener singing under the open window the vicewarden stole on tiptoe to the window and closed it noiselessly before he ventured to go on  yes lovey a bear but not without a head i hope  youre the bear and me the keeper  and if any one knows us theyll have sharp eyes thats all  i shall have to practise the steps a bit my lady said looking out through the bears mouth one cant help being rather human just at first you know  and of course youll say come up bruin wont you  yes of course replied the keeper laying hold of the chain that hung from the bears collar with one hand while with the other he cracked a little whip  now go round the room in a sort of a dancing attitude  very good my dear very good  come up bruin come up i say  imagecome up bruin  he roared out the last words for the benefit of uggug who had just come into the room and was now standing with his hands spread out and eyes and mouth wide open the very picture of stupid amazement oh my was all he could gasp out  the keeper pretended to be adjusting the bears collar which gave him an opportunity of whispering unheard by uggug my fault im afraid quite forgot to fasten the door  plots ruined if he finds it out keep it up a minute or two longer  be savage  then while seeming to pull it back with all his strength he let it advance upon the scared boy my lady with admirable presence of mind kept up what she no doubt intended for a savage growl though it was more like the purring of a cat and uggug backed out of the room with such haste that he tripped over the mat and was heard to fall heavily outside an accident to which even his doting mother paid no heed in the excitement of the moment  the vicewarden shut and bolted the door  off with the disguises he panted  theres not a moment to lose  hes sure to fetch the professor and we couldnt take him in you know  and in another minute the disguises were stowed away in the cupboard the door unbolted and the two conspirators seated lovingly sidebyside on the sofa earnestly discussing a book the vicewarden had hastily snatched off the table which proved to be the citydirectory of the capital of outland  the door opened very slowly and cautiously and the professor peeped in uggugs stupid face being just visible behind him  it is a beautiful arrangement the vicewarden was saying with enthusiasm  you see my precious one that there are fifteen houses in green street before you turn into west street  fifteen houses  is it possible my lady replied  i thought it was fourteen  and so intent were they on this interesting question that neither of them even looked up till the professor leading uggug by the hand stood close before them  my lady was the first to notice their approach why heres the professor she exclaimed in her blandest tones and my precious child too  are lessons over  a strange thing has happened the professor began in a trembling tone his exalted fatness this was one of uggugs many titles tells me he has just seen in this very room a dancingbear and a courtjester  the vicewarden and his wife shook with wellacted merriment  not in this room darling said the fond mother  weve been sitting here this hour or more reading here she referred to the book lying on her lap reading thethe citydirectory  let me feel your pulse my boy said the anxious father now put out your tongue  ah i thought so  hes a little feverish professor and has had a bad dream  put him to bed at once and give him a cooling draught  i aint been dreaming his exalted fatness remonstrated as the professor led him away  bad grammar sir his father remarked with some sternness kindly attend to that little matter professor as soon as you have corrected the feverishness  and by the way professor the professor left his distinguished pupil standing at the door and meekly returned there is a rumour afloat that the people wish to elect anin point of fact an you understand that i mean an  not another professor the poor old man exclaimed in horror  no  certainly not the vicewarden eagerly explained merely an emperor you understand  an emperor cried the astonished professor holding his head between his hands as if he expected it to come to pieces with the shock what will the warden  why the warden will most likely be the new emperor my lady explained  where could we find a better  unless perhaps she glanced at her husband  where indeed the professor fervently responded quite failing to take the hint  the vicewarden resumed the thread of his discourse  the reason i mentioned it professor was to ask you to be so kind as to preside at the election  you see it would make the thing respectableno suspicion of anything underhand  i fear i cant your excellency the old man faltered what will the warden  true true the vicewarden interrupted  your position as courtprofessor makes it awkward i admit  well well then the election shall be held without you  better so than if it were held within me the professor murmured with a bewildered air as if he hardly knew what he was saying bed i think your highness said and a coolingdraught and he wandered dreamily back to where uggug sulkily awaited him  i followed them out of the room and down the passage the professor murmuring to himself all the time as a kind of aid to his feeble memory c c c couch coolingdraught correctgrammar till in turning a corner he met sylvie and bruno so suddenly that the startled professor let go of his fat pupil who instantly took to his heels   chapter 10  the other professor  we were looking for you cried sylvie in a tone of great relief we do want you so much you cant think  what is it dear children the professor asked beaming on them with a very different look from what uggug ever got from him  we want you to speak to the gardener for us sylvie said as she and bruno took the old mans hands and led him into the hall  hes ever so unkind  bruno mournfully added  theys all unkind to us now that fathers gone  the lion were much nicer  but you must explain to me please the professor said with an anxious look which is the lion and which is the gardener its most important not to get two such animals confused together and ones very liable to do it in their caseboth having mouths you know  doos oo always confuses two animals together  bruno asked  pretty often im afraid the professor candidly confessed now for instance theres the rabbithutch and the hallclock the professor pointed them out  one gets a little confused with themboth having doors you know  now only yesterdaywould you believe iti put some lettuces into the clock and tried to wind up the rabbit  did the rabbit go after oo wounded it up said bruno  the professor clasped his hands on the top of his head and groaned go  i should think it did go  why its gone  and where ever its gone tothats what i cant find out  ive done my bestive read all the article rabbit in the great dictionarycome in  only the tailor sir with your little bill said a meek voice outside the door  ah well i can soon settle his business the professor said to the children if youll just wait a minute  how much is it this year my man  the tailor had come in while he was speaking  well its been a doubling so many years you see the tailor replied a little gruffly and i think id like the money now its two thousand pound it is  oh thats nothing the professor carelessly remarked feeling in his pocket as if he always carried at least that amount about with him but wouldnt you like to wait just another year and make it four thousand  just think how rich youd be  why you might be a king if you liked  i dont know as id care about being a king the man said thoughtfully  but it dew sound a powerful sight o money well i think ill wait  of course you will said the professor  theres good sense in you i see  goodday to you my man  will you ever have to pay him that four thousand pounds  sylvie asked as the door closed on the departing creditor  never my child the professor replied emphatically  hell go on doubling it till he dies  you see its always worth while waiting another year to get twice as much money  and now what would you like to do my little friends  shall i take you to see the other professor this would be an excellent opportunity for a visit he said to himself glancing at his watch he generally takes a short rest of fourteen minutes and a halfabout this time  bruno hastily went round to sylvie who was standing at the other side of the professor and put his hand into hers  i thinks wed like to go he said doubtfully only please lets go all together its best to be on the safe side oo know  why you talk as if you were sylvie exclaimed the professor  i know i did bruno replied very humbly  i quite forgotted i wasnt sylvie  only i fought he might be rarver fierce  the professor laughed a jolly laugh  oh hes quite tame he said he never bites  hes only a littlea little dreamy you know he took hold of brunos other hand and led the children down a long passage i had never noticed beforenot that there was anything remarkable in that i was constantly coming on new rooms and passages in that mysterious palace and very seldom succeeded in finding the old ones again  near the end of the passage the professor stopped  this is his room he said pointing to the solid wall  we cant get in through there  bruno exclaimed  sylvie said nothing till she had carefully examined whether the wall opened anywhere  then she laughed merrily  youre playing us a trick you dear old thing she said  theres no door here  there isnt any door to the room said the professor we shall have to climb in at the window  so we went into the garden and soon found the window of the other professors room  it was a groundfloor window and stood invitingly open the professor first lifted the two children in and then he and i climbed in after them  imagethe other professor  the other professor was seated at a table with a large book open before him on which his forehead was resting he had clasped his arms round the book and was snoring heavily  he usually reads like that the professor remarked when the books very interesting and then sometimes its very difficult to get him to attend  this seemed to be one of the difficult times the professor lifted him up once or twice and shook him violently but he always returned to his book the moment he was let go of and showed by his heavy breathing that the book was as interesting as ever  how dreamy he is the professor exclaimed  he must have got to a very interesting part of the book  and he rained quite a shower of thumps on the other professors back shouting hoy hoy all the time  isnt it wonderful that he should be so dreamy he said to bruno  if hes always as sleepy as that bruno remarked a course hes dreamy  but what are we to do said the professor  you see hes quite wrapped up in the book  suppose oo shuts the book  bruno suggested  thats it cried the delighted professor  of course thatll do it and he shut up the book so quickly that he caught the other professors nose between the leaves and gave it a severe pinch  the other professor instantly rose to his feet and carried the book away to the end of the room where he put it back in its place in the bookcase  ive been reading for eighteen hours and threequarters he said and now i shall rest for fourteen minutes and a half is the lecture all ready  very nearly the professor humbly replied  i shall ask you to give me a hint or twothere will be a few little difficulties  and banquet i think you said  oh yes  the banquet comes first of course  people never enjoy abstract science you know when theyre ravenous with hunger and then theres the fancydressball  oh therell be lots of entertainment  where will the ball come in said the other professor  i think it had better come at the beginning of the banquetit brings people together so nicely you know  yes thats the right order  first the meeting then the eating then the treatingfor im sure any lecture you give us will be a treat said the other professor who had been standing with his back to us all this time occupying himself in taking the books out one by one and turning them upsidedown  an easel with a black board on it stood near him and every time that he turned a book upsidedown he made a mark on the board with a piece of chalk  and as to the pigtalewhich you have so kindly promised to give us the professor went on thoughtfully rubbing his chin  i think that had better come at the end of the banquet then people can listen to it quietly  shall i sing it the other professor asked with a smile of delight  if you can the professor replied cautiously  let me try said the other professor seating himself at the pianoforte for the sake of argument let us assume that it begins on a flat and he struck the note in question  la la la  i think thats within an octave of it he struck the note again and appealed to bruno who was standing at his side did i sing it like that my child  no oo didnt bruno replied with great decision  it were more like a duck  single notes are apt to have that effect the other professor said with a sigh  let me try a whole verse     there was a pig that sat alone    beside a ruined pump    by day and night he made his moan    it would have stirred a heart of stone    to see him wring his hoofs and groan    because he could not jump  would you call that a tune professor he asked when he had finished  the professor considered a little  well he said at last some of the notes are the same as others and some are different but i should hardly call it a tune  let me try it a bit by myself said the other professor and he began touching the notes here and there and humming to himself like an angry bluebottle  how do you like his singing the professor asked the children in a low voice  it isnt very beautiful sylvie said hesitatingly  its very extremely ugly  bruno said without any hesitation at all  all extremes are bad the professor said very gravely for instance sobriety is a very good thing when practised in moderation but even sobriety when carried to an extreme has its disadvantages  what are its disadvantages was the question that rose in my mind and as usual bruno asked it for me  what are its lizard bandages  well this is one of them said the professor  when a mans tipsy thats one extreme you know he sees one thing as two  but when hes extremely sober thats the other extreme he sees two things as one its equally inconvenient whichever happens  what does illconvenient mean  bruno whispered to sylvie  the difference between convenient and inconvenient is best explained by an example said the other professor who had overheard the question  if youll just think over any poem that contains the two wordssuch as  the professor put his hands over his ears with a look of dismay if you once let him begin a poem he said to sylvie hell never leave off again  he never does  did he ever begin a poem and not leave off again  sylvie enquired  three times said the professor  bruno raised himself on tiptoe till his lips were on a level with sylvies ear  what became of them three poems he whispered is he saying them all now  hush said sylvie  the other professor is speaking  ill say it very quick murmured the other professor with downcast eyes and melancholy voice which contrasted oddly with his face as he had forgotten to leave off smiling  at least it wasnt exactly a smile as sylvie said afterwards it looked as if his mouth was made that shape  go on then said the professor  what must be must be  remember that  sylvie whispered to bruno its a very good rule for whenever you hurt yourself  and its a very good rule for whenever i make a noise said the saucy little fellow  so you remember it too miss  whatever do you mean said sylvie trying to frown a thing she never managed particularly well  oftens and oftens said bruno havent oo told me  there mustnt be so much noise bruno when ive tolded oo there must why there isnt no rules at all about there mustnt  but oo never believes me  as if any one could believe you you wicked wicked boy said sylvie the words were severe enough but i am of opinion that when you are really anxious to impress a criminal with a sense of his guilt you ought not to pronounce the sentence with your lips quite close to his cheeksince a kiss at the end of it however accidental weakens the effect terribly   chapter 11  peter and paul  as i was saying the other professor resumed if youll just think over any poem that contains the wordssuch as     peter is poor said noble paul    and i have always been his friend     and though my means to give are small     at least i can afford to lend     how few in this cold age of greed     do good except on selfish grounds     but i can feel for peters need     and i will lend him fifty pounds      how great was peters joy to find     his friend in such a genial vein     how cheerfully the bond he signed     to pay the money back again     we cant said paul be too precise     tis best to fix the very day     so by a learned friends advice     ive made it noon the fourth of may  imagehow cheefully the bond he signed      but this is april  peter said     the first of april as i think     five little weeks will soon be fled     one scarcely will have time to wink     give me a year to speculate     to buy and sellto drive a trade     said paul i cannot change the date     on may the fourth it must be paid      well well said peter with a sigh     hand me the cash and i will go     ill form a jointstock company     and turn an honest pound or so     im grieved said paul to seem unkind     the money shalt of course be lent     but for a week or two i find     it will not be convenient      so week by week poor peter came     and turned in heaviness away     for still the answer was the same     i cannot manage it today     and now the april showers were dry     the five short weeks were nearly spent     yet still he got the old reply     it is not quite convenient      the fourth arrived and punctual paul     came with his legal friend at noon     i thought it best said he to call     one cannot settle things too soon     poor peter shuddered in despair     his flowing locks he wildly tore     and very soon his yellow hair     was lying all about the floor      the legal friend was standing by     with sudden pity half unmanned     the teardrop trembled in his eye     the signed agreement in his hand     but when at length the legal soul     resumed its customary force     the law he said we cant control     pay or the law must take its course      said paul how bitterly i rue     that fatal morning when i called     consider peter what you do     you wont be richer when youre bald     think you by rending curls away     to make your difficulties less     forbear this violence i pray     you do but add to my distress  imagepoor peter shuddered in despair      not willingly would i inflict     said peter on that noble heart     one needless pang  yet why so strict     is this to act a friendly part     however legal it may be     to pay what never has been lent     this style of business seems to me     extremely inconvenient      no nobleness of soul have i     like some that in this age are found     paul blushed in sheer humility     and cast his eyes upon the ground     this debt will simply swallow all     and make my life a life of woe     nay nay nay peter answered paul     you must not rail on fortune so      you have enough to eat and drink     you are respected in the world     and at the barbers as i think     you often get your whiskers curled     though nobleness you cant attain     to any very great extent     the path of honesty is plain     however inconvenient      tis true said peter im alive     i keep my station in the world     once in the week i just contrive     to get my whiskers oiled and curled     but my assets are very low     my little incomes overspent     to trench on capital you know     is always inconvenient      but pay your debts cried honest paul     my gentle peter pay your debts     what matter if it swallows all     that you describe as your assets     already youre an hour behind     yet generosity is best     it pinches mebut never mind     i will not charge you interest      how good  how great poor peter cried     yet i must sell my sunday wig     the scarfpin that has been my pride     my grand pianoand my pig     full soon his property took wings     and daily as each treasure went     he sighed to find the state of things     grow less and less convenient      weeks grew to months and months to years     peter was worn to skin and bone     and once he even said with tears     remember paul that promised loan     said paul ill lend you when i can     all the spare money i have got     ah peter youre a happy man     yours is an enviable lot  imagesuch boots as these you seldom see      im getting stout as you may see     it is but seldom i am well     i cannot feel my ancient glee     in listening to the dinnerbell     but you you gambol like a boy     your figure is so spare and light     the dinnerbells a note of joy     to such a healthy appetite      said peter i am well aware     mine is a state of happiness     and yet how gladly could i spare     some of the comforts i possess     what you call healthy appetite     i feel as hungers savage tooth     and when no dinner is in sight     the dinnerbells a sound of ruth      no scarecrow would accept this coat     such boots as these you seldom see     ah paul a single fivepoundnote     would make another man of me     said paul it fills me with surprise     to hear you talk in such a tone     i fear you scarcely realise     the blessings that are all your own      youre safe from being overfed     youre sweetly picturesque in rags     you never know the aching head     that comes along with moneybags     and you have time to cultivate     that best of qualities content     for which youll find your present state     remarkably convenient      said peter though i cannot sound     the depths of such a man as you     yet in your character ive found     an inconsistency or two     you seem to have long years to spare     when theres a promise to fulfil     and yet how punctual you were     in calling with that little bill      one cant be too deliberate     said paul in parting with ones pelf     with bills as you correctly state     im punctuality itself     a man may surely claim his dues     but when theres money to be lent     a man must be allowed to choose     such times as are convenient      it chanced one day as peter sat     gnawing a crusthis usual meal     paul bustled in to have a chat     and grasped his hand with friendly zeal     i knew said he your frugal ways     so that i might not wound your pride     by bringing strangers in to gaze     ive left my legal friend outside      you well remember i am sure     when first your wealth began to go     and people sneered at one so poor     i never used my peter so     and when youd lost your little all     and found yourself a thing despised     i need not ask you to recall     how tenderly i sympathised      then the advice ive poured on you     so full of wisdom and of wit     all given gratis though tis true     i might have fairly charged for it     but i refrain from mentioning     full many a deed i might relate     for boasting is a kind of thing     that i particularly hate  imagei will lend you fifty more      how vast the total sum appears     of all the kindnesses ive done     from childhoods halfforgotten years     down to that loan of april one     that fifty pounds  you little guessed     how deep it drained my slender store     but theres a heart within this breast     and i will lend you fifty more      not so was peters mild reply     his cheeks all wet with grateful tears     no man recalls so well as i     your services in bygone years     and this new offer i admit     is very very kindly meant     still to avail myself of it     would not be quite convenient  youll see in a moment what the difference is between convenient and inconvenient you quite understand it now dont you he added looking kindly at bruno who was sitting at sylvies side on the floor  yes said bruno very quietly  such a short speech was very unusual for him but just then he seemed i fancied a little exhausted in fact he climbed up into sylvies lap as he spoke and rested his head against her shoulder  what a many verses it was he whispered   chapter 12  a musical gardener  the other professor regarded him with some anxiety  the smaller animal ought to go to bed at once he said with an air of authority  why at once said the professor  because he cant go at twice said the other professor  the professor gently clapped his hands  isnt he wonderful he said to sylvie  nobody else could have thought of the reason so quick why of course he cant go at twice  it would hurt him to be divided  this remark woke up bruno suddenly and completely i dont want to be divided he said decisively  it does very well on a diagram said the other professor i could show it you in a minute only the chalks a little blunt  take care  sylvie anxiously exclaimed as he began rather clumsily to point it  youll cut your finger off if you hold the knife so  if oo cuts it off will oo give it to me please  bruno thoughtfully added  its like this said the other professor hastily drawing a long line upon the black board and marking the letters a b at the two ends and c in the middle let me explain it to you  if ab were to be divided into two parts at c  it would be drownded bruno pronounced confidently  the other professor gasped  what would be drownded  why the bumblebee of course said bruno  and the two bits would sink down in the sea  here the professor interfered as the other professor was evidently too much puzzled to go on with his diagram  when i said it would hurt him i was merely referring to the action of the nerves  the other professor brightened up in a moment  the action of the nerves he began eagerly is curiously slow in some people i had a friend once that if you burnt him with a redhot poker it would take years and years before he felt it  and if you only pinched him queried sylvie  then it would take ever so much longer of course  in fact i doubt if the man himself would ever feel it at all  his grandchildren might  i wouldnt like to be the grandchild of a pinched grandfather would you mister sir  bruno whispered  it might come just when you wanted to be happy  that would be awkward i admitted taking it quite as a matter of course that he had so suddenly caught sight of me  but dont you always want to be happy bruno  not always bruno said thoughtfully  sometimes when is too happy i wants to be a little miserable  then i just tell sylvie about it oo know and sylvie sets me some lessons  then its all right  im sorry you dont like lessons i said  you should copy sylvie  shes always as busy as the day is long  well so am i said bruno  no no  sylvie corrected him  youre as busy as the day is short  well whats the difference  bruno asked  mister sir isnt the day as short as its long  i mean isnt it the same length  never having considered the question in this light i suggested that they had better ask the professor and they ran off in a moment to appeal to their old friend  the professor left off polishing his spectacles to consider  my dears he said after a minute the day is the same length as anything that is the same length as it and he resumed his neverending task of polishing  the children returned slowly and thoughtfully to report his answer isnt he wise  sylvie asked in an awestruck whisper  if i was as wise as that i should have a headache all day long  i know i should  you appear to be talking to somebodythat isnt here the professor said turning round to the children  who is it  bruno looked puzzled  i never talks to nobody when he isnt here he replied  it isnt good manners  oo should always wait till he comes before oo talks to him  the professor looked anxiously in my direction and seemed to look through and through me without seeing me  then who are you talking to he said  there isnt anybody here you know except the other professor and he isnt here he added wildly turning round and round like a teetotum children  help to look for him  quick  hes got lost again  the children were on their feet in a moment  where shall we look said sylvie  anywhere shouted the excited professor  only be quick about it and he began trotting round and round the room lifting up the chairs and shaking them  bruno took a very small book out of the bookcase opened it and shook it in imitation of the professor  he isnt here he said  he cant be there bruno  sylvie said indignantly  course he cant said bruno  i should have shooked him out if hed been in there  has he ever been lost before  sylvie enquired turning up a corner of the hearthrug and peeping under it  once before said the professor he once lost himself in a wood  and couldnt he find hisself again said bruno  why didnt he shout  hed be sure to hear hisself cause he couldnt be far off oo know  lets try shouting said the professor  what shall we shout said sylvie  on second thoughts dont shout the professor replied the vicewarden might hear you  hes getting awfully strict  this reminded the poor children of all the troubles about which they had come to their old friend bruno sat down on the floor and began crying  he is so cruel he sobbed  and he lets uggug take away all my toys  and such horrid meals  what did you have for dinner today said the professor  a little piece of a dead crow was brunos mournful reply  he means rookpie sylvie explained  it were a dead crow bruno persisted  and there were a applepudding and uggug ate it alland i got nuffin but a crust  and i asked for a orangeanddidnt get it  and the poor little fellow buried his face in sylvies lap who kept gently stroking his hairas she went on its all true professor dear  they do treat my darling bruno very badly and theyre not kind to me either she added in a lower tone as if that were a thing of much less importance  the professor got out a large red silk handkerchief and wiped his eyes i wish i could help you dear children he said  but what can i do  we know the way to fairylandwhere fathers gonequite well said sylvie if only the gardener would let us out  wont he open the door for you said the professor  not for us said sylvie but im sure he would for you do come and ask him professor dear  ill come this minute said the professor  bruno sat up and dried his eyes  isnt he kind mister sir  he is indeed said i  but the professor took no notice of my remark he had put on a beautiful cap with a long tassel and was selecting one of the other professors walkingsticks from a stand in the corner of the room  a thick stick in ones hand makes people respectful he was saying to himself come along dear children  and we all went out into the garden together  i shall address him first of all the professor explained as we went along with a few playful remarks on the weather  i shall then question him about the other professor  this will have a double advantage  first it will open the conversation you cant even drink a bottle of wine without opening it first and secondly if hes seen the other professor we shall find him that way and if he hasnt we shant  on our way we passed the target at which uggug had been made to shoot during the ambassadors visit  see said the professor pointing out a hole in the middle of the bullseye  his imperial fatness had only one shot at it and he went in just here  bruno carefully examined the hole  couldnt go in there he whispered to me  he are too fat  we had no sort of difficulty in finding the gardener  though he was hidden from us by some trees that harsh voice of his served to direct us and as we drew nearer the words of his song became more and more plainly audible      he thought he saw an albatross     that fluttered round the lamp     he looked again and found it was     a pennypostagestamp     youd best be getting home he said     the nights are very damp  imagehe thought he saw an albatross  would it be afraid of catching cold said bruno  if it got very damp sylvie suggested it might stick to something you know  and that somefin would have to go by the post what ever it was bruno eagerly exclaimed  suppose it was a cow  wouldnt it be dreadful for the other things  and all these things happened to him said the professor thats what makes the song so interesting  he must have had a very curious life said sylvie  you may say that the professor heartily rejoined  of course she may cried bruno  by this time we had come up to the gardener who was standing on one leg as usual and busily employed in watering a bed of flowers with an empty wateringcan  it hasnt got no water in it  bruno explained to him pulling his sleeve to attract his attention  its lighter to hold said the gardener  a lot of water in it makes ones arms ache and he went on with his work singing softly to himself  the nights are very damp  in digging things out of the ground which you probably do now and then the professor began in a loud voice in making things into heapswhich no doubt you often do and in kicking things about with one heelwhich you seem never to leave off doing have you ever happened to notice another professor something like me but different  never shouted the gardener so loudly and violently that we all drew back in alarm  there aint such a thing  we will try a less exciting topic the professor mildly remarked to the children  you were asking  we asked him to let us through the gardendoor said sylvie but he wouldnt but perhaps he would for you  the professor put the request very humbly and courteously  i wouldnt mind letting you out said the gardener  but i mustnt open the door for children  dyou think id disobey the rules not for oneandsixpence  the professor cautiously produced a couple of shillings  thatll do it the gardener shouted as he hurled the wateringcan across the flowerbed and produced a handful of keysone large one and a number of small ones  but look here professor dear whispered sylvie  he neednt open the door for us at all  we can go out with you  true dear child the professor thankfully replied as he replaced the coins in his pocket  that saves two shillings  and he took the childrens hands that they might all go out together when the door was opened  this however did not seem a very likely event though the gardener patiently tried all the small keys over and over again  at last the professor ventured on a gentle suggestion  why not try the large one  i have often observed that a door unlocks much more nicely with its own key  the very first trial of the large key proved a success the gardener opened the door and held out his hand for the money  the professor shook his head  you are acting by rule he explained in opening the door for me and now its open we are going out by rulethe rule of three  the gardener looked puzzled and let us go out but as he locked the door behind us we heard him singing thoughtfully to himself      he thought he saw a gardendoor     that opened with a key     he looked again and found it was     a double rule of three     and all its mystery he said     is clear as day to me  i shall now return said the professor when we had walked a few yards you see its impossible to read here for all my books are in the house  but the children still kept fast hold of his hands  do come with us sylvie entreated with tears in her eyes  well well said the goodnatured old man  perhaps ill come after you some day soon  but i must go back now  you see i left off at a comma and its so awkward not knowing how the sentence finishes besides youve got to go through dogland first and im always a little nervous about dogs but itll be quite easy to come as soon as ive completed my new inventionfor carrying onesself you know it wants just a little more working out  wont that be very tiring to carry yourself  sylvie enquired  well no my child  you see whatever fatigue one incurs by carrying one saves by being carried  goodbye dears  goodbye sir he added to my intense surprise giving my hand an affectionate squeeze  goodbye professor  i replied but my voice sounded strange and far away and the children took not the slightest notice of our farewell evidently they neither saw me nor heard me as with their arms lovingly twined round each other they marched boldly on   chapter 13  a visit to dogland  theres a house away there to the left said sylvie after we had walked what seemed to me about fifty miles  lets go and ask for a nights lodging  it looks a very comfable house bruno said as we turned into the road leading up to it  i doos hope the dogs will be kind to us i is so tired and hungry  a mastiff dressed in a scarlet collar and carrying a musket was pacing up and down like a sentinel in front of the entrance he started on catching sight of the children and came forwards to meet them keeping his musket pointed straight at bruno who stood quite still though he turned pale and kept tight hold of sylvies hand while the sentinel walked solemnly round and round them and looked at them from all points of view  imagethe mastiffsentinel  oobooh hooh boohooyah  he growled at last  woobah yahwah oobooh bow wahbah woobooyah  bow wow he asked bruno severely  of course bruno understood all this easily enough  all fairies understand doggeethat is doglanguage  but as you may find it a little difficult just at first i had better put it into english for you  humans i verily believe  a couple of stray humans what dog do you belong to  what do you want  we dont belong to a dog  bruno began in doggee peoples never belongs to dogs he whispered to sylvie  but sylvie hastily checked him for fear of hurting the mastiffs feelings  please we want a little food and a nights lodgingif theres room in the house she added timidly  sylvie spoke doggee very prettily but i think its almost better for you to give the conversation in english  the house indeed growled the sentinel  have you never seen a palace in your life  come along with me  his majesty must settle whats to be done with you  they followed him through the entrancehall down a long passage and into a magnificent saloon around which were grouped dogs of all sorts and sizes  two splendid bloodhounds were solemnly sitting up one on each side of the crownbearer  two or three bulldogswhom i guessed to be the bodyguard of the kingwere waiting in grim silence in fact the only voices at all plainly audible were those of two little dogs who had mounted a settee and were holding a lively discussion that looked very like a quarrel  lords and ladies in waiting and various court officials our guide gruffly remarked as he led us in  of me the courtiers took no notice whatever but sylvie and bruno were the subject of many inquisitive looks and many whispered remarks of which i only distinctly caught onemade by a slylooking dachshund to his friend bah wooh wahyah hoobah oobooh hah bah  shes not such a badlooking human is she  leaving the new arrivals in the centre of the saloon the sentinel advanced to a door at the further end of it which bore an inscription painted on it in doggee royal kennelscratch and yell  before doing this the sentinel turned to the children and said give me your names  wed rather not  bruno exclaimed pulling sylvie away from the door we want them ourselves come back sylvie  come quick  nonsense said sylvie very decidedly and gave their names in doggee  then the sentinel scratched violently at the door and gave a yell that made bruno shiver from head to foot  hooyah wah said a deep voice inside  thats doggee for come in  its the king himself the mastiff whispered in an awestruck tone take off your wigs and lay them humbly at his paws what we should call at his feet  sylvie was just going to explain very politely that really they couldnt perform that ceremony because their wigs wouldnt come off when the door of the royal kennel opened and an enormous newfoundland dog put his head out  bow wow was his first question  when his majesty speaks to you the sentinel hastily whispered to bruno you should prick up your ears  bruno looked doubtfully at sylvie  id rather not please he said it would hurt  imagethe dogking  it doesnt hurt a bit the sentinel said with some indignation look its like this  and he pricked up his ears like two railway signals  sylvie gently explained matters  im afraid we cant manage it she said in a low voice  im very sorry but our ears havent got the right she wanted to say machinery in doggee but she had forgotten the word and could only think of steamengine  the sentinel repeated sylvies explanation to the king  cant prick up their ears without a steamengine  his majesty exclaimed they must be curious creatures  i must have a look at them and he came out of his kennel and walked solemnly up to the children  what was the amazementnor to say the horror of the whole assembly when sylvie actually patted his majesty on the head while bruno seized his long ears and pretended to tie them together under his chin  the sentinel groaned aloud a beautiful greyhound who appeared to be one of the ladies in waitingfainted away and all the other courtiers hastily drew back and left plenty of room for the huge newfoundland to spring upon the audacious strangers and tear them limb from limb  onlyhe didnt  on the contrary his majesty actually smiled so far as a dog can smileand the other dogs couldnt believe their eyes but it was true all the same his majesty wagged his tail  yah hooh hahwooh that is well i never was the universal cry  his majesty looked round him severely and gave a slight growl which produced instant silence conduct my friends to the banquetinghall he said laying such an emphasis on my friends that several of the dogs rolled over helplessly on their backs and began to lick brunos feet  a procession was formed but i only ventured to follow as far as the door of the banquetinghall so furious was the uproar of barking dogs within  so i sat down by the king who seemed to have gone to sleep and waited till the children returned to say goodnight when his majesty got up and shook himself  time for bed he said with a sleepy yawn  the attendants will show you your room he added aside to sylvie and bruno  bring lights and with a dignified air he held out his paw for them to kiss  but the children were evidently not well practised in courtmanners sylvie simply stroked the great paw bruno hugged it the master of the ceremonies looked shocked  all this time dogwaiters in splendid livery were running up with lighted candles but as fast as they put them upon the table other waiters ran away with them so that there never seemed to be one for me though the master kept nudging me with his elbow and repeating i cant let you sleep here  youre not in bed you know  i made a great effort and just succeeded in getting out the words i know im not  im in an armchair  well forty winks will do you no harm the master said and left me i could scarcely hear his words and no wonder he was leaning over the side of a ship that was miles away from the pier on which i stood the ship passed over the horizon and i sank back into the armchair  the next thing i remember is that it was morning breakfast was just over sylvie was lifting bruno down from a high chair and saying to a spaniel who was regarding them with a most benevolent smile yes thank you weve had a very nice breakfast havent we bruno  there was too many bones in thebruno began but sylvie frowned at him and laid her finger on her lips for at this moment the travelers were waited on by a very dignified officer the headgrowler whose duty it was first to conduct them to the king to bid him farewell and then to escort them to the boundary of dogland  the great newfoundland received them most affably but instead of saying goodbye he startled the headgrowler into giving three savage growls by announcing that he would escort them himself  it is a most unusual proceeding your majesty the headgrowler exclaimed almost choking with vexation at being set aside for he had put on his best courtsuit made entirely of catskins for the occasion  i shall escort them myself his majesty repeated gently but firmly laying aside the royal robes and changing his crown for a small coronet and you may stay at home  i are glad  bruno whispered to sylvie when they had got well out of hearing  he were so welly cross  and he not only patted their royal escort but even hugged him round the neck in the exuberance of his delight  his majesty calmly wagged the royal tail  its quite a relief he said getting away from that palace now and then  royal dogs have a dull life of it i can tell you  would you mind this to sylvie in a low voice and looking a little shy and embarrassed would you mind the trouble of just throwing that stick for me to fetch  sylvie was too much astonished to do anything for a moment it sounded such a monstrous impossibility that a king should wish to run after a stick  but bruno was equal to the occasion and with a glad shout of hi then  fetch it good doggie he hurled it over a clump of bushes the next moment the monarch of dogland had bounded over the bushes and picked up the stick and came galloping back to the children with it in his mouth  bruno took it from him with great decision  beg for it he insisted and his majesty begged  paw commanded sylvie and his majesty gave his paw  in short the solemn ceremony of escorting the travelers to the boundaries of dogland became one long uproarious game of play  but business is business the dogking said at last  and i must go back to mine  i couldnt come any further he added consulting a dogwatch which hung on a chain round his neck not even if there were a cat insight  they took an affectionate farewell of his majesty and trudged on  that were a dear dog  bruno exclaimed  has we to go far sylvie is tired  not much further darling  sylvie gently replied  do you see that shining just beyond those trees im almost sure its the gate of fairyland  i know its all goldenfather told me so and so bright so bright she went on dreamily  it dazzles said bruno shading his eyes with one little hand while the other clung tightly to sylvies hand as if he were halfalarmed at her strange manner  for the child moved on as if walking in her sleep her large eyes gazing into the far distance and her breath coming and going in quick pantings of eager delight  i knew by some mysterious mental light that a great change was taking place in my sweet little friend for such i loved to think her and that she was passing from the condition of a mere outland sprite into the true fairynature  upon bruno the change came later but it was completed in both before they reached the golden gate through which i knew it would be impossible for me to follow  i could but stand outside and take a last look at the two sweet children ere they disappeared within and the golden gate closed with a bang  and with such a bang  it never will shut like any other cupboarddoor arthur explained  theres something wrong with the hinge  however heres the cake and wine  and youve had your forty winks  so you really must get off to bed old man  youre fit for nothing else  witness my hand arthur forester md  by this time i was wideawake again  not quite yet  i pleaded really im not sleepy now  and it isnt midnight yet  well i did want to say another word to you arthur replied in a relenting tone as he supplied me with the supper he had prescribed only i thought you were too sleepy for it tonight  we took our midnight meal almost in silence for an unusual nervousness seemed to have seized on my old friend  what kind of a night is it he asked rising and undrawing the windowcurtains apparently to change the subject for a minute i followed him to the window and we stood together looking out in silence  when i first spoke to you about arthur began after a long and embarrassing silence that is when we first talked about herfor i think it was you that introduced the subjectmy own position in life forbade me to do more than worship her from a distance and i was turning over plans for leaving this place finally and settling somewhere out of all chance of meeting her again that seemed to be my only chance of usefulness in life  would that have been wise  i said  to leave yourself no hope at all  there was no hope to leave arthur firmly replied though his eyes glittered with tears as he gazed upwards into the midnight sky from which one solitary star the glorious vega blazed out in fitful splendour through the driving clouds  she was like that star to me bright beautiful and pure but out of reach out of reach  he drew the curtains again and we returned to our places by the fireside  what i wanted to tell you was this he resumed  i heard this evening from my solicitor  i cant go into the details of the business but the upshot is that my worldly wealth is much more than i thought and i am or shall soon be in a position to offer marriage without imprudence to any lady even if she brought nothing  i doubt if there would be anything on her side the earl is poor i believe but i should have enough for both even if health failed  i wish you all happiness in your married life  i cried shall you speak to the earl tomorrow  not yet awhile said arthur  he is very friendly but i dare not think he means more than that as yet  and as foras for lady muriel try as i may i cannot read her feelings towards me  if there is love she is hiding it  no i must wait i must wait  i did not like to press any further advice on my friend whose judgment i felt was so much more sober and thoughtful than my own and we parted without more words on the subject that had now absorbed his thoughts nay his very life  the next morning a letter from my solicitor arrived summoning me to town on important business   chapter 14  fairysylvle  for a full month the business for which i had returned to london detained me there and even then it was only the urgent advice of my physician that induced me to leave it unfinished and pay another visit to elveston  arthur had written once or twice during the month but in none of his letters was there any mention of lady muriel  still i did not augur ill from his silence to me it looked like the natural action of a lover who even while his heart was singing she is mine would fear to paint his happiness in the cold phrases of a written letter but would wait to tell it by word of mouth  yes i thought i am to hear his song of triumph from his own lips  the night i arrived we had much to say on other matters and tired with the journey i went to bed early leaving the happy secret still untold  next day however as we chatted on over the remains of luncheon i ventured to put the momentous question  well old friend you have told me nothing of lady murielnor when the happy day is to be  the happy day arthur said looking unexpectedly grave is yet in the dim future  we need to knowor rather she needs to know me better i know her sweet nature thoroughly by this time but i dare not speak till i am sure that my love is returned  dont wait too long  i said gaily  faint heart never won fair lady  it is faint heart perhaps  but really i dare not speak just yet  but meanwhile i pleaded you are running a risk that perhaps you have not thought of  some other man  no said arthur firmly  she is heartwhole i am sure of that yet if she loves another better than me so be it  i will not spoil her happiness  the secret shall die with me  but she is my first and my only love  that is all very beautiful sentiment i said but it is not practical it is not like you      he either fears his fate too much     or his desert is small     who dares not put it to the touch     to win or lose it all  i dare not ask the question whether there is another he said passionately  it would break my heart to know it  yet is it wise to leave it unasked  you must not waste your life upon an if  i tell you i dare not may i find it out for you  i asked with the freedom of an old friend  no no he replied with a pained look  i entreat you to say nothing let it wait  as you please i said and judged it best to say no more just then but this evening i thought i will call on the earl  i may be able to see how the land lies without so much as saying a word  it was a very hot afternoontoo hot to go for a walk or do anything or else it wouldnt have happened i believe  in the first place i want to knowdear child who reads thiswhy fairies should always be teaching us to do our duty and lecturing us when we go wrong and we should never teach them anything  you cant mean to say that fairies are never greedy or selfish or cross or deceitful because that would be nonsense you know  well then dont you think they might be all the better for a little lecturing and punishing now and then  i really dont see why it shouldnt be tried and im almost sure that if you could only catch a fairy and put it in the corner and give it nothing but bread and water for a day or two youd find it quite an improved characterit would take down its conceit a little at all events  the next question is what is the best time for seeing fairies i believe i can tell you all about that  the first rule is that it must be a very hot daythat we may consider as settled and you must be just a little sleepybut not too sleepy to keep your eyes open mind  well and you ought to feel a littlewhat one may call fairyish the scotch call it eerie and perhaps thats a prettier word if you dont know what it means im afraid i can hardly explain it you must wait till you meet a fairy and then youll know  and the last rule is that the crickets should not be chirping i cant stop to explain that you must take it on trust for the present  so if all these things happen together you have a good chance of seeing a fairyor at least a much better chance than if they didnt  the first thing i noticed as i went lazily along through an open place in the wood was a large beetle lying struggling on its back and i went down upon one knee to help the poor thing to its feet again in some things you know you cant be quite sure what an insect would like for instance i never could quite settle supposing i were a moth whether i would rather be kept out of the candle or be allowed to fly straight in and get burntor again supposing i were a spider im not sure if i should be quite pleased to have my web torn down and the fly let loosebut i feel quite certain that if i were a beetle and had rolled over on my back i should always be glad to be helped up again  so as i was saying i had gone down upon one knee and was just reaching out a little stick to turn the beetle over when i saw a sight that made me draw back hastily and hold my breath for fear of making any noise and frightening the little creature a way  not that she looked as if she would be easily frightened she seemed so good and gentle that im sure she would never expect that any one could wish to hurt her  she was only a few inches high and was dressed in green so that you really would hardly have noticed her among the long grass and she was so delicate and graceful that she quite seemed to belong to the place almost as if she were one of the flowers  i may tell you besides that she had no wings i dont believe in fairies with wings and that she had quantities of long brown hair and large earnest brown eyes and then i shall have done all i can to give you an idea of her  imagefairysylvie  sylvie i found out her name afterwards had knelt down just as i was doing to help the beetle but it needed more than a little stick for her to get it on its legs again it was as much as she could do with both arms to roll the heavy thing over and all the while she was talking to it half scolding and half comforting as a nurse might do with a child that had fallen down  there there  you neednt cry so much about it  youre not killed yetthough if you were you couldnt cry you know and so its a general rule against crying my dear  and how did you come to tumble over  but i can see well enough how it wasi neednt ask you that walking over sandpits with your chin in the air as usual of course if you go among sandpits like that you must expect to tumble you should look  the beetle murmured something that sounded like i did look and sylvie went on again  but i know you didnt  you never do  you always walk with your chin upyoure so dreadfully conceited  well lets see how many legs are broken this time  why none of them i declare  and whats the good of having six legs my dear if you can only kick them all about in the air when you tumble  legs are meant to walk with you know  now dont begin putting out your wings yet ive more to say  go to the frog that lives behind that buttercupgive him my complimentssylvies complimentscan you say compliments  the beetle tried and i suppose succeeded  yes thats right  and tell him hes to give you some of that salve i left with him yesterday  and youd better get him to rub it in for you hes got rather cold hands but you mustnt mind that  i think the beetle must have shuddered at this idea for sylvie went on in a graver tone  now you neednt pretend to be so particular as all that as if you were too grand to be rubbed by a frog  the fact is you ought to be very much obliged to him  suppose you could get nobody but a toad to do it how would you like that  there was a little pause and then sylvie added now you may go be a good beetle and dont keep your chin in the air and then began one of those performances of humming and whizzing and restless banging about such as a beetle indulges in when it has decided on flying but hasnt quite made up its mind which way to go  at last in one of its awkward zigzags it managed to fly right into my face and by the time i had recovered from the shock the little fairy was gone  i looked about in all directions for the little creature but there was no trace of herand my eerie feeling was quite gone off and the crickets were chirping again merrilyso i knew she was really gone  and now ive got time to tell you the rule about the crickets they always leave off chirping when a fairy goes bybecause a fairys a kind of queen over them i supposeat all events its a much grander thing than a cricketso whenever youre walking out and the crickets suddenly leave off chirping you may be sure that they see a fairy  i walked on sadly enough you may be sure  however i comforted myself with thinking its been a very wonderful afternoon so far  ill just go quietly on and look about me and i shouldnt wonder if i were to come across another fairy somewhere  peering about in this way i happened to notice a plant with rounded leaves and with queer little holes cut in the middle of several of them  ah the leafcutter bee  i carelessly remarkedyou know i am very learned in natural history for instance i can always tell kittens from chickens at one glanceand i was passing on when a sudden thought made me stoop down and examine the leaves  then a little thrill of delight ran through me for i noticed that the holes were all arranged so as to form letters there were three leaves side by side with b r and u marked on them and after some search i found two more which contained an n and an o  and then all in a moment a flash of inner light seemed to illumine a part of my life that had all but faded into oblivionthe strange visions i had experienced during my journey to elveston and with a thrill of delight i thought those visions are destined to be linked with my waking life  by this time the eerie feeling had come back again and i suddenly observed that no crickets were chirping so i felt quite sure that bruno was somewhere very near  and so indeed he wasso near that i had very nearly walked over him without seeing him which would have been dreadful always supposing that fairies can be walked over my own belief is that they are something of the nature of willothewisps and theres no walking over them  think of any pretty little boy you know with rosy cheeks large dark eyes and tangled brown hair and then fancy him made small enough to go comfortably into a coffeecup and youll have a very fair idea of him  whats your name little one  i began in as soft a voice as i could manage  and by the way why is it we always begin by asking little children their names  is it because we fancy a name will help to make them a little bigger  you never thought of as king a real large man his name now did you but however that may be i felt it quite necessary to know his name so as he didnt answer my question i asked it again a little louder  whats your name my little man  whats oors he said without looking up  i told him my name quite gently for he was much too small to be angry with  duke of anything he asked just looking at me for a moment and then going on with his work  not duke at all i said a little ashamed of having to confess it  oore big enough to be two dukes said the little creature i suppose oore sir something then  no i said feeling more and more ashamed  i havent got any title  the fairy seemed to think that in that case i really wasnt worth the trouble of talking to for he quietly went on digging and tearing the flowers to pieces  after a few minutes i tried again  please tell me what your name is  bruno the little fellow answered very readily  why didnt oo say please before  thats something like what we used to be taught in the nursery i thought to myself looking back through the long years about a hundred of them since you ask the question to the time when i was a little child  and here an idea came into my head and i asked him arent you one of the fairies that teach children to be good  well we have to do that sometimes said bruno and a dreadful bother it is as he said this he savagely tore a heartsease in two and trampled on the pieces  what are you doing there bruno  i said  spoiling sylvies garden was all the answer bruno would give at first  but as he went on tearing up the flowers he muttered to himself the nasty cross thing wouldnt let me go and play this morningsaid i must finish my lessons firstlessons indeed ill vex her finely though  oh bruno you shouldnt do that  i cried  dont you know thats revenge  and revenge is a wicked cruel dangerous thing  riveredge said bruno  what a funny word  i suppose oo call it cruel and dangerous cause if oo wented too far and tumbleded in ood get drownded  no not riveredge i explained revenge saying the word very slowly  but i couldnt help thinking that brunos explanation did very well for either word  oh said bruno opening his eyes very wide but without trying to repeat the word  come  try and pronounce it bruno  i said cheerfully  revenge revenge  but bruno only tossed his little head and said he couldnt that his mouth wasnt the right shape for words of that kind  and the more i laughed the more sulky the little fellow got about it  well never mind my little man  i said  shall i help you with that job  yes please bruno said quite pacified  only i wiss i could think of somefin to vex her more than this oo dont know how hard it is to make her angry  now listen to me bruno and ill teach you quite a splendid kind of revenge  somefin thatll vex her finely he asked with gleaming eyes  something that will vex her finely  first well get up all the weeds in her garden  see there are a good many at this end quite hiding the flowers  but that wont vex her said bruno  after that i said without noticing the remark well water this highest bedup here  you see its getting quite dry and dusty  bruno looked at me inquisitively but he said nothing this time  then after that i went on the walks want sweeping a bit and i think you might cut down that tall nettleits so close to the garden that its quite in the way  what is oo talking about  bruno impatiently interrupted me all that wont vex her a bit  wont it  i said innocently  then after that suppose we put in some of these coloured pebblesjust to mark the divisions between the different kinds of flowers you know  thatll have a very pretty effect  bruno turned round and had another good stare at me  at last there came an odd little twinkle into his eyes and he said with quite a new meaning in his voice thatll do nicely  lets put em in rows all the red together and all the blue together    thatll do capitally i said and thenwhat kind of flowers does sylvie like best  bruno had to put his thumb in his mouth and consider a little before he could answer  violets he said at last  theres a beautiful bed of violets down by the brook  oh lets fetch em cried bruno giving a little skip into the air here  catch hold of my hand and ill help oo along  the grass is rather thick down that way  i couldnt help laughing at his having so entirely forgotten what a big creature he was talking to  no not yet bruno i said we must consider whats the right thing to do first  you see weve got quite a business before us  yes lets consider said bruno putting his thumb into his mouth again and sitting down upon a dead mouse  what do you keep that mouse for  i said  you should either bury it or else throw it into the brook  why its to measure with cried bruno  how ever would oo do a garden without one  we make each bed three mouses and a half long and two mouses wide  i stopped him as he was dragging it off by the tail to show me how it was used for i was half afraid the eerie feeling might go off before we had finished the garden and in that case i should see no more of him or sylvie  i think the best way will be for you to weed the beds while i sort out these pebbles ready to mark the walks with  thats it cried bruno  and ill tell oo about the caterpillars while we work  ah lets hear about the caterpillars i said as i drew the pebbles together into a heap and began dividing them into colours  and bruno went on in a low rapid tone more as if he were talking to himself  yesterday i saw two little caterpillars when i was sitting by the brook just where oo go into the wood  they were quite green and they had yellow eyes and they didnt see me  and one of them had got a moths wing to carrya great brown moths wing oo know all dry with feathers  so he couldnt want it to eat i should thinkperhaps he meant to make a cloak for the winter  perhaps i said for bruno had twisted up the last word into a sort of question and was looking at me for an answer  one word was quite enough for the little fellow and he went on merrily  well and so he didnt want the other caterpillar to see the moths wing oo knowso what must he do but try to carry it with all his left legs and he tried to walk on the other set  of course he toppled over after that  after what  i said catching at the last word for to tell the truth i hadnt been attending much  he toppled over bruno repeated very gravely and if oo ever saw a caterpillar topple over ood know its a welly serious thing and not sit grinning like thatand i shant tell oo no more  indeed and indeed bruno i didnt mean to grin  see im quite grave again now  but bruno only folded his arms and said dont tell me i see a little twinkle in one of oor eyesjust like the moon  why do you think im like the moon bruno  i asked  oor face is large and round like the moon bruno answered looking at me thoughtfully  it doosnt shine quite so brightbut its more cleaner  i couldnt help smiling at this  you know i sometimes wash my face bruno  the moon never does that  oh doosnt she though cried bruno and he leant forwards and added in a solemn whisper the moons face gets dirtier and dirtier every night till its black all across  and then when its dirty all overso he passed his hand across his own rosy cheeks as he spoke then she washes it  then its all clean again isnt it  not all in a moment said bruno  what a deal of teaching oo wants she washes it little by littleonly she begins at the other edge oo know  by this time he was sitting quietly on the dead mouse with his arms folded and the weeding wasnt getting on a bit so i had to say work first pleasure afterwards no more talking till that beds finished   chapter 15  brunos revenge  after that we had a few minutes of silence while i sorted out the pebbles and amused myself with watching brunos plan of gardening it was quite a new plan to me he always measured each bed before he weeded it as if he was afraid the weeding would make it shrink and once when it came out longer than he wished he set to work to thump the mouse with his little fist crying out there now  its all gone wrong again  why dont oo keep oor tail straight when i tell oo  ill tell you what ill do bruno said in a halfwhisper as we worked  oo like fairies dont oo  yes i said of course i do or i shouldnt have come here i should have gone to some place where there are no fairies  bruno laughed contemptuously  why oo might as well say ood go to some place where there wasnt any airsupposing oo didnt like air  this was a rather difficult idea to grasp  i tried a change of subject youre nearly the first fairy i ever saw  have you ever seen any people besides me  plenty said bruno  we seeem when we walk in the road  but they cant see you  how is it they never tread on you  cant tread on us said bruno looking amused at my ignorance why suppose oore walking hereso making little marks on the ground and suppose theres a fairythats mewalking here  very well then oo put one foot here and one foot here so oo doosnt tread on the fairy  this was all very well as an explanation but it didnt convince me why shouldnt i put one foot on the fairy  i asked  i dont know why the little fellow said in a thoughtful tone but i know oo wouldnt  nobody never walked on the top of a fairy now ill tell oo what ill do as oore so fond of fairies ill get oo an invitation to the fairykings dinnerparty i know one of the headwaiters  i couldnt help laughing at this idea do the waiters invite the guests  i asked  oh not to sit down  bruno said  but to wait at table ood like that wouldnt oo  to hand about plates and so on  well but thats not so nice as sitting at the table is it  of course it isnt bruno said in a tone as if he rather pitied my ignorance but if oore not even sir anything oo cant expect to be allowed to sit at the table oo know  i said as meekly as i could that i didnt expect it but it was the only way of going to a dinnerparty that i really enjoyed  and bruno tossed his head and said in a rather offended tone that i might do as i pleasedthere were many he knew that would give their ears to go  have you ever been yourself bruno  they invited me once last week bruno said very gravely it was to wash up the soupplatesno the cheeseplates i mean that was grand enough  and i waited at table  and i didnt hardly make only one mistake  what was it  i said  you neednt mind telling me  only bringing scissors to cut the beef with bruno said carelessly but the grandest thing of all was i fetched the king a glass of cider  that was grand  i said biting my lip to keep myself from laughing  wasnt it said bruno very earnestly  oo know it isnt every one thats had such an honour as that  this set me thinking of the various queer things we call an honour in this world but which after all havent a bit more honour in them than what bruno enjoyed when he took the king a glass of cider  i dont know how long i might not have dreamed on in this way if bruno hadnt suddenly roused me oh come here quick he cried in a state of the wildest excitement  catch hold of his other horn i cant hold him more than a minute  he was struggling desperately with a great snail clinging to one of its horns and nearly breaking his poor little back in his efforts to drag it over a blade of grass  i saw we should have no more gardening if i let this sort of thing go on so i quietly took the snail away and put it on a bank where he couldnt reach it  well hunt it afterwards bruno i said if you really want to catch it  but whats the use of it when youve got it  whats the use of a fox when oove got it said bruno i know oo big things hunt foxes  i tried to think of some good reason why big things should hunt foxes and he should not hunt snails but none came into my head so i said at last well i suppose ones as good as the other ill go snailhunting myself some day  i should think oo wouldnt be so silly said bruno as to go snailhunting by oorself  why ood never get the snail along if oo hadnt somebody to hold on to his other horn  of course i shant go alone i said quite gravely  by the way is that the best kind to hunt or do you recommend the ones without shells  oh no we never hunt the ones without shells bruno said with a little shudder at the thought of it theyre always so cross about it and then if oo tumbles over them theyre ever so sticky  by this time we had nearly finished the garden  i had fetched some violets and bruno was just helping me to put in the last when he suddenly stopped and said im tired  rest then i said i can go on without you quite well  bruno needed no second invitation he at once began arranging the dead mouse as a kind of sofa and ill sing oo a little song he said as he rolled it about  do said i i like songs very much  which song will oo choose  bruno said as he dragged the mouse into a place where he could get a good view of me  ting ting ting is the nicest  there was no resisting such a strong hint as this however i pretended to think about it for a moment and then said well i like ting ting ting best of all  imagebrunos revenge  that shows oore a good judge of music bruno said with a pleased look how many harebells would oo like  and he put his thumb into his mouth to help me to consider  as there was only one cluster of harebells within easy reach i said very gravely that i thought one would do this time and i picked it and gave it to him  bruno ran his hand once or twice up and down the flowers like a musician trying an instrument producing a most delicious delicate tinkling as he did so  i had never heard flowermusic beforei dont think one can unless ones in the eerie state and i dont know quite how to give you an idea of what it was like except by saying that it sounded like a peal of bells a thousand miles off  when he had satisfied himself that the flowers were in tune he seated himself on the dead mouse he never seemed really comfortable anywhere else and looking up at me with a merry twinkle in his eyes he began  by the way the tune was rather a curious one and you might like to try it for yourself so here are the notes  imagemusic for harebells      rise oh rise  the daylight dies      the owls are hooting ting ting ting      wake oh wake  beside the lake      the elves are fluting ting ting ting      welcoming our fairy king      we sing sing sing  he sang the first four lines briskly and merrily making the harebells chime in time with the music but the last two he sang quite slowly and gently and merely waved the flowers backwards and forwards  then he left off to explain  the fairyking is oberon and he lives across the lakeand sometimes he comes in a little boatand we go and meet him and then we sing this song you know  and then you go and dine with him  i said mischievously  oo shouldnt talk bruno hastily said it interrupts the song so  i said i wouldnt do it again  i never talk myself when im singing he went on very gravely so oo shouldnt either then he tuned the harebells once more and sang      hear oh hear  from far and near     the music stealing ting ting ting     fairy belts adown the dells     are merrily pealing ting ting ting     welcoming our fairy king     we ring ring ring      see oh see  on every tree     what lamps are shining ting ting ting     they are eyes of fiery flies     to light our dining ting ting ting     welcoming our fairy king     they swing swing swing      haste oh haste to take and taste     the dainties waiting ting ting ting     honeydew is stored  hush bruno  i interrupted in a warning whisper  shes coming  bruno checked his song and as she slowly made her way through the long grass he suddenly rushed out headlong at her like a little bull shouting look the other way  look the other way  which way  sylvie asked in rather a frightened tone as she looked round in all directions to see where the danger could be  that way said bruno carefully turning her round with her face to the wood  now walk backwards walk gentlydont be frightened oo shant trip  but sylvie did trip notwithstanding in fact he led her in his hurry across so many little sticks and stones that it was really a wonder the poor child could keep on her feet at all  but he was far too much excited to think of what he was doing  i silently pointed out to bruno the best place to lead her to so as to get a view of the whole garden at once it was a little rising ground about the height of a potato and when they had mounted it i drew back into the shade that sylvie mightnt see me  i heard bruno cry out triumphantly now oo may look and then followed a clapping of hands but it was all done by bruno himself  sylvie was silentshe only stood and gazed with her hands clasped together and i was half afraid she didnt like it after all  bruno too was watching her anxiously and when she jumped down off the mound and began wandering up and down the little walks he cautiously followed her about evidently anxious that she should form her own opinion of it all without any hint from him  and when at last she drew a long breath and gave her verdictin a hurried whisper and without the slightest regard to grammar its the loveliest thing as i never saw in all my life before the little fellow looked as well pleased as if it had been given by all the judges and juries in england put together  and did you really do it all by yourself bruno said sylvie and all for me  i was helped a bit bruno began with a merry little laugh at her surprise  weve been at it all the afternooni thought ood like and here the poor little fellows lip began to quiver and all in a moment he burst out crying and running up to sylvie he flung his arms passionately round her neck and hid his face on her shoulder  there was a little quiver in sylvies voice too as she whispered why whats the matter darling and tried to lift up his head and kiss him  but bruno only clung to her sobbing and wouldnt be comforted till he had confessed  i triedto spoil oor gardenfirstbut ill never never and then came another burst of tears which drowned the rest of the sentence  at last he got out the words i likedputting in the flowersfor oo sylvie and i never was so happy before and the rosy little face came up at last to be kissed all wet with tears as it was  sylvie was crying too by this time and she said nothing but bruno dear and i never was so happy before though why these two children who had never been so happy before should both be crying was a mystery to me  i felt very happy too but of course i didnt cry big things never do you know we leave all that to the fairies  only i think it must have been raining a little just then for i found a drop or two on my cheeks  after that they went through the whole garden again flower by flower as if it were a long sentence they were spelling out with kisses for commas and a great hug by way of a fullstop when they got to the end  doos oo know that was my riveredge sylvie  bruno solemnly began  sylvie laughed merrily  what do you mean she said  and she pushed back her heavy brown hair with both hands and looked at him with dancing eyes in which the big teardrops were still glittering  bruno drew in a long breath and made up his mouth for a great effort i mean revenge he said now oo undertand and he looked so happy and proud at having said the word right at last that i quite envied him i rather think sylvie didnt undertand at all but she gave him a little kiss on each cheek which seemed to do just as well  so they wandered off lovingly together in among the buttercups each with an arm twined round the other whispering and laughing as they went and never so much as once looked back at poor me yes once just before i quite lost sight of them bruno half turned his head and nodded me a saucy little goodbye over one shoulder  and that was all the thanks i got for my trouble  the very last thing i saw of them was this sylvie was stooping down with her arms round brunos neck and saying coaxingly in his ear do you know bruno ive quite forgotten that hard word  do say it once more come  only this once dear  but bruno wouldnt try it again   chapter 16  a changed crocodile  the marvellousthe mysterioushad quite passed out of my life for the moment and the commonplace reigned supreme  i turned in the direction of the earls house as it was now the witching hour of five and i knew i should find them ready for a cup of tea and a quiet chat  lady muriel and her father gave me a delightfully warm welcome they were not of the folk we meet in fashionable drawingrooms who conceal all such feelings as they may chance to possess beneath the impenetrable mask of a conventional placidity  the man with the iron mask was no doubt a rarity and a marvel in his own age in modern london no one would turn his head to give him a second look  no these were real people when they looked pleased it meant that they were pleased and when lady muriel said with a bright smile im very glad to see you again i knew that it was true  still i did not venture to disobey the injunctionscrazy as i felt them to beof the lovesick young doctor by so much as alluding to his existence and it was only after they had given me full details of a projected picnic to which they invited me that lady muriel exclaimed almost as an afterthought and do if you can bring doctor forester with you  im sure a day in the country would do him good im afraid he studies too much  it was on the tip of my tongue to quote the words his only books are womans looks but i checked myself just in timewith something of the feeling of one who has crossed a street and has been all but run over by a passing hansom  and i think he has too lonely a life she went on with a gentle earnestness that left no room whatever to suspect a double meaning do get him to come  and dont forget the day tuesday week  we can drive you over  it would be a pity to go by rail there is so much pretty scenery on the road  and our open carriage just holds four  oh ill persuade him to come  i said with confidencethinking it would take all my powers of persuasion to keep him away  the picnic was to take place in ten days and though arthur readily accepted the invitation i brought him nothing that i could say would induce him to calleither with me or without me on the earl and his daughter in the meanwhile  no he feared to  wear out his welcome he said they had seen enough of him for one while and when at last the day for the expedition arrived he was so childishly nervous and uneasy that i thought it best so to arrange our plans that we should go separately to the housemy intention being to arrive some time after him so as to give him time to get over a meeting  with this object i purposely made a considerable circuit on my way to the hall as we called the earls house and if i could only manage to lose my way a bit i thought to myself that would suit me capitally  in this i succeeded better and sooner than i had ventured to hope for the path through the wood had been made familiar to me by many a solitary stroll in my former visit to elveston and how i could have so suddenly and so entirely lost iteven though i was so engrossed in thinking of arthur and his ladylove that i heeded little elsewas a mystery to me  and this open place i said to myself seems to have some memory about it i cannot distinctly recallsurely it is the very spot where i saw those fairychildren  but i hope there are no snakes about  i mused aloud taking my seat on a fallen tree  i certainly do not like snakesand i dont suppose bruno likes them either  no he doesnt like them said a demure little voice at my side hes not afraid of them you know but he doesnt like them he says theyre too waggly  words fail me to describe the beauty of the little groupcouched on a patch of moss on the trunk of the fallen tree that met my eager gaze sylvie reclining with her elbow buried in the moss and her rosy cheek resting in the palm of her hand and bruno stretched at her feet with his head in her lap  imagefairies resting  too waggly was all i could say in so sudden an emergency  im not praticular bruno said carelessly but i do like straight animals best  but you like a dog when it wags its tail sylvie interrupted you know you do bruno  but theres more of a dog isnt there mister sir  bruno appealed to me you wouldnt like to have a dog if it hadnt got nuffin but a head and a tail  i admitted that a dog of that kind would be uninteresting  there isnt such a dog as that sylvie thoughtfully remarked  but there would be cried bruno if the professor shortened it up for us  shortened it up  i said  thats something new  how does he do it  hes got a curious machine sylvie was beginning to explain  a welly curious machine bruno broke in not at all willing to have the story thus taken out of his mouth and if oo puts insomefinoruvverat one end oo know and he turns the handleand it comes out at the uvver end oh ever so short  as short as short  sylvie echoed  and one day when we was in outland oo knowbefore we came to fairyland me and sylvie took him a big crocodile  and he shortened it up for us  and it did look so funny  and it kept looking round and saying wherever is the rest of me got to and then its eyes looked unhappy  not both its eyes sylvie interrupted  course not said the little fellow  only the eye that couldnt see wherever the rest of it had got to but the eye that could see wherever  how short was the crocodile  i asked as the story was getting a little complicated  half as short again as when we caught it so long said bruno spreading out his arms to their full stretch  i tried to calculate what this would come to but it was too hard for me please make it out for me dear child who reads this  but you didnt leave the poor thing so short as that did you  well no  sylvie and me took it back again and we got it stretched totohow much was it sylvie  two times and a half and a little bit more said sylvie  it wouldnt like that better than the other way im afraid  oh but it did though  bruno put in eagerly  it were proud of its new tail  oo never saw a crocodile so proud  why it could go round and walk on the top of its tail and along its back all the way to its head  imagea changed crocodile  not quite all the way said sylvie  it couldnt you know  ah but it did once  bruno cried triumphantly  oo werent lookingbut i watched it  and it walked on tippietytoe so as it wouldnt wake itself cause it thought it were asleep  and it got both its paws on its tail  and it walked and it walked all the way along its back  and it walked and it walked on its forehead and it walked a tiny little way down its nose  there now  this was a good deal worse than the last puzzle  please dear child help again  i dont believe no crocodile never walked along its own forehead sylvie cried too much excited by the controversy to limit the number of her negatives  oo dont know the reason why it did it bruno scornfully retorted it had a welly good reason  i heerd it say why shouldnt i walk on my own forehead so a course it did oo know  if thats a good reason bruno i said why shouldnt you get up that tree  shall in a minute said bruno soon as weve done talking only two peoples cant talk comfably togevver when ones getting up a tree and the other isnt  it appeared to me that a conversation would scarcely be comfable while trees were being climbed even if both the peoples were doing it but it was evidently dangerous to oppose any theory of brunos so i thought it best to let the question drop and to ask for an account of the machine that made things longer  this time bruno was at a loss and left it to sylvie its like a mangle she said if things are put in they get squoze  squeezeled  bruno interrupted  yes sylvie accepted the correction but did not attempt to pronounce the word which was evidently new to her  they getlike thatand they come out oh ever so long  once bruno began again sylvie and me writed  wrote  sylvie whispered  well we wroted a nurserysong and the professor mangled it longer for us  it were there was a little man and he had a little gun and the bullets  i know the rest i interrupted  but would you say it long i mean the way that it came out of the mangle  well get the professor to sing it for you said sylvie it would spoil it to say it  i would like to meet the professor i said  and i would like to take you all with me to see some friends of mine that live near here would you like to come  i dont think the professor would like to come said sylvie hes very shy  but wed like it very much  only wed better not come this size you know  the difficulty had occurred to me already and i had felt that perhaps there would be a slight awkwardness in introducing two such tiny friends into society  what size will you be  i enquired  wed better come ascommon children sylvie thoughtfully replied thats the easiest size to manage  could you come today  i said thinking then we could have you at the picnic  sylvie considered a little  not today she replied  we havent got the things ready  well come ontuesday next if you like and now really bruno you must come and do your lessons  i wiss oo wouldnt say really bruno the little fellow pleaded with pouting lips that made him look prettier than ever it always shows theres something horrid coming  and i wont kiss you if youre so unkind  ah but you have kissed me  sylvie exclaimed in merry triumph  well then ill unkiss you  and he threw his arms round her neck for this novel but apparently not very painful operation  its very like kissing  sylvie remarked as soon as her lips were again free for speech  oo dont know nuffin about it  it were just the conkery  bruno replied with much severity as he marched away  sylvie turned her laughing face to me  shall we come on tuesday she said  very well i said let it be tuesday next but where is the professor  did he come with you to fairyland  no said sylvie  but he promised hed come and see us some day hes getting his lecture ready so he has to stay at home  at home  i said dreamily not feeling quite sure what she had said  yes sir  his lordship and lady muriel are at home please to walk this way   chapter 17  the three badgers  still more dreamily i found myself following this imperious voice into a room where the earl his daughter and arthur were seated so youre come at last said lady muriel in a tone of playful reproach  i was delayed i stammered  though what it was that had delayed me i should have been puzzled to explain  luckily no questions were asked  the carriage was ordered round the hamper containing our contribution to the picnic was duly stowed away and we set forth  there was no need for me to maintain the conversation  lady muriel and arthur were evidently on those most delightful of terms where one has no need to check thought after thought as it rises to the lips with the fear this will not be appreciatedthis will give offence this will sound too seriousthis will sound flippant like very old friends in fullest sympathy their talk rippled on  why shouldnt we desert the picnic and go in some other direction she suddenly suggested  a party of four is surely selfsufficing and as for food our hamper  why shouldnt we  what a genuine ladys argument laughed arthur a lady never knows on which side the onus probandithe burden of provinglies  do men always know she asked with a pretty assumption of meek docility  with one exceptionthe only one i can think of dr watts who has asked the senseless question      why should i deprive my neighbour     of his goods against his will  fancy that as an argument for honesty  his position seems to be im only honest because i see no reason to steal and the thiefs answer is of course complete and crushing  i deprive my neighbour of his goods because i want them myself  and i do it against his will because theres no chance of getting him to consent to it  i can give you one other exception i said an argument i heard only todayand not by a lady why shouldnt i walk on my own forehead  what a curious subject for speculation said lady muriel turning to me with eyes brimming over with laughter  may we know who propounded the question  and did he walk on his own forehead  i cant remember who it was that said it  i faltered  nor where i heard it  whoever it was i hope we shall meet him at the picnic said lady muriel its a far more interesting question than isnt this a picturesque ruin arent those autumntints lovely i shall have to answer those two questions ten times at least this afternoon  thats one of the miseries of society said arthur  why cant people let one enjoy the beauties of nature without having to say so every minute  why should life be one long catechism  its just as bad at a picturegallery the earl remarked i went to the ra last may with a conceited young artist and he did torment me  i wouldnt have minded his criticizing the pictures himself but i had to agree with himor else to argue the point which would have been worse  it was depreciatory criticism of course said arthur  i dont see the of course at all  why did you ever know a conceited man dare to praise a picture the one thing he dreads next to not being noticed is to be proved fallible  if you once praise a picture your character for infallibility hangs by a thread  suppose its a figurepicture and you venture to say draws well somebody measures it and finds one of the proportions an eighth of an inch wrong  you are disposed of as a critic  did you say he draws well your friends enquire sarcastically while you hang your head and blush no  the only safe course if any one says draws well is to shrug your shoulders  draws well you repeat thoughtfully  draws well humph thats the way to become a great critic  thus airily chatting after a pleasant drive through a few miles of beautiful scenery we reached the rendezvousa ruined castlewhere the rest of the picnicparty were already assembled  we spent an hour or two in sauntering about the ruins gathering at last by common consent into a few random groups seated on the side of a mound which commanded a good view of the old castle and its surroundings  the momentary silence that ensued was promptly taken possession of or more correctly taken into custodyby a voice a voice so smooth so monotonous so sonorous that one felt with a shudder that any other conversation was precluded and that unless some desperate remedy were adopted we were fated to listen to a lecture of which no man could foresee the end  the speaker was a broadlybuilt man whose large flat pale face was bounded on the north by a fringe of hair on the east and west by a fringe of whisker and on the south by a fringe of beardthe whole constituting a uniform halo of stubbly whiteybrown bristles  his features were so entirely destitute of expression that i could not help saying to myselfhelplessly as if in the clutches of a nightmare they are only penciled in no final touches as yet  and he had a way of ending every sentence with a sudden smile which spread like a ripple over that vast blank surface and was gone in a moment leaving behind it such absolute solemnity that i felt impelled to murmur it was not he it was somebody else that smiled  do you observe such was the phrase with which the wretch began each sentence do you observe the way in which that broken arch at the very top of the ruin stands out against the clear sky  it is placed exactly right and there is exactly enough of it  a little more or a little less and all would be utterly spoiled  imagea lecture on art  oh gifted architect murmured arthur inaudibly to all but lady muriel and myself  foreseeing the exact effect his work would have when in ruins centuries after his death  and do you observe where those trees slope down the hill indicating them with a sweep of the hand and with all the patronising air of the man who has himself arranged the landscape how the mists rising from the river fill up exactly those intervals where we need indistinctness for artistic effect  here in the foreground a few clear touches are not amiss but a background without mist you know  it is simply barbarous  yes we need indistinctness  the orator looked so pointedly at me as he uttered these words that i felt bound to reply by murmuring something to the effect that i hardly felt the need myselfand that i enjoyed looking at a thing better when i could see it  quite so the great man sharply took me up  from your point of view that is correctly put  but for anyone who has a soul for art such a view is preposterous  nature is one thing  art is another nature shows us the world as it is  but artas a latin author tells usart you know the words have escaped my memory  ars est celare naturam arthur interposed with a delightful promptitude  quite so the orator replied with an air of relief  i thank you ars est celare naturam but that isnt it and for a few peaceful moments the orator brooded frowningly over the quotation  the welcome opportunity was seized and another voice struck into the silence  what a lovely old ruin it is cried a young lady in spectacles the very embodiment of the march of mind looking at lady muriel as the proper recipient of all really original remarks  and dont you admire those autumntints on the trees  i do intensely  lady muriel shot a meaning glance at me but replied with admirable gravity  oh yes indeed indeed  so true  and isnt strange said the young lady passing with startling suddenness from sentiment to science that the mere impact of certain coloured rays upon the retina should give us such exquisite pleasure  you have studied physiology then a certain young doctor courteously enquired  oh yes  isnt it a sweet science  arthur slightly smiled  it seems a paradox does it not he went on that the image formed on the retina should be inverted  it is puzzling she candidly admitted  why is it we do not see things upsidedown  you have never heard the theory then that the brain also is inverted  no indeed  what a beautiful fact  but how is it proved  thus replied arthur with all the gravity of ten professors rolled into one  what we call the vertex of the brain is really its base and what we call its base is really its vertex it is simply a question of nomenclature  this last polysyllable settled the matter  how truly delightful the fair scientist exclaimed with enthusiasm i shall ask our physiological lecturer why he never gave us that exquisite theory  id give something to be present when the question is asked  arthur whispered to me as at a signal from lady muriel we moved on to where the hampers had been collected and devoted ourselves to the more substantial business of the day  we waited on ourselves as the modern barbarism combining two good things in such a way as to secure the discomforts of both and the advantages of neither of having a picnic with servants to wait upon you had not yet reached this outoftheway regionand of course the gentlemen did not even take their places until the ladies had been duly provided with all imaginable creaturecomforts  then i supplied myself with a plate of something solid and a glass of something fluid and found a place next to lady muriel  it had been left vacantapparently for arthur as a distinguished stranger but he had turned shy and had placed himself next to the young lady in spectacles whose high rasping voice had already cast loose upon society such ominous phrases as man is a bundle of qualities the objective is only attainable through the subjective arthur was bearing it bravely but several faces wore a look of alarm and i thought it high time to start some less metaphysical topic  in my nursery days i began when the weather didnt suit for an outofdoors picnic we were allowed to have a peculiar kind that we enjoyed hugely  the table cloth was laid under the table instead of upon it we sat round it on the floor and i believe we really enjoyed that extremely uncomfortable kind of dinner more than we ever did the orthodox arrangement  ive no doubt of it lady muriel replied  theres nothing a wellregulated child hates so much as regularity i believe a really healthy boy would thoroughly enjoy greek grammar if only he might stand on his head to learn it  and your carpetdinner certainly spared you one feature of a picnic which is to me its chief drawback  the chance of a shower  i suggested  no the chanceor rather the certainty of live things occurring in combination with ones food  spiders are my bugbear  now my father has no sympathy with that sentimenthave you dear  for the earl had caught the word and turned to listen  to each his sufferings all are men he replied in the sweet sad tones that seemed natural to him each has his pet aversion  but youll never guess his  lady muriel said with that delicate silvery laugh that was music to my ears  i declined to attempt the impossible  he doesnt like snakes she said in a stage whisper  now isnt that an unreasonable aversion fancy not liking such a dear coaxingly clingingly affectionate creature as a snake  not like snakes  i exclaimed  is such a thing possible  no he doesnt like them she repeated with a pretty mockgravity hes not afraid of them you know  but he doesnt like them he says theyre too waggly  i was more startled than i liked to show  there was something so uncanny in this echo of the very words i had so lately heard from that little forestsprite that it was only by a great effort i succeeded in saying carelessly let us banish so unpleasant a topic  wont you sing us something lady muriel  i know you do sing without music  the only songs i knowwithout musicare desperately sentimental im afraid  are your tears all ready  quite ready  quite ready came from all sides and lady murielnot being one of those ladysingers who think it de rigueur to decline to sing till they have been petitioned three or four times and have pleaded failure of memory loss of voice and other conclusive reasons for silencebegan at once  imagethree badgers on a mossy stone       there be three badgers on a mossy stone      beside a dark and covered way      each dreams himself a monarch on his throne      and so they stay and stay      though their old father languishes alone      they stay and stay and stay       there be three herrings loitering around      longing to share that mossy seat      each herring tries to sing what she has found      that makes life seem so sweet      thus with a grating and uncertain sound      they bleat and bleat and bleat       the motherherring on the salt seawave      sought vainly for her absent ones      the fatherbadger writhing in a cave      shrieked out  return my sons      you shalt have buns he shrieked if youll behave      yea buns and buns and buns       i fear said she your sons have gone astray      my daughters left me while i slept      yes m the badger said its as you say      they should be better kept      thus the poor parents talked the time away      and wept and wept and wept  here bruno broke off suddenly  the herrings song wants anuvver tune sylvie he said  and i cant sing it not wizout oo plays it for me  imagethree badgers writhing in a cave  instantly sylvie seated herself upon a tiny mushroom that happened to grow in front of a daisy as if it were the most ordinary musical instrument in the world and played on the petals as if they were the notes of an organ  and such delicious tiny music it was such teenytiny music  bruno held his head on one side and listened very gravely for a few moments until he had caught the melody  then the sweet childish voice rang out once more       oh dear beyond our dearest dreams      fairer than all that fairest seems      to feast the rosy hours away      to revel in a roundelay      how blest would be      a life so free      ipwergispudding to consume      and drink the subtle azzigoom       and if in other days and hours      mid other fluffs and other flowers      the choice were given me how to dine      name what thou wilt it shalt be thine      oh then i see      the life for me      ipwergispudding to consume      and drink the subtle azzigoom  oo may leave off playing now sylvie  i can do the uvver tune much better wizout a compliment  he means without accompaniment sylvie whispered smiling at my puzzled look and she pretended to shut up the stops of the organ      the badgers did not care to talk to fish     they did not dote on herrings songs     they never had experienced the dish     to which that name belongs     and oh to pinch their tails this was their wish     with tongs yea tongs and tongs  i ought to mention that he marked the parenthesis in the air with his finger  it seemed to me a very good plan  you know theres no sound to represent itany more than there is for a question  suppose you have said to your friend you are better today and that you want him to understand that you are asking him a question what can be simpler than just to make a   in the air with your finger he would understand you in a moment  imagethose aged one waxed gay       and are not these the fish the eldest sighed      whose mother dwells beneath the foam      they are the fish the second one replied      and they have left their home      oh wicked fish the youngest badger cried      to roam yea roam and roam      gently the badgers trotted to the shore      the sandy shore that fringed the bay      each in his mouth a living herring bore      those aged ones waxed gay      clear rang their voices through the oceans roar      hooray hooray hooray  so they all got safe home again bruno said after waiting a minute to see if i had anything to say he evidently felt that some remark ought to be made  and i couldnt help wishing there were some such rule in society at the conclusion of a songthat the singer herself should say the right thing and not leave it to the audience  suppose a young lady has just been warbling with a grating and uncertain sound shelleys exquisite lyric i arise from dreams of thee how much nicer it would be instead of your having to say oh thank you thank you for the young lady herself to remark as she draws on her gloves while the impassioned words oh press it to thine own or it will break at last are still ringing in your ears but she wouldnt do it you know  so it did break at last  and i knew it would she added quietly as i started at the sudden crash of broken glass  youve been holding it sideways for the last minute and letting all the champagne run out  were you asleep i wonder  im so sorry my singing has such a narcotic effect   chapter 18  queer street number forty  lady muriel was the speaker  and for the moment that was the only fact i could clearly realise  but how she came to be there and how i came to be thereand how the glass of champagne came to be thereall these were questions which i felt it better to think out in silence and not commit myself to any statement till i understood things a little more clearly  first accumulate a mass of facts and then construct a theory that i believe is the true scientific method i sat up rubbed my eves and began to accumulate facts  a smooth grassy slope bounded at the upper end by venerable ruins half buried in ivy at the lower by a stream seen through arching treesa dozen gailydressed people seated in little groups here and theresome open hampersthe debris of a picnicsuch were the facts accumulated by the scientific researcher  and now what deep farreaching theory was he to construct from them  the researcher found himself at fault  yet stay  one fact had escaped his notice while all the rest were grouped in twos and in threes arthur was alone while all tongues were talking his was silent while all faces were gay his was gloomy and despondent  here was a fact indeed the researcher felt that a theory must be constructed without delay  lady muriel had just risen and left the party  could that be the cause of his despondency  the theory hardly rose to the dignity of a working hypothesis  clearly more facts were needed  the researcher looked round him once more and now the facts accumulated in such bewildering profusion that the theory was lost among them for lady muriel had gone to meet a strange gentleman just visible in the distance and now she was returning with him both of them talking eagerly and joyfully like old friends who have been long parted and now she was moving from group to group introducing the new hero of the hour and he young tall and handsome moved gracefully at her side with the erect bearing and firm tread of a soldier verily the theory looked gloomy for arthur  his eye caught mine and he crossed to me  he is very handsome i said  abominably handsome muttered arthur then smiled at his own bitter words  lucky no one heard me but you  doctor forester said lady muriel who had just joined us let me introduce to you my cousin eric lindon captain lindon i should say  arthur shook off his illtemper instantly and completely as he rose and gave the young soldier his hand  i have heard of you he said im very glad to make the acquaintance of lady muriels cousin  yes thats all im distinguished for as yet said eric so we soon got to call him with a winning smile  and i doubt glancing at lady muriel if it even amounts to a goodconductbadge but its something to begin with  you must come to my father eric said lady muriel  i think hes wandering among the ruins and the pair moved on  the gloomy look returned to arthurs face and i could see it was only to distract his thoughts that he took his place at the side of the metaphysical young lady and resumed their interrupted discussion  talking of herbert spencer he began do you really find no logical difficulty in regarding nature as a process of involution passing from definite coherent homogeneity to indefinite incoherent heterogeneity  amused as i was at the ingenious jumble he had made of spencers words i kept as grave a face as i could  no physical difficulty she confidently replied but i havent studied logic much  would you state the difficulty  well said arthur do you accept it as selfevident  is it as obvious for instance as that things that are greater than the same are greater than one another  to my mind she modestly replied it seems quite as obvious i grasp both truths by intuition  but other minds may need some logicali forget the technical terms  for a complete logical argument arthur began with admirable solemnity we need two prim misses  of course she interrupted  i remember that word now and they produce  a delusion said arthur  yees she said dubiously  i dont seem to remember that so well but what is the whole argument called  a sillygism  ah yes  i remember now  but i dont need a sillygism you know to prove that mathematical axiom you mentioned  nor to prove that all angles are equal i suppose  why of course not  one takes such a simple truth as that for granted  here i ventured to interpose and to offer her a plate of strawberries and cream  i felt really uneasy at the thought that she might detect the trick and i contrived unperceived by her to shake my head reprovingly at the pseudophilosopher  equally unperceived by her arthur slightly raised his shoulders and spread his hands abroad as who should say what else can i say to her and moved away leaving her to discuss her strawberries by involution or any other way she preferred  by this time the carriages that were to convey the revelers to their respective homes had begun to assemble outside the castlegrounds and it became evidentnow that lady muriels cousin had joined our party that the problem how to convey five people to elveston with a carriage that would only hold four must somehow be solved  the honorable eric lindon who was at this moment walking up and down with lady muriel might have solved it at once no doubt by announcing his intention of returning on foot  of this solution there did not seem to be the very smallest probability  the next best solution it seemed to me was that i should walk home and this i at once proposed  youre sure you dont mind said the earl  im afraid the carriage wont take us all and i dont like to suggest to eric to desert his cousin so soon  so far from minding it i said i should prefer it  it will give me time to sketch this beautiful old ruin  ill keep you company arthur suddenly said  and in answer to what i suppose was a look of surprise on my face he said in a low voice i really would rather  i shall be quite de trop in the carriage  i think ill walk too said the earl  youll have to be content with eric as your escort he added to lady muriel who had joined us while he was speaking  you must be as entertaining as cerberusthree gentlemen rolled into one lady muriel said to her companion  it will be a grand military exploit  a sort of forlorn hope the captain modestly suggested  you do pay pretty compliments laughed his fair cousin  good day to you gentlemen threeor rather deserters three  and the two young folk entered the carriage and were driven away  how long will your sketch take said arthur  well i said i should like an hour for it  dont you think you had better go without me  ill return by train  i know theres one in about an hours time  perhaps that would be best said the earl  the station is quite close  so i was left to my own devices and soon found a comfortable seat at the foot of a tree from which i had a good view of the ruins  it is a very drowsy day i said to myself idly turning over the leaves of the sketchbook to find a blank page  why i thought you were a mile off by this time  for to my surprise the two walkers were back again  i came back to remind you arthur said that the trains go every ten minutes  nonsense  i said  it isnt the metropolitan railway  it is the metropolitan railway the earl insisted  this is a part of kensington  why do you talk with your eyes shut said arthur  wake up  i think its the heat makes me so drowsy i said hoping but not feeling quite sure that i was talking sense  am i awake now  i think not the earl judicially pronounced  what do you think doctor  hes only got one eye open  and hes snoring like anything cried bruno  do wake up you dear old thing  and he and sylvie set to work rolling the heavy head from side to side as if its connection with the shoulders was a matter of no sort of importance  and at last the professor opened his eyes and sat up blinking at us with eyes of utter bewilderment would you have the kindness to mention he said addressing me with his usual oldfashioned courtesy whereabouts we are just now and who we are beginning with me  i thought it best to begin with the children  this is sylvie  sir and this is bruno  ah yes  i know them well enough the old man murmured  its myself im most anxious about and perhaps youll be good enough to mention at the same time how i got here  a harder problem occurs to me i ventured to say and that is how youre to get back again  true true the professor replied  thats the problem no doubt viewed as a problem outside of oneself it is a most interesting one viewed as a portion of ones own biography it is i must admit very distressing  he groaned but instantly added with a chuckle as to myself i think you mentioned that i am  oore the professor  bruno shouted in his ear  didnt oo know that oove come from outland  and its ever so far away from here  the professor leapt to his feet with the agility of a boy then theres no time to lose he exclaimed anxiously ill just ask this guileless peasant with his brace of buckets that contain apparently water if hell be so kind as to direct us guileless peasant he proceeded in a louder voice would you tell us the way to outland  the guileless peasant turned with a sheepish grin  hey was all he said  the waytooutland the professor repeated  the guileless peasant set down his buckets and considered  ah dunnot  i ought to mention the professor hastily put in that whatever you say will be used in evidence against you  the guileless peasant instantly resumed his buckets  then ah says nowt he answered briskly and walked away at a great pace  the children gazed sadly at the rapidly vanishing figure  he goes very quick the professor said with a sigh  but i know that was the right thing to say  ive studied your english laws  however lets ask this next man thats coming  he is not guileless and he is not a peasantbut i dont know that either point is of vital importance  it was in fact the honourable eric lindon who had apparently fulfilled his task of escorting lady muriel home and was now strolling leisurely up and down the road outside the house enjoying a solitary cigar  might i trouble you sir to tell us the nearest way to outland oddity as he was in outward appearance the professor was in that essential nature which no outward disguise could conceal a thorough gentleman  and as such eric lindon accepted him instantly  he took the cigar from his mouth and delicately shook off the ash while he considered the name sounds strange to me he said  i doubt if i can help you  it is not very far from fairyland the professor suggested  eric lindons eyebrows were slightly raised at these words and an amused smile which he courteously tried to repress flitted across his handsome face a trifle cracked he muttered to himself  but what a jolly old patriarch it is  then he turned to the children  and cant you help him little folk he said with a gentleness of tone that seemed to win their hearts at once surely you know all about it      how many miles to babylon     threescore miles and ten     can i get there by candlelight     yes and back again  to my surprise bruno ran forwards to him as if he were some old friend of theirs seized the disengaged hand and hung on to it with both of his own and there stood this tall dignified officer in the middle of the road gravely swinging a little boy to and fro while sylvie stood ready to push him exactly as if a real swing had suddenly been provided for their pastime  we dont want to get to babylon oo know  bruno explained as he swung  and it isnt candlelight its daylight  sylvie added giving the swing a push of extra vigour which nearly took the whole machine off its balance  by this time it was clear to me that eric lindon was quite unconscious of my presence  even the professor and the children seemed to have lost sight of me and i stood in the midst of the group as unconcernedly as a ghost seeing but unseen  how perfectly isochronous the professor exclaimed with enthusiasm he had his watch in his hand and was carefully counting brunos oscillations  he measures time quite as accurately as a pendulum imagehow perfectly isochronous  yet even pendulums the goodnatured young soldier observed as he carefully released his hand from brunos grasp are not a joy for ever  come thats enough for one bout little man next time we meet you shall have another  meanwhile youd better take this old gentleman to queer street number  well find it cried bruno eagerly as they dragged the professor away  we are much indebted to you the professor said looking over his shoulder  dont mention it replied the officer raising his hat as a parting salute  what number did you say the professor called from the distance  the officer made a trumpet of his two hands  forty he shouted in stentorian tones  and not piano by any means he added to himself its a mad world my masters a mad world  he lit another cigar and strolled on towards his hotel  what a lovely evening  i said joining him as he passed me  lovely indeed he said  where did you come from dropped from the clouds  im strolling your way i said and no further explanation seemed necessary  have a cigar  thanks im not a smoker  is there a lunatic asylum near here  not that i know of  thought there might be  met a lunatic just now  queer old fish as ever i saw  and so in friendly chat we took our homeward ways and wished each other goodnight at the door of his hotel  left to myself i felt the eerie feeling rush over me again and saw standing at the door of number forty the three figures i knew so well  then its the wrong house  bruno was saying  no no  its the right house the professor cheerfully replied but its the wrong street  thats where weve made our mistake our best plan now will be to  it was over  the street was empty commonplace life was around me and the eerie feeling had fled   chapter 19  how to make a phlizz  the week passed without any further communication with the hall as arthur was evidently fearful that we might wear out our welcome but when on sunday morning we were setting out for church i gladly agreed to his proposal to go round and enquire after the earl who was said to be unwell  eric who was strolling in the garden gave us a good report of the invalid who was still in bed with lady muriel in attendance  are you coming with us to church  i enquired  thanks no he courteously replied  its notexactly in my line you know  its an excellent institutionfor the poor  when im with my own folk i go just to set them an example  but im not known here so i think ill excuse myself sitting out a sermon  countrypreachers are always so dull  arthur was silent till we were out of hearing  then he said to himself almost inaudibly where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them  yes i assented no doubt that is the principle on which churchgoing rests  and when he does go he continued our thoughts ran so much together that our conversation was often slightly elliptical i suppose he repeats the words i believe in the communion of saints  but by this time we had reached the little church into which a goodly stream of worshipers consisting mainly of fishermen and their families was flowing  the service would have been pronounced by any modern aesthetic religionistor religious aesthete which is itto be crude and cold to me coming fresh from the everadvancing developments of a london church under a soidisant catholic rector it was unspeakably refreshing  there was no theatrical procession of demure little choristers trying their best not to simper under the admiring gaze of the congregation the peoples share in the service was taken by the people themselves unaided except that a few good voices judiciously posted here and there among them kept the singing from going too far astray  there was no murdering of the noble music contained in the bible and the liturgy by its recital in a dead monotone with no more expression than a mechanical talkingdoll  no the prayers were prayed the lessons were read and best of all the sermon was talked and i found myself repeating as we left the church the words of jacob when he awaked out of his sleep surely the lord is in this place  this is none other but the house of god and this is the gate of heaven  yes said arthur apparently in answer to my thoughts those high services are fast becoming pure formalism  more and more the people are beginning to regard them as performances in which they only assist in the french sense  and it is specially bad for the little boys  theyd be much less selfconscious as pantomimefairies with all that dressingup and stagyentrances and exits and being always en evidence no wonder if theyre eaten up with vanity the blatant little coxcombs  when we passed the hall on our return we found the earl and lady muriel sitting out in the garden eric had gone for a stroll  we joined them and the conversation soon turned on the sermon we had just heard the subject of which was selfishness  what a change has come over our pulpits arthur remarked since the time when paley gave that utterly selfish definition of virtue the doing good to mankind in obedience to the will of god and for the sake of everlasting happiness  lady muriel looked at him enquiringly but she seemed to have learned by intuition what years of experience had taught me that the way to elicit arthurs deepest thoughts was neither to assent nor dissent but simply to listen  at that time he went on a great tidal wave of selfishness was sweeping over human thought right and wrong had somehow been transformed into gain and loss and religion had become a sort of commercial transaction  we may be thankful that our preachers are beginning to take a nobler view of life  but is it not taught again and again in the bible  i ventured to ask  not in the bible as a whole said arthur  in the old testament no doubt rewards and punishments are constantly appealed to as motives for action  that teaching is best for children and the israelites seem to have been mentally utter children  we guide our children thus at first but we appeal as soon as possible to their innate sense of right and wrong and when that stage is safely past we appeal to the highest motive of all the desire for likeness to and union with the supreme good  i think you will find that to be the teaching of the bible as a whole beginning with that thy days may be long in the land and ending with be ye perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect  we were silent for awhile and then arthur went off on another tack look at the literature of hymns now  how cankered it is through and through with selfishness  there are few human compositions more utterly degraded than some modern hymns  i quoted the stanza      whatever lord we tend to thee     repaid a thousandfold shall be     then gladly will we give to thee     giver of all  yes he said grimly that is the typical stanza  and the very last charitysermon i heard was infected with it  after giving many good reasons for charity the preacher wound up with and for all you give you will be repaid a thousandfold oh the utter meanness of such a motive to be put before men who do know what selfsacrifice is who can appreciate generosity and heroism  talk of original sin he went on with increasing bitterness  can you have a stronger proof of the original goodness there must be in this nation than the fact that religion has been preached to us as a commercial speculation for a century and that we still believe in a god  it couldnt have gone on so long lady muriel musingly remarked if the opposition hadnt been practically silencedput under what the french call la cloture  surely in any lecturehall or in private society such teaching would soon have been hooted down  i trust so said arthur and though i dont want to see brawling in church legalised i must say that our preachers enjoy an enormous privilegewhich they ill deserve and which they misuse terribly we put our man into a pulpit and we virtually tell him now you may stand there and talk to us for halfanhour  we wont interrupt you by so much as a word  you shall have it all your own way and what does he give us in return  shallow twaddle that if it were addressed to you over a dinnertable you would think does the man take me for a fool  the return of eric from his walk checked the tide of arthurs eloquence and after a few minutes talk on more conventional topics we took our leave  lady muriel walked with us to the gate  you have given me much to think about she said earnestly as she gave arthur her hand im so glad you came in  and her words brought a real glow of pleasure into that pale worn face of his  on the tuesday as arthur did not seem equal to more walking i took a long stroll by myself having stipulated that he was not to give the whole day to his books but was to meet me at the hall at about teatime  on my way back i passed the station just as the afternoontrain came in sight and sauntered down the stairs to see it come in  but there was little to gratify my idle curiosity and when the train was empty and the platform clear i found it was about time to be moving on if i meant to reach the hall by five  as i approached the end of the platform from which a steep irregular wooden staircase conducted to the upper world i noticed two passengers who had evidently arrived by the train but who oddly enough had entirely escaped my notice though the arrivals had been so few they were a young woman and a little girl the former so far as one could judge by appearances was a nursemaid or possibly a nurserygoverness in attendance on the child whose refined face even more than her dress distinguished her as of a higher class than her companion  the childs face was refined but it was also a worn and sad one and told a tale or so i seemed to read it of much illness and suffering sweetly and patiently borne  she had a little crutch to help herself along with and she was now standing looking wistfully up the long staircase and apparently waiting till she could muster courage to begin the toilsome ascent  there are some things one says in lifeas well as things one doeswhich come automatically by reflex action as the physiologists say meaning no doubt action without reflection just as lucus is said to be derived a non lucendo  closing ones eyelids when something seems to be flying into the eye is one of those actions and saying may i carry the little girl up the stairs was another it wasnt that any thought of offering help occurred to me and that then i spoke the first intimation i had of being likely to make that offer was the sound of my own voice and the discovery that the offer had been made  the servant paused doubtfully glancing from her charge to me and then back again to the child  would you like it dear she asked her  but no such doubt appeared to cross the childs mind she lifted her arms eagerly to be taken up  please was all she said while a faint smile flickered on the weary little face  i took her up with scrupulous care and her little arm was at once clasped trustfully round my neck  imagethe lame child  she was a very light weightso light in fact that the ridiculous idea crossed my mind that it was rather easier going up with her in my arms than it would have been without her and when we reached the road above with its cartruts and loose stonesall formidable obstacles for a lame childi found that i had said id better carry her over this rough place before i had formed any mental connection between its roughness and my gentle little burden  indeed its troubling you too much sir the maid exclaimed  she can walk very well on the flat but the arm that was twined about my neck clung just an atom more closely at the suggestion and decided me to say shes no weight really  ill carry her a little further  im going your way  the nurse raised no further objection and the next speaker was a ragged little boy with bare feet and a broom over his shoulder who ran across the road and pretended to sweep the perfectly dry road in front of us  give us a apny the little urchin pleaded with a broad grin on his dirty face  dont give him a apny said the little lady in my arms  the words sounded harsh but the tone was gentleness itself  hes an idle little boy  and she laughed a laugh of such silvery sweetness as i had never yet heard from any lips but sylvies  to my astonishment the boy actually joined in the laugh as if there were some subtle sympathy between them as he ran away down the road and vanished through a gap in the hedge  but he was back in a few moments having discarded his broom and provided himself from some mysterious source with an exquisite bouquet of flowers  buy a posy buy a posy  only a apny he chanted with the melancholy drawl of a professional beggar  dont buy it was her majestys edict as she looked down with a lofty scorn that seemed curiously mixed with tender interest on the ragged creature at her feet  but this time i turned rebel and ignored the royal commands such lovely flowers and of forms so entirely new to me were not to be abandoned at the bidding of any little maid however imperious i bought the bouquet and the little boy after popping the halfpenny into his mouth turned headoverheels as if to ascertain whether the human mouth is really adapted to serve as a moneybox  with wonder that increased every moment i turned over the flowers and examined them one by one there was not a single one among them that i could remember having ever seen before  at last i turned to the nursemaid  do these flowers grow wild about here  i never saw but the speech died away on my lips  the nursemaid had vanished  you can put me down now if you like sylvie quietly remarked  i obeyed in silence and could only ask myself is this a dream on finding sylvie and bruno walking one on either side of me and clinging to my hands with the ready confidence of childhood  youre larger than when i saw you last  i began  really i think we ought to be introduced again  theres so much of you that i never met before you know  very well  sylvie merrily replied  this is bruno  it doesnt take long  hes only got one name  theres another name to me  bruno protested with a reproachful look at the mistress of the ceremonies  and its esquire  oh of course  i forgot said sylvie  brunoesquire  and did you come here to meet me my children  i enquired  you know i said wed come on tuesday sylvie explained  are we the proper size for common children  quite the right size for children i replied adding mentally though not common children by any means but what became of the nursemaid  it are gone  bruno solemnly replied  then it wasnt solid like sylvie and you  no  oo couldnt touch it oo know  if oo walked at it ood go right froo  i quite expected youd find it out once said sylvie  bruno ran it against a telegraph post by accident  and it went in two halves but you were looking the other way  i felt that i had indeed missed an opportunity to witness such an event as a nursemaid going in two halves does not occur twice in a lifetime  when did oo guess it were sylvie  bruno enquired  imageit went in two halves  i didnt guess it till it was sylvie i said  but how did you manage the nursemaid    bruno managed it said sylvie  its called a phlizz  and how do you make a phlizz bruno  the professor teached me how said bruno first oo takes a lot of air  oh bruno  sylvie interposed  the professor said you werent to tell but who did her voice  i asked  indeed its troubling you too much sir  she can walk very well on the flat  bruno laughed merrily as i turned hastily from side to side looking in all directions for the speaker that were me he gleefully proclaimed in his own voice  she can indeed walk very well on the flat i said  and i think i was the flat  by this time we were near the hall  this is where my friends live i said  will you come in and have some tea with them  bruno gave a little jump of joy and sylvie said yes please youd like some tea bruno wouldnt you  he hasnt tasted tea she explained to me since we left outland  and that werent good tea said bruno  it were so welly weak   chapter 20  light come light go  lady muriels smile of welcome could not quite conceal the look of surprise with which she regarded my new companions  i presented them in due form  this is sylvie lady muriel  and this is bruno  any surname she enquired her eyes twinkling with fun  no i said gravely  no surname  she laughed evidently thinking i said it in fun and stooped to kiss the children a salute to which bruno submitted with reluctance sylvie returned it with interest  while she and arthur who had arrived before me supplied the children with tea and cake i tried to engage the earl in conversation but he was restless and distrait and we made little progress  at last by a sudden question he betrayed the cause of his disquiet  would you let me look at those flowers you have in your hand  willingly  i said handing him the bouquet  botany was i knew a favourite study of his and these flowers were to me so entirely new and mysterious that i was really curious to see what a botanist would say of them  they did not diminish his disquiet  on the contrary he became every moment more excited as he turned them over  these are all from central india he said laying aside part of the bouquet they are rare even there and i have never seen them in any other part of the world  these two are mexicanthis one he rose hastily and carried it to the window to examine it in a better light the flush of excitement mounting to his very forehead is  i am nearly sure but i have a book of indian botany here he took a volume from the bookshelves and turned the leaves with trembling fingers  yes compare it with this picture  it is the exact duplicate  this is the flower of the upastree which usually grows only in the depths of forests and the flower fades so quickly after being plucked that it is scarcely possible to keep its form or colour even so far as the outskirts of the forest  yet this is in full bloom  where did you get these flowers he added with breathless eagerness  i glanced at sylvie who gravely and silently laid her finger on her lips then beckoned to bruno to follow her and ran out into the garden and i found myself in the position of a defendant whose two most important witnesses have been suddenly taken away  let me give you the flowers  i stammered out at last quite at my wits end as to how to get out of the difficulty  you know much more about them than i do  i accept them most gratefully  but you have not yet told me the earl was beginning when we were interrupted to my great relief by the arrival of eric lindon  to arthur however the newcomer was i saw clearly anything but welcome  his face clouded over he drew a little back from the circle and took no further part in the conversation which was wholly maintained for some minutes by lady muriel and her lively cousin who were discussing some new music that had just arrived from london  do just try this one he pleaded  the music looks easy to sing at sight and the songs quite appropriate to the occasion  then i suppose its      five oclock tea     ever to thee     faithful ill be     five oclock tea  laughed lady muriel as she sat down to the piano and lightly struck a few random chords  not quite and yet it is a kind of ever to thee faithful ill be its a pair of hapless lovers he crosses the briny deep and she is left lamenting  that is indeed appropriate she replied mockingly as he placed the song before her  and am i to do the lamenting  and who for if you please  she played the air once or twice through first in quick and finally in slow time and then gave us the whole song with as much graceful ease as if she had been familiar with it all her life      he stept so lightly to the land     all in his manly pride     he kissed her cheek he pressed her hand     yet still she glanced aside     too gay he seems she darkly dreams     too gallant and too gay     to think of mepoor simple me     when he is far away      i bring my love this goodly pearl     across the seas he said     a gem to deck the dearest girl     that ever sailor wed     she clasps it tight her eyes are bright     her throbbing heart would say     he thought of mehe thought of me     when he was far away      the ship has sailed into the west     her oceanbird is flown     a dull dead pain is in her breast     and she is weak and lone     yet theres a smile upon her face     a smile that seems to say     hell think of me hell think of me     when he is far away      though waters wide between us glide     our lives are warm and near     no distance parts two faithful hearts     two hearts that love so dear     and i will trust my sailorlad     for ever and a day     to think of meto think of me     when he is far away  the look of displeasure which had begun to come over arthurs face when the young captain spoke of love so lightly faded away as the song proceeded and he listened with evident delight  but his face darkened again when eric demurely remarked dont you think my soldierlad would have fitted the tune just as well  why so it would  lady muriel gaily retorted soldiers sailors tinkers tailors what a lot of words would fit in i think my tinkerlad sounds best  dont you  to spare my friend further pain i rose to go just as the earl was beginning to repeat his particularly embarrassing question about the flowers  you have not yet  yes ive had some tea thank you  i hastily interrupted him and now we really must be going good evening lady muriel and we made our adieux and escaped while the earl was still absorbed in examining the mysterious bouquet  lady muriel accompanied us to the door  you couldnt have given my father a more acceptable present she said warmly  he is so passionately fond of botany  im afraid i know nothing of the theory of it but i keep his hortus siccus in order  i must get some sheets of blottingpaper and dry these new treasures for him before they fade  that wont be no good at all said bruno who was waiting for us in the garden  why wont it said i  you know i had to give the flowers to stop questions  yes it cant be helped said sylvie but they will be sorry when they find them gone  but how will they go  well i dont know how  but they will go  the nosegay was only a phlizz you know  bruno made it up  these last words were in a whisper as she evidently did not wish arthur to hear  but of this there seemed to be little risk he hardly seemed to notice the children but paced on silent and abstracted and when at the entrance to the wood they bid us a hasty farewell and ran off he seemed to wake out of a daydream  the bouquet vanished as sylvie had predicted and when a day or two afterwards arthur and i once more visited the hall we found the earl and his daughter with the old housekeeper out in the garden examining the fastenings of the drawingroom window  we are holding an inquest lady muriel said advancing to meet us and we admit you as accessories before the fact to tell us all you know about those flowers  the accessories before the fact decline to answer any questions i gravely replied  and they reserve their defence  well then turn queens evidence please  the flowers have disappeared in the night she went on turning to arthur and we are quite sure no one in the house has meddled with them  somebody must have entered by the window  but the fastenings have not been tampered with said the earl  it must have been while you were dining my lady said the housekeeper  that was it said the earl  the thief must have seen you bring the flowers turning to me and have noticed that you did not take them away  and he must have known their great valuethey are simply priceless he exclaimed in sudden excitement  and you never told us how you got them said lady muriel  some day i stammered i may be free to tell you  just now would you excuse me  the earl looked disappointed but kindly said very well we will ask no questions  imagefive oclock tea  but we consider you a very bad queens evidence lady muriel added playfully as we entered the arbour  we pronounce you to be an accomplice and we sentence you to solitary confinement and to be fed on bread and butter  do you take sugar  it is disquieting certainly she resumed when all creaturecomforts had been duly supplied to find that the house has been entered by a thief in this outoftheway place  if only the flowers had been eatables one might have suspected a thief of quite another shape  you mean that universal explanation for all mysterious disappearances the cat did it said arthur  yes she replied  what a convenient thing it would be if all thieves had the same shape  its so confusing to have some of them quadrupeds and others bipeds  it has occurred to me said arthur as a curious problem in teleology the science of final causes he added in answer to an enquiring look from lady muriel  and a final cause is  well suppose we saythe last of a series of connected eventseach of the series being the cause of the nextfor whose sake the first event takes place  but the last event is practically an effect of the first isnt it and yet you call it a cause of it  arthur pondered a moment  the words are rather confusing i grant you he said  will this do  the last event is an effect of the first but the necessity for that event is a cause of the necessity for the first  that seems clear enough said lady muriel  now let us have the problem  its merely this  what object can we imagine in the arrangement by which each different size roughly speaking of living creatures has its special shape  for instance the human race has one kind of shapebipeds  another set ranging from the lion to the mouse are quadrupeds  go down a step or two further and you come to insects with six legshexapodsa beautiful name is it not but beauty in our sense of the word seems to diminish as we go down the creature becomes morei wont say ugly of any of gods creaturesmore uncouth and when we take the microscope and go a few steps lower still we come upon animalculae terribly uncouth and with a terrible number of legs  the other alternative said the earl would be a diminuendo series of repetitions of the same type never mind the monotony of it lets see how it would work in other ways  begin with the race of men and the creatures they require let us say horses cattle sheep and dogs we dont exactly require frogs and spiders do we muriel  lady muriel shuddered perceptibly it was evidently a painful subject we can dispense with them she said gravely  well then well have a second race of men halfayard high  who would have one source of exquisite enjoyment not possessed by ordinary men  arthur interrupted  what source said the earl  why the grandeur of scenery  surely the grandeur of a mountain to me depends on its size relative to me  double the height of the mountain and of course its twice as grand  halve my height and you produce the same effect  happy happy happy small  lady muriel murmured rapturously none but the short none but the short none but the short enjoy the tall  but let me go on said the earl  well have a third race of men five inches high a fourth race an inch high  they couldnt eat common beef and mutton im sure  lady muriel interrupted  true my child i was forgetting  each set must have its own cattle and sheep  and its own vegetation i added  what could a cow an inch high do with grass that waved far above its head  that is true  we must have a pasture within a pasture so to speak the common grass would serve our inchhigh cows as a green forest of palms while round the root of each tall stem would stretch a tiny carpet of microscopic grass  yes i think our scheme will work fairly well  and it would be very interesting coming into contact with the races below us  what sweet little things the inchhigh bulldogs would be  i doubt if even muriel would run away from one of them  dont you think we ought to have a crescendo series as well said lady muriel  only fancy being a hundred yards high  one could use an elephant as a paperweight and a crocodile as a pair of scissors  and would you have races of different sizes communicate with one another  i enquired  would they make war on one another for instance or enter into treaties  war we must exclude i think  when you could crush a whole nation with one blow of your fist you couldnt conduct war on equal terms but anything involving a collision of minds only would be possible in our ideal worldfor of course we must allow mental powers to all irrespective of size perhaps the fairest rule would be that the smaller the race the greater should be its intellectual development  do you mean to say said lady muriel that these manikins of an inch high are to argue with me  surely surely said the earl  an argument doesnt depend for its logical force on the size of the creature that utters it  she tossed her head indignantly  i would not argue with any man less than six inches high she cried  id make him work  what at said arthur listening to all this nonsense with an amused smile  embroidery she readily replied  what lovely embroidery they would do  yet if they did it wrong i said you couldnt argue the question i dont know why but i agree that it couldnt be done  the reason is said lady muriel one couldnt sacrifice ones dignity so far  of course one couldnt echoed arthur  any more than one could argue with a potato  it would be altogetherexcuse the ancient puninfra dig  i doubt it said i  even a pun doesnt quite convince me  well if that is not the reason said lady muriel what reason would you give  i tried hard to understand the meaning of this question but the persistent humming of the bees confused me and there was a drowsiness in the air that made every thought stop and go to sleep before it had got well thought out so all i could say was that must depend on the weight of the potato  i felt the remark was not so sensible as i should have liked it to be but lady muriel seemed to take it quite as a matter of course in that case she began but suddenly started and turned away to listen  dont you hear him she said  hes crying  we must go to him somehow  and i said to myself thats very strange  i quite thought it was lady muriel talking to me  why its sylvie all the while  and i made another great effort to say something that should have some meaning in it  is it about the potato   chapter 21  through the ivory door  i dont know said sylvie  hush  i must think  i could go to him by myself well enough  but i want you to come too  let me go with you i pleaded  i can walk as fast as you can im sure  sylvie laughed merrily  what nonsense she cried why you cant walk a bit  youre lying quite flat on your back you dont understand these things  i can walk as well as you can i repeated  and i tried my best to walk a few steps but the ground slipped away backwards quite as fast as i could walk so that i made no progress at all  sylvie laughed again  there i told you so  youve no idea how funny you look moving your feet about in the air as if you were walking  wait a bit  ill ask the professor what wed better do and she knocked at his studydoor  the door opened and the professor looked out  whats that crying i heard just now he asked  is it a human animal  its a boy sylvie said  im afraid youve been teasing him  no indeed i havent  sylvie said very earnestly  i never tease him well i must ask the other professor about it he went back into the study and we heard him whispering small human animalsays she hasnt been teasing himthe kind thats called boy  ask her which boy said a new voice  the professor came out again  which boy is it that you havent been teasing  sylvie looked at me with twinkling eyes  you dear old thing she exclaimed standing on tiptoe to kiss him while he gravely stooped to receive the salute  how you do puzzle me  why there are several boys i havent been teasing  the professor returned to his friend and this time the voice said tell her to bring them hereall of them  i cant and i wont  sylvie exclaimed the moment he reappeared its bruno thats crying and hes my brother and please we both want to go he cant walk you know heshes dreaming you know this in a whisper for fear of hurting my feelings  do lets go through the ivory door  ill ask him said the professor disappearing again  he returned directly  he says you may  follow me and walk on tiptoe  the difficulty with me would have been just then not to walk on tiptoe  it seemed very hard to reach down far enough to just touch the floor as sylvie led me through the study  the professor went before us to unlock the ivory door  i had just time to glance at the other professor who was sitting reading with his back to us before the professor showed us out through the door and locked it behind us  bruno was standing with his hands over his face crying bitterly  imagewhats the matter darling  whats the matter darling said sylvie with her arms round his neck  hurted mine self welly much sobbed the poor little fellow  im so sorry darling  how ever did you manage to hurt yourself so  course i managed it said bruno laughing through his tears doos oo think nobody else but oo cant manage things  matters were looking distinctly brighter now bruno had begun to argue come lets hear all about it  i said  my foot took it into its head to slip bruno began  a foot hasnt got a head  sylvie put in but all in vain  i slipted down the bank  and i tripted over a stone  and the stone hurted my foot  and i trod on a bee  and the bee stinged my finger poor bruno sobbed again  the complete list of woes was too much for his feelings  and it knewed i didnt mean to trod on it he added as the climax  that bee should be ashamed of itself  i said severely and sylvie hugged and kissed the wounded hero till all tears were dried  my fingers quite unstung now said bruno  why doos there be stones mister sir doos oo know  theyre good for something i said even if we dont know what whats the good of dandelions now  dindledums said bruno  oh theyre ever so pretty  and stones arent pretty one bit  would oo like some dindledums mister sir  bruno  sylvie murmured reproachfully  you mustnt say mister and sir both at once  remember what i told you  you telled me i were to say mister when i spoked about him and i were to say sir when i spoked to him  well youre not doing both you know  ah but i is doing bofe miss praticular  bruno exclaimed triumphantly  i wishted to speak about the gemplunand i wishted to speak to the gemplun  so a course i said mister sir  thats all right bruno i said  course its all right said bruno  sylvie just knows nuffin at all  there never was an impertinenter boy said sylvie frowning till her bright eyes were nearly invisible  and there never was an ignoranter girl retorted bruno  come along and pick some dindledums thats all shes fit for he added in a very loud whisper to me  but why do you say dindledums bruno  dandelions is the right word  its because he jumps about so sylvie said laughing  yes thats it bruno assented  sylvie tells me the words and then when i jump about they get shooken up in my head till theyre all froth  i expressed myself as perfectly satisfied with this explanation but arent you going to pick me any dindledums after all  course we will cried bruno  come along sylvie  and the happy children raced away bounding over the turf with the fleetness and grace of young antelopes  then you didnt find your way back to outland  i said to the professor  oh yes i did he replied we never got to queer street but i found another way  ive been backwards and forwards several times since then  i had to be present at the election you know as the author of the new moneyact  the emperor was so kind as to wish that i should have the credit of it let come what come may i remember the very words of the imperial speech if it should turn out that the warden is alive you will bear witness that the change in the coinage is the professors doing not mine i never was so glorified in my life before  tears trickled down his cheeks at the recollection which apparently was not wholly a pleasant one  is the warden supposed to be dead  well its supposed so but mind you i dont believe it the evidence is very weakmere hearsay  a wandering jester with a dancingbear they found their way into the palace one day has been telling people he comes from fairyland and that the warden died there i wanted the vicewarden to question him but most unluckily he and my lady were always out walking when the jester came round  yes the wardens supposed to be dead  and more tears trickled down the old mans cheeks  but what is the new moneyact  the professor brightened up again  the emperor started the thing he said  he wanted to make everybody in outland twice as rich as he was before just to make the new government popular  only there wasnt nearly enough money in the treasury to do it  so i suggested that he might do it by doubling the value of every coin and banknote in outland  its the simplest thing possible  i wonder nobody ever thought of it before  and you never saw such universal joy the shops are full from morning to night  everybodys buying everything  and how was the glorifying done  a sudden gloom overcast the professors jolly face  they did it as i went home after the election he mournfully replied  it was kindly meant but i didnt like it  they waved flags all round me till i was nearly blind and they rang bells till i was nearly deaf and they strewed the road so thick with flowers that i lost my way  and the poor old man sighed deeply  how far is it to outland  i asked to change the subject  about five days march  but one must go backoccasionally  you see as courtprofessor i have to be always in attendance on prince uggug the empress would be very angry if i left him even for an hour  but surely every time you come here you are absent ten days at least  oh more than that the professor exclaimed  a fortnight sometimes but of course i keep a memorandum of the exact time when i started so that i can put the courttime back to the very moment excuse me i said  i dont understand  silently the professor drew front his pocket a square gold watch with six or eight hands and held it out for my inspection this he began is an outlandish watch  so i should have thought  which has the peculiar property that instead of its going with the time the time goes with it  i trust you understand me now  hardly i said  permit me to explain  so long as it is let alone it takes its own course  time has no effect upon it  i have known such watches i remarked  it goes of course at the usual rate  only the time has to go with it hence if i move the hands i change the time  to move them forwards in advance of the true time is impossible but i can move them as much as a month backwardsthat is the limit  and then you have the events all over againwith any alterations experience may suggest  what a blessing such a watch would be i thought in real life to be able to unsay some heedless wordto undo some reckless deed might i see the thing done  with pleasure said the good natured professor  when i move this hand back to here pointing out the place history goes back fifteen minutes  trembling with excitement i watched him push the hand round as he described  hurted mine self welly much  shrilly and suddenly the words rang in my ears and more startled than i cared to show i turned to look for the speaker  yes  there was bruno standing with the tears running down his cheeks just as i had seen him a quarter of an hour ago and there was sylvie with her arms round his neck  i had not the heart to make the dear little fellow go through his troubles a second time so hastily begged the professor to push the hands round into their former position  in a moment sylvie and bruno were gone again and i could just see them in the far distance picking dindledums  wonderful indeed  i exclaimed  it has another property yet more wonderful said the professor you see this little peg  that is called the reversal peg if you push it in the events of the next hour happen in the reverse order do not try it now  i will lend you the watch for a few days and you can amuse yourself with experiments  thank you very much  i said as he gave me the watch  ill take the greatest care of itwhy here are the children again  we could only but find six dindledums said bruno putting them into my hands cause sylvie said it were time to go back  and heres a big blackberry for ooself  we couldnt only find but two  thank you its very nice i said  and i suppose you ate the other bruno  no i didnt bruno said carelessly  arent they pretty dindledums mister sir  yes very but what makes you limp so my child  mine foots come hurted again  bruno mournfully replied  and he sat down on the ground and began nursing it  the professor held his head between his handsan attitude that i knew indicated distraction of mind  better rest a minute he said it may be better thenor it may be worse  if only i had some of my medicines here  im courtphysician you know he added aside to me  shall i go and get you some blackberries darling  sylvie whispered with her arms round his neck and she kissed away a tear that was trickling down his cheek  bruno brightened up in a moment  that are a good plan he exclaimed i thinks my foot would come quite unhurted if i eated a blackberry two or three blackberriessix or seven blackberries  sylvie got up hastily  id better go she said aside to me before he gets into the double figures  let me come and help you i said  i can reach higher up than you can  yes please said sylvie putting her hand into mine and we walked off together  bruno loves blackberries she said as we paced slowly along by a tall hedge that looked a promising place for them and it was so sweet of him to make me eat the only one  oh it was you that ate it then  bruno didnt seem to like to tell me about it  no i saw that said sylvie  hes always afraid of being praised but he made me eat it really  i would much rather he oh whats that and she clung to my hand halffrightened as we came in sight of a hare lying on its side with legs stretched out just in the entrance to the wood  its a hare my child  perhaps its asleep  no it isnt asleep sylvie said timidly going nearer to look at it its eyes are open  is itis ither voice dropped to an awestruck whisper is it dead do you think  yes its quite dead i said after stooping to examine it poor thing  i think its been hunted to death  i know the harriers were out yesterday  but they havent touched it  perhaps they caught sight of another and left it to die of fright and exhaustion  hunted to death  sylvie repeated to herself very slowly and sadly i thought hunting was a thing they played at like a game  bruno and i hunt snails but we never hurt them when we catch them  sweet angel  i thought  how am i to get the idea of sport into your innocent mind  and as we stood handinhand looking down at the dead hare i tried to put the thing into such words as she could understand you know what fierce wildbeasts lions and tigers are  sylvie nodded well in some countries men have to kill them to save their own lives you know  yes said sylvie if one tried to kill me bruno would kill it if he could  well and so the menthe huntersget to enjoy it you know the running and the fighting and the shouting and the danger  yes said sylvie  bruno likes danger  well but in this country there arent any lions and tigers loose so they hunt other creatures you see i hoped but in vain that this would satisfy her and that she would ask no more questions  they hunt foxes sylvie said thoughtfully  and i think they kill them too  foxes are very fierce  i daresay men dont love them are hares fierce  no i said  a hare is a sweet gentle timid animalalmost as gentle as a lamb  but if men love hares whywhy her voice quivered and her sweet eyes were brimming over with tears  im afraid they dont love them dear child  all children love them sylvie said  all ladies love them  im afraid even ladies go to hunt them sometimes  sylvie shuddered  oh no not ladies she earnestly pleaded not lady muriel  no she never does im surebut this is too sad a sight for you dear lets try and find some  but sylvie was not satisfied yet  in a hushed solemn tone with bowed head and clasped hands she put her final question does god love hares  yes  i said  im sure he does  he loves every living thing even sinful men  how much more the animals that cannot sin  i dont know what sin means said sylvie  and i didnt try to explain it  come my child i said trying to lead her away  wish goodbye to the poor hare and come and look for blackberries  goodbye poor hare  sylvie obediently repeated looking over her shoulder at it as we turned away  and then all in a moment her selfcommand gave way  pulling her hand out of mine she ran back to where the dead hare was lying and flung herself down at its side in such an agony of grief as i could hardly have believed possible in so young a child  oh my darling my darling she moaned over and over again and god meant your life to be so beautiful  sometimes but always keeping her face hidden on the ground she would reach out one little hand to stroke the poor dead thing and then once more bury her face in her hands and sob as if her heart would break imagethe dead hare  i was afraid she would really make herself ill still i thought it best to let her weep away the first sharp agony of grief and after a few minutes the sobbing gradually ceased and sylvie rose to her feet and looked calmly at me though tears were still streaming down her cheeks  i did not dare to speak again just yet but simply held out my hand to her that we might quit the melancholy spot  yes ill come now she said  very reverently she kneeled down and kissed the dead hare then rose and gave me her hand and we moved on in silence  a childs sorrow is violent but short and it was almost in her usual voice that she said after a minute oh stop stop  here are some lovely blackberries  we filled our hands with fruit and returned in all haste to where the professor and bruno were seated on a bank awaiting our return  just before we came within hearingdistance sylvie checked me please dont tell bruno about the hare she said  very well my child  but why not  tears again glittered in those sweet eyes and she turned her head away so that i could scarcely hear her reply  heshes very fond of gentle creatures you know  and hedhed be so sorry  i dont want him to be made sorry  and your agony of sorrow is to count for nothing then sweet unselfish child  i thought to myself but no more was said till we had reached our friends and bruno was far too much engrossed in the feast we had brought him to take any notice of sylvies unusually grave manner  im afraid its getting rather late professor  i said  yes indeed said the professor  i must take you all through the ivory door again  youve stayed your full time  mightnt we stay a little longer pleaded sylvie  just one minute added bruno  but the professor was unyielding  its a great privilege coming through at all he said  we must go now and we followed him obediently to the ivory door which he threw open and signed to me to go through first  youre coming too arent you  i said to sylvie  yes she said but you wont see us after youve gone through  but suppose i wait for you outside  i asked as i stepped through the doorway  in that case said sylvie i think the potato would be quite justified in asking your weight  i can quite imagine a really superior kidneypotato declining to argue with any one under fifteen stone  with a great effort i recovered the thread of my thoughts we lapse very quickly into nonsense  i said   chapter 22  crossing the line  let us lapse back again said lady muriel  take another cup of tea i hope thats sound common sense  and all that strange adventure i thought has occupied the space of a single comma in lady muriels speech  a single comma for which grammarians tell us to count one  i felt no doubt that the professor had kindly put back the time for me to the exact point at which i had gone to sleep  when a few minutes afterwards we left the house arthurs first remark was certainly a strange one weve been there just twenty minutes he said and ive done nothing but listen to you and lady muriel talking and yet somehow i feel exactly as if i had been talking with her for an hour at least  and so he had been i felt no doubt only as the time had been put back to the beginning of the teteatete he referred to the whole of it had passed into oblivion if not into nothingness  but i valued my own reputation for sanity too highly to venture on explaining to him what had happened  for some cause which i could not at the moment divine arthur was unusually grave and silent during our walk home  it could not be connected with eric lindon i thought as he had for some days been away in london so that having lady muriel almost all to himself for i was only too glad to hear those two conversing to have any wish to intrude any remarks of my ownhe ought theoretically to have been specially radiant and contented with life  can he have heard any bad news  i said to myself  and almost as if he had read my thoughts he spoke  he will be here by the last train he said in the tone of one who is continuing a conversation rather than beginning one  captain lindon do you mean  yescaptain lindon said arthur i said he because i fancied we were talking about him  the earl told me he comes tonight though tomorrow is the day when he will know about the commission that hes hoping for  i wonder he doesnt stay another day to hear the result if hes really so anxious about it as the earl believes he is  he can have a telegram sent after him i said but its not very soldierlike running away from possible bad news  hes a very good fellow said arthur but i confess it would be good news for me if he got his commission and his marching orders all at once  i wish him all happinesswith one exception  good night we had reached home by this time  im not good company tonight better be alone  it was much the same next day  arthur declared he wasnt fit for society and i had to set forth alone for an afternoonstroll i took the road to the station and at the point where the road from the hall joined it i paused seeing my friends in the distance seemingly bound for the same goal  will you join us the earl said after i had exchanged greetings with him and lady muriel and captain lindon  this restless young man is expecting a telegram and we are going to the station to meet it  there is also a restless young woman in the case lady muriel added  that goes without saying my child said her father women are always restless  for generous appreciation of all ones best qualities his daughter impressively remarked theres nothing to compare with a father is there eric  cousins are not in it said eric and then somehow the conversation lapsed into two duologues the younger folk taking the lead and the two old men following with less eager steps  and when are we to see your little friends again said the earl they are singularly attractive children  i shall be delighted to bring them when i can i said but i dont know myself when i am likely to see them again  im not going to question you said the earl but theres no harm in mentioning that muriel is simply tormented with curiosity  we know most of the people about here and she has been vainly trying to guess what house they can possibly be staying at  some day i may be able to enlighten her but just at present  thanks  she must bear it as best she can  i tell her its a grand opportunity for practising patience but she hardly sees it from that point of view  why there are the children  so indeed they were waiting for us apparently at a stile which they could not have climbed over more than a few moments as lady muriel and her cousin had passed it without seeing them on catching sight of us bruno ran to meet us and to exhibit to us with much pride the handle of a claspknifethe blade having been broken offwhich he had picked up in the road  and what shall you use it for bruno  i said  dont know bruno carelessly replied must think  a childs first view of life the earl remarked with that sweet sad smile of his is that it is a period to be spent in accumulating portable property  that view gets modified as the years glide away and he held out his hand to sylvie who had placed herself by me looking a little shy of him  but the gentle old man was not one with whom any child human or fairy could be shy for long and she had very soon deserted my hand for hisbruno alone remaining faithful to his first friend  we overtook the other couple just as they reached the station and both lady muriel and eric greeted the children as old friendsthe latter with the words so you got to babylon by candlelight after all  yes and back again cried bruno  lady muriel looked from one to the other in blank astonishment what you know them eric she exclaimed this mystery grows deeper every day  then we must be somewhere in the third act said eric  you dont expect the mystery to be cleared up till the fifth act do you  but its such a long drama was the plaintive reply  we must have got to the fifth act by this time  third act i assure you said the young soldier mercilessly scene a railwayplatform  lights down  enter prince in disguise of course and faithful attendant  this is the prince taking brunos hand and here stands his humble servant what is your royal highness next command and he made a most courtierlike low bow to his puzzled little friend  oore not a servant  bruno scornfully exclaimed  oore a gemplun  servant i assure your royal highness  eric respectfully insisted allow me to mention to your royal highness my various situationspast present and future  what did oo begin wiz  bruno asked beginning to enter into the jest was oo a shoeblack  lower than that your royal highness  years ago i offered myself as a slaveas a confidential slave i think its called he asked turning to lady muriel  but lady muriel heard him not something had gone wrong with her glove which entirely engrossed her attention  did oo get the place said bruno  sad to say your royal highness i did not  so i had to take a situation asas waiter which i have now held for some years havent i  he again glanced at lady muriel  sylvie dear do help me to button this glove  lady muriel whispered hastily stooping down and failing to hear the question  and what will oo be next said bruno  my next place will i hope be that of groom  and after that  dont puzzle the child so  lady muriel interrupted what nonsense you talk  after that eric persisted i hope to obtain the situation of housekeeper whichfourth act he proclaimed with a sudden change of tone  lights turned up  red lights  green lights  distant rumble heard  enter a passengertrain  and in another minute the train drew up alongside of the platform and a stream of passengers began to flow out from the booking office and waitingrooms  did you ever make real life into a drama said the earl now just try  ive often amused myself that way consider this platform as our stage  good entrances and exits on both sides you see capital background scene real engine moving up and down all this bustle and people passing to and fro must have been most carefully rehearsed  how naturally they do it  with never a glance at the audience  and every grouping is quite fresh you see no repetition  it really was admirable as soon as i began to enter into it from this point of view  even a porter passing with a barrow piled with luggage seemed so realistic that one was tempted to applaud he was followed by an angry mother with hot red face dragging along two screaming children and calling to some one behind john come on enter john very meek very silent and loaded with parcels and he was followed in his turn by a frightened little nursemaid carrying a fat baby also screaming  all the children screamed  capital byplay said the old man aside  did you notice the nursemaids look of terror  it was simply perfect  you have struck quite a new vein i said  to most of us life and its pleasures seem like a mine that is nearly worked out  worked out exclaimed the earl  for any one with true dramatic instincts it is only the overture that is ended  the real treat has yet to begin  you go to a theatre and pay your ten shillings for a stall and what do you get for your money  perhaps its a dialogue between a couple of farmersunnatural in their overdone caricature of farmers dressmore unnatural in their constrained attitudes and gesturesmost unnatural in their attempts at ease and geniality in their talk  go instead and take a seat in a thirdclass railwaycarriage and youll get the same dialogue done to the life frontseatsno orchestra to block the viewand nothing to pay  which reminds me said eric  there is nothing to pay on receiving a telegram  shall we enquire for one  and he and lady muriel strolled off in the direction of the telegraphoffice  i wonder if shakespeare had that thought in his mind i said when he wrote all the worlds a stage  the old man sighed  and so it is he said look at it as you will life is indeed a drama a drama with but few encoresand no bouquets he added dreamily  we spend one half of it in regretting the things we did in the other half  and the secret of enjoying it he continued resuming his cheerful tone is intensity  but not in the modern aesthetic sense i presume  like the young lady in punch who begins a conversation with are you intense  by no means replied the earl what i mean is intensity of thoughta concentrated attention we lose half the pleasure we might have in life by not really attending take any instance you like it doesnt matter how trivial the pleasure may bethe principle is the same  suppose a and b are reading the same secondrate circulatinglibrary novel  a never troubles himself to master the relationships of the characters on which perhaps all the interest of the story depends he skips over all the descriptions of scenery and every passage that looks rather dull he doesnt half attend to the passages he does read he goes on reading merely from want of resolution to find another occupationfor hours after he ought to have put the book aside and reaches the finis in a state of utter weariness and depression  b puts his whole soul into the thingon the principle that whatever is worth doing is worth doing well he masters the genealogies he calls up pictures before his minds eye as he reads about the scenery best of all he resolutely shuts the book at the end of some chapter while his interest is yet at its keenest and turns to other subjects so that when next he allows himself an hour at it it is like a hungry man sitting down to dinner and when the book is finished he returns to the work of his daily life like a giant refreshed  but suppose the book were really rubbishnothing to repay attention  well suppose it said the earl  my theory meets that case i assure you  a never finds out that it is rubbish but maunders on to the end trying to believe hes enjoying himself  b quietly shuts the book when hes read a dozen pages walks off to the library and changes it for a better  i have yet another theory for adding to the enjoyment of lifethat is if i have not exhausted your patience im afraid you find me a very garrulous old man  no indeed  i exclaimed earnestly  and indeed i felt as if one could not easily tire of the sweet sadness of that gentle voice  it is that we should learn to take our pleasures quickly and our pains slowly  but why  i should have put it the other way myself  by taking artificial painwhich can be as trivial as you pleaseslowly the result is that when real pain comes however severe all you need do is to let it go at its ordinary pace and its over in a moment  very true i said but how about the pleasure  why by taking it quick you can get so much more into life  it takes you three hours and a half to hear and enjoy an opera  suppose i can take it in and enjoy it in halfanhour  why i can enjoy seven operas while you are listening to one  always supposing you have an orchestra capable of playing them i said  and that orchestra has yet to be found  the old man smiled  i have heard an air played he said and by no means a short oneplayed right through variations and all in three seconds  when  and how  i asked eagerly with a halfnotion that i was dreaming again  it was done by a little musicalbox he quietly replied after it had been wound up the regulator or something broke and it ran down as i said in about three seconds but it must have played all the notes you know  did you enjoy it  i asked with all the severity of a crossexamining barrister  no i didnt he candidly confessed  but then you know i hadnt been trained to that kind of music  i should much like to try your plan i said and as sylvie and bruno happened to run up to us at the moment i left them to keep the earl company and strolled along the platform making each person and event play its part in an extempore drama for my especial benefit what is the earl tired of you already  i said as the children ran past me  no  sylvie replied with great emphasis  he wants the eveningpaper so brunos going to be a little newsboy  mind you charge a good price for it  i called after them  returning up the platform i came upon sylvie alone well child i said wheres your little newsboy couldnt he get you an eveningpaper  he went to get one at the bookstall at the other side said sylvie and hes coming across the line with itoh bruno you ought to cross by the bridge for the distant thud thud of the express was already audible  suddenly a look of horror came over her face  oh hes fallen down on the rails she cried and darted past me at a speed that quite defied the hasty effort i made to stop her  but the wheezy old stationmaster happened to be close behind me he wasnt good for much poor old man but he was good for this and before i could turn round he had the child clasped in his arms saved from the certain death she was rushing to  so intent was i in watching this scene that i hardly saw a flying figure in a light grey suit who shot across from the back of the platform and was on the line in another second  so far as one could take note of time in such a moment of horror he had about ten clear seconds before the express would be upon him in which to cross the rails and to pick up bruno  whether he did so or not it was quite impossible to guess the next thing one knew was that the express had passed and that whether for life or death all was over  when the cloud of dust had cleared away and the line was once more visible we saw with thankful hearts that the child and his deliverer were safe  all right  eric called to us cheerfully as he recrossed the line hes more frightened than hurt  imagecrossing the line  he lifted the little fellow up into lady muriels arms and mounted the platform as gaily as if nothing had happened but he was as pale as death and leaned heavily on the arm i hastily offered him fearing he was about to faint  ill justsit down a moment he said dreamily wheres sylvie  sylvie ran to him and flung her arms round his neck sobbing as if her heart would break  dont do that my darling  eric murmured with a strange look in his eyes  nothing to cry about now you know but you very nearly got yourself killed for nothing  for bruno the little maiden sobbed and he would have done it for me  wouldnt you bruno  course i would  bruno said looking round with a bewildered air  lady muriel kissed him in silence as she put him down out of her arms then she beckoned sylvie to come and take his hand and signed to the children to go back to where the earl was seated  tell him she whispered with quivering lips tell himall is well  then she turned to the hero of the day  i thought it was death she said thank god you are safe  did you see how near it was  i saw there was just time eric said lightly  a soldier must learn to carry his life in his hand you know im all right now  shall we go to the telegraphoffice again i daresay its come by this time  i went to join the earl and the children and we waitedalmost in silence for no one seemed inclined to talk and bruno was halfasleep on sylvies laptill the others joined us  no telegram had come  ill take a stroll with the children i said feeling that we were a little de trop and ill look in in the course of the evening  we must go back into the wood now sylvie said as soon as we were out of hearing  we cant stay this size any longer  then you will be quite tiny fairies again next time we meet  yes said sylvie but well be children again some dayif youll let us  brunos very anxious to see lady muriel again  she are welly nice said bruno  i shall be very glad to take you to see her again i said hadnt i better give you back the professors watch itll be too large for you to carry when youre fairies you know  bruno laughed merrily  i was glad to see he had quite recovered from the terrible scene he had gone through  oh no it wont he said when we go small itll go small  and then itll go straight to the professor sylvie added and you wont be able to use it anymore so youd better use it all you can now we must go small when the sun sets  goodbye  goodbye cried bruno  but their voices sounded very far away and when i looked round both children had disappeared  and it wants only two hours to sunset  i said as i strolled on i must make the best of my time   chapter 23  an outlandish watch  as i entered the little town i came upon two of the fishermens wives interchanging that last word which never was the last and it occurred to me as an experiment with the magic watch to wait till the little scene was over and then to encore it  well good night tye  and ye winna forget to send us word when your martha writes  nay ah winna forget  an if she isnt suited she can but coom back good night tye  a casual observer might have thought and there ends the dialogue that casual observer would have been mistaken  ah shell like em i warn ye  theyll not treat her bad yer may depend  theyre varry canny fowk good night  ay they are that  good night  good night  and yell send us word if she writes  aye ah will yer may depend  good night tye  and at last they parted  i waited till they were some twenty yards apart and then put the watch a minute back  the instantaneous change was startling the two figures seemed to flash back into their former places  isnt suited she can but coom back  good night tye one of them was saying and so the whole dialogue was repeated and when they had parted for the second time i let them go their several ways and strolled on through the town  but the real usefulness of this magic power i thought would be to undo some harm some painful event some accident  i had not long to wait for an opportunity of testing this property also of the magic watch for even as the thought passed through my mind the accident i was imagining occurred  a light cart was standing at the door of the great millinery depot of elveston laden with cardboard packingcases which the driver was carrying into the shop one by one  one of the cases had fallen into the street but it scarcely seemed worth while to step forward and pick it up as the man would be back again in a moment  yet in that moment a young man riding a bicycle came sharp round the corner of the street and in trying to avoid running over the box upset his machine and was thrown headlong against the wheel of the springcart the driver ran out to his assistance and he and i together raised the unfortunate cyclist and carried him into the shop  his head was cut and bleeding and one knee seemed to be badly injured and it was speedily settled that he had better be conveyed at once to the only surgery in the place  i helped them in emptying the cart and placing in it some pillows for the wounded man to rest on and it was only when the driver had mounted to his place and was starting for the surgery that i bethought me of the strange power i possessed of undoing all this harm  now is my time  i said to myself as i moved back the hand of the watch and saw almost without surprise this time all things restored to the places they had occupied at the critical moment when i had first noticed the fallen packingcase  instantly i stepped out into the street picked up the box and replaced it in the cart in the next moment the bicycle had spun round the corner passed the cart without let or hindrance and soon vanished in the distance in a cloud of dust  delightful power of magic  i thought how much of human suffering i havenot only relieved but actually annihilated  and in a glow of conscious virtue i stood watching the unloading of the cart still holding the magic watch open in my hand as i was curious to see what would happen when we again reached the exact time at which i had put back the hand  the result was one that if only i had considered the thing carefully i might have foreseen as the hand of the watch touched the mark the springcartwhich had driven off and was by this time halfway down the street was back again at the door and in the act of starting whileoh woe for the golden dream of worldwide benevolence that had dazzled my dreaming fancythe wounded youth was once more reclining on the heap of pillows his pale face set rigidly in the hard lines that told of pain resolutely endured  oh mocking magic watch  i said to myself as i passed out of the little town and took the seaward road that led to my lodgings the good i fancied i could do is vanished like a dream the evil of this troublesome world is the only abiding reality  and now i must record an experience so strange that i think it only fair before beginning to relate it to release my muchenduring reader from any obligation he may feel to believe this part of my story i would not have believed it i freely confess if i had not seen it with my own eyes then why should i expect it of my reader who quite possibly has never seen anything of the sort  i was passing a pretty little villa which stood rather back from the road in its own grounds with bright flowerbeds in frontcreepers wandering over the walls and hanging in festoons about the bowwindows an easychair forgotten on the lawn with a newspaper lying near it a small pugdog couchant before it resolved to guard the treasure even at the sacrifice of lifeand a frontdoor standing invitingly halfopen  here is my chance i thought for testing the reverse action of the magic watch  i pressed the reversalpeg and walked in in another house the entrance of a stranger might cause surprise perhaps anger even going so far as to expel the said stranger with violence but here i knew nothing of the sort could happen the ordinary course of events first to think nothing about me then hearing my footsteps to look up and see me and then to wonder what business i had therewould be reversed by the action of my watch they would first wonder who i was then see me then look down and think no more about me  and as to being expelled with violence that event would necessarily come first in this case  so if i can once get in i said to myself all risk of expulsion will be over  imagethe pugdog sat up  the pugdog sat up as a precautionary measure as i passed but as i took no notice of the treasure he was guarding he let me go by without even one remonstrant bark  he that takes my life he seemed to be saying wheezily to himself takes trash but he that takes the daily telegraph  but this awful contingency i did not face  the party in the drawingroomi had walked straight in you understand without ringing the bell or giving any notice of my approach consisted of four laughing rosy children of ages from about fourteen down to ten who were apparently all coming towards the door i found they were really walking backwards while their mother seated by the fire with some needlework on her lap was saying just as i entered the room now girls you may get your things on for a walk  to my utter astonishmentfor i was not yet accustomed to the action of the watch all smiles ceased as browning says on the four pretty faces and they all got out pieces of needlework and sat down no one noticed me in the least as i quietly took a chair and sat down to watch them  when the needlework had been unfolded and they were all ready to begin their mother said come thats done at last  you may fold up your work girls but the children took no notice whatever of the remark on the contrary they set to work at once sewingif that is the proper word to describe an operation such as i had never before witnessed  each of them threaded her needle with a short end of thread attached to the work which was instantly pulled by an invisible force through the stuff dragging the needle after it the nimble fingers of the little sempstress caught it at the other side but only to lose it again the next moment  and so the work went on steadily undoing itself and the neatlystitched little dresses or whatever they were steadily falling to pieces  now and then one of the children would pause as the recovered thread became inconveniently long wind it on a bobbin and start again with another short end  at last all the work was picked to pieces and put away and the lady led the way into the next room walking backwards and making the insane remark not yet dear we must get the sewing done first after which i was not surprised to see the children skipping backwards after her exclaiming oh mother it is such a lovely day for a walk  in the diningroom the table had only dirty plates and empty dishes on it however the partywith the addition of a gentleman as goodnatured and as rosy as the childrenseated themselves at it very contentedly  you have seen people eating cherrytart and every now and then cautiously conveying a cherrystone from their lips to their plates well something like that went on all through this ghastlyor shall we say ghostlybanquet  an empty fork is raised to the lips there it receives a neatlycut piece of mutton and swiftly conveys it to the plate where it instantly attaches itself to the mutton already there soon one of the plates furnished with a complete slice of mutton and two potatoes was handed up to the presiding gentleman who quietly replaced the slice on the joint and the potatoes in the dish  their conversation was if possible more bewildering than their mode of dining  it began by the youngest girl suddenly and without provocation addressing her eldest sister oh you wicked storyteller she said  i expected a sharp reply from the sister but instead of this she turned laughingly to her father and said in a very loud stagewhisper to be a bride  the father in order to do his part in a conversation that seemed only fit for lunatics replied whisper it to me dear  but she didnt whisper these children never did anything they were told she said quite loud of course not  everybody knows what dotty wants  and little dolly shrugged her shoulders and said with a pretty pettishness now father youre not to tease you know i dont want to be bridesmaid to anybody  and dollys to be the fourth was her fathers idiotic reply  here number three put in her oar  oh it is settled mother dear really and truly  mary told us all about it  its to be next tuesday four weeksand three of her cousins are coming to be bridesmaids and  she doesnt forget it minnie the mother laughingly replied i do wish theyd get it settled  i dont like long engagements  and minnie wound up the conversationif so chaotic a series of remarks deserves the namewith only think  we passed the cedars this morning just exactly as mary davenant was standing at the gate wishing goodbye to misteri forget his name  of course we looked the other way  by this time i was so hopelessly confused that i gave up listening and followed the dinner down into the kitchen  but to you o hypercritical reader resolute to believe no item of this weird adventure what need to tell how the mutton was placed on the spit and slowly unroastedhow the potatoes were wrapped in their skins and handed over to the gardener to be buriedhow when the mutton had at length attained to rawness the fire which had gradually changed from redheat to a mere blaze died down so suddenly that the cook had only just time to catch its last flicker on the end of a matchor how the maid having taken the mutton off the spit carried it backwards of course out of the house to meet the butcher who was coming also backwards down the road  the longer i thought over this strange adventure the more hopelessly tangled the mystery became and it was a real relief to meet arthur in the road and get him to go with me up to the hall to learn what news the telegraph had brought  i told him as we went what had happened at the station but as to my further adventures i thought it best for the present to say nothing  the earl was sitting alone when we entered  i am glad you are come in to keep me company he said  muriel is gone to bedthe excitement of that terrible scene was too much for herand eric has gone to the hotel to pack his things to start for london by the early train  then the telegram has come  i said  did you not hear  oh i had forgotten it came in after you left the station  yes its all right eric has got his commission and now that he has arranged matters with muriel he has business in town that must be seen to at once  what arrangement do you mean  i asked with a sinking heart as the thought of arthurs crushed hopes came to my mind  do you mean that they are engaged  they have been engagedin a sensefor two years the old man gently replied  that is he has had my promise to consent to it so soon as he could secure a permanent and settled line in life  i could never be happy with my child married to a man without an object to live forwithout even an object to die for  i hope they will be happy a strange voice said  the speaker was evidently in the room but i had not heard the door open and i looked round in some astonishment  the earl seemed to share my surprise who spoke he exclaimed  it was i said arthur looking at us with a worn haggard face and eyes from which the light of life seemed suddenly to have faded and let me wish you joy also dear friend he added looking sadly at the earl and speaking in the same hollow tones that had startled us so much  thank you the old man said simply and heartily  a silence followed then i rose feeling sure that arthur would wish to be alone and bade our gentle host good night arthur took his hand but said nothing nor did he speak again as we went home till we were in the house and had lit our bedroom candles  then he said more to himself than to me the heart knoweth its own bitterness i never understood those words till now  the next few days passed wearily enough  i felt no inclination to call by myself at the hall still less to propose that arthur should go with me it seemed better to wait till timethat gentle healer of our bitterest sorrows should have helped him to recover from the first shock of the disappointment that had blighted his life  business however soon demanded my presence in town and i had to announce to arthur that i must leave him for a while but i hope to run down again in a month i added  i would stay now if i could i dont think its good for you to be alone  no i cant face solitude here for long said arthur  but dont think about me  i have made up my mind to accept a post in india that has been offered me  out there i suppose i shall find something to live for i cant see anything at present  this life of mine i guard as gods high gift from scathe and wrong not greatly care to lose  yes i said your namesake bore as heavy a blow and lived through it  a far heavier one than mine said arthur  the woman he loved proved false  there is no such cloud as that on my memory ofof he left the name unuttered and went on hurriedly but you will return will you not  yes i shall come back for a short time  do said arthur and you shall write and tell me of our friends ill send you my address when im settled down   chapter 24  the frogs birthdaytreat  and so it came to pass that just a week after the day when my fairyfriends first appeared as children i found myself taking a farewellstroll through the wood in the hope of meeting them once more  i had but to stretch myself on the smooth turf and the eerie feeling was on me in a moment  put oor ear welly low down said bruno and ill tell oo a secret its the frogs birthdaytreatand weve lost the baby  what baby  i said quite bewildered by this complicated piece of news  the queens baby a course said bruno  titanias baby  and wes welly sorry  sylvie shesoh so sorry  how sorry is she  i asked mischievously  threequarters of a yard bruno replied with perfect solemnity and im a little sorry too he added shutting his eyes so as not to see that he was smiling  and what are you doing about the baby  well the soldiers are all looking for itup and down everywhere  the soldiers  i exclaimed  yes a course said bruno  when theres no fighting to be done the soldiers doos any little odd jobs oo know  i was amused at the idea of its being a little odd job to find the royal baby  but how did you come to lose it  i asked  we put it in a flower sylvie who had just joined us explained with her eyes full of tears  only we cant remember which  she says us put it in a flower bruno interrupted cause she doosnt want i to get punished  but it were really me what put it there sylvie were picking dindledums  imagethe queens baby  you shouldnt say us put it in a flower sylvie very gravely remarked  well hus then said bruno  i never can remember those horrid hs  let me help you to look for it i said  so sylvie and i made a voyage of discovery among all the flowers but there was no baby to be seen  whats become of bruno  i said when we had completed our tour  hes down in the ditch there said sylvie amusing a young frog  i went down on my hands and knees to look for him for i felt very curious to know how young frogs ought to be amused  after a minutes search i found him sitting at the edge of the ditch by the side of the little frog and looking rather disconsolate  how are you getting on bruno  i said nodding to him as he looked up  cant amuse it no more bruno answered very dolefully cause it wont say what it would like to do next  ive showed it all the duckweedsand a live caddisworm but it wont say nuffin whatwould oo like he shouted into the ear of the frog but the little creature sat quite still and took no notice of him its deaf i think  bruno said turning away with a sigh and its time to get the theatre ready  who are the audience to be  only but frogs said bruno  but they havent comed yet they wants to be drove up like sheep  would it save time i suggested if i were to walk round with sylvie to drive up the frogs while you get the theatre ready  that are a good plan cried bruno  but where are sylvie  im here said sylvie peeping over the edge of the bank i was just watching two frogs that were having a race  which won it  bruno eagerly inquired  sylvie was puzzled  he does ask such hard questions she confided to me  and whats to happen in the theatre  i asked  first they have their birthdayfeast sylvie said then bruno does some bits of shakespeare then he tells them a story  i should think the frogs like the feast best  dont they  well theres generally very few of them that get any  they will keep their mouths shut so tight  and its just as well they do she added because bruno likes to cook it himself and he cooks very queerly now theyre all in  would you just help me to put them with their heads the right way  we soon managed this part of the business though the frogs kept up a most discontented croaking all the time  what are they saying  i asked sylvie  theyre saying fork fork its very silly of them  youre not going to have forks she announced with some severity  those that want any feast have just got to open their mouths and bruno ll put some of it in  at this moment bruno appeared wearing a little white apron to show that he was a cook and carrying a tureen full of very queerlooking soup  i watched very carefully as he moved about among the frogs but i could not see that any of them opened their mouths to be fed except one very young one and im nearly sure it did it accidentally in yawning  however bruno instantly put a large spoonful of soup into its mouth and the poor little thing coughed violently for some time  so sylvie and i had to share the soup between us and to pretend to enjoy it for it certainly was very queerly cooked  i only ventured to take one spoonful of it sylvies summersoup bruno said it was and must candidly confess that it was not at all nice and i could not feel surprised that so many of the guests had kept their mouths shut up tight  whats the soup made of bruno said sylvie who had put a spoonful of it to her lips and was making a wry face over it  and brunos answer was anything but encouraging  bits of things  the entertainment was to conclude with bits of shakespeare as sylvie expressed it which were all to be done by bruno sylvie being fully engaged in making the frogs keep their heads towards the stage after which bruno was to appear in his real character and tell them a story of his own invention  will the story have a moral to it  i asked sylvie while bruno was away behind the hedge dressing for the first bit  i think so sylvie replied doubtfully  there generally is a moral only he puts it in too soon  and will he say all the bits of shakespeare  no hell only act them said sylvie  he knows hardly any of the words  when i see what hes dressed like ive to tell the frogs what character it is  theyre always in such a hurry to guess dont you hear them all saying what what and so indeed they were it had only sounded like croaking till sylvie explained it but i could now make out the wawt  wawt quite distinctly  but why do they try to guess it before they see it  i dont know sylvie said but they always do  sometimes they begin guessing weeks and weeks before the day  so now when you hear the frogs croaking in a particularly melancholy way you may be sure theyre trying to guess brunos next shakespeare bit  isnt that interesting  however the chorus of guessing was cut short by bruno who suddenly rushed on from behind the scenes and took a flying leap down among the frogs to rearrange them  for the oldest and fattest frogwho had never been properly arranged so that he could see the stage and so had no idea what was going onwas getting restless and had upset several of the frogs and turned others round with their heads the wrong way  and it was no good at all bruno said to do a bit of shakespeare when there was nobody to look at it you see he didnt count me as anybody  so he set to work with a stick stirring them up very much as you would stir up tea in a cup till most of them had at least one great stupid eye gazing at the stage  oo must come and sit among them sylvie he said in despair ive put these two sidebyside with their noses the same way ever so many times but they do squarrel so  so sylvie took her place as mistress of the ceremonies and bruno vanished again behind the scenes to dress for the first bit  hamlet was suddenly proclaimed in the clear sweet tones i knew so well  the croaking all ceased in a moment and i turned to the stage in some curiosity to see what brunos ideas were as to the behaviour of shakespeares greatest character  according to this eminent interpreter of the drama hamlet wore a short black cloak which he chiefly used for muffling up his face as if he suffered a good deal from toothache and turned out his toes very much as he walked  to be or not to be  hamlet remarked in a cheerful tone and then turned headoverheels several times his cloak dropping off in the performance  i felt a little disappointed brunos conception of the part seemed so wanting in dignity  wont he say any more of the speech  i whispered to sylvie  i think not sylvie whispered in reply  he generally turns headoverheels when he doesnt know any more words  bruno had meanwhile settled the question by disappearing from the stage and the frogs instantly began inquiring the name of the next character  youll know directly cried sylvie as she adjusted two or three young frogs that had struggled round with their backs to the stage macbeth she added as bruno reappeared  macbeth had something twisted round him that went over one shoulder and under the other arm and was meant i believe for a scotch plaid he had a thorn in his hand which he held out at arms length as if he were a little afraid of it  is this a dagger  macbeth inquired in a puzzled sort of tone and instantly a chorus of thorn  thorn arose from the frogs i had quite learned to understand their croaking by this time  its a dagger  sylvie proclaimed in a peremptory tone hold your tongues  and the croaking ceased at once  shakespeare has not told us so far as i know that macbeth had any such eccentric habit as turning headoverheels in private life but bruno evidently considered it quite an essential part of the character and left the stage in a series of somersaults  however he was back again in a few moments having tucked under his chin the end of a tuft of wool probably left on the thorn by a wandering sheep which made a magnificent beard that reached nearly down to his feet  shylock  sylvie proclaimed  no i beg your pardon she hastily corrected herself king lear  i hadnt noticed the crown bruno had very cleverly provided one which fitted him exactly by cutting out the centre of a dandelion to make room for his head  king lear folded his arms to the imminent peril of his beard and said in a mild explanatory tone ay every inch a king and then paused as if to consider how this could best be proved  and here with all possible deference to bruno as a shakespearian critic i must express my opinion that the poet did not mean his three great tragic heroes to be so strangely alike in their personal habits nor do i believe that he would have accepted the faculty of turning headoverheels as any proof at all of royal descent  yet it appeared that king lear after deep meditation could think of no other argument by which to prove his kingship and as this was the last of the bits of shakespeare we never do more than three sylvie explained in a whisper bruno gave the audience quite a long series of somersaults before he finally retired leaving the enraptured frogs all crying out more more which i suppose was their way of encoring a performance but bruno wouldnt appear again till the proper time came for telling the story  imagethe frogs birthdaytreat  when he appeared at last in his real character i noticed a remarkable change in his behaviour  he tried no more somersaults  it was clearly his opinion that however suitable the habit of turning headoverheels might be to such petty individuals as hamlet and king lear it would never do for bruno to sacrifice his dignity to such an extent  but it was equally clear that he did not feel entirely at his ease standing all alone on the stage with no costume to disguise him and though he began several times  there were a mouse he kept glancing up and down and on all sides as if in search of more comfortable quarters from which to tell the story  standing on one side of the stage and partly overshadowing it was a tall foxglove which seemed as the evening breeze gently swayed it hither and thither to offer exactly the sort of accommodation that the orator desired  having once decided on his quarters it needed only a second or two for him to run up the stem like a tiny squirrel and to seat himself astride on the topmost bend where the fairybells clustered most closely and from whence he could look down on his audience from such a height that all shyness vanished and he began his story merrily  once there were a mouse and a crocodile and a man and a goat and a lion i had never heard the dramatis personae tumbled into a story with such profusion and in such reckless haste and it fairly took my breath away  even sylvie gave a little gasp and allowed three of the frogs who seemed to be getting tired of the entertainment to hop away into the ditch without attempting to stop them  and the mouse found a shoe and it thought it were a mousetrap so it got right in and it stayed in ever so long  why did it stay in said sylvie  her function seemed to be much the same as that of the chorus in a greek play she had to encourage the orator and draw him out by a series of intelligent questions  cause it thought it couldnt get out again bruno explained it were a clever mouse  it knew it couldnt get out of traps  but why did it go in at all said sylvie  and it jamp and it jamp bruno proceeded ignoring this question and at last it got right out again  and it looked at the mark in the shoe  and the mans name were in it  so it knew it wasnt its own shoe  had it thought it was said sylvie  why didnt i tell oo it thought it were a mousetrap the indignant orator replied  please mister sir will oo make sylvie attend sylvie was silenced and was all attention in fact she and i were most of the audience now as the frogs kept hopping away and there were very few of them left  so the mouse gave the man his shoe  and the man were welly glad cause he hadnt got but one shoe and he were hopping to get the other  here i ventured on a question  do you mean hopping or hoping  bofe said bruno  and the man took the goat out of the sack we havent heard of the sack before i said  nor you wont hear of it again said bruno  and he said to the goat oo will walk about here till i comes back and he went and he tumbled into a deep hole and the goat walked round and round  and it walked under the tree and it wug its tail  and it looked up in the tree  and it sang a sad little song  oo never heard such a sad little song  can you sing it bruno  i asked  iss i can bruno readily replied  and i sant  it would make sylvie cry  it wouldnt sylvie interrupted in great indignation and i dont believe the goat sang it at all  it did though said bruno  it singed it right froo i sawed it singing with its long beard  it couldnt sing with its beard i said hoping to puzzle the little fellow a beard isnt a voice  well then oo couldnt walk with sylvie  bruno cried triumphantly sylvie isnt a foot  i thought i had better follow sylvies example and be silent for a while  bruno was too sharp for us  and when it had singed all the song it ran awayfor to get along to look for the man oo know and the crocodile got along after itfor to bite it oo know  and the mouse got along after the crocodile  wasnt the crocodile running  sylvie enquired  she appealed to me crocodiles do run dont they  i suggested crawling as the proper word  he wasnt running said bruno and he wasnt crawling he went struggling along like a portmanteau  and he held his chin ever so high in the air  what did he do that for said sylvie  cause he hadnt got a toofache said bruno  cant oo make out nuffin wizout i splain it  why if hed had a toofache a course hed have held his head downlike thisand hed have put a lot of warm blankets round it  if hed had any blankets sylvie argued  course he had blankets retorted her brother  doos oo think crocodiles goes walks wizout blankets  and he frowned with his eyebrows  and the goat was welly flightened at his eyebrows  id never be afraid of eyebrows exclaimed sylvie  i should think oo would though if theyd got a crocodile fastened to them like these had  and so the man jamp and he jamp and at last he got right out of the hole  sylvie gave another little gasp this rapid dodging about among the characters of the story had taken away her breath  and he runned away for to look for the goat oo know  and he heard the lion grunting  lions dont grunt said sylvie  this one did said bruno  and its mouth were like a large cupboard and it had plenty of room in its mouth  and the lion runned after the man for to eat him oo know  and the mouse runned after the lion  but the mouse was running after the crocodile i said he couldnt run after both  bruno sighed over the density of his audience but explained very patiently  he did runned after bofe cause they went the same way and first he caught the crocodile and then he didnt catch the lion and when hed caught the crocodile what doos oo think he didcause hed got pincers in his pocket  i cant guess said sylvie  imagehe wrenched out that crocodiles toof  nobody couldnt guess it  bruno cried in high glee why he wrenched out that crocodiles toof  which tooth  i ventured to ask  but bruno was not to be puzzled  the toof he were going to bite the goat with a course  he couldnt be sure about that i argued  unless he wrenched out all its teeth  bruno laughed merrily and half sang as he swung himself backwards and forwards he didwrenchedoutall its teef  why did the crocodile wait to have them wrenched out said sylvie  it had to wait said bruno  i ventured on another question  but what became of the man who said you may wait here till i come back  he didnt say oo may bruno explained  he said oo will just like sylvie says to me oo will do oor lessons till twelve oclock oh i wiss he added with a little sigh i wiss sylvie would say oo may do oor lessons  this was a dangerous subject for discussion sylvie seemed to think she returned to the story  but what became of the man  well the lion springed at him  but it came so slow it were three weeks in the air  did the man wait for it all that time  i said  course he didnt  bruno replied gliding headfirst down the stem of the foxglove for the story was evidently close to its end he sold his house and he packed up his things while the lion were coming  and he went and he lived in another town  so the lion ate the wrong man  this was evidently the moral so sylvie made her final proclamation to the frogs  the storys finished  and whatever is to be learned from it she added aside to me im sure i dont know  i did not feel quite clear about it myself so made no suggestion but the frogs seemed quite content moral or no moral and merely raised a husky chorus of off off as they hopped away   chapter 25  looking eastward  its just a week i said three days later to arthur since we heard of lady muriels engagement  i think i ought to call at any rate and offer my congratulations  wont you come with me  a pained expression passed over his face  when must you leave us he asked  by the first train on monday  wellyes i will come with you  it would seem strange and unfriendly if i didnt  but this is only friday  give me till sunday afternoon i shall be stronger then  shading his eyes with one hand as if halfashamed of the tears that were coursing down his cheeks he held the other out to me it trembled as i clasped it  i tried to frame some words of sympathy but they seemed poor and cold and i left them unspoken good night was all i said  good night dear friend he replied  there was a manly vigour in his tone that convinced me he was wrestling with and triumphing over the great sorrow that had so nearly wrecked his lifeand that on the steppingstone of his dead self he would surely rise to higher things  there was no chance i was glad to think as we set out on sunday afternoon of meeting eric at the hall as he had returned to town the day after his engagement was announced  his presence might have disturbed the calmthe almost unnatural calmwith which arthur met the woman who had won his heart and murmured the few graceful words of sympathy that the occasion demanded  lady muriel was perfectly radiant with happiness sadness could not live in the light of such a smile and even arthur brightened under it and when she remarked you see im watering my flowers though it is the sabbathday his voice had almost its old ring of cheerfulness as he replied even on the sabbathday works of mercy are allowed but this isnt the sabbathday  the sabbathday has ceased to exist  i know its not saturday lady muriel replied but isnt sunday often called the christian sabbath  it is so called i think in recognition of the spirit of the jewish institution that one day in seven should be a day of rest but i hold that christians are freed from the literal observance of the fourth commandment  then where is our authority for sunday observance  we have first the fact that the seventh day was sanctified when god rested from the work of creation  that is binding on us as theists  secondly we have the fact that the lords day is a christian institution  that is binding on us as christians  and your practical rules would be  first as theists to keep it holy in some special way and to make it so far as is reasonably possible a day of rest  secondly as christians to attend public worship  and what of amusements  i would say of them as of all kinds of work whatever is innocent on a weekday is innocent on sunday provided it does not interfere with the duties of the day  then you would allow children to play on sunday  certainly i should  why make the day irksome to their restless natures  i have a letter somewhere said lady muriel from an old friend describing the way in which sunday was kept in her younger days i will fetch it for you  i had a similar description viva voce years ago arthur said when she had left us from a little girl  it was really touching to hear the melancholy tone in which she said on sunday i mustnt play with my doll  on sunday i mustnt run on the sands  on sunday i mustnt dig in the garden poor child  she had indeed abundant cause for hating sunday  here is the letter said lady muriel returning let me read you a piece of it  when as a child i first opened my eyes on a sundaymorning a feeling of dismal anticipation which began at least on the friday culminated  i knew what was before me and my wish if not my word was would god it were evening it was no day of rest but a day of texts of catechisms watts of tracts about converted swearers godly charwomen and edifying deaths of sinners saved  up with the lark hymns and portions of scripture had to be learned by heart till 8 oclock when there were familyprayers then breakfast which i was never able to enjoy partly from the fast already undergone and partly from the outlook i dreaded  at 9 came sundayschool and it made me indignant to be put into the class with the villagechildren as well as alarmed lest by some mistake of mine i should be put below them  the churchservice was a veritable wilderness of zin  i wandered in it pitching the tabernacle of my thoughts on the lining of the square familypew the fidgets of my small brothers and the horror of knowing that on the monday i should have to write out from memory jottings of the rambling disconnected extempore sermon which might have had any text but its own and to stand or fall by the result  this was followed by a cold dinner at 1 servants to have no work sundayschool again from 2 to 4 and eveningservice at 6 the intervals were perhaps the greatest trial of all from the efforts i had to make to be less than usually sinful by reading books and sermons as barren as the dead sea there was but one rosy spot in the distance all that day and that was bedtime which never could come too early  such teaching was well meant no doubt said arthur but it must have driven many of its victims into deserting the churchservices altogether  im afraid i was a deserter this morning she gravely said  i had to write to eric  would youwould you mind my telling you something he said about prayer  it had never struck me in that light before  in what light said arthur  why that all nature goes by fixed regular lawsscience has proved that  so that asking god to do anything except of course praying for spiritual blessings is to expect a miracle and weve no right to do that  ive not put it as well as he did but that was the outcome of it and it has confused me  please tell me what you can say in answer to it  i dont propose to discuss captain lindons difficulties arthur gravely replied specially as he is not present  but if it is your difficulty his voice unconsciously took a tenderer tone then i will speak  it is my difficulty she said anxiously  then i will begin by asking why did you except spiritual blessings is not your mind a part of nature  yes but freewill comes in therei can choose this or that and god can influence my choice  then you are not a fatalist  oh no she earnestly exclaimed  thank god  arthur said to himself but in so low a whisper that only i heard it  you grant then that i can by an act of free choice move this cup suiting the action to the word this way or that way  yes i grant it  well let us see how far the result is produced by fixed laws the cup moves because certain mechanical forces are impressed on it by my hand  my hand moves because certain forceselectric magnetic or whatever nerveforce may prove to beare impressed on it by my brain  this nerveforce stored in the brain would probably be traceable if science were complete to chemical forces supplied to the brain by the blood and ultimately derived from the food i eat and the air i breathe  but would not that be fatalism  where would freewill come in  in choice of nerves replied arthur  the nerveforce in the brain may flow just as naturally down one nerve as down another we need something more than a fixed law of nature to settle which nerve shall carry it  that something is freewill  her eyes sparkled i see what you mean she exclaimed human freewill is an exception to the system of fixed law eric said something like that  and then i think he pointed out that god can only influence nature by influencing human wills so that we might reasonably pray give us this day our daily bread because many of the causes that produce bread are under mans control but to pray for rain or fine weather would be as unreasonable as she checked herself as if fearful of saying something irreverent  in a hushed low tone that trembled with emotion and with the solemnity of one in the presence of death arthur slowly replied shalt he that contendeth with the almighty instruct him  shall we the swarm that in the noontide beam were born feeling in ourselves the power to direct this way or that the forces of natureof nature of which we form so trivial a partshall we in our boundless arrogance in our pitiful conceit deny that power to the ancient of days saying to our creator thus far and no further  thou madest but thou canst not rule  lady muriel had covered her face in her hands and did not look up she only murmured thanks thanks again and again  we rose to go  arthur said with evident effort one word more if you would know the power of prayerin anything and everything that man can need try it  ask and it shall be given you ihave tried it i know that god answers prayer  our walk home was a silent one till we had nearly reached the lodgings then arthur murmuredand it was almost an echo of my own thoughtswhat knowest thou o wife whether thou shalt save thy husband  the subject was not touched on again  we sat on talking while hour after hour of this our last night together glided away unnoticed he had much to tell me about india and the new life he was going to and the work he hoped to do  and his great generous soul seemed so filled with noble ambition as to have no space left for any vain regret or selfish repining  come it is nearly morning  arthur said at last rising and leading the way upstairs  the sun will be rising in a few minutes and though i have basely defrauded you of your last chance of a nights rest here im sure youll forgive me for i really couldnt bring myself to say good night sooner  and god knows whether youll ever see me again or hear of me  hear of you i am certain i shall  i warmly responded and quoted the concluding lines of that strange poem waring       oh never star     was lost here but it rose afar     look east where whole new thousands are     in vishnuland what avatar  aye look eastward  arthur eagerly replied pausing at the staircase window which commanded a fine view of the sea and the eastward horizon  the west is the fitting tomb for all the sorrow and the sighing all the errors and the follies of the past for all its withered hopes and all its buried loves  from the east comes new strength new ambition new hope new life new love  look eastward aye look eastward  his last words were still ringing in my ears as i entered my room and undrew the windowcurtains just in time to see the sun burst in glory from his oceanprison and clothe the world in the light of a new day  so may it be for him and me and all of us  i mused  all that is evil and dead and hopeless fading with the night that is past all that is good and living and hopeful rising with the dawn of day  fading with the night the chilly mists and the noxious vapours and the heavy shadows and the wailing gusts and the owls melancholy hootings rising with the day the darting shafts of light and the wholesome morning breeze and the warmth of a dawning life and the mad music of the lark  look eastward  fading with the night the clouds of ignorance and the deadly blight of sin and the silent tears of sorrow and ever rising higher higher with the day the radiant dawn of knowledge and the sweet breath of purity and the throb of a worlds ecstasy  look eastward  imagelook eastward  fading with the night the memory of a dead love and the withered leaves of a blighted hope and the sickly repinings and moody regrets thatnumb the best energies of the soul and rising broadening rolling upward like a living flood the manly resolve and the dauntless will and the heavenward gaze of faiththe substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen  look eastward  aye look eastward
