38157442	westward ho   by charles kingsley    to  the rajah sir james brooke kcb  and  george augustus selwyn dd  bishop of new zealand   this book is dedicated   by one who unknown to them has no other method of expressing his admiration and reverence for their characters  that type of english virtue at once manful and godly practical and enthusiastic prudent and selfsacrificing which he has tried to depict in these pages they have exhibited in a form even purer and more heroic than that in which he has drest it and than that in which it was exhibited by the worthies whom elizabeth without distinction of rank or age gathered round her in the ever glorious wars of her great reign  c k  february 1855    contents   introduction  i     how mr oxenham saw the white bird  ii    how

how mr oxenham saw the white bird       the hollow oak our palace is         our heritage the sea  all who have travelled through the delicious scenery of north devon must needs know the little white town of bideford which slopes upwards from its broad tideriver paved with yellow sands and manyarched old bridge where salmon wait for autumn floods toward the pleasant upland on the west above the town the hills close in cushioned with deep oak woods through which juts here and there a crag of fernfringed slate below they lower and open more and more in softly rounded knolls and fertile squares of red and green till they sink into the wide expanse of hazy flats rich saltmarshes and rolling sandhills where torridge joins her sister taw and both together flow quietly toward the broad surges of the bar and the everlasting thunder of the long atlantic swell pleasantly the old town stands there beneath its soft italian sky fanned day and night by the fresh ocean breeze which forbids alike the keen winter frosts and the fierce thunder heats of the midland and pleasantly it has stood there for now perhaps eight hundred years since the first grenville cousin of the conqueror returning from the conquest of south wales drew round him trusty saxon serfs and free norse rovers with their golden curls and dark silurian britons from the swansea shore and all the mingled blood which still gives to the seaward folk of the next county their strength and intellect and even in these levelling days their peculiar beauty of face and form  but at the time whereof i write bideford was not merely a pleasant country town whose quay was haunted by a few coasting craft it was one of the chief ports of england it furnished seven ships to fight the armada even more than a century afterwards say the chroniclers it sent more vessels to the northern trade than any port in england saving strange juxtaposition london and topsham and was the centre of a local civilization and enterprise small perhaps compared with the vast efforts of the present day but who dare despise the day of small things if it has proved to be the dawn of mighty ones and it is to the sealife and labor of bideford and dartmouth and topsham and plymouth then a petty place and many another little western town that england owes the foundation of her naval and commercial glory it was the men of devon the drakes and hawkins gilberts and raleighs grenvilles and oxenhams and a host more of forgotten worthies whom we shall learn one day to honor as they deserve to whom she owes her commerce her colonies her very existence for had they not first crippled by their west indian raids the illgotten resources of the spaniard and then crushed his last huge effort in britains salamis the glorious fight of 1588 what had we been by now but a popish appanage of a worldtyranny as cruel as heathen rome itself and far more devilish  it is in memory of these men their voyages and their battles their faith and their valor their heroic lives and no less heroic deaths that i write this book and if now and then i shall seem to warm into a style somewhat too stilted and pompous let me be excused for my subjects sake fit rather to have been sung than said and to have proclaimed to all true english hearts not as a novel but as an epic which some man may yet gird himself to write the same great message which the songs of troy and the persian wars and the trophies of marathon and salamis spoke to the hearts of all true greeks of old   one bright summers afternoon in the year of grace 1575 a tall and fair boy came lingering along bideford quay in his scholars gown with satchel and slate in hand watching wistfully the shipping and the sailors till just after he had passed the bottom of the high street he came opposite to one of the many taverns which looked out upon the river in the open bay window sat merchants and gentlemen discoursing over their afternoons draught of sack and outside the door was gathered a group of sailors listening earnestly to some one who stood in the midst the boy all alive for any seanews must needs go up to them and take his place among the sailorlads who were peeping and whispering under the elbows of the men and so came in for the following speech delivered in a loud bold voice with a strong devonshire accent and a fair sprinkling of oaths  if you dont believe me go and see or stay here and grow all over blue mould i tell you as i am a gentleman i saw it with these eyes and so did salvation yeo there through a window in the lower room and we measured the heap as i am a christened man seventy foot long ten foot broad and twelve foot high of silver bars and each bar between a thirty and forty pound weight and says captain drake there my lads of devon ive brought you to the mouth of the worlds treasurehouse and its your own fault now if you dont sweep it out as empty as a stockfish  why didnt you bring some of they home then mr oxenham  why werent you there to help to carry them we would have brought em away safe enough and young drake and i had broke the door abroad already but captain drake goes off in a dead faint and when we came to look he had a wound in his leg you might have laid three fingers in and his boots were full of blood and had been for an hour or more but the heart of him was that that he never knew it till he dropped and then his brother and i got him away to the boats he kicking and struggling and bidding us let him go on with the fight though every step he took in the sand was in a pool of blood and so we got off and tell me ye sons of shotten herrings wasnt it worth more to save him than the dirty silver for silver we can get again brave boys theres more fish in the sea than ever came out of it and more silver in nombre de dios than would pave all the streets in the west country but of such captains as franky drake heaven never makes but one at a time and if we lose him goodbye to englands luck say i and who dont agree let him choose his weapons and im his man  he who delivered this harangue was a tall and sturdy personage with a florid blackbearded face and bold restless dark eyes who leaned with crossed legs and arms akimbo against the wall of the house and seemed in the eyes of the schoolboy a very magnifico some prince or duke at least he was dressed contrary to all sumptuary laws of the time in a suit of crimson velvet a little the worse perhaps for wear by his side were a long spanish rapier and a brace of daggers gaudy enough about the hilts his fingers sparkled with rings he had two or three gold chains about his neck and large earrings in his ears behind one of which a red rose was stuck jauntily enough among the glossy black curls on his head was a broad velvet spanish hat in which instead of a feather was fastened with a great gold clasp a whole quezal bird whose gorgeous plumage of fretted golden green shone like one entire precious stone as he finished his speech he took off the said hat and looking at the bird in it  look ye my lads did you ever see such a fowl as that before thats the bird which the old indian kings of mexico let no one wear but their own selves and therefore i wear iti john oxenham of south tawton for a sign to all brave lads of devon that as the spaniards are the masters of the indians were the masters of the spaniards and he replaced his hat  a murmur of applause followed but one hinted that he doubted the spaniards were too many for them  too many how many men did we take nombre de dios with seventythree were we and no more when we sailed out of plymouth sound and before we saw the spanish main half were gastados used up as the dons say with the scurvy and in port pheasant captain rawse of cowes fell in with us and that gave us some thirty hands more and with that handful my lads only fiftythree in all we picked the lock of the new world and whom did we lose but our trumpeter who stood braying like an ass in the middle of the square instead of taking care of his neck like a christian i tell you those spaniards are rank cowards as all bullies are they pray to a woman the idolatrous rascals and no wonder they fight like women  youm right captain sang out a tall gaunt fellow who stood close to him one westcountryman can fight two easterlings and an easterling can beat three dons any day eh my lads of devon       for o its the herrings and the good brown beef        and the cider and the cream so white      o they are the making of the jolly devon lads        for to play and eke to fight  come said oxenham come along who lists who lists wholl make his fortune       oh who will join jolly mariners all         and who will join says he o      to fill his pockets with the good red goold         by sailing on the sea o  wholl list cried the gaunt man again nows your time weve got forty men to plymouth now ready to sail the minute we get back and we want a dozen out of you bideford men and just a boy or two and then wem off and away and make our fortunes or go to heaven       our bodies in the sea so deep         our souls in heaven to rest      where valiant seamen one and all         hereafter shall be blest  now said oxenham you wont let the plymouth men say that the bideford men darent follow them north devon against south it is wholl join wholl join it is but a step of a way after all and sailing as smooth as a duckpond as soon as youre past cape finisterre ill run a clovelly herringboat there and back for a wager of twenty pound and never ship a bucketful all the way wholl join dont think youre buying a pig in a poke i know the road and salvation yeo here too who was the gunners mate as well as i do the narrow seas and better you ask him to show you the chart of it now and see if he dont tell you over the ruttier as well as drake himself  on which the gaunt man pulled from under his arm a great white buffalo horn covered with rough etchings of land and sea and held it up to the admiring ring  see here boys all and behold the pictur of the place draed out so natural as ever was life i got mun from a portingal down to the azores and hed pricked mun out and pricked mun out wheresoever hed sailed and whatsoever hed seen take mun in your hands now simon evans take mun in your hands look mun over and ill warrant youll know the way in five minutes so well as ever a shark in the seas  and the horn was passed from hand to hand while oxenham who saw that his hearers were becoming moved called through the open window for a great tankard of sack and passed that from hand to hand after the horn  the schoolboy who had been devouring with eyes and ears all which passed and had contrived by this time to edge himself into the inner ring now stood face to face with the hero of the emerald crest and got as many peeps as he could at the wonder but when he saw the sailors one after another having turned it over a while come forward and offer to join mr oxenham his soul burned within him for a nearer view of that wondrous horn as magical in its effects as that of tristrem or the enchanters in ariosto and when the group had somewhat broken up and oxenham was going into the tavern with his recruits he asked boldly for a nearer sight of the marvel which was granted at once  and now to his astonished gaze displayed themselves cities and harbors dragons and elephants whales which fought with sharks plate ships of spain islands with apes and palmtrees each with its name overwritten and here and there here is gold and again much gold and silver inserted most probably as the words were in english by the hands of mr oxenham himself lingeringly and longingly the boy turned it round and round and thought the owner of it more fortunate than khan or kaiser oh if he could but possess that horn what needed he on earth beside to make him blest  i say will you sell this  yea marry or my own soul if i can get the worth of it  i want the horni dont want your soul its somewhat of a stale sole for aught i know and there are plenty of fresh ones in the bay  and therewith after much fumbling he pulled out a tester the only one he had and asked if that would buy it  that no nor twenty of them  the boy thought over what a good knighterrant would do in such case and then answered tell you what ill fight you for it  thank ee sir  break the jackanapess head for him yeo said oxenham  call me jackanapes again and i break yours sir and the boy lifted his fist fiercely  oxenham looked at him a minute smilingly tut tut my man hit one of your own size if you will and spare little folk like me  if i have a boys age sir i have a mans fist i shall be fifteen years old this month and know how to answer any one who insults me  fifteen my young cockerel you look liker twenty said oxenham with an admiring glance at the lads broad limbs keen blue eyes curling golden locks and round honest face fifteen if i had halfadozen such lads as you i would make knights of them before i died eh yeo  hell do said yeo he will make a brave gamecock in a year or two if he dares ruffle up so early at a tough old henmaster like the captain  at which there was a general laugh in which oxenham joined as loudly as any and then bade the lad tell him why he was so keen after the horn  because said he looking up boldly i want to go to sea i want to see the indies i want to fight the spaniards though i am a gentlemans son id a deal liever be a cabinboy on board your ship and the lad having hurried out his say fiercely enough dropped his head again  and you shall cried oxenham with a great oath and take a galloon and dine off carbonadoed dons whose son are you my gallant fellow  mr leighs of burrough court  bless his soul i know him as well as i do the eddystone and his kitchen too who sups with him tonight  sir richard grenville  dick grenville i did not know he was in town go home and tell your father john oxenham will come and keep him company there off with you ill make all straight with the good gentleman and you shall have your venture with me and as for the horn let him have the horn yeo and ill give you a noble for it  not a penny noble captain if young master will take a poor mariners gift there it is for the sake of his love to the calling and heaven send him luck therein and the good fellow with the impulsive generosity of a true sailor thrust the horn into the boys hands and walked away to escape thanks  and now quoth oxenham my merry men all make up your minds what mannered men you be minded to be before you take your bounties i want none of your rascally lurching longshore vermin who get five pounds out of this captain and ten out of that and let him sail without them after all while they are stowed away under womens mufflers and in tavern cellars if any man is of that humor he had better to cut himself up and salt himself down in a barrel for pork before he meets me again for by this light let me catch him be it seven years hence and if i do not cut his throat upon the streets its a pity but if any man will be true brother to me true brother to him ill be come wreck or prize storm or calm salt water or fresh victuals or none share and fare alike and heres my hand upon it for every man and all and so       westward ho with a rumbelow         and hurra for the spanish main o  after which oration mr oxenham swaggered into the tavern followed by his new men and the boy took his way homewards nursing his precious horn trembling between hope and fear and blushing with maidenly shame and a halfsense of wrongdoing at having revealed suddenly to a stranger the darling wish which he had hidden from his father and mother ever since he was ten years old  now this young gentleman amyas leigh though come of as good blood as any in devon and having lived all his life in what we should even now call the very best society and being on account of the valor courtesy and truly noble qualities which he showed forth in his most eventful life chosen by me as the hero and centre of this story was not saving for his good looks by any means what would be called nowadays an interesting youth still less a highly educated one for with the exception of a little latin which had been driven into him by repeated blows as if it had been a nail he knew no books whatsoever save his bible his prayerbook the old mort darthur of caxtons edition which lay in the great bay window in the hall and the translation of las casas history of the west indies which lay beside it lately done into english under the title of the cruelties of the spaniards he devoutly believed in fairies whom he called pixies and held that they changed babies and made the mushroom rings on the downs to dance in when he had warts or burns he went to the white witch at northam to charm them away he thought that the sun moved round the earth and that the moon had some kindred with a cheshire cheese he held that the swallows slept all the winter at the bottom of the horsepond talked like raleigh grenville and other low persons with a broad devonshire accent and was in many other respects so very ignorant a youth that any pert monitor in a national school might have had a hearty laugh at him nevertheless this ignorant young savage vacant of the glorious gains of the nineteenth century childrens literature and science made easy and worst of all of those improved views of english history now current among our railway essayists which consist in believing all persons male and female before the year 1688 and nearly all after it to have been either hypocrites or fools had learnt certain things which he would hardly have been taught just now in any school in england for his training had been that of the old persians to speak the truth and to draw the bow both of which savage virtues he had acquired to perfection as well as the equally savage ones of enduring pain cheerfully and of believing it to be the finest thing in the world to be a gentleman by which word he had been taught to understand the careful habit of causing needless pain to no human being poor or rich and of taking pride in giving up his own pleasure for the sake of those who were weaker than himself moreover having been entrusted for the last year with the breaking of a colt and the care of a cast of young hawks which his father had received from lundy isle he had been profiting much by the means of those coarse and frivolous amusements in perseverance thoughtfulness and the habit of keeping his temper and though he had never had a single object lesson or been taught to use his intellectual powers he knew the names and ways of every bird and fish and fly and could read as cunningly as the oldest sailor the meaning of every drift of cloud which crossed the heavens lastly he had been for some time past on account of his extraordinary size and strength undisputed cock of the school and the most terrible fighter among all bideford boys in which brutal habit he took much delight and contrived strange as it may seem to extract from it good not only for himself but for others doing justice among his schoolfellows with a heavy hand and succoring the oppressed and afflicted so that he was the terror of all the sailorlads and the pride and stay of all the towns boys and girls and hardly considered that he had done his duty in his calling if he went home without beating a big lad for bullying a little one for the rest he never thought about thinking or felt about feeling and had no ambition whatsoever beyond pleasing his father and mother getting by honest means the maximum of red quarrenders and mazard cherries and going to sea when he was big enough neither was he what would be nowadays called by many a pious child for though he said his creed and lords prayer night and morning and went to the service at the church every forenoon and read the days psalms with his mother every evening and had learnt from her and from his father as he proved well in after life that it was infinitely noble to do right and infinitely base to do wrong yet the age of childrens religious books not having yet dawned on the world he knew nothing more of theology or of his own soul than is contained in the church catechism it is a question however on the whole whether though grossly ignorant according to our modern notions in science and religion he was altogether untrained in manhood virtue and godliness and whether the barbaric narrowness of his information was not somewhat counterbalanced both in him and in the rest of his generation by the depth and breadth and healthiness of his education  so let us watch him up the hill as he goes hugging his horn to tell all that has passed to his mother from whom he had never hidden anything in his life save only that seafever and that only because he foreknew that it would give her pain and because moreover being a prudent and sensible lad he knew that he was not yet old enough to go and that as he expressed it to her that afternoon there was no use hollaing till he was out of the wood  so he goes up between the rich lanebanks heavy with drooping ferns and honeysuckle out upon the windy down toward the old court nestled amid its ring of windclipt oaks through the gray gateway into the homeclose and then he pauses a moment to look around first at the wide bay to the westward with its southern wall of purple cliffs then at the dim isle of lundy far away at sea then at the cliffs and downs of morte and braunton right in front of him then at the vast yellow sheet of rolling sandhill and green alluvial plain dotted with red cattle at his feet through which the silver estuary winds onward toward the sea beneath him on his right the torridge like a landlocked lake sleeps broad and bright between the old park of tapeley and the charmed rock of the hubbastone where seven hundred years ago the norse rovers landed to lay siege to kenwith castle a mile away on his left hand and not three fields away are the old stones of the bloody corner where the retreating danes cut off from their ships made their last fruitless stand against the saxon sheriff and the valiant men of devon within that charmed rock so torridge boatmen tell sleeps now the old norse viking in his leaden coffin with all his fairy treasure and his crown of gold and as the boy looks at the spot he fancies and almost hopes that the day may come when he shall have to do his duty against the invader as boldly as the men of devon did then and past him far below upon the soft southeastern breeze the stately ships go sliding out to sea when shall he sail in them and see the wonders of the deep and as he stands there with beating heart and kindling eye the cool breeze whistling through his long fair curls he is a symbol though he knows it not of brave young england longing to wing its way out of its island prison to discover and to traffic to colonize and to civilize until no wind can sweep the earth which does not bear the echoes of an english voice patience young amyas thou too shalt forth and westward ho beyond thy wildest dreams and see brave sights and do brave deeds which no man has since the foundation of the world thou too shalt face invaders stronger and more cruel far than dane or norman and bear thy part in that great titan strife before the renown of which the name of salamis shall fade away  mr oxenham came that evening to supper as he had promised but as people supped in those days in much the same manner as they do now we may drop the thread of the story for a few hours and take it up again after supper is over  come now dick grenville do thou talk the good man round and ill warrant myself to talk round the good wife  the personage whom oxenham addressed thus familiarly answered by a somewhat sarcastic smile and mr oxenham gives dick grenville with just enough emphasis on the mr and the dick to hint that a liberty had been taken with him overmuch credit with the men mr oxenhams credit with fair ladies none can doubt friend leigh is heards great ship home yet from the straits  the speaker known well in those days as sir richard grenville granville greenvil greenfield with two or three other variations was one of those truly heroical personages whom providence fitting always the men to their age and their work had sent upon the earth whereof it takes right good care not in england only but in spain and italy in germany and the netherlands and wherever in short great men and great deeds were needed to lift the mediaeval world into the modern  and among all the heroic faces which the painters of that age have preserved none perhaps hardly excepting shakespeares or spensers alvas or farinas is more heroic than that of richard grenville as it stands in princes worthies of devon of a spanish type perhaps or more truly speaking a cornish rather than an english with just enough of the british element in it to give delicacy to its massiveness the forehead and whole brain are of extraordinary loftiness and perfectly upright the nose long aquiline and delicately pointed the mouth fringed with a short silky beard small and ripe yet firm as granite with just pout enough of the lower lip to give hint of that capacity of noble indignation which lay hid under its usual courtly calm and sweetness if there be a defect in the face it is that the eyes are somewhat small and close together and the eyebrows though delicately arched and without a trace of peevishness too closely pressed down upon them the complexion is dark the figure tall and graceful altogether the likeness of a wise and gallant gentleman lovely to all good men awful to all bad men in whose presence none dare say or do a mean or a ribald thing whom brave men left feeling themselves nerved to do their duty better while cowards slipped away as bats and owls before the sun so he lived and moved whether in the court of elizabeth giving his counsel among the wisest or in the streets of bideford capped alike by squire and merchant shopkeeper and sailor or riding along the moorland roads between his houses of stow and bideford while every woman ran out to her door to look at the great sir richard the pride of north devon or sitting there in the low mullioned window at burrough with his cup of malmsey before him and the lute to which he had just been singing laid across his knees while the red western sun streamed in upon his high bland forehead and soft curling locks ever the same steadfast godfearing chivalrous man conscious as far as a soul so healthy could be conscious of the pride of beauty and strength and valor and wisdom and a race and name which claimed direct descent from the grandfather of the conqueror and was tracked down the centuries by valiant deeds and noble benefits to his native shire himself the noblest of his race men said that he was proud but he could not look round him without having something to be proud of that he was stern and harsh to his sailors but it was only when he saw in them any taint of cowardice or falsehood that he was subject at moments to such fearful fits of rage that he had been seen to snatch the glasses from the table grind them to pieces in his teeth and swallow them but that was only when his indignation had been aroused by some tale of cruelty or oppression and above all by those west indian devilries of the spaniards whom he regarded and in those days rightly enough as the enemies of god and man of this last fact oxenham was well aware and therefore felt somewhat puzzled and nettled when after having asked mr leighs leave to take young amyas with him and set forth in glowing colors the purpose of his voyage he found sir richard utterly unwilling to help him with his suit  heyday sir richard you are not surely gone over to the side of those canting fellows spanish jesuits in disguise every one of them they are who pretended to turn up their noses at franky drake as a pirate and be hanged to them  my friend oxenham answered he in the sententious and measured style of the day i have always held as you should know by this that mr drakes booty as well as my good friend captain hawkinss is lawful prize as being taken from the spaniard who is not only hostis humani generis but has no right to the same having robbed it violently by torture and extreme iniquity from the poor indian whom god avenge as he surely will  amen said mrs leigh  i say amen too quoth oxenham especially if it please him to avenge them by english hands  and i also went on sir richard for the rightful owners of the said goods being either miserably dead or incapable by reason of their servitude of ever recovering any share thereof the treasure falsely called spanish cannot be better bestowed than in building up the state of england against them our natural enemies and thereby in building up the weal of the reformed churches throughout the world and the liberties of all nations against a tyranny more foul and rapacious than that of nero or caligula which if it be not the cause of god i for one know not what gods cause is and as he warmed in his speech his eyes flashed very fire  hark now said oxenham who can speak more boldly than he and yet he will not help this lad to so noble an adventure  you have asked his father and mother what is their answer  mine is this said mr leigh if it be gods will that my boy should become hereafter such a mariner as sir richard grenville let him go and god be with him but let him first bide here at home and be trained if god give me grace to become such a gentleman as sir richard grenville  sir richard bowed low and mrs leigh catching up the last word  there mr oxenham you cannot gainsay that unless you will be discourteous to his worship and for methough it be a weak womans reason yet it is a mothers he is my only child his elder brother is far away god only knows whether i shall see him again and what are all reports of his virtues and his learning to me compared to that sweet presence which i daily miss ah mr oxenham my beautiful joseph is gone and though he be lord of pharaohs household yet he is far away in egypt and you will take benjamm also ah mr oxenham you have no child or you would not ask for mine  and how do you know that my sweet madam said the adventurer turning first deadly pale and then glowing red her last words had touched him to the quick in some unexpected place and rising he courteously laid her hand to his lips and saidi say no more farewell sweet madam and god send all men such wives as you  and all wives said she smiling such husbands as mine  nay i will not say that answered he with a half sneerand then farewell friend leighfarewell gallant dick grenville god send i see thee lord high admiral when i come home and yet why should i come home will you pray for poor jack gentles  tut tut man good words said leigh let us drink to our merry meeting before you go and rising and putting the tankard of malmsey to his lips he passed it to sir richard who rose and saying to the fortune of a bold mariner and a gallant gentleman drank and put the cup into oxenhams hand  the adventurers face was flushed and his eye wild whether from the liquor he had drunk during the day or whether from mrs leighs last speech he had not been himself for a few minutes he lifted the cup and was in act to pledge them when he suddenly dropped it on the table and pointed staring and trembling up and down and round the room as if following some fluttering object  there do you see it the birdthe bird with the white breast  each looked at the other but leigh who was a quickwitted man and an old courtier forced a laugh instantly and criednonsense brave jack oxenham leave white birds for men who will show the white feather mrs leigh waits to pledge you  oxenham recovered himself in a moment pledged them all round drinking deep and fiercely and after hearty farewells departed never hinting again at his strange exclamation  after he was gone and while leigh was attending him to the door mrs leigh and grenville kept a few minutes dead silence at lastgod help him said she  amen said grenville for he never needed it more but indeed madam i put no faith in such omens  but sir richard that bird has been seen for generations before the death of any of his family i know those who were at south tawton when his mother died and his brother also and they both saw it god help him for after all he is a proper man  so many a lady has thought before now mrs leigh and well for him if they had not but indeed i make no account of omens when god is ready for each man then he must go and when can he go better  but said mr leigh who entered i have seen and especially when i was in italy omens and prophecies before now beget their own fulfilment by driving men into recklessness and making them run headlong upon that very ruin which as they fancied was running upon them  and which said sir richard they might have avoided if instead of trusting in i know not what dumb and dark destiny they had trusted in the living god by faith in whom men may remove mountains and quench the fire and put to flight the armies of the alien i too know and know not how i know that i shall never die in my bed  god forfend cried mrs leigh  and why fair madam if i die doing my duty to my god and my queen the thought never moves me nay to tell the truth i pray often enough that i may be spared the miseries of imbecile old age and that end which the old northmen rightly called a cows death rather than a mans but enough of this mr leigh you have done wisely tonight poor oxenham does not go on his voyage with a single eye i have talked about him with drake and hawkins and i guess why mrs leigh touched him so home when she told him that he had no child  has he one then in the west indies cried the good lady  god knows and god grant we may not hear of shame and sorrow fallen upon an ancient and honorable house of devon my brother stukely is woe enough to north devon for this generation  poor braggadocio said mr leigh and yet not altogether that too for he can fight at least  so can every mastiff and boar much more an englishman and now come hither to me my adventurous godson and dont look in such doleful dumps i hear you have broken all the sailorboys heads already  nearly all said young amyas with due modesty but am i not to go to sea  all things in their time my boy and god forbid that either i or your worthy parents should keep you from that noble calling which is the safeguard of this england and her queen but you do not wish to live and die the master of a trawler  i should like to be a brave adventurer like mr oxenham  god grant you become a braver man than he for as i think to be bold against the enemy is common to the brutes but the prerogative of a man is to be bold against himself  how sir  to conquer our own fancies amyas and our own lusts and our ambition in the sacred name of duty this it is to be truly brave and truly strong for he who cannot rule himself how can he rule his crew or his fortunes come now i will make you a promise if you will bide quietly at home and learn from your father and mother all which befits a gentleman and a christian as well as a seaman the day shall come when you shall sail with richard grenville himself or with better men than he on a nobler errand than goldhunting on the spanish main  o my boy my boy said mrs leigh hear what the good sir richard promises you many an earls son would be glad to be in your place  and many an earls son will be glad to be in his place a score years hence if he will but learn what i know you two can teach him and now amyas my lad i will tell you for a warning the history of that sir thomas stukely of whom i spoke just now and who was as all men know a gallant and courtly knight of an ancient and worshipful family in ilfracombe well practised in the wars and well beloved at first by our incomparable queen the friend of all true virtue as i trust she will be of yours some day who wanted but one step to greatness and that was this that in his hurry to rule all the world he forgot to rule himself at first he wasted his estate in show and luxury always intending to be famous and destroying his own fame all the while by his vainglory and haste then to retrieve his losses he hit upon the peopling of florida which thou and i will see done some day by gods blessing for i and some good friends of mine have an errand there as well as he but he did not go about it as a loyal man to advance the honor of his queen but his own honor only dreaming that he too should be a king and was not ashamed to tell her majesty that he had rather be sovereign of a molehill than the highest subject of an emperor  they say said mr leigh that he told her plainly he should be a prince before he died and that she gave him one of her pretty quips in return  i dont know that her majesty had the best of it a fool is many times too strong for a wise man by virtue of his thick hide for when she said that she hoped she should hear from him in his new principality yes sooth says he graciously enough and in what style asks she to our dear sister says stukely to which her clemency had nothing to reply but turned away as mr burleigh told me laughing  alas for him said gentle mrs leigh such selfconceitand heaven knows we have the root of it in ourselves alsois the very daughter of selfwill and of that loud crying out about i and me and mine which is the very birdcall for all devils and the broad road which leads to death  it will lead him to his said sir richard god grant it be not upon towerhill for since that florida plot and after that his hopes of irish preferment came to naught he who could not help himself by fair means has taken to foul ones and gone over to italy to the pope whose infallibility has not been proof against stukelys wit for he was soon his holinesss closet counsellor and they say his bosom friend and made him give credit to his boasts that with three thousand soldiers he would beat the english out of ireland and make the popes son king of it  ay but said mr leigh i suppose the italians have the same fetch now as they had when i was there to explain such ugly cases namely that the pope is infallible only in doctrine and quoad pope while quoad hominem he is even as others or indeed in general a deal worse so that the office and not the man may be glorified thereby but where is stukely now  at rome when last i heard of him ruffling it up and down the vatican as baron ross viscount murrough earl wexford marquis leinster and a title or two more which have cost the pope little seeing that they never were his to give and plotting they say some harebrained expedition against ireland by the help of the spanish king which must end in nothing but his shame and ruin and now my sweet hosts i must call for servingboy and lantern and home to my bed in bideford  and so amyas leigh went back to school and mr oxenham went his way to plymouth again and sailed for the spanish main    chapter ii  how amyas came home the first time       si taceant homines facient te sidera notum          sol nescit comitis immemor esse sui                               old epigram on drake  five years are past and gone it is nine of the clock on a still bright november morning but the bells of bideford church are still ringing for the daily service two hours after the usual time and instead of going soberly according to wont cannot help breaking forth every five minutes into a jocund peal and tumbling head over heels in ecstasies of joy bideford streets are a very flowergarden of all the colors swarming with seamen and burghers and burghers wives and daughters all in their holiday attire garlands are hung across the streets and tapestries from every window the ships in the pool are dressed in all their flags and give tumultuous vent to their feelings by peals of ordnance of every size every stable is crammed with horses and sir richard grenvilles house is like a very tavern with eating and drinking and unsaddling and running to and fro of grooms and servingmen along the little churchyard packed full with women streams all the gentle blood of north devontall and stately men and fair ladies worthy of the days when the gentry of england were by due right the leaders of the people by personal prowess and beauty as well as by intellect and education and first there is my lady countess of bath whom sir richard grenville is escorting cap in hand for her good earl bourchier is in london with the queen and there are bassets from beautiful umberleigh and carys from more beautiful clovelly and fortescues of wear and fortescues of buckland and fortescues from all quarters and coles from slade and stukelys from affton and st legers from annery and coffins from portledge and even coplestones from eggesford thirty miles away and last but not least for almost all stop to give them place sir john chichester of ralegh followed in single file after the good old patriarchal fashion by his eight daughters and three of his five famous sons one to avenge his murdered brother is fighting valiantly in ireland hereafter to rule there wisely also as lord deputy and baron of belfast and he meets at the gate his cousin of arlington and behind him a train of four daughters and nineteen sons the last of whom has not yet passed the townhall while the first is at the lychgate who laughing make way for the elder though shorter branch of that most fruitful tree and so on into the church where all are placed according to their degrees or at least as near as may be not without a few sour looks and shovings and whisperings from one highborn matron and another till the churchwardens and sidesmen who never had before so goodly a company to arrange have bustled themselves hot and red and frantic and end by imploring abjectly the help of the great sir richard himself to tell them who everybody is and which is the elder branch and which is the younger and who carries eight quarterings in their arms and who only four and so prevent their setting at deadly feud half the fine ladies of north devon for the old men are all safe packed away in the corporation pews and the young ones care only to get a place whence they may eye the ladies and at last there is a silence and a looking toward the door and then distant music flutes and hautboys drums and trumpets which come braying and screaming and thundering merrily up to the very church doors and then cease and the churchwardens and sidesmen bustle down to the entrance rods in hand and there is a general whisper and rustle not without glad tears and blessings from many a woman and from some men also as the wonder of the day enters and the rector begins not the morning service but the good old thanksgiving after a victory at sea  and what is it which has thus sent old bideford wild with that goodly joy and pious mirth of which we now only retain traditions in our translation of the psalms why are all eyes fixed with greedy admiration on those four weatherbeaten mariners decked out with knots and ribbons by loving hands and yet more on that gigantic figure who walks before them a beardless boy and yet with the frame and stature of a hercules towering like saul of old a head and shoulders above all the congregation with his golden locks flowing down over his shoulders and why as the five go instinctively up to the altar and there fall on their knees before the rails are all eyes turned to the pew where mrs leigh of burrough has hid her face between her hands and her hood rustles and shakes to her joyful sobs because there was fellowfeeling of old in merry england in county and in town and these are devon men and men of bideford whose names are amyas leigh of burrough john staveley michael heard and jonas marshall of bideford and thomas braund of clovelly and they the first of all english mariners have sailed round the world with francis drake and are come hither to give god thanks  it is a long story to explain how it happened we must go back for a page or two almost to the point from whence we started in the last chapter  for somewhat more than a twelvemonth after mr oxenhams departure young amyas had gone on quietly enough according to promise with the exception of certain occasional outbursts of fierceness common to all young male animals and especially to boys of any strength of character his scholarship indeed progressed no better than before but his home education went on healthily enough and he was fast becoming young as he was a right good archer and rider and swordsman after the old school of buckler practice when his father having gone down on business to the exeter assizes caught as was too common in those days the gaolfever from the prisoners sickened in the very court and died within a week  and now mrs leigh was left to god and her own soul with this young lioncub in leash to tame and train for this life and the life to come she had loved her husband fervently and holily he had been often peevish often melancholy for he was a disappointed man with an estate impoverished by his fathers folly and his own youthful ambition which had led him up to court and made him waste his heart and his purse in following a vain shadow he was one of those men moreover who possess almost every gift except the gift of the power to use them and though a scholar a courtier and a soldier he had found himself when he was past forty without settled employment or aim in life by reason of a certain shyness pride or delicate honor call it which you will which had always kept him from playing a winning game in that very world after whose prizes he hankered to the last and on which he revenged himself by continual grumbling at last by his good luck he met with a fair young miss foljambe of derbyshire then about queen elizabeths court who was as tired as he of the sins of the world though she had seen less of them and the two contrived to please each other so well that though the queen grumbled a little as usual at the lady for marrying and at the gentleman for adoring any one but her royal self they got leave to vanish from the little babylon at whitehall and settle in peace at burrough in her he found a treasure and he knew what he had found  mrs leigh was and had been from her youth one of those noble old english churchwomen without superstition and without severity who are among the fairest features of that heroic time there was a certain melancholy about her nevertheless for the recollections of her childhood carried her back to times when it was an awful thing to be a protestant she could remember among them fiveandtwenty years ago the burning of poor blind joan waste at derby and of mistress joyce lewis too like herself a lady born and sometimes even now in her nightly dreams rang in her ears her mothers bitter cries to god either to spare her that fiery torment or to give her strength to bear it as she whom she loved had borne it before her for her mother who was of a good family in yorkshire had been one of queen catherines bedchamber women and the bosom friend and disciple of anne askew and she had sat in smithfield with blood curdled by horror to see the hapless court beauty a month before the paragon of henrys court carried in a chair so crippled was she by the rack to her fiery doom at the stake beside her fellowcourtier mr lascelles while the very heavens seemed to the shuddering mob around to speak their wrath and grief in solemn thunder peals and heavy drops which hissed upon the crackling pile  therefore a sadness hung upon her all her life and deepened in the days of queen mary when as a notorious protestant and heretic she had had to hide for her life among the hills and caverns of the peak and was only saved by the love which her husbands tenants bore her and by his bold declaration that good catholic as he was he would run through the body any constable justice or priest yea bishop or cardinal who dared to serve the queens warrant upon his wife  so she escaped but as i said a sadness hung upon her all her life and the skirt of that dark mantle fell upon the young girl who had been the partner of her wanderings and hidings among the lonely hills and who after she was married gave herself utterly up to god  and yet in giving herself to god mrs leigh gave herself to her husband her children and the poor of northam town and was none the less welcome to the grenvilles and fortescues and chichesters and all the gentle families round who honored her husbands talents and enjoyed his wit she accustomed herself to austerities which often called forth the kindly rebukes of her husband and yet she did so without one superstitious thought of appeasing the fancied wrath of god or of giving him pleasure base thought by any pain of hers for her spirit had been trained in the freest and loftiest doctrines of luthers school and that little mystic altdeutsch theologie to which the great reformer said that he owed more than to any book save the bible and st augustine was her counsellor and comforter by day and night  and now at little past forty she was left a widow lovely still in face and figure and still more lovely from the divine calm which brooded like the dove of peace and the holy spirit of god which indeed it was over every look and word and gesture a sweetness which had been ripened by storm as well as by sunshine which this world had not given and could not take away no wonder that sir richard and lady grenville loved her no wonder that her children worshipped her no wonder that the young amyas when the first burst of grief was over and he knew again where he stood felt that a new life had begun for him that his mother was no more to think and act for him only but that he must think and act for his mother and so it was that on the very day after his fathers funeral when schoolhours were over instead of coming straight home he walked boldly into sir richard grenvilles house and asked to see his godfather  you must be my father now sir said he firmly  and sir richard looked at the boys broad strong face and swore a great and holy oath like glasgerions by oak and ash and thorn that he would be a father to him and a brother to his mother for christs sake and lady grenville took the boy by the hand and walked home with him to burrough and there the two fair women fell on each others necks and wept together the one for the loss which had been the other as by a prophetic instinct for the like loss which was to come to her also for the sweet st leger knew well that her husbands fiery spirit would never leave his body on a peaceful bed but that death as he prayed almost nightly that it might would find him sword in hand upon the field of duty and of fame and there those two vowed everlasting sisterhood and kept their vow and after that all things went on at burrough as before and amyas rode and shot and boxed and wandered on the quay at sir richards side for mrs leigh was too wise a woman to alter one tittle of the training which her husband had thought best for his younger boy it was enough that her elder son had of his own accord taken to that form of life in which she in her secret heart would fain have moulded both her children for frank gods wedding gift to that pure love of hers had won himself honor at home and abroad first at the school at bideford then at exeter college where he had become a friend of sir philip sidneys and many another young man of rank and promise and next in the summer of 1572 on his way to the university of heidelberg he had gone to paris with luckily for him letters of recommendation to walsingham at the english embassy by which letters he not only fell in a second time with philip sidney but saved his own life as sidney did his in the massacre of st bartholomews day at heidelberg he had stayed two years winning fresh honor from all who knew him and resisting all sidneys entreaties to follow him into italy for scorning to be a burden to his parents he had become at heidelberg tutor to two young german princes whom after living with them at their fathers house for a year or more he at last to his own great delight took with him down to padua to perfect them as he wrote home according to his insufficiency in all princely studies sidney was now returned to england but frank found friends enough without him such letters of recommendation and diplomas did he carry from i know not how many princes magnificos and learned doctors who had fallen in love with the learning modesty and virtue of the fair young englishman and ere frank returned to germany he had satiated his soul with all the wonders of that wondrous land he had talked over the art of sonneteering with tasso the art of history with sarpi he had listened between awe and incredulity to the daring theories of galileo he had taken his pupils to venice that their portraits might be painted by paul veronese he had seen the palaces of palladio and the merchant princes on the rialto and the argosies of ragusa and all the wonders of that meetingpoint of east and west he had watched tintorettos mighty hand hurling tempestuous glories oer the scene and even by dint of private intercession in high places had been admitted to that sacred room where with long silver beard and undimmed eye amid a pantheon of his own creations the ancient titian patriarch of art still lingered upon earth and told old tales of the bellinis and raffaelle and michael angelo and the building of st peters and the fire at venice and the sack of rome and of kings and warriors statesmen and poets long since gone to their account and showed the sacred brush which francis the first had stooped to pick up for him and license forbidden to sidney by his friend languet he had been to rome and seen much to the scandal of good protestants at home that right good fellow as sidney calls him who had not yet eaten himself to death the pope for the time being and he had seen the frescos of the vatican and heard palestrina preside as chapelmaster over the performance of his own music beneath the dome of st peters and fallen half in love with those luscious strains till he was awakened from his dream by the recollection that beneath that same dome had gone up thanksgivings to the god of heaven for those bloodstained streets and shrieking women and heaps of insulted corpses which he had beheld in paris on the night of st bartholomew at last a few months before his father died he had taken back his pupils to their home in germany from whence he was dismissed as he wrote with rich gifts and then mrs leighs heart beat high at the thought that the wanderer would return but alas within a month after his fathers death came a long letter from frank describing the alps and the valleys of the waldenses with whose barbes he had had much talk about the late horrible persecutions and setting forth how at padua he had made the acquaintance of that illustrious scholar and light of the age stephanus parmenius commonly called from his native place budaeus who had visited geneva with him and heard the disputations of their most learned doctors which both he and budaeus disliked for their hard judgments both of god and man as much as they admired them for their subtlety being themselves as became italian students platonists of the school of ficinus and picus mirandolensis so wrote master frank in a long sententious letter full of latin quotations but the letter never reached the eyes of him for whose delight it had been penned and the widow had to weep over it alone and to weep more bitterly than ever at the conclusion in which with many excuses frank said that he had at the special entreaty of the said budaeus set out with him down the danube stream to buda that he might before finishing his travels make experience of that learning for which the hungarians were famous throughout europe and after that though he wrote again and again to the father whom he fancied living no letter in return reached him from home for nearly two years till fearing some mishap he hurried back to england to find his mother a widow and his brother amyas gone to the south seas with captain drake of plymouth and yet even then after years of absence he was not allowed to remain at home for sir richard to whom idleness was a thing horrible and unrighteous would have him up and doing again before six months were over and sent him off to court to lord hunsdon  there being as delicately beautiful as his brother was huge and strong he had speedily by carews interest and that of sidney and his uncle leicester found entrance into some office in the queens household and he was now basking in the full sunshine of court favor and fair ladies eyes and all the chivalries and euphuisms of glorianas fairyland and the fast friendship of that bright meteor sidney who had returned with honor in 1577 from the delicate mission on behalf of the german and belgian protestants on which he had been sent to the court of vienna under color of condoling with the new emperor rodolph on his fathers death frank found him when he himself came to court in 1579 as lovely and loving as ever and at the early age of twentyfive acknowledged as one of the most remarkable men of europe the patron of all men of letters the counsellor of warriors and statesmen and the confidant and advocate of william of orange languet plessis du mornay and all the protestant leaders on the continent and found moreover that the son of the poor devon squire was as welcome as ever to the friendship of natures and fortunes most favored yet most unspoilt minion  poor mrs leigh as one who had long since learned to have no self and to live not only for her children but in them submitted without a murmur and only said smiling to her stern friendyou took away my mastiffpup and now you must needs have my fair greyhound also  would you have your fair greyhound dear lady grow up a tall and true cotswold dog that can pull down a stag of ten or one of those smoothskinned poppets which the florence ladies lead about with a ring of bells round its neck and a flannel farthingale over its loins  mrs leigh submitted and was rewarded after a few months by a letter sent through sir richard from none other than gloriana herself in which she thanked her for the loan of that most delicate and flawless crystal the soul of her excellent son with more praises of him than i have room to insert and finished by exalting the poor mother above the famed cornelia for those sons whom she called her jewels she only showed yet kept them to herself but you madam having two as precious i doubt not as were ever that roman dames have beyond her courage lent them both to your country and to your queen who therein holds herself indebted to you for that which if god give her grace she will repay as becomes both her and you which epistle the sweet mother bedewed with holy tears and laid by in the cedarbox which held her household gods by the side of franks innumerable diplomas and letters of recommendation the latin whereof she was always spelling over although she understood not a word of it in hopes of finding here and there that precious excellentissimus noster franciscus leighius anglus which was all in all to the mothers heart  but why did amyas go to the south seas amyas went to the south seas for two causes each of which has before now sent many a lad to far worse places first because of an old schoolmaster secondly because of a young beauty i will take them in order and explain  vindex brimblecombe whilom servitor of exeter college oxford commonly called sir vindex after the fashion of the times was in those days master of the grammarschool of bideford he was at root a godly and kindhearted pedant enough but like most schoolmasters in the old flogging days had his heart pretty well hardened by long baneful license to inflict pain at will on those weaker than himself a power healthful enough for the victim for doubtless flogging is the best of all punishments being not only the shortest but also a mere bodily and animal and not like most of our newfangled humane punishments a spiritual and fiendish torture but for the executioner pretty certain to eradicate from all but the noblest spirits every trace of chivalry and tenderness for the weak as well often as all selfcontrol and command of temper be that as it may old sir vindex had heart enough to feel that it was now his duty to take especial care of the fatherless boy to whom he tried to teach his qui quae quod but the only outcome of that new sense of responsibility was a rapid increase in the number of floggings which rose from about two a week to one per diem not without consequences to the pedagogue himself  for all this while amyas had never for a moment lost sight of his darling desire for a sealife and when he could not wander on the quay and stare at the shipping or go down to the pebbleridge at northam and there sit devouring with hungry eyes the great expanse of ocean which seemed to woo him outward into boundless space he used to console himself in schoolhours by drawing ships and imaginary charts upon his slate instead of minding his humanities  now it befell upon an afternoon that he was very busy at a map or birdseye view of an island whereon was a great castle and at the gate thereof a dragon terrible to see while in the foreground came that which was meant for a gallant ship with a great flag aloft but which by reason of the forest of lances with which it was crowded looked much more like a porcupine carrying a signpost and at the roots of those lances many little round os whereby was signified the heads of amyas and his schoolfellows who were about to slay that dragon and rescue the beautiful princess who dwelt in that enchanted tower to behold which marvel of art all the other boys at the same desk must needs club their heads together and with the more security because sir vindex as was his custom after dinner was lying back in his chair and slept the sleep of the just  but when amyas by special instigation of the evil spirit who haunts successful artists proceeded further to introduce heedless of perspective a rock on which stood the lively portraiture of sir vindexnose spectacles gown and all and in his hand a brandished rod while out of his mouth a label shrieked after the runaways you come back while a similar label replied from the gallant bark goodbye master the shoving and tittering rose to such a pitch that cerberus awoke and demanded sternly what the noise was about to which of course there was no answer  you of course leigh come up sir and show me your exercitation  now of amyass exercitation not a word was written and moreover he was in the very article of putting the last touches to mr brimblecombes portrait whereon to the astonishment of all hearers he made answer  all in good time sir and went on drawing  in good time sir insolent veni et vapula  but amyas went on drawing  come hither sirrah or ill flay you alive  wait a bit answered amyas  the old gentleman jumped up ferula in hand and darted across the school and saw himself upon the fatal slate  proh flagitium what have we here villain and clutching at his victim he raised the cane whereupon with a serene and cheerful countenance up rose the mighty form of amyas leigh a head and shoulders above his tormentor and that slate descended on the bald coxcomb of sir vindex brimblecombe with so shrewd a blow that slate and pate cracked at the same instant and the poor pedagogue dropped to the floor and lay for dead  after which amyas arose and walked out of the school and so quietly home and having taken counsel with himself went to his mother and said please mother ive broken schoolmasters head  broken his head thou wicked boy shrieked the poor widow what didst do that for  i cant tell said amyas penitently i couldnt help it it looked so smooth and bald and round andyou know  i know oh wicked boy thou hast given place to the devil and now perhaps thou hast killed him  killed the devil asked amyas hopefully but doubtfully  no killed the schoolmaster sirrah is he dead  i dont think hes dead his coxcomb sounded too hard for that but had not i better go and tell sir richard  the poor mother could hardly help laughing in spite of her terror at amyass perfect coolness which was not in the least meant for insolence and being at her wits end sent him as usual to his godfather  amyas rehearsed his story again with pretty nearly the same exclamations to which he gave pretty nearly the same answers and thenwhat was he going to do to you then sirrah  flog me because i could not write my exercise and so drew a picture of him instead  what art afraid of being flogged  not a bit besides im too much accustomed to it but i was busy and he was in such a desperate hurry and oh sir if you had but seen his bald head you would have broken it yourself  now sir richard had twenty years ago in like place and very much in like manner broken the head of vindex brimblecombes father schoolmaster in his day and therefore had a precedent to direct him and he answeredamyas sirrah those who cannot obey will never be fit to rule if thou canst not keep discipline now thou wilt never make a company or a crew keep it when thou art grown dost mind that sirrah  yes said amyas  then go back to school this moment sir and be flogged  very well said amyas considering that he had got off very cheaply while sir richard as soon as he was out of the room lay back in his chair and laughed till he cried again  so amyas went back and said that he was come to be flogged whereon the old schoolmaster whose pate had been plastered meanwhile wept tears of joy over the returning prodigal and then gave him such a switching as he did not forget for eightandforty hours  but that evening sir richard sent for old vindex who entered trembling cap in hand and having primed him with a cup of sack saidwell mr schoolmaster my godson has been somewhat too much for you today there are a couple of nobles to pay the doctor  o sir richard gratias tibi et domino but the boy hits shrewdly hard nevertheless i have repaid him in inverse kind and set him an imposition to learn me one of phaedrus his fables sir richard if you do not think it too much  which then the one about the man who brought up a lions cub and was eaten by him in play at last  ah sir richard you have always a merry wit but indeed the boy is a brave boy and a quick boy sir richard but more forgetful than lethe andsapienti loquorit were well if he were away for i shall never see him again without my head aching moreover he put my son jack upon the fire last wednesday as you would put a football though he is a year older your worship because he said he looked so like a roasting pig sir richard  alas poor jack  and whats more your worship he is pugnax bellicosus gladiator a fireeater and swashbuckler beyond all christian measure a very sucking entellus sir richard and will do to death some of her majestys lieges erelong if he be not wisely curbed it was but a month agone that he bemoaned himself i hear as alexander did because there were no more worlds to conquer saying that it was a pity he was so strong for now he had thrashed all the bideford lads he had no sport left and so as my jack tells me last tuesday week he fell upon a young man of barnstaple sir richard a hosiers man sir and plebeius which i consider unfit for one of his blood and moreover a man full grown and as big as either of us vindex stood five feet four in his highheeled shoes and smote him clean over the quay into the mud because he said that there was a prettier maid in barnstaple your worship will forgive my speaking of such toys to which my fidelity compels me than ever bideford could show and then offered to do the same to any man who dare say that mistress rose salterne his worship the mayors daughter was not the fairest lass in all devon  eh say that over again my good sir quoth sir richard who had thus arrived as we have seen at the second count of the indictment i say good sir whence dost thou hear all these pretty stories  my son jack sir richard my son jack ingenui vultus puer  but not it seems ingenui pudoris tell thee what mr schoolmaster no wonder if thy son gets put on the fire if thou employ him as a talebearer but that is the way of all pedagogues and their sons by which they train the lads up eavesdroppers and favorcurriers and prepare themsirrah do you hearfor a much more lasting and hotter fire than that which has scorched thy son jacks nethertackle do you mark me sir  the poor pedagogue thus cunningly caught in his own trap stood trembling before his patron who as hereditary head of the bridge trust which endowed the school and the rest of the bideford charities could by a turn of his finger sweep him forth with the besom of destruction and he gasped with terror as sir richard went ontherefore mind you sir schoolmaster unless you shall promise me never to hint word of what has passed between us two and that neither you nor yours shall henceforth carry tales of my godson or speak his name within a days march of mistress salternes look to it if i do not  what was to be done in default was not spoken for down went poor old vindex on his knees  oh sir richard excellentissime immo praecelsissime domine et senator i promise o sir miles et eques of the garter bath and golden fleece consider your dignities and my old ageand my great familynine childrenoh sir richard and eight of them girlsdo eagles war with mice says the ancient  thy large family eh how old is that fatwitted son of thine  sixteen sir richard but that is not his fault indeed  nay i suppose he would be still sucking his thumb if he daredget up manget up and seat yourself  heaven forbid murmured poor vindex with deep humility  why is not the rogue at oxford with a murrain on him instead of lurching about here carrying tales and ogling the maidens  i had hoped sir richardand therefore i said it was not his faultbut there was never a servitorship at exeter open  go to mango to i will speak to my brethren of the trust and to oxford he shall go this autumn or else to exeter gaol for a strong rogue and a masterless man do you hear  hearoh sir yes and return thanks jack shall go sir richard doubt it noti were mad else and sir richard may i go too  and therewith vindex vanished and sir richard enjoyed a second mighty laugh which brought in lady grenville who possibly had overheard the whole for the first words she said were  i think my sweet life we had better go up to burrough  so to burrough they went and after much talk and many tears matters were so concluded that amyas leigh found himself riding joyfully towards plymouth by the side of sir richard and being handed over to captain drake vanished for three years from the good town of bideford  and now he is returned in triumph and the observed of all observers and looks round and round and sees all faces whom he expects except one and that the one which he had rather see than his mothers he is not quite sure shame on himself  and now the prayers being ended the rector ascends the pulpit and begins his sermon on the text  the heaven and the heaven of heavens are the lords the whole earth hath he given to the children of men deducing therefrom craftily to the exceeding pleasure of his hearers the iniquity of the spaniards in dispossessing the indians and in arrogating to themselves the sovereignty of the tropic seas the vanity of the pope of rome in pretending to bestow on them the new countries of america and the justice valor and glory of mr drake and his expedition as testified by gods miraculous protection of him and his both in the straits of magellan and in his battle with the galleon and last but not least upon the rock by celebes when the pelican lay for hours firmly fixed and was floated off unhurt as it were by miracle by a sudden shift of wind  ay smile reader if you will and perhaps there was matter for a smile in that honest sermon interlarded as it was with scraps of greek and hebrew which no one understood but every one expected as their right for a preacher was nothing then who could not prove himself a good latiner and graced moreover by a somewhat pedantic and lengthy refutation from scripture of dan horaces cockney horror of the sea       illi robur et aes triplex etc  and his infidel and ungodly slander against the impias rates and their crews  smile if you will but those were days and there were never less superstitious ones in which englishmen believed in the living god and were not ashamed to acknowledge as a matter of course his help and providence and calling in the matters of daily life which we now in our covert atheism term secular and carnal and when the sermon ended the communion service had begun and the bread and the wine were given to those five mariners every gallant gentleman who stood near them for the press would not allow of more knelt and received the elements with them as a thing of course and then rose to join with heart and voice not merely in the gloria in excelsis but in the te deum which was the closing act of all and no sooner had the clerk given out the first verse of that great hymn than it was taken up by five hundred voices within the church in bass and tenor treble and alto for every one could sing in those days and the westcountry folk as now were fuller than any of music the chant was caught up by the crowd outside and rang away over roof and river up to the woods of annery and down to the marshes of the taw in wave on wave of harmony and as it died away the shipping in the river made answer with their thunder and the crowd streamed out again toward the bridge head whither sir richard grenville and sir john chichester and mr salterne the mayor led the five heroes of the day to await the pageant which had been prepared in honor of them and as they went by there were few in the crowd who did not press forward to shake them by the hand and not only them but their parents and kinsfolk who walked behind till mrs leigh her stately joy quite broken down at last could only answer between her sobs go along good peoplegod a mercy go alongand god send you all such sons  god give me back mine cried an old redcloaked dame in the crowd and then struck by some hidden impulse she sprang forward and catching hold of young amyass sleeve  kind sir dear sir for christ his sake answer a poor old widow woman  what is it dame quoth amyas gently enough  did you see my son to the indiesmy son salvation  salvation replied he with the air of one who recollected the name  yes sure salvation yeo of clovelly a tall man and black and sweareth awfully in his talk the lord forgive him  amyas recollected now it was the name of the sailor who had given him the wondrous horn five years ago  my good dame said he the indies are a very large place and your son may be safe and sound enough there without my having seen him i knew one salvation yeo but he must have come withby the by godfather has mr oxenham come home  there was a dead silence for a moment among the gentlemen round and then sir richard said solemnly and in a low voice turning away from the old dame  amyas mr oxenham has not come home and from the day he sailed no word has been heard of him and all his crew  oh sir richard and you kept me from sailing with him had i known this before i went into church i had had one mercy more to thank god for  thank him all the more in thy life my child whispered his mother  and no news of him whatsoever  none but that the year after he sailed a ship belonging to andrew barker of bristol took out of a spanish caravel somewhere off the honduras his two brass guns but whence they came the spaniard knew not having bought them at nombre de dios  yes cried the old woman they brought home the guns and never brought home my boy  they never saw your boy mother said sir richard  but ive seen him i saw him in a dream four years last whitsuntide as plain as i see you now gentles alying upon a rock calling for a drop of water to cool his tongue like dives to the torment oh dear me and the old dame wept bitterly  there is a rose noble for you said mrs leigh  and there another said sir richard and in a few minutes four or five gold coins were in her hand but the old dame did but look wonderingly at the gold a moment and then  ah dear gentles gods blessing on you and mr carys mighty good to me already but gold wont buy back childer o young gentleman young gentleman make me a promise if you want gods blessing on you this day bring me back my boy if you find him sailing on the seas bring him back and an old widows blessing be on you  amyas promisedwhat else could he doand the group hurried on but the lads heart was heavy in the midst of joy with the thought of john oxenham as he walked through the churchyard and down the short street which led between the ancient school and still more ancient townhouse to the head of the long bridge across which the pageant having arranged eastthewater was to defile and then turn to the right along the quay  however he was bound in all courtesy to turn his attention now to the show which had been prepared in his honor and which was really well enough worth seeing and hearing the english were in those days an altogether dramatic people ready and able as in bideford that day to extemporize a pageant a masque or any effort of the thespian art short of the regular drama for they were in the first place even down to the very poorest a wellfed people with fewer luxuries than we but more abundant necessaries and while beef ale and good woollen clothes could be obtained in plenty without overworking either body or soul men had time to amuse themselves in something more intellectual than mere toping in pothouses moreover the half century after the reformation in england was one not merely of new intellectual freedom but of immense animal good spirits after years of dumb confusion and cruel persecution a breathing time had come mary and the fires of smithfield had vanished together like a hideous dream and the mighty shout of joy which greeted elizabeths entry into london was the keynote of fifty glorious years the expression of a newfound strength and freedom which vented itself at home in drama and in song abroad in mighty conquests achieved with the laughing recklessness of boys at play  so first preceded by the waits came along the bridge toward the townhall a device prepared by the good rector who standing by acted as showman and explained anxiously to the bystanders the import of a certain allegory wherein on a great banner was depicted queen elizabeth herself who in ample ruff and farthingale a bible in one hand and a sword in the other stood triumphant upon the necks of two sufficiently abject personages whose triple tiara and imperial crown proclaimed them the pope and the king of spain while a label issuing from her royal mouth informed the world that       by land and sea a virgin queen i reign      and spurn to dust both antichrist and spain  which having been received with due applause a wellbedizened lad having in his cap as a posy loyalty stepped forward and delivered himself of the following verses       oh great eliza oh worldfamous crew      which shall i hail more blest your queen or you      while without other either falls to wrack      and light must eyes or eyes their light must lack      she without you a diamond sunk in mine      its worth unprized to self alone must shine      you without her like hands bereft of head      like ajax rage by blindfold lust misled      she light you eyes she head and you the hands      in fair proportion knit by heavenly hands      servants in queen and queen in servants blest      your only glory how to serve her best      and hers how best the adventurous might to guide      which knows no check of foemen wind or tide      so fair elizas spotless fame may fly      triumphant round the globe and shake th astounded sky  with which sufficiently bad verses loyalty passed on while my lady bath hinted to sir richard not without reason that the poet in trying to exalt both parties had very sufficiently snubbed both and intimated that it was hardly safe for country wits to attempt that euphuistic antithetical and delicately conceited vein whose proper fountain was in whitehall however on went loyalty very well pleased with himself and next amid much cheering two great tinsel fish a salmon and a trout symbolical of the wealth of torridge waddled along by means of two human legs and a staff apiece which protruded from the fishes stomachs they drew or seemed to draw for half the prentices in the town were shoving it behind and cheering on the panting monarchs of the flood a car wherein sate amid reeds and riverflags three or four pretty girls in robes of grayblue spangled with gold their heads wreathed one with a crown of the sweet bogmyrtle another with hops and white convolvulus the third with pale heather and golden fern they stopped opposite amyas and she of the myrtle wreath rising and bowing to him and the company began with a pretty blush to say her say       hither from my moorland

of fragrant gale from her own head and stooping from the car placed it on the head of amyas leigh who made answer  there is no place like home my fair mistress and no scent to my taste like this old homescent in all the spiceislands that i ever sailed by  her song was not so bad said sir richard to lady bathbut how came she to hear plymouth bells at tamarhead full fifty miles away thats too much of a poets license is it not  the rivernymphs as daughters of oceanus and thus of immortal parentage are bound to possess organs of more than mortal keenness but as you say the song was not so baderudite as well as prettily conceivedand saving for a certain rustical simplicity and monosyllabic baldness smacks rather of the forests of castaly than those of torridge  so spake my lady bath whom sir richard wisely answered not for she was a terribly learned member of the college of critics and disputed even with sidneys sister the chieftaincy of the euphuists so sir richard answered not but answer was made for him  since the whole choir of muses madam have migrated to the court of whitehall no wonder if some dews of parnassus should fertilize at times even our devon moors  the speaker was a tall and slim young man some fiveandtwenty years old of so rare and delicate a beauty that it seemed that some greek statue or rather one of those pensive and pious knights whom the old german artists took delight to paint had condescended to tread awhile this workday earth in living flesh and blood the forehead was very lofty and smooth the eyebrows thin and greatly arched the envious gallants whispered that something at least of their curve was due to art as was also the exceeding smoothness of those delicate cheeks the face was somewhat long and thin the nose aquiline and the languid mouth showed perhaps too much of the ivory upper teeth but the most striking point of the speakers appearance was the extraordinary brilliancy of his complexion which shamed with its whiteness that of all fair ladies round save where open on each cheek a bright red spot gave warning as did the long thin neck and the taper hands of sad possibilities perhaps not far off possibilities which all saw with an inward sigh except she whose doting glances as well as her resemblance to the fair youth proclaimed her at once his mother mrs leigh herself  master frank for he it was was dressed in the very extravagance of the fashionnot so much from vanity as from that delicate instinct of selfrespect which would keep some men spruce and spotless from one years end to another upon a desert island for as frank used to say in his sententious way mr frank leigh at least beholds me though none else be by and why should i be more discourteous to him than i permit others to be be sure that he who is a grobian in his own company will sooner or later become a grobian in that of his friends  so mr frank was arrayed spotlessly but after the latest fashion of milan not in trunk hose and slashed sleeves nor in french standing collar treble quadruple daedalian ruff or stiffnecked rabato that had more arches for pride propped up with wire and timber than five london bridges but in a closefitting and perfectly plain suit of dovecolor which set off cunningly the delicate proportions of his figure and the delicate hue of his complexion which was shaded from the sun by a broad dovecolored spanish hat with feather to match looped up over the right ear with a pearl brooch and therein a crowned e supposed by the damsels of bideford to stand for elizabeth which was whispered to be the gift of some most illustrious hand this same looping up was not without good reason and purpose prepense thereby all the world had full view of a beautiful little ear which looked as if it had been cut of cameo and made as my lady rich once told him to hearken only to the music of the spheres or to the chants of cherubim behind the said ear was stuck a fresh rose and the golden hair was all drawn smoothly back and round to the left temple whence tied with a pink ribbon in a great true lovers knot a mighty lovelock curled as it had been laid in press rolled down low upon his bosom oh frank frank have you come out on purpose to break the hearts of all bideford burghers daughters and if so did you expect to further that triumph by dyeing that pretty little pointed beard with shame i report it of a bright vermilion but we know you better frank and so does your mother and you are but a masquerading angel after all in spite of your knots and your perfumes and the gold chain round your neck which a german princess gave you and the emerald ring on your right forefinger which hatton gave you and the pair of perfumed gloves in your left which sidneys sister gave you and the silverhilted toledo which an italian marquis gave you on a certain occasion of which you never choose to talk like a prudent and modest gentleman as you are but of which the gossips talk of course all the more and whisper that you saved his life from bravoesa dozen at the least and had that sword for your reward and might have had his beautiful sisters hand beside and i know not what else but that you had so many ladyloves already that you were loath to burden yourself with a fresh one that at least we know to be a lie fair frank for your heart is as pure this day as when you knelt in your little crib at burrough and said       four corners to my bed      four angels round my head      matthew mark luke and john      bless the bed that i lie on  and who could doubt it if being pure themselves they have instinctive sympathy with what is pure who ever looked into those great deep blue eyes of yours the black fringed curtains of whose azure lids usually downdropt as if in deepest thought you raise slowly almost wonderingly each time you speak as if awakening from some fair dream whose home is rather in your platonical eternal world of suprasensible forms than on that workday earth wherein you nevertheless acquit yourself so well therei must stop describing you or i shall catch the infection of your own euphuism and talk of you as you would have talked of sidney or of spenser or of that swan of avon whose song had just begun when yoursbut i will not anticipate my lady bath is waiting to give you her rejoinder  ah my silvertongued scholar and are you then the poet or have you been drawing on the inexhaustible bank of your friend raleigh or my cousin sidney or has our new cygnet immerito lent you a few unpublished leaves from some fresh shepherds calendar  had either madam of that cynosural triad been within call of my most humble importunities your ears had been delectate with far nobler melody  but not our eyes with fairer faces eh well you have chosen your nymphs and had good store from whence to pick i doubt not few young dulcineas round but must have been glad to take service under so renowned a captain  the only difficulty gracious countess has been to know where to fix the wandering choice of my bewildered eyes where all alike are fair and all alike facund  we understand said she smiling       dan cupid choosing midst his mothers graces      himself more fair made scorn of fairest faces  the young scholar capped her distich forthwith and bowing to her with a meaning look   then goddess turn he cried and veil thy light blinded by thine what eyes can choose aright   go saucy sir said my lady in high glee the pageant stays your supreme pleasure  and away went mr frank as master of the revels to bring up the prentices pageant while for his sake the nymph of torridge was forgotten for awhile by all young dames and most young gentlemen and his mother heaved a deep sigh which lady bath overhearing  what in the dumps good madam while all are rejoicing in your joy are you afraid that we courtdames shall turn your adoniss brain for him  i do indeed fear lest your condescension should make him forget that he is only a poor squires orphan  i will warrant him never to forget aught that he should recollect said my lady bath  and she spoke truly but soon franks silver voice was heard calling out  room there good people for the gallant prentice lads  and on they came headed by a giant of buckram and pasteboard armor forth of whose stomach looked like a clockface in a steeple a human visage to be greeted as was the fashion then by a volley of quips and puns from high and low  young mr william cary of clovelly who was the wit of those parts opened the fire by asking him whether he were goliath gogmagog or grantorto in the romance for giants names always began with a g to which the giants stomach answered pretty surlily  mine dont i begin with an o  then thou criest out before thou art hurt o cowardly giant  let me out lads quoth the irascible visage struggling in his buckram prison and i soon show him whether i be a coward  nay if thou gettest out of thyself thou wouldst be beside thyself and so wert but a mad giant  and that were pity said lady bath for by the romances giants have never overmuch wit to spare  mercy dear lady said frank and let the giant begin with an o  a   a false start giant you were to begin with an o  ill make you end with an o mr william cary roared the testy tower of buckram  and so i do for i end with fico  be mollified sweet giant said frank and spare the rash youth of yon foolish knight shall elephants catch flies or hurlothrumbo stain his club with brains of dagonet the jester be mollified leave thy caverned grumblings like etna when its windy wrath is past and discourse eloquence from thy central omphalos like pythoness ventriloquizing  if you do begin laughing at me too mr leigh  said the giants clockface in a piteous tone  i laugh not art thou not ordulf the earl and i thy humblest squire speak up my lord your cousin my lady bath commands you  and at last the giant began       a giant i earl ordulf men me call      gainst paynim foes devonias champion

necessary by all laws of the drama madam said frank with a sly smile that the speech and the speaker shall fit each other pass on earl ordulf a more learned worthy waits  whereon up came a fresh member of the procession namely no less a person than vindex brimblecombe the ancient schoolmaster with fiveandforty boys at his heels who halting pulled out his spectacles and thus signified his forgiveness of his whilom broken head  that the world should have been circumnavigated ladies and gentles were matter enough of jubilation to the student of herodotus and plato plinius and  ahem much more when the circumnavigators are britons more again when damnonians  dont swear master said young will cary  gulielme cary gulielme cary hast thou forgotten thy  whippings never old lad go on but

he is but a poor little starved evat  out of the road old custis march on don palmado  these allusions to the usual instrument of torture in westcountry schools made the old gentleman wince especially when they were followed home by  who stole admiral grenvilles brooms because birch rods were dear  but proudly he shook his bald head as a bull shakes off the flies and returned to the charge once more   great alexander famed commander wept and made a pother at conquering only half the world but drake had conquerd tother and hercules to brink of seas   oh  and clapping both hands to the back of his neck the schoolmaster began dancing frantically about while his boys broke out tittering o the ochidore look to the blue ochidore whove put ochidore to maisters poll  it was too true neatly

francis leigh wrote the epigram and diving through the crowd the pedagogue vanished howling while father neptune crowned with seaweeds a trident in one hand and a live dogfish in the other swaggered up the street surrounded by a tall bodyguard of mariners and followed by a great banner on which was depicted a globe with drakes ship sailing thereon upside down and overwritten       see every man the pelican         which round the world did go      while her sternpost was uppermost         and topmasts down below      and by the way she lost a day         out of her log was stole      but neptune kind with favoring wind         hath brought her safe and whole  now lads cried neptune hand me my parable thats writ for me and here goeth  and at the top of his bullvoice he began roaring       i am king neptune bold        the ruler of the seas      i dont understand much singing upon land        but i hope what i say will please       here be five bideford men        which have saild

to hull and to heave and to pull        and to prove themselves in fight       where be those spaniards proud        that make their valiant boasts      and think for to keep the poor indians for their sheep        and to farm my golden coasts       twas the devil and the pope gave them        my kingdom for their own      but my nephew francis drake he caused them to quake        and he pickd

triton and bring forward the freedom of the seas  triton roaring through a conch brought forward a cockleshell full of saltwater and delivered it solemnly to amyas who of course put a noble into it and returned it after grenville had done the same  holla dick admiral cried neptune who was pretty far gone in liquor we knew thou hadst a right english heart in thee for all thou standest there as taut as a don who has swallowed his rapier  grammercy stop thy bellowing fellow and on for thou smellest vilely of fish  everything smells sweet in its right place im going home  i thought thou wert there all along being already halfseas over said cary  ay right upseedutch and thats more than thou ever wilt be thou longshore stayathome why wast making sheeps eyes at mistress salterne here while my pretty little chuck of burrough there was playing at shovegroat with spanish doubloons  go to the devil sirrah said cary neptune had touched on a sore subject and more cheeks than amyas leighs reddened at the hint  amen if heaven so please and on rolled the monarch of the seas and so the pageant ended  the moment amyas had an opportunity he asked his brother frank somewhat peevishly where rose salterne was  what the mayors daughter with her uncle by kilkhampton i believe  now cunning master frank whose daily wish was to seek peace and ensue it told amyas this because he must needs speak the truth but he was purposed at the same time to speak as little truth as he could for fear of accidents and therefore omitted to tell his brother how that he two days before had entreated rose salterne herself to appear as the nymph of torridge which honor she who had no objection either to exhibit her pretty face to recite pretty poetry or to be trained thereto by the cynosure of north devon would have assented willingly but that her father stopped the pretty project by a peremptory countermove and packed her off in spite of her tears to the said uncle on the atlantic cliffs after which he went up to burrough and laughed over the whole matter with mrs leigh  i am but a burgher mrs leigh and you a lady of blood but i am too proud to let any man say that simon salterne threw his daughter at your sons headno not if you were an empress  and to speak truth mr salterne there are young gallants enough in the country quarrelling about her pretty face every day without making her a tourneyqueen to tilt about  which was very true for during the three years of amyass absence rose salterne had grown into so beautiful a girl of eighteen that half north devon was mad about the rose of torridge as she was called and there was not a young gallant for ten miles round not to speak of her fathers clerks and prentices who moped about after her like so many malvolios and treasured up the very parings of her nails who would not have gone to jerusalem to win her so that all along the vales of torridge and of taw and even away to clovelly for young mr cary was one of the sick not a gay bachelor but was frowning on his fellows and vying with them in the fashion of his clothes the set of his ruffs the harness of his horse the carriage of his hawks the pattern of his swordhilt and those were golden days for all tailors and armorers from exmoor to okehampton town but of all those foolish young lads not one would speak to the other either out hunting or at the archery butts or in the tiltyard and my lady bath who confessed that there was no use in bringing out her daughters where rose salterne was in the way prophesied in her classical fashion that roses wedding bid fair to be a very bridal of atalanta and feast of the lapithae and poor mr will cary who always blurted out the truth when old salterne once asked him angrily in bideford market what a plague business had he making sheeps eyes at his daughter broke out before all bystanders and what a plague business had you old boy to throw such an apple of discord into our merry meetings hereabouts if you choose to have such a daughter you must take the consequences and be hanged to you to which mr salterne answered with some truth that she was none of his choosing nor of mr carys neither and so the dor being given the belligerents parted laughing but the war remained in statu quo and not a week passed but by mysterious hands some nosegay or languishing sonnet was conveyed into the roses chamber all which she stowed away with the simplicity of a country girl finding it mighty pleasant and took all compliments quietly enough probably because on the authority of her mirror she considered them no more than her due  and now to add to the general confusion home was come young amyas leigh more desperately in love with her than ever for as is the way with sailors who after all are the truest lovers as they are the finest fellows god bless them upon earth his lonely shipwatches had been spent in imprinting on his imagination month after month year after year every feature and gesture and tone of the fair lass whom he had left behind him and that all the more intensely because beside his mother he had no one else to think of and was as pure as the day he was born having been trained as many a brave young man was then to look upon profligacy not as a proof of manhood but as what the old germans and those gortyneans who crowned the offender with wool knew it to be a cowardly and effeminate sin    chapter iii  of two gentlemen of wales and how they hunted with the hounds and yet ran with the deer       i know that deformed he has been a vile thief this seven years      he goes up and down like a gentleman i remember his namemuch      ado about nothing  amyas slept that night a tired and yet a troubled sleep and his mother and frank as they bent over his pillow could see that his brain was busy with many dreams  and no wonder for over and above all the excitement of the day the recollection of john oxenham had taken strange possession of his mind and all that evening as he sat in the baywindowed room where he had seen him last amyas was recalling to himself every look and gesture of the lost adventurer and wondering at himself for so doing till he retired to sleep only to renew the fancy in his dreams at last he found himself he knew not how sailing westward ever up the wake of the setting sun in chase of a tiny sail which was john oxenhams upon him was a painful sense that unless he came up with her in time something fearful would come to pass but the ship would not sail all around floated the sargasso beds clogging her bows with their long snaky coils of weed and still he tried to sail and tried to fancy that he was sailing till the sun went down and all was utter dark and then the moon arose and in a moment john oxenhams ship was close aboard her sails were torn and fluttering the pitch was streaming from her sides her bulwarks were rotting to decay and what was that line of dark objects dangling along the mainyarda line of hanged men and horror of horrors from the yardarm close above him john oxenhams corpse looked down with gravelight eyes and beckoned and pointed as if to show him his way and strove to speak and could not and pointed still not forward but back along their course and when amyas looked back behold behind him was the snow range of the andes glittering in the moon and he knew that he was in the south seas once more and that all america was between him and home and still the corpse kept pointing back and back and looking at him with yearning eyes of agony and lips which longed to tell some awful secret till he sprang up and woke with a shout of terror and found himself lying in the little coved chamber in dear old burrough with the gray autumn morning already stealing in  feverish and excited he tried in vain to sleep again and after an hours tossing rose and dressed and started for a bathe on his beloved old pebble ridge as he passed his mothers door he could not help looking in the dim light of morning showed him the bed but its pillow had not been pressed that night his mother in her long white nightdress was kneeling at the other end of the chamber at her priedieu absorbed in devotion gently he slipped in without a word and knelt down at her side she turned smiled passed her arm around him and went on silently with her prayers why not they were for him and he knew it and prayed also and his prayers were for her and for poor lost john oxenham and all his vanished crew  at last she rose and standing above him parted the yellow locks from off his brow and looked long and lovingly into his face there was nothing to be spoken for there was nothing to be concealed between these two souls as clear as glass each knew all which the other meant each knew that its own thoughts were known at last the mutual gaze was over she stooped and kissed him on the brow and was in the act to turn away as a tear dropped on his forehead her little bare feet were peeping out from under her dress he bent down and kissed them again and again and then looking up as if to excuse himself  you have such pretty feet mother  instantly with a womans instinct she had hidden them she had been a beauty once as i said and though her hair was gray and her roses had faded long ago she was beautiful still in all eyes which saw deeper than the mere outward red and white  your dear father used to say so thirty years ago  and i say so still you always were beautiful you are beautiful now  what is that to you silly boy will you play the lover with an old mother go and take your walk and think of younger ladies if you can find any worthy of you  and so the son went forth and the mother returned to her prayers  he walked down to the pebble ridge where the surges of the bay have defeated their own fury by rolling up in the course of ages a rampart of gray boulderstones some two miles long as cunningly curved and smoothed and fitted as if the work had been done by human hands which protects from the high tides of spring and autumn a fertile sheet of smooth alluvial turf sniffing the keen salt air like a young seadog he stripped and plunged into the breakers and dived and rolled and tossed about the foam with stalwart arms till he heard himself hailed from off the shore and looking up saw standing on the top of the rampart the tall figure of his cousin eustace  amyas was halfdisappointed at his coming for lovelorn rascal he had been dreaming all the way thither of rose salterne and had no wish for a companion who would prevent his dreaming of her all the way back nevertheless not having seen eustace for three years it was but civil to scramble out and dress while his cousin walked up and down upon the turf inside  eustace leigh was the son of a younger brother of leigh of burrough who had more or less cut himself off from his family and indeed from his countrymen by remaining a papist true though born a papist he had not always been one for like many of the gentry he had become a protestant under edward the sixth and then a papist again under mary but to his honor be it said at that point he had stopped having too much honesty to turn protestant a second time as hundreds did at elizabeths accession so a papist he remained living out of the way of the world in a great rambling dark house still called chapel on the atlantic cliffs in moorwinstow parish not far from sir richard grenvilles house of stow the penal laws never troubled him for in the first place they never troubled any one who did not make conspiracy and rebellion an integral doctrine of his religious creed and next they seldom troubled even them unless fired with the glory of martyrdom they bullied the longsuffering of elizabeth and her council into giving them their deserts and like poor father southwell in after years insisted on being hanged whether burleigh liked or not moreover in such a nomansland and endofalltheearth was that old house at moorwinstow that a dozen conspiracies might have been hatched there without any one hearing of it and jesuits and seminary priests skulked in and out all the year round unquestioned though unblest and found a sort of piquant pleasure like naughty boys who have crept into the storecloset in living in mysterious little dens in a lonely turret and going up through a trapdoor to celebrate mass in a secret chamber in the roof where they were allowed by the powers that were to play as much as they chose at persecuted saints and preach about hiding in dens and caves of the earth for once when the zealous parson of moorwinstow having discovered what everybody knew already the existence of mass priests and their idolatry at chapel house made formal complaint thereof to sir richard and called on him as the nearest justice of the peace to put in force the act of the fourteenth of elizabeth that worthy knight only rated him soundly for a fantastical puritan and bade him mind his own business if he wished not to make the place too hot for him whereon for the temporal authorities happily for the peace of england kept in those days a somewhat tight hand upon the spiritual ones the worthy parson subsidedfor after all mr thomas leigh paid his tithes regularly enoughand was content as he expressed it to bow his head in the house of rimmon like naaman of old by eating mr leighs dinners as often as he was invited and ignoring the vocation of old father francis who sat opposite to him dressed as a layman and calling himself the young gentlemans pedagogue  but the said birds of illomen had a very considerable lien on the conscience of poor mr thomas leigh the father of eustace in the form of certain lands once belonging to the abbey of hartland he more than half believed that he should be lost for holding those lands but he did not believe it wholly and therefore he did not give them up which was the case as poor mary tudor found to her sorrow with most of her catholic subjects whose consciences while they compelled them to return to the only safe fold of mother church extra quam nulla salus by no means compelled them to disgorge the wealth of which they had plundered that only hope of their salvation most of them however like poor tom leigh felt the abbey rents burn in their purses and as john bull generally does in a difficulty compromised the matter by a second folly as if two wrong things made one right one and petted foreign priests and listened or pretended not to listen to their plottings and their practisings and gave up a son here and a son there as a sort of a sinoffering and scapegoat to be carried off to douay or rheims or rome and trained as a seminary priest in plain english to be taught the science of villainy on the motive of superstition one of such hapless scapegoats and children who had been cast into the fire to moloch was eustace leigh whom his father had sent giving the fruit of his body for the sin of his soul to be made a liar of at rheims  and a very fair liar he had become not that the lad was a bad fellow at heart but he had been chosen by the harpies at home on account of his peculiar vocation in plain english because the wily priests had seen in him certain capacities of vague hysterical fear of the unseen the religious sentiment we call it nowadays and with them that tendency to be a rogue which superstitious men always have he was now a tall handsome lightcomplexioned man with a huge upright forehead a very small mouth and a dry and set expression of face which was always trying to get free or rather to seem free and indulge in smiles and dimples which were proper for one ought to have christian love and if one had love one ought to be cheerful and when people were cheerful they smiled and therefore he would smile and tried to do so but his charity prepense looked no more alluring than malice prepense would have done and had he not been really a handsome fellow many a woman who raved about his sweetness would have likened his frankness to that of a skeleton dancing in fetters and his smiles to the grins thereof  he had returned to england about a month before in obedience to the proclamation which had been set forth for that purpose and certainly not before it was needed that whosoever had children wards etc in the parts beyond the seas should send in their names to the ordinary and within four months call them home again so eustace was now staying with his father at chapel having nevertheless his private matters to transact on behalf of the virtuous society by whom he had been brought up one of which private matters had brought him to bideford the night before  so he sat down beside amyas on the pebbles and looked at him all over out of the corners of his eyes very gently as if he did not wish to hurt him or even the flies on his back and amyas faced right round and looked him full in the face with the heartiest of smiles and held out a lions paw which eustace took rapturously and a great shaking of hands ensued amyas gripping with a great round fist and a quiet quiver thereof as much as to say i am glad to see you and eustace pinching hard with white straight fingers and sawing the air violently up and down as much as to say dont you see how glad i am to see you a very different greeting from the former  hold hard old lad said amyas before you break my elbow and where do you come from  from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it said he with a little smile and nod of mysterious selfimportance  like the devil eh well every man has his pattern how is my uncle  now if there was one man on earth above another of whom eustace leigh stood in dread it was his cousin amyas in the first place he knew amyas could have killed him with a blow and there are natures who instead of rejoicing in the strength of men of greater prowess than themselves look at such with irritation dread at last spite expecting perhaps that the stronger will do to them what they feel they might have done in his place every one perhaps has the same envious cowardly devil haunting about his heart but the brave men though they be very sparrows kick him out the cowards keep him and foster him and so did poor eustace leigh  next he could not help feeling that amyas despised him they had not met for three years but before amyas went eustace never could argue with him simply because amyas treated him as beneath argument no doubt he was often rude and unfair enough but the whole mass of questions concerning the unseen world which the priests had stimulated in his cousins mind into an unhealthy fungus crop were to amyas simply as he expressed it wind and moonshine and he treated his cousin as a sort of harmless lunatic and as they say in devon halfbaked and eustace knew it and knew too that his cousin did him an injustice he used to undervalue me said he to himself let us see whether he does not find me a match for him now and then went off into an agony of secret contrition for his selfseeking and his forgetting that the glory of god and not his own exaltation was the object of his existence  there dear readers ex pede herculem i cannot tire myself or you especially in this book with any wiredrawn souldissections i have tried to hint to you two opposite sorts of menthe one trying to be good with all his might and main according to certain approved methods and rules which he has got by heart and like a weak oarsman feeling and fingering his spiritual muscles over all day to see if they are growing the other not even knowing whether he is good or not but just doing the right thing without thinking about it as simply as a little child because the spirit of god is with him if you cannot see the great gulf fixed between the two i trust that you will discover it some day  but in justice be it said all this came upon eustace not because he was a romanist but because he was educated by the jesuits had he been saved from them he might have lived and died as simple and honest a gentleman as his brothers who turned out like true englishmen as did all the romish laity to face the great armada and one of whom was fighting at that very minute under st leger in ireland and as brave and loyal a soldier as those roman catholics whose noble blood has stained every crimean battlefield but his fate was appointed otherwise and the upasshadow which has blighted the whole romish church blighted him also  ah my dearest cousin said eustace how disappointed i was this morning at finding i had arrived just a day too late to witness your triumph but i hastened to your home as soon as i could and learning from your mother that i should find you here hurried down to bid you welcome again to devon  well old lad it does look very natural to see you i often used to think of you walking the deck o nights uncle and the girls are all right then but is the old pony dead yet and hows dick the smith and nancy grown a fine maid by now i warrant slid it seems half a life that ive been away  and you really thought of your poor cousin be sure that he too thought of you and offered up nightly his weak prayers for your safety doubtless not without avail to those saints to whom would that you  halt there coz if they are half as good fellows as you and i take them for theyll help me without asking  they have helped you amyas  maybe id have done as much im sure for them if i d been in their place  and do you not feel then that you owe a debt of gratitude to them and above all to her whose intercessions have i doubt not availed for your preservation her the star of the sea the allcompassionate guide of the mariner  humph said amyas heres frank let him answer  and as he spoke up came frank and after due greetings sat down beside them on the ridge  i say brother heres eustace trying already to convert me and telling me that i owe all my luck to the blessed virgins prayers for me  it may be so said frank at least you owe it to the prayers of that most pure and peerless virgin by whose commands you sailed the sweet incense of whose orisons has gone up for you daily and for whose sake you were preserved from flood and foe that you might spread the fame and advance the power of the spotless championess of truth and right and freedomelizabeth your queen  amyas answered this rhapsody which would have been then both fashionable and sincere by a loyal chuckle eustace smiled meekly but answered somewhat venomously nevertheless  i at least am certain that i speak the truth when i call my patroness a virgin undefiled  both the brothers brows clouded at once amyas as he lay on his back on the pebbles said quietly to the gulls over his headi wonder what the frenchman whose head i cut off at the azores thinks by now about all that  cut off a frenchmans head said frank  yes faith and so fleshed my maiden sword ill tell you it was in some tavern i and george drake had gone in and there sat this frenchman with his sword on the table ready for a quarrel i found afterwards he was a noted bully and begins with us loudly enough about this and that but after awhile by the instigation of the devil what does he vent but a dozen slanders against her majestys honor one atop of the other i was ashamed to hear them and i should be more ashamed to repeat them  i have heard enough of such said frank they come mostly through lewd rascals about the french ambassador who have been bred god help them among the filthy vices of that medicean court in which the queen of scots had her schooling and can only perceive in a virtuous freedom a cloak for licentiousness like their own let the curs bark honi soit qui mal y pense is our motto and shall be forever  but i didnt let the cur bark for i took him by the ears to show him out into the street whereon he got to his sword and i to mine and a very near chance i had of never bathing on the pebble ridge more for the fellow did not fight with edge and buckler like a christian but had some newfangled french devils device of scryming and foining with his point haing and stamping and tracing at me that i expected to be full of eyelet holes ere i could close with him  thank god that you are safe then said frank i know that play well enough and dangerous enough it is  of course you know it but i didnt mores the pity  well ill teach it thee lad as well as rowland yorke himself       thy fincture carricade and sly passata      thy stramazon and resolute stoccata      wiping maudritta closing embrocata      and all the cant of the honorable fencing mystery  rowland yorke whos he then  a very roystering rascal who is making good profit in london just now by teaching this very art of fence and is as likely to have his mortal thread clipt in a tavern brawl as thy frenchman but how did you escape his pinking iron  how had it through my left arm before i could look round and at that i got mad and leapt upon him and caught him by the wrist and then had a fair sideblow and as fortune would have it off tumbled his head on to the table and there was an end of his slanders  so perish all her enemies said frank and eustace who had been trying not to listen rose and said  i trust that you do not number me among them  as you speak i do coz said frank but for your own sake let me advise you to put faith in the true report of those who have daily experience of their mistresss excellent virtue as they have of the suns shining and of the earths bringing forth fruit and not in the tattle of a few cowardly backstair rogues who wish to curry favor with the guises come we will say no more walk round with us by appledore and then home to breakfast  but eustace declined having immediate business he said in northam town and then in bideford and so left them to lounge for another halfhour on the beach and then walk across the smooth sheet of turf to the little white fishing village which stands some two miles above the bar at the meeting of the torridge and the taw  now it came to pass that eustace leigh as we have seen told his cousins that he was going to northam but he did not tell them that his point was really the same as their own namely appledore and therefore after having satisfied his conscience by going as far as the very nearest house in northam village he struck away sharp to the left across the fields repeating i know not what to the blessed virgin all the way whereby he went several miles out of his road and also as is the wont of crooked spirits jesuits especially as three centuries sufficiently testify only outwitted himself for his cousins going merrily like honest men along the straight road across the turf arrived in appledore opposite the little mariners rest inn just in time to see what eustace had taken so much trouble to hide from them namely four of mr thomas leighs horses standing at the door held by his groom saddles and mailbags on back and mounting three of them eustace leigh and two strange gentlemen  theres one lie already this morning growled amyas he told us he was going to northam  and we do not know that he has not been there blandly suggested frank  why you are as bad a jesuit as he to help him out with such a fetch  he may have changed his mind  bless your pure imagination my sweet boy said amyas laying his great hand on franks head and mimicking his mothers manner i say dear frank lets step into this shop and buy a pennyworth of whipcord  what do you want with whipcord man  to spin my top to be sure  top how long hast had a top  ill buy one then and save my conscience but the upshot of this sport i must see why may not i have an excuse ready made as well as master eustace  so saying he pulled frank into the little shop unobserved by the party at the inndoor  what strange cattle has he been importing now look at that threelegged fellow trying to get aloft on the wrong side how he claws at his horses ribs like a cat scratching an elder stem  the threelegged man was a tall meeklooking person who had bedizened himself with gorgeous garments a great feather and a sword so long and broad that it differed little in size from the very thin and stiff shanks between which it wandered uncomfortably  young david in sauls weapons said frank he had better not go in them for he certainly has not proved them  look if his third leg is not turned into a tail why does not some one in charity haul in halfayard of his belt for him  it was too true the sword after being kicked out three or four times from its uncomfortable post between his legs had returned unconquered and the hilt getting a little too far back by reason of the too great length of the belt the weapon took up its post triumphantly behind standing out point in air a tail confest amid the tittering of the ostlers and the cheers of the sailors  at last the poor man by dint of a chair was mounted safely while his fellowstranger a burly coarselooking man equally gay and rather more handy made so fierce a rush at his saddle that like vaulting ambition who oerleaps his selle he fell on tother side or would have fallen had he not been brought up short by the shoulders of the ostler at his offstirrup in which shock off came hat and feather  pardie the bulldogfaced one is a fighting man dost see frank he has had his head broken  that scar came not my son but by a pair of most catholic and apostolic scissors my gentle buzzard that is a priests tonsure  hang the dog o that the sailors may but see it and put him over the quay head ive a half mind to go and do it myself  my dear amyas said frank laying two fingers on his arm these men whosoever they are are the guests of our uncle and therefore the guests of our family ham gained little by publishing noahs shame neither shall we by publishing our uncles  murrain on you old franky you never let a man speak his mind and shame the devil  i have lived long enough in courts old amyas without a murrain on you to have found out first that it is not so easy to shame the devil and secondly that it is better to outwit him and the only way to do that sweet chuck is very often not to speak your mind at all we will go down and visit them at chapel in a day or two and see if we cannot serve these reynards as the badger did the fox when he found him in his hole and could not get him out by evil savors  how then  stuck a sweet nosegay in the door which turned reynards stomach at once and so overcame evil with good  well thou art too good for this world thats certain so we will go home to breakfast those rogues are out of sight by now  nevertheless amyas was not proof against the temptation of going over to the inndoor and asking who were the gentlemen who went with mr leigh  gentlemen of wales said the ostler who came last night in a pinnace from milfordhaven and their names mr morgan evans and mr evan morgans  mr judas iscariot and mr iscariot judas said amyas between his teeth and then observed aloud that the welsh gentlemen seemed rather poor horsemen  so i said to mr leighs groom your worship but he says that those parts be so uncommon rough and mountainous that the poor gentlemen you see being enforced to hunt on foot have no such opportunities as young gentlemen hereabout like your worship whom god preserve and send a virtuous lady and one worthy of you  thou hast a villainously glib tongue fellow said amyas who was thoroughly out of humor and a sneaking down visage too when i come to look at you i doubt but you are a papist too i do  well sir and what if i am i trust i dont break the queens laws by that if i dont attend northam church i pay my months shilling for the use of the poor as the act directs and beyond that neither you nor any man dare demand of me  dare act directs you rascally lawyer you and whence does an ostler like you get your shilling to pay withal answer me the examinate found it so difficult to answer the question that he suddenly became afflicted with deafness  do you hear roared amyas catching at him with his lions paw  yes missus anon anon missus quoth he to an imaginary landlady inside and twisting under amyass hand like an eel vanished into the house while frank got the hotheaded youth away  what a plague is one to do then that fellow was a papist spy  of course he was said frank  then what is one to do if the whole country is full of them  not to make fools of ourselves about them and so leave them to make fools of themselves  thats all very fine butwell i shall remember the villains face if i see him again  there is no harm in that said frank  glad you think so  dont quarrel with me amyas the first day  quarrel with thee my darling old fellow i had sooner kiss the dust off thy feet if i were worthy of it so now away home my inside cries cupboard  in the meanwhile messrs evans and morgans were riding away as fast as the rough bylanes would let them along the fresh coast of the bay steering carefully clear of northam town on the one hand and on the other of portledge where dwelt that most protestant justice of the peace mr coffin and it was well for them that neither amyas leigh nor indeed any other loyal englishman was by when they entered as they shortly did the lonely woods which stretch along the southern wall of the bay for there eustace leigh pulled up short and both he and his groom leaping from their horses knelt down humbly in the wet grass and implored the blessing of the two valiant gentlemen of wales who having graciously bestowed it with three fingers apiece became thenceforth no longer morgan evans and evan morgans welshmen and gentlemen but father parsons and father gampian jesuits and gentlemen in no sense in which that word is applied in this book  after a few minutes the party were again in motion ambling steadily and cautiously along the high tableland towards moorwinstow in the west while beneath them on the right at the mouth of richwooded glens opened vistas of the bright blue bay and beyond it the sandhills of braunton and the ragged rocks of morte while far away to the north and west the lonely isle of lundy hung like a soft gray cloud  but they were not destined to reach their point as peaceably as they could have wished for just as they got opposite clovelly dike the huge old roman encampment which stands about midway in their journey they heard a halloo from the valley below answered by a fainter one far ahead at which like a couple of rogues as indeed they were father campian and father parsons looked at each other and then both stared round at the wild desolate open pasture for the country was then all unenclosed and the great dark furzegrown banks above their heads and campian remarked gently to parsons that this was a very dreary spot and likely enough for robbers  a likelier spot for us father said eustace punning the old romans knew what they were about when they put their legions up aloft here to overlook land and sea for miles away and we may thank them some day for their leavings the banks are all sound there is plenty of good water inside and added he in latin in case our spanish friendsyou understand  pauca verba my son said campian but as he spoke up from the ditch close beside him as if rising out of the earth burst through the furzebushes an armed cavalier  pardon gentlemen shouted he as the jesuit and his horse recoiled against the groom stand for your lives  mater caelorum moaned campian while parsons who as all the world knows was a blustering bully enough at least with his tongue asked what a murrain right had he to stop honest folks on the queens highway confirming the same with a mighty oath which he set down as peccatum veniale on account of the sudden necessity nay indeed fraus pia as proper to support the character of that valiant gentleman of wales mr evan morgans but the horseman taking no notice of his hint dashed across the nose of eustace leighs horse with a hillo old lad where ridest so early and peering down for a moment into the ruts of the narrow trackway struck spurs into his horse shouting a fresh slot right away for hartland forward gentlemen all follow follow follow  who is this roysterer asked parsons loftily  will cary of clovelly an awful heretic and here come more behind  and as he spoke four or five more mounted gallants plunged in and out of the great dikes and thundered on behind the party whose horses quite understanding what game was up burst into full gallop neighing and squealing and in another minute the hapless jesuits were hurling along over moor and moss after a hart of grease  parsons who though a vulgar bully was no coward supported the character of mr evan morgans well enough and he would have really enjoyed himself had he not been in agonies of fear lest those precious saddlebags in front of him should break from their lashings and rolling to the earth expose to the hoofs of heretic horses perhaps to the gaze of heretic eyes such a cargo of bulls dispensations secret correspondences seditious tracts and so forth that at the very thought of their being seen his head felt loose upon his shoulders but the future martyr behind him mr morgan evans gave himself up at once to abject despair and as he bumped and rolled along sought vainly for comfort in professional ejaculations in the latin tongue  mater intemerata eripe me eugh i am down adhaesit pavimento venterno i am not el dilectum tuum e potestate canisah audisti me inter cornua unicornium put this too down inughthy account in favor of my pooroh sharpness of this saddle oh whither barbarous islanders  now riding on his quarter not in the rough trackway like a cockney but through the soft heather like a sportsman was a very gallant knight whom we all know well by this time richard grenville by name who had made mr cary and the rest his guests the night before and then ridden out with them at five oclock that morning after the wholesome early ways of the time to rouse a wellknown stag in the glens at buckish by help of mr coffins hounds from portledge who being as good a latiner as campians self and overhearing both the scraps of psalm and the barbarous islanders pushed his horse alongside of mr eustace leigh and at the first check said with two low bows towards the two strangers  i hope mr leigh will do me the honor of introducing me to his guests i should be sorry and mr cary also that any gentle strangers should become neighbors of ours even for a day without our knowing who they are who honor our western thule with a visit and showing them ourselves all due requital for the compliment of their presence  after which the only thing which poor eustace could do especially as it was spoken loud enough for all bystanders was to introduce in due form mr evan morgans and mr morgan evans who hearing the name and what was worse seeing the terrible face with its quiet searching eye felt like a brace of partridgepoults cowering in the stubble with a hawk hanging ten feet over their heads  gentlemen said sir richard blandly cap in hand i fear that your mails must have been somewhat in your way in this unexpected gallop if you will permit my groom who is behind to disencumber you of them and carry them to chapel you will both confer an honor on me and be enabled yourselves to see the mort more pleasantly  a twinkle of fun in spite of all his efforts played about good sir richards eye as he gave this searching hint the two welsh gentlemen stammered out clumsy thanks and pleading great haste and fatigue from a long journey contrived to fall to the rear and vanish with their guides as soon as the slot had been recovered  will said sir richard pushing alongside of young cary  your worship  jesuits will  may the father of lies fly away with them over the nearest cliff  he will not do that while this irish trouble is about those fellows are come to practise here for saunders and desmond  perhaps they have a consecrated banner in their bag the scoundrels shall i and young coffin on and stop them hard if the honest men may not rob the thieves once in a way  no give the devil rope and he will hang himself keep thy tongue at home and thine eyes too will  how then  let clovelly beach be watched night and day like any mousehole no one can land round harty point with these southwesters stop every fellow who has the ghost of an irish brogue come he in or go he out and send him over to me  some one should guard budehaven sir  leave that to me now then forward gentlemen all or the stag will take the sea at the abbey  and on they crashed down the hartland glens through the oakscrub and the great crownferns and the baying of the slowhound and the tantaras of the horn died away farther and fainter toward the blue atlantic while the conspirators with lightened hearts pricked fast across bursdon upon their evil errand but eustace leigh had other thoughts and other cares than the safety of his fathers two mysterious guests important as that was in his eyes for he was one of the many who had drunk in sweet poison though in his case it could hardly be called sweet from the magic glances of the rose of torridge he had seen her in the town and for the first time in his life fallen utterly in love and now that she had come down close to his fathers house he looked on her as a lamb fallen unawares into the jaws of the greedy wolf which he felt himself to be for eustaces love had little or nothing of chivalry selfsacrifice or purity in it those were virtues which were not taught at rheims careful as the jesuits were over the practical morality of their pupils this severe restraint had little effect in producing real habits of selfcontrol what little eustace had learnt of women from them was as base and vulgar as the rest of their teaching what could it be else if instilled by men educated in the schools of italy and france in the age which produced the foul novels of cinthio and bandello and compelled rabelais in order to escape the rack and stake to hide the light of his great wisdom not beneath a bushel but beneath a dunghill the age in which the romish church had made marriage a legalized tyranny and the laity by a natural and pardonable revulsion had exalted adultery into a virtue and a science that all love was lust that all women had their price that profligacy though an ecclesiastical sin was so pardonable if not necessary as to be hardly a moral sin were notions which eustace must needs have gathered from the hints of his preceptors for their written works bear to this day fullest and foulest testimony that such was their opinion and that their conception of the relation of the sexes was really not a whit higher than that of the profligate laity who confessed to them he longed to marry rose salterne with a wild selfish fury but only that he might be able to claim her as his own property and keep all others from her of her as a coequal and ennobling helpmate as one in whose honor glory growth of heart and soul his own were inextricably wrapt up he had never dreamed marriage would prevent god from being angry with that with which otherwise he might be angry and therefore the sanction of the church was the more probable and safe course but as yet his suit was in very embryo he could not even tell whether rose knew of his love and he wasted miserable hours in maddening thoughts and tost all night upon his sleepless bed and rose next morning fierce and pale to invent fresh excuses for going over to her uncles house and lingering about the fruit which he dared not snatch    chapter iv  the two ways of being crost in love       i could not love thee dear so much      loved i not honor morelovelace  and what all this while has become of the fair breaker of so many hearts to whom i have not yet even introduced my readers  she was sitting in the little farmhouse beside the mill buried in the green depths of the valley of combe halfway between stow and chapel sulking as much as her sweet nature would let her at being thus shut out from all the grand doings at bideford and forced to keep a martinmas lent in that far western glen so lonely was she in fact that though she regarded eustace leigh with somewhat of aversion and being a good protestant with a great deal of suspicion she could not find it in her heart to avoid a chat with him whenever he came down to the farm and to its mill which he contrived to do on i know not what wouldbe errand almost every day her uncle and aunt at first looked stiff enough at these visits and the latter took care always to make a third in every conversation but still mr leigh was a gentlemans son and it would not do to be rude to a neighboring squire and a good customer and rose was the rich mans daughter and they poor cousins so it would not do either to quarrel with her and besides the pretty maid half by wilfulness and half by her sweet winning tricks generally contrived to get her own way wheresoever she went and she herself had been wise enough to beg her aunt never to leave them alonefor she could not abear the sight of mr eustace only she must have some one to talk with down here on which her aunt considered that she herself was but a simple countrywoman and that townsfolks ways of course must be very different from hers and that people knew their own business best and so forth and let things go on their own way eustace in the meanwhile who knew well that the difference in creed between him and rose was likely to be the very hardest obstacle in the way of his love took care to keep his private opinions well in the background and instead of trying to convert the folk at the mill daily bought milk or flour from them and gave it away to the old women in moorwinstow who agreed that after all for a papist he was a godly young man enough and at last having taken counsel with campian and parsons on certain political plots then on foot came with them to the conclusion that they would all three go to church the next sunday where messrs evan morgans and morgan evans having crammed up the rubrics beforehand behaved themselves in a most orthodox and unexceptionable manner as did also poor eustace to the great wonder of all good folks and then went home flattering himself that he had taken in parson clerk and people not knowing in his simple unsimplicity and cunning foolishness that each good wife in the parish was saying to the other he turned protestant the devil turned monk hes only after mistress salterne the young hypocrite  but if the two jesuits found it expedient for the holy cause in which they were embarked to reconcile themselves outwardly to the powers that were they were none the less busy in private in plotting their overthrow  ever since april last they had been playing at hideandseek through the length and breadth of england and now they were only lying quiet till expected news from ireland should give them their cue and a great rising of the west should sweep from her throne that stiffnecked persecuting excommunicate reprobate illegitimate and profligate usurper who falsely called herself the queen of england  for they had as stoutly persuaded themselves in those days as they have in these with a real baconian contempt of the results of sensible experience that the heart of england was really with them and that the british nation was on the point of returning to the bosom of the catholic church and giving up elizabeth to be led in chains to the feet of the rightful lord of creation the old man of the seven hills and this fair hope which has been skipping just in front of them for centuries always a step farther off like the place where the rainbow touches the ground they used to announce at times in language which terrified old mr leigh one day indeed as eustace entered his fathers private room after his usual visit to the mill he could hear voices high in dispute parsons as usual blustering mr leigh peevishly deprecating and campian who was really the sweetestnatured of men trying to pour oil on the troubled waters whereat eustace for the good of the cause of course stopped outside and listened  my excellent sir said mr leigh does not your very presence here show how i am affected toward the holy cause of the catholic faith but i cannot in the meanwhile forget that i am an englishman  and what is england said parsons a heretic and schismatic babylon whereof it is written come out of her my people lest you be partaker of her plagues yea what is a country an arbitrary division of territory by the princes of this world who are naught and come to naught they are created by the peoples will their existence depends on the sanction of him to whom all power is given in heaven and earthour holy father the pope take away the latter and what is a kingthe people who have made him may unmake him  my dear sir recollect that i have sworn allegiance to queen elizabeth  yes sir you have sir and as i have shown at large in my writings you were absolved from that allegiance from the moment that the bull of pius the fifth declared her a heretic and excommunicate and thereby to have forfeited all dominion whatsoever i tell you sir what i thought you should have known already that since the year 1569 england has had no queen no magistrates no laws no lawful authority whatsoever and that to own allegiance to any english magistrate sir or to plead in an english court of law is to disobey the apostolic precept how dare you go to law before the unbelievers i tell you sir rebellion is now not merely permitted it is a duty  take care sir for gods sake take care said mr leigh right or wrong i cannot have such language used in my house for the sake of my wife and children i cannot  my dear brother parsons deal more gently with the flock interposed campian your opinion though probable as i well know in the eyes of most of our order is hardly safe enough here the opposite is at least so safe that mr leigh may well excuse his conscience for accepting it after all are we not sent hither to proclaim this very thing and to relieve the souls of good catholics from a burden which has seemed to them too heavy  yes said parsons halfsulkily to allow all balaams who will to sacrifice to baal while they call themselves by the name of the lord  my dear brother have i not often reminded you that naaman was allowed to bow himself in the house of rimmon and can we therefore complain of the office to which the holy father has appointed us to declare to such as mr leigh his especial grace by which the bull of pius the fifth on whose soul god have mercy shall henceforth bind the queen and the heretics only but in no ways the catholics at least as long as the present tyranny prevents the pious purposes of the bull  be it so sir be it so only observe this mr leigh that our brother campian confesses this to be a tyranny observe sir that the bull does still bind the socalled queen and that she and her magistrates are still none the less usurpers nonentities and shadows of a shade and observe this sir that when that which is lawful is excused to the weak it remains no less lawful to the strong the seven thousand who had not bowed the knee to baal did not slay his priests but elijah did and won to himself a good reward and if the rest of the children of israel sinned not in not slaying eglon yet ehuds deed was none the less justified by all laws human and divine  for heavens sake do not talk so sir or i must leave the room what have i to do with ehud and eglon and slaughters and tyrannies our queen is a very good queen if heaven would but grant her repentance and turn her to the true faith i have never been troubled about religion nor any one else that i know of in the west country  you forget mr trudgeon of launceston father and poor father mayne interposed eustace who had by this time slipped in and campian added softly  yes your west of england also has been honored by its martyrs as well as my london by the precious blood of story  what young malapert cried poor leigh facing round upon his son glad to find any one on whom he might vent his illhumor are you too against me with a murrain on you and pray what the devil brought cuthbert mayne to the gallows and turned mr trudgeon he was always a foolish hothead out of house and home but just such treasonable talk as mr parsons must needs hold in my house to make a beggar of me and my children as he will before he has done  the blessed virgin forbid said campian  the blessed virgin forbid but you must help her to forbid it mr campian we should never have had the law of 1571 against bulls and agnus deis and blessed grains if the popes bull of 1569 had not made them matter of treason by preventing a poor creatures saving his soul in the true church without putting his neck into a halter by denying the queens authority  what sir almost roared parsons do you dare to speak evil of the edicts of the vicar of christ  i no i didnt who says i did all i meant was i am suremr campian you are a reasonable man speak for me  mr leigh only meant i am sure that the holy fathers prudent intentions have been so far defeated by the perverseness and invincible misunderstanding of the heretics that that which was in itself meant for the good of the oppressed english catholics has been perverted to their harm  and thus reverend sir said eustace glad to get into his fathers good graces again my father attaches blame not to the popeheaven forbidbut to the pravity of his enemies  and it is for this very reason said campian that we have brought with us the present merciful explanation of the bull  ill tell you what gentlemen said mr leigh who like other weak men grew in valor as his opponent seemed inclined to make peace i dont think the declaration was needed after the new law of 1571 was made it was never put in force till mayne and trudgeon made fools of themselves and that was full six years there were a few offenders they say who were brought up and admonished and let go but even that did not happen down here and need not happen now unless you put my son here for you shall never put me i warrant you upon some deed which had better be left alone and so bring us all to shame  your son sir if not openly vowed to god has i hope a due sense of that inward vocation which we have seen in him and reverences his spiritual fathers too well to listen to the temptations of his earthly father  what sir will you teach my son to disobey me  your son is ours also sir this is strange language in one who owes a debt to the church which it was charitably fancied he meant to pay in the person of his child  these last words touched poor mr leigh in a sore point and breaking all bounds he swore roundly at parsons who stood foaming with rage  a plague upon you sir and a black assizes for you for you will come to the gallows yet do you mean to taunt me in my own house with that hartland land you had better go back and ask those who sent you where the dispensation to hold the land is which they promised to get me years ago and have gone on putting me off till they have got my money and my son and my conscience and i vow before all the saints seem now to want my head over and above god help meand the poor mans eyes fairly filled with tears  now was eustaces turn to be roused for after all he was an englishman and a gentleman and he said kindly enough but firmly  courage my dearest father remember that i am still your son and not a jesuit yet and whether i ever become one i promise you will depend mainly on the treatment which you meet with at the hands of these reverend gentlemen for whom i as having brought them hither must consider myself as surety to you  if a powderbarrel had exploded in the jesuits faces they could not have been more amazed campian looked blank at parsons and parsons at campian till the stouterhearted of the two recovering his breath at last  sir do you know sir the curse pronounced on those who after putting their hand to the plough look back  eustace was one of those impulsive men with a lack of moral courage who dare raise the devil but never dare fight him after he has been raised and he now tried to pass off his speech by winking and making signs in the direction of his father as much as to say that he was only trying to quiet the old mans fears but campian was too frightened parsons too angry to take his hints and he had to carry his part through  all i read is father parsons that such are not fit for the kingdom of god of which high honor i have for some time past felt myself unworthy i have much doubt just now as to my vocation and in the meanwhile have not forgotten that i am a citizen of a free country and so saying he took his fathers arm and walked out  his last words had hit the jesuits hard they had put the poor cobwebspinners in mind of the humiliating fact which they have had thrust on them daily from that time till now and yet have never learnt the lesson that all their scholastic cunning plotting intriguing bulls pardons indulgences and the rest of it are on this side the channel a mere enchanters cloudcastle and fata morgana which vanishes into empty air by one touch of that magic wand the constables staff a citizen of a free countrythere was the rub and they looked at each other in more utter perplexity than ever at last parsons spoke  theres a woman in the wind ill lay my life on it i saw him blush up crimson yesterday when his mother asked him whether some rose salterne or other was still in the neighborhood  a woman well the spirit may be willing though the flesh be weak we will inquire into this the youth may do us good service as a layman and if anything should happen to his elder brother whom the saints protect he is heir to some wealth in the meanwhile our dear brother parsons will perhaps see the expediency of altering our tactics somewhat while we are here  and thereupon a long conversation began between the two who had been sent together after the wise method of their order in obedience to the precept two are better than one in order that campian might restrain parsons vehemence and parsons spur on campians gentleness and so each act as the supplement of the other and each also it must be confessed gave advice pretty nearly contradictory to his fellows if occasion should require without the danger as their writers have it of seeming changeable and inconsistent  the upshot of this conversation was that in a day or two during which time mr leigh and eustace also had made the amende honorable and matters went smoothly enough father campian asked father francis the household chaplain to allow him as an especial favor to hear eustaces usual confession on the ensuing friday  poor father francis dared not refuse so great a man and assented with an inward groan knowing well that the intent was to worm out some family secrets whereby his power would be diminished and the jesuits increased for the regular priesthood and the jesuits throughout england were toward each other in a state of armed neutrality which wanted but little at any moment to become open war as it did in james the firsts time when those meek missionaries by their gentle moral tortures literally hunted to death the poor popish bishop of hippopotamus that is to say london for the time being  however campian heard eustaces confession and by putting to him such questions as may be easily conceived by those who know anything about the confessional discovered satisfactorily enough that he was what campian would have called in love though i should question much the propriety of the term as applied to any facts which poor prurient campian discovered or indeed knew how to discover seeing that a swine has no eye for pearls but he had found out enough he smiled and set to work next vigorously to discover who the lady might be  if he had frankly said to eustace i feel for you and if your desires are reasonable or lawful or possible i will help you with all my heart and soul he might have had the young mans secret heart and saved himself an hours trouble but of course he took instinctively the crooked and suspicious method expected to find the case the worst possibleas a man was bound to do who had been trained to take the lowest possible view of human nature and to consider the basest motives as the mainspring of all human actionand began his moral torture accordingly by a series of delicate questions which poor eustace dodged in every possible way though he knew that the good father was too cunning for him and that he must give in at last nevertheless like a rabbit who runs squealing round and round before the weasel into whose jaws it knows that it must jump at last by force of fascination he parried and parried and pretended to be stupid and surprised and honorably scrupulous and even angry while every question as to her being married or single catholic or heretic english or foreign brought his tormentor a step nearer the goal at last when campian finding the business not such a very bad one had asked something about her worldly wealth eustace saw a door of escape and sprang at it  even if she be a heretic she is heiress to one of the wealthiest merchants in devon  ah said campian thoughtfully and she is but eighteen you say  only eighteen  ah well my son there is time she may be reconciled to the church or you may change  i shall die first  ah poor lad well she may be reconciled and her wealth may be of use to the cause of heaven  and it shall be of use only absolve me and let me be at peace let me have but her he cried piteously i do not want her wealthnot i let me have but her and that but for one year one month one dayand all the restmoney fame talents yea my life itself hers if it be neededare at the service of holy church ay i shall glory in showing my devotion by some special sacrificesome desperate deed prove me now and see what there is i will not do  and so eustace was absolved after which campian added  this is indeed well my son for there is a thing to be done now but it may be at the risk of life  prove me cried eustace impatiently  here is a letter which was brought me last night no matter from whence you can understand it better than i and i longed to have shown it you but that i feared my son had become  you feared wrongly then my dear father campian  so campian translated to him the cipher of the letter  this to evan morgans gentleman at mr leighs house in moorwinstow devonshire news may be had by one who will go to the shore of clovelly any evening after the 25th of november at dead low tide and there watch for a boat rowed by one with a red beard and a portugal by his speech if he be asked how many he will answer eight hundred and one take his letters and read them if the shore be watched let him who comes show a light three times in a safe place under the cliff above the town below is dangerous landing farewell and expect great things  i will go said eustace tomorrow is the 25th and i know a sure and easy place your friend seems to know these shores well  ah what is it we do not know said campian with a mysterious smile and now  and now to prove to you how i trust to you you shall come with me and see thisthe lady of whom i spoke and judge for yourself whether my fault is not a venial one  ah my son have i not absolved you already what have i to do with fair faces nevertheless i will come both to show you that i trust you and it may be to help towards reclaiming a heretic and saving a lost soul who knows  so the two set out together and as it was appointed they had just got to the top of the hill between chapel and stow mill when up the lane came none other than mistress rose salterne herself in all the glories of a new scarlet hood from under which her large dark languid eyes gleamed soft lightnings through poor eustaces heart and marrow up to them she tripped on delicate ankles and tiny feet tall lithe and graceful a true westcountry lass and as she passed them with a pretty blush and courtesy even campian looked back at the fair innocent creature whose long dark curls after the then country fashion rolled down from beneath the hood below her waist entangling the soul of eustace leigh within their glossy nets  there whispered he trembling from head to foot can you excuse me now  i had excused you long ago said the kindhearted father alas that so much fair red and white should have been created only as a feast for worms  a feast for gods you mean cried eustace on whose common sense the naive absurdity of the last speech struck keenly and then as if to escape the scolding which he deserved for his heathenry  will you let me return for a moment i will follow you let me go  campian saw that it was of no use to say no and nodded eustace darted from his side and running across a field met rose full at the next turn of the road  she started and gave a pretty little shriek  mr leigh i thought you had gone forward  i came back to speak to you rosemistress salterne i mean  to me  to you i must speak tell you all or die and he pressed up close to her she shrank back somewhat frightened  do not stir do not go i implore you rose only hear me and fiercely and passionately seizing her by the hand he poured out the whole story of his love heaping her with every fantastic epithet of admiration which he could devise  there was little perhaps of all his words which rose had not heard many a time before but there was a quiver in his voice and a fire in his eye from which she shrank by instinct  let me go she said you are too rough sir  ay he said seizing now both her hands rougher perhaps than the gay gallants of bideford who serenade you and write sonnets to you and send you posies rougher but more loving rose do not turn away i shall die if you take your eyes off me tell metell me now herethis momentbefore we partif i may love you  go away she answered struggling and bursting into tears this is too rude if i am but a merchants daughter i am gods child remember that i am alone leave me go or i will call for help  eustace had heard or read somewhere that such expressions in a womans mouth were mere facons de parler and on the whole signs that she had no objection to be alone and did not intend to call for help and he only grasped her hands the more fiercely and looked into her face with keen and hungry eyes but she was in earnest nevertheless and a loud shriek made him aware that if he wished to save his own good name he must go but there was one question for an answer to which he would risk his very life  yes proud woman i thought so some one of those gay gallants has been beforehand with me tell me who  but she broke from him and passed him and fled down the lane  mark it cried he after her you shall rue the day when you despised eustace leigh mark it proud beauty and he turned back to join campian who stood in some trepidation  you have not hurt the maiden my son i thought i heard a scream  hurt her no would god that she were dead nevertheless and i by her say no more to me father we will home even campian knew enough of the world to guess what had happened and they both hurried home in silence  and so eustace leigh played his move and lost it  poor little rose having run nearly to chapel stopped for very shame and walked quietly by the cottages which stood opposite the gate and then turned up the lane towards moorwinstow village whither she was bound but on second thoughts she felt herself so red and flustered that she was afraid of going into the village for fear as she said to herself of making people talk and so turning into a bypath struck away toward the cliffs to cool her blushes in the seabreeze and there finding a quiet grassy nook beneath the crest of the rocks she sat down on the turf and fell into a great meditation  rose salterne was a thorough specimen of a westcoast maiden full of passionate impulsive affections and wild dreamy imaginations a fit subject as the northdevon women are still for all romantic and gentle superstitions left early without mothers care she had fed her fancy upon the legends and ballads of her native land till she believedwhat did she not believeof mermaids and pixies charms and witches dreams and omens and all that world of magic in which most of the countrywomen and countrymen too believed firmly enough but twenty years ago then her fathers house was seldom without some merchant or seacaptain from foreign parts who like othello had his tales of          antres vast and deserts idle      of rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads reach heaven  and       and of the cannibals that each other eat      the anthropophagi and men whose heads      do grow beneath their shoulders  all which tales she like desdemona devoured with greedy ears whenever she could the house affairs with haste despatch and when these failed there was still boundless store of wonders open to her in old romances which were then to be found in every english house of the better class the legend of king arthur florice and blancheflour sir ysumbras sir guy of warwick palamon and arcite and the romaunt of the rose were with her textbooks and canonical authorities and lucky it was perhaps for her that sidneys arcadia was still in petto or mr frank who had already seen the first book or two in manuscript and extolled it above all books past present or to come would have surely brought a copy down for rose and thereby have turned her poor little flighty brains upside down forever and with her head full of these it was no wonder if she had likened herself of late more than once to some of those peerless princesses of old for whose fair hand paladins and kaisers thundered against each other in tilted field and perhaps she would not have been sorry provided of course no one was killed if duels and passages of arms in honor of her as her father reasonably dreaded had actually taken place  for rose was not only well aware that she was wooed but found the said wooing and little shame to her a very pleasant process not that she had any wish to break hearts she did not break her heart for any of her admirers and why should they break theirs for her they were all very charming each in his way the gentlemen at least for she had long since learnt to turn up her nose at merchants and burghers but one of them was not so very much better than the other  of course mr frank leigh was the most charming but then as a courtier and squire of dames he had never given her a sign of real love nothing but sonnets and compliments and there was no trusting such things from a gallant who was said though by the by most scandalously to have a lady love at milan and another at vienna and halfadozen in the court and halfadozen more in the city  and very charming was mr william cary with his quips and his jests and his galliards and lavoltas over and above his rich inheritance but then charming also mr coffin of portledge though he were a little proud and stately but which of the two should she choose it would be very pleasant to be mistress of clovelly court but just as pleasant to find herself lady of portledge where the coffins had lived ever since noahs flood if indeed they had not merely returned thither after that temporary displacement and to bring her wealth into a family which was as proud of its antiquity as any nobleman in devon and might have made a fourth to that famous trio of devonshire cs of which it is written       crocker cruwys and copplestone      when the conqueror came were all at home  and mr hugh fortescue toopeople said that he was certain to become a great soldierperhaps as great as his brother arthurand that would be pleasant enough too though he was but the younger son of an innumerable family but then so was amyas leigh ah poor amyas her girls fancy for him had vanished or rather perhaps it was very much what it always had been only that four or five more girls fancies beside it had entered in and kept it in due subjection but still she could not help thinking a good deal about him and his voyage and the reports of his great strength and beauty and valor which had already reached her in that outoftheway corner and though she was not in the least in love with him she could not help hoping that he had at least to put her pretty little thought in the mildest shape not altogether forgotten her and was hungering too with all her fancy to give him no peace till he had told her all the wonderful things which he had seen and done in this evermemorable voyage so that altogether it was no wonder if in her last nights dream the figure of amyas had been even more forward and troublesome than that of frank or the rest  but moreover another figure had been forward and troublesome enough in last nights sleepworld and forward and troublesome enough too now in todays wakingworld namely eustace the rejected how strange that she should have dreamt of him the night before and dreamt too of his fighting with mr frank and mr amyas it must be a warningsee she had met him the very next day in this strange way so the first half of her dream had come true and after what had past she only had to breathe a whisper and the second part of the dream would come true also if she wished for a passage of arms in her own honor she could easily enough compass one not that she would do it for worlds and after all though mr eustace had been very rude and naughty yet still it was not his own fault he could not help being in love with her andand in short the poor little maid felt herself one of the most important personages on earth with all the cares or hearts of the country in her keeping and as much perplexed with matters of weight as ever was any cleophila or dianeme fiordispina or flourdeluce in verse run tame or prose run mad  poor little rose had she but had a mother but she was to learn her lesson such as it was in another school she was too shy too proud perhaps to tell her aunt her mighty troubles but a counsellor she must have and after sitting with her head in her hands for halfanhour or more she arose suddenly and started off along the cliffs towards marsland she would go and see lucy passmore the white witch lucy knew everything lucy would tell her what to do perhaps even whom to marry  lucy was a fat jolly woman of fifty with little pigeyes which twinkled like sparks of fire and eyebrows which sloped upwards and outwards like those of a satyr as if she had been as indeed she had all her life looking out of the corners of her eyes her qualifications as white witch were boundless cunning equally boundless good nature considerable knowledge of human weaknesses some mesmeric power some skill in yarbs as she called her simples a firm faith in the virtue of her own incantations and the faculty of holding her tongue by dint of these she contrived to gain a fair share of money and also which she liked even better of power among the simple folk for many miles round if a child was scalded a tooth ached a piece of silver was stolen a heifer shrewstruck a pig bewitched a young damsel crost in love lucy was called in and lucy found a remedy especially for the latter complaint now and then she found herself on ticklish ground for the kindheartedness which compelled her to help all distressed damsels out of a scrape sometimes compelled her also to help them into one whereon enraged fathers called lucy ugly names and threatened to send her into exeter gaol for a witch and she smiled quietly and hinted that if she were like some that were ready to return evil for evil such talk as that would bring no blessing on them that spoke it which being translated into plain english meant if you trouble me i will overlook i e fascinate you and then your pigs will die your horses stray your cream turn sour your barns be fired your son have st vituss dance your daughter fits and so on woe on woe till you are very probably starved to death in a ditch by virtue of this terrible little eye of mine at which in spite of all your swearing and bullying you know you are now shaking in your shoes for fear so you had much better hold your tongue give me a drink of cider and leave ill alone lest you make it worse  not that lucy ever proceeded to any such fearful extremities on the contrary her boast and her belief too was that she was sent into the world to make poor souls as happy as she could by lawful means of course if possible but if notwhy unlawful ones were better than none for she couldnt abear to see the poor creatures taking on she was too too tenderhearted and so she was to every one but her husband a tall simplehearted rabbitfaced man a good deal older than herself fully agreeing with sir richard grenvilles great axiom that he who cannot obey cannot rule lucy had been for the last fiveandtwenty years training him pretty smartly to obey her with the intention it is to be charitably hoped of letting him rule her in turn when his lesson was perfected he bore his honors however meekly enough having a boundless respect for his wifes wisdom and a firm belief in her supernatural powers and let her go her own way and earn her own money while he got a little more in a truly pastoral method not extinct yet along those lonely cliffs by feeding a herd of some dozen donkeys and twenty goats the donkeys fetched at each lowtide white shellsand which was to be sold for manure to the neighboring farmers the goats furnished milk and kiddypies and when there was neither milking nor sandcarrying to be done old will passmore just sat under a sunny rock and watched the buckgoats rattle their horns together thinking about nothing at all and taking very good care all the while neither to inquire nor to see who came in and out of his little cottage in the glen  the prophetess when rose approached her oracular cave was seated on a tripod in front of the fire distilling strong waters out of pennyroyal but no sooner did her distinguished visitor appear at the hatch than the still was left to take care of itself and a clean apron and mutch having been slipt on lucy welcomed rose with endless courtesies andbless my dear soul alive who ever would have thought to see the rose of torridge to my poor little place  rose sat down and then how to begin was more than she knew and she stayed silent a full five minutes looking earnestly at the point of her shoe till lucy who was an adept in such cases thought it best to proceed to business at once and save rose the delicate operation of opening the ball herself and so in her own way half fawning half familiar  well my dear young lady and what is it i can do for ye for i guess you want a bit of old lucys help eh though im most mazed to see ye here surely i should have supposed that pretty face could manage they sort of matters for itself eh  rose thus bluntly charged confessed at once and with many blushes and hesitations made her soon understand that what she wanted was to have her fortune told  eh oh i see the pretty face has managed it a bit too well already eh tu many o mun pure fellows well taint every mayden has her pick and choose like some i know of as be blest in love by stars above so you haint made up your mind then  rose shook her head  ahwell she went on in a halfbantering tone not so asy is it then ones gude for one thing and one for another eh one has the blood and another the money  and so the cunning woman as she truly was talking half to herself ran over all the names which she thought likely peering at rose all the while out of the corners of her foxy bright eyes while rose stirred the peat ashes steadfastly with the point of her little shoe half angry half ashamed half frightened to find that the cunning woman had guessed so well both her suitors and her thoughts about them and tried to look unconcerned at each name as it came out  well well said lucy who took nothing by her move simply because there was nothing to take think over itthink over it my dear life and if you did set your mind on any onewhy thenthen maybe i might help you to a sight of him  a sight of him  his sperrit dear life his sperrit only i mane i udnt have no keeping company in my house no not for gowld untowld i udnt but the sperrit of munto see whether mun would be true or not youd like to know that now udnt you my darling  rose sighed and stirred the ashes about vehemently  i must first know who it is to be if you could show me thatnow  oh i can show ye that tu i can ben theres a way to t a sure way but tis mortal cold for the time o year you zee  but what is it then said rose who had in her heart been longing for something of that very kind and had half made up her mind to ask for a charm  why youm not afraid to goo into the say by night for a minute are you and tomorrow night would serve too t will be just low tide to midnight  if you would come with me perhaps  ill come ill come and stand within call to be sure only do ye mind this dear soul alive not to goo telling a crumb about mun noo not for the world or yull see naught at all indeed now and beside theres a noxious business growd up against me up to chapel there and i hear tell how mr leigh saith i shall to exeter gaol for a witchdid ye ever hear the likesbecause his groom jan saith i overlooked munthe papist dog and now never he nor th owld father francis goo by me without a spetting and saying of their ayes and malificasi do know what their rooman latin do mane zo well as ever they i duand a making o their charms and incantations to their saints and idols they be mortal feared of witches they papists and mortal hard on em even on a pure body like me that doth a bit in the white way case why you see dear life said she with one of her humorous twinkles tu to a trade do never agree do ye try my bit of a charm now do ye  rose could not resist the temptation and between them both the charm was agreed on and the next night was fixed for its trial on the payment of certain current coins of the realm for lucy of course must live by her trade and slipping a tester into the dames hand as earnest rose went away home and got there in safety  but in the meanwhile at the very hour that eustace had been prosecuting his suit in the lane at moorwinstow a very different scene was being enacted in mrs leighs room at burrough  for the night before amyas as he was going to bed heard his brother frank in the next room tune his lute and then begin to sing and both their windows being open and only a thin partition between the chambers amyass admiring ears came in for every word of the following canzonet sung in that delicate and mellow tenor voice for which frank was famed among all fair ladies        ah tyrant love megaeras serpents bearing      why thus requite my sighs with venomd smart        ah ruthless dove the vultures talons wearing      why flesh them traitress in this faithful heart        is this my meed  must dragons teeth alone        in venus lawns by lovers hands be sown        nay gentlest cupid twas my pride undid me      nay guiltless dove by mine own wound i fell        to worship not to wed celestials bid me      i dreamt to mate in heaven and wake in hell        forever doomd ixionlike to reel        on mine own passions everburning wheel  at which the simple sailor sighed and longed that he could write such neat verses and sing them so sweetly how he would besiege the ear of rose salterne with amorous ditties but still he could not be everything and if he had the bone and muscle of the family it was but fair that frank should have the brains and voice and after all he was bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh and it was just the same as if he himself could do all the fine things which frank could do for as long as one of the family won honor what matter which of them it was whereon he shouted through the wall good night old songthrush i suppose i need not pay the musicians  what awake answered frank come in here and lull me to sleep with a seasong  so amyas went in and found frank laid on the outside of his bed not yet undrest  i am a bad sleeper said he i spend more time i fear in burning the midnight oil than prudent men should come and be my jongleur my minnesinger and tell me about andes and cannibals and the iceregions and the fireregions and the paradises of the west  so amyas sat down and told but somehow every story which he tried to tell came round by crooked paths yet sure to none other point than rose salterne and how he thought of her here and thought of her there and how he wondered what she would say if she had seen him in this adventure and how he longed to have had her with him to show her that glorious sight till frank let him have his own way and then out came the whole story of the simple fellows daily and hourly devotion to her through those three long years of worldwide wanderings  and oh frank i could hardly think of anything but her in the church the other day god forgive me and it did seem so hard for her to be the only face which i did not seeand have not seen her yet either  so i thought dear lad said frank with one of his sweetest smiles and tried to get her father to let her impersonate the nymph of torridge  did you you dear kind fellow that would have been too delicious  just so too delicious wherefore i suppose it was ordained not to be that which was being delicious enough  and is she as pretty as ever  ten times as pretty dear lad as half the young fellows round have discovered if you mean to win her and wear her and god grant you may fare no worse you will have rivals enough to get rid of  humph said amyas i hope i shall not have to make short work with some of them  i hope not said frank laughing now go to bed and tomorrow morning give your sword to mother to keep lest you should be tempted to draw it on any of her majestys lieges  no fear of that frank i am no swashbuckler thank god but if any one gets in my way ill serve him as the mastiff did the terrier and just drop him over the quay into the river to cool himself or my names not amyas  and the giant swung himself laughing out of the room and slept all night like a seal not without dreams of course of rose salterne  the next morning according to his wont he went into his mothers room whom he was sure to find up and at her prayers for he liked to say his prayers too by her side as he used to do when he was a little boy it seemed so homelike he said after three years knocking up and down in nomans land but coming gently to the door for fear of disturbing her and entering unperceived beheld a sight which stopped him short  mrs leigh was sitting in her chair with her face bowed fondly down upon the head of his brother frank who knelt before her his face buried in her lap amyas could see that his whole form was quivering with stifled emotion their mother was just finishing the last words of a wellknown textfor my sake and the gospels shall receive a hundredfold in this present life fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters  but not a wife interrupted frank with a voice stifled with sobs that was too precious a gift for even him to promise to those who gave up a first love for his sake  and yet said he after a moments silence has he not heaped me with blessings enough already that i must repine and rage at his refusing me one more even though that one beno mother i am your son and gods and you shall know it even though amyas never does and he looked up with his clear blue eyes and white forehead and his face was as the face of an angel  both of them saw that amyas was present and started and blushed his mother motioned him away with her eyes and he went quietly out as one stunned why had his name been mentioned  love cunning love told him all at once this was the meaning of last nights canzonet this was why its words had seemed to fit his own heart so well his brother was his rival and he had been telling him all his love last night what a stupid brute he was how it must have made poor frank wince and then frank had listened so kindly even bid him god speed in his suit what a gentleman old frank was to be sure no wonder the queen was so fond of him and all the court ladieswhy if it came to that what wonder if rose salterne should be fond of him too heyday that would be a pretty fish to find in my net when i come to haul it quoth amyas to himself as he paced the garden and clutching desperately hold of his locks with both hands as if to hold his poor confused head on its shoulders he strode and tramped up and down the shellpaved garden walks for a full half hour till franks voice as cheerful as ever though he more than suspected all called him  come in to breakfast lad and stop grinding and creaking upon those miserable limpets before thou hast set every tooth in my head on edge  amyas whether by dint of holding his head straight or by higher means had got the thoughts of the said head straight enough by this time and in he came and fell to upon the broiled fish and strong ale with a sort of fury as determined to do his duty to the utmost in all matters that day and therefore of course in that most important matter of bodily sustenance while his mother and frank looked at him not without anxiety and even terror doubting what turn his fancy might have taken in so new a case at last  my dear amyas you will really heat your blood with all that strong ale remember those who drink beer think beer  then they think right good thoughts mother and in the meanwhile those who drink water think water eh old frank and heres your health  and clouds are water said his mother somewhat reassured by his genuine good humor and so are rainbows and clouds are angels thrones and rainbows the sign of gods peace on earth  amyas understood the hint and laughed then ill pledge frank out of the next ditch if it please you and him but firsti sayhe must hearken to a parable a manner mystery miracle play i have got in my head like what they have at easter to the townhall now then hearken madam and i and frank will act and up rose amyas and shoved back his chair and put on a solemn face  mrs leigh looked up trembling and frank he scarce knew why rose  no you pitch again you are king david and sit still upon your throne david was a great singer you know and a player on the viols and ruddy too and of a fair countenance so that will fit now then mother dont look so frightened i am not going to play goliath for all my cubits i am to present nathan the prophet now david hearken for i have a message unto thee o king  there were two men in one city one rich and the other poor and the rich man had many flocks and herds and all the fine ladies in whitehall to court if he liked and the poor man had nothing but  and in spite of his broad honest smile amyass deep voice began to tremble and choke  frank sprang up and burst into tears oh amyas my brother my brother stop i cannot endure this oh god was it not enough to have entangled myself in this fatal fancy but over and above i must meet the shame of my brothers discovering it  what shame then id like to know said amyas recovering himself look here brother frank ive thought it all over in the garden and i was an ass and a braggart for talking to you as i did last night of course you love her everybody must and i was a fool for not recollecting that and if you love her your taste and mine agree and what can be better i think you are a sensible fellow for loving her and you think me one and as for who has her why youre the eldest and first come first served is the rule and best to keep to it besides brother frank though im no scholar yet im not so blind but that i tell the difference between you and me and of course your chance against mine for a hundred to one and i am not going to be fool enough to row against wind and tide too im good enough for her i hope but if i am you are better and the good dog may run but its the best that takes the hare and so i have nothing more to do with the matter at all and if you marry her why it will set the old house on its legs again and thats the first thing to be thought of and you may just as well do it as i and better too not but that its a plague a horrible plague went on amyas with a ludicrously doleful visage but so are other things too by the dozen its all in the days work as the huntsman said when the lion ate him one would never get through the furzecroft if one stopped to pull out the prickles the pig didnt scramble out of the ditch by squeaking and the less said the sooner mended nobody was sent into the world only to suck honeypots what must be must man is but dust if you cant get crumb you must fain eat crust so ill go and join the army in ireland and get it out of my head for cannon balls fright away love as well as poverty does and thats all ive got to say wherewith amyas sat down and returned to the beer while mrs leigh wept tears of joy  amyas amyas said frank you must not throw away the hopes of years and for me too oh how just was your parable ah mother mine to what use is all my scholarship and my philosophy when this dear simple sailorlad outdoes me at the first trial of courtesy  my children my children which of you shall i love best which of you is the more noble i thanked god this morning for having given me one such son but to have found that i possess two and mrs leigh laid her head on the table and buried her face in her hands while the generous battle went on  but dearest amyas  but frank if you dont hold your tongue i must go forth it was quite trouble enough to make up ones mind without having you afterwards trying to unmake it again  amyas if you give her up to me god do so to me and more also if i do not hereby give her up to you  he had done it alreadythis morning said mrs leigh looking up through her tears he renounced her forever on his knees before me only he is too noble to tell you so  the more reason i should copy him said amyas setting his lips and trying to look desperately determined and then suddenly jumping up he leaped upon frank and throwing his arms round his neck sobbed out there there now for gods sake let us forget all and think about our mother and the old house and how we may win her honor before we die and that will be enough to keep our hands full without fretting about this woman and thatwhat an ass i have been for years instead of learning my calling dreaming about her and dont know at this minute whether she cares more for me than she does for her fathers prentices  oh amyas every word of yours puts me to fresh shame will you believe that i know as little of her likings as you do  dont tell me that and play the devils game by putting fresh hopes into me when i am trying to kick them out i wont believe it if she is not a fool she must love you and if she dont why be hanged if she is worth loving  my dearest amyas i must ask you too to make no more such speeches to me all those thoughts i have forsworn  only this morning so there is time to catch them again before they are gone too far  only this morning said frank with a quiet smile but centuries have passed since then  centuries i dont see many gray hairs yet  i should not have been surprised if you had though answered frank in so sad and meaning a tone that amyas could only answer  well you are an angel  you at least are something even more to the purpose for you are a man  and both spoke truth and so the battle ended and frank went to his books while amyas who must needs be doing if he was not to dream started off to the dockyard to potter about a new ship of sir richards and forget his woes in the capacity of sir oracle among the sailors and so he had played his move for rose even as eustace had and lost her but not as eustace had    chapter v  clovelly court in the olden time            it was among the ways of good queen bess              who ruled as well as ever mortal can sir            when she was stoggd and the country in a mess              she was wont to send for a devon man sir                                           west country song  the next morning amyas leigh was not to be found not that he had gone out to drown himself in despair or even to bemoan himself down by the torridge side he had simply ridden off frank found to sir richard grenville at stow his mother at once divined the truth that he was gone to try for a post in the irish army and sent off frank after him to bring him home again and make him at least reconsider himself  so frank took horse and rode thereon ten miles or more and then as there were no inns on the road in those days or indeed in these and he had some ten miles more of hilly road before him he turned down the hill towards clovelly court to obtain after the hospitable humane fashion of those days good entertainment for man and horse from mr cary the squire  and when he walked selfinvited like the loudshouting menelaus into the long dark wainscoted hall of the court the first object he beheld was the mighty form of amyas who seated at the long table was alternately burying his face in a pasty and the pasty in his face his sorrows having as it seemed only sharpened his appetite while young will cary kneeling on the opposite bench with his elbows on the table was in that graceful attitude laying down the law fiercely to him in a low voice  hillo lad cried amyas come hither and deliver me out of the hands of this fireeater who i verily believe will kill me if i do not let him kill some one else  ah mr frank said will cary who like all other young gentlemen of these parts held frank in high honor and considered him a very oracle and cynosure of fashion and chivalry welcome here i was just longing for you too i wanted your advice on halfadozen matters sit down and eat there is the ale  none so early thank you  ah no said amyas burying his head in the tankard and then mimicking frank avoid strong ale o mornings it heats the blood thickens the animal spirits and obfuscates the cerebrum with frenetical and lymphatic idols which cloud the quintessential light of the pure reason eh young plato young daniel come hither to judgment and yet though i cannot see through the bottom of the tankard already i can see plain enough still to see this that will shall not fight  shall i not eh who says that mr frank i appeal to you now only hear  we are in the judgmentseat said frank settling to the pasty proceed appellant  well i was telling amyas that tom coffin of portledge i will stand him no longer  let him be then said amyas he could stand very well by himself when i saw him last  plague on you hold your tongue has he any right to look at me as he does whenever i pass him  that depends on how he looks a cat may look at a king provided she dont take him for a mouse  oh i know how he looks and what he means too and he shall stop or i will stop him and the other day when i spoke of rose salterneah groaned frank ates apple againnever mind what i said he burst out laughing in my face and is not that a fair quarrel and what is more i know that he wrote a sonnet and sent it to her to stow by a market woman what right has he to write sonnets when i cant its not fair play mr frank or i am a jew and a spaniard and a papist its not and will smote the table till the plates danced again  my dear knight of the burning pestle i have a plan a device a disentanglement according to most approved rules of chivalry let us fix a day and summon by tuck of drum all young gentlemen under the age of thirty dwelling within fifteen miles of the habitation of that peerless oriana  and all prenticeboys too cried amyas out of the pasty  and all prenticeboys the bold lads shall fight first with good quarterstaves in bideford market till all heads are broken and the head which is not broken let the back belonging to it pay the penalty of the noble members cowardice after which grand tournament to which that of tottenham shall be but a fleabite and a batrachomyomachy  confound you and your long words sir said poor will i know you are flouting me  pazienza signor cavaliere that which is to come is no flouting but bloody and warlike earnest for afterwards all the young gentlemen shall adjourn into a convenient field sand or bogwhich last will be better as no man will be able to run away if he be up to his knees in soft peat and there stripping to our shirts with rapiers of equal length and keenest temper each shall slay his man catch who catch can and the conquerors fight again like a most valiant main of gamecocks as we are till all be dead and out of their woes after which the survivor bewailing before heaven and earth the cruelty of our fair oriana and the slaughter which her basiliscine eyes have caused shall fall gracefully upon his sword and so end the woes of this our lovelorn generation placetne domini as they used to ask in the senate at oxford  really said cary this is too bad  so is pardon me your fighting mr coffin with anything longer than a bodkin  bodkins are too short for such fierce bobadils said amyas they would close in so near that we should have them falling to fisticuffs after the first bout  then let them fight with squirts across the marketplace for by heaven and the queens laws they shall fight with nothing else  my dear mr cary went on frank suddenly changing his bantering tone to one of the most winning sweetness do not fancy that i cannot feel for you or that i as well as you have not known the stings of love and the bitterer stings of jealousy but oh mr cary does it not seem to you an awful thing to waste selfishly upon your own quarrel that divine wrath which as plato says is the very root of all virtues and which has been given you like all else which you have that you may spend it in the service of her whom all bad souls fear and all virtuous souls adoreour peerless queen who dares while she rules england call his sword or his courage his own or any ones but hers are there no spaniards to conquer no wild irish to deliver from their oppressors that two gentlemen of devon can find no better place to flesh their blades than in each others valiant and honorable hearts  by heaven cried amyas frank speaks like a book and for me i do think that christian gentlemen may leave love quarrels to bulls and rams  and that the heir of clovelly said frank smiling may find more noble examples to copy than the stags in his own deerpark  well said will penitently you are a great scholar mr frank and you speak like one but gentlemen must fight sometimes or where would be their honor  i speak said frank a little proudly not merely as a scholar but as a gentleman and one who has fought ere now and to whom it has happened mr cary to kill his man on whose soul may god have mercy but it is my pride to remember that i have never yet fought in my own quarrel and my trust in god that i never shall for as there is nothing more noble and blessed than to fight in behalf of those whom we love so to fight in our own private behalf is a thing not to be allowed to a christian man unless refusal imports utter loss of life or honor and even then it may be though i would not lay a burden on any mans conscience it is better not to resist evil but to overcome it with good  and i can tell you will said amyas i am not troubled with fear of ghosts but when i cut off the frenchmans head i said to myself if that braggart had been slandering me instead of her gracious majesty i should expect to see that head lying on my pillow every time i went to bed at night  god forbid said will with a shudder but what shall i do for to the market tomorrow i will go if it were chokefull of coffins and a ghost in each coffin of the lot  leave the matter to me said amyas i have my device as well as scholar frank here and if there be as i suppose there must be a quarrel in the market tomorrow see if i do not  well you are two good fellows said will let us have another tankard in  and drink the health of mr coffin and all gallant lads of the north said frank and now to my business i have to take this runaway youth here home to his mother and if he will not go quietly i have orders to carry him across my saddle  i hope your nag has a strong back then said amyas but i must go on and see sir richard frank it is all very well to jest as we have been doing but my mind is made up  stop said cary you must stay here tonight first for good fellowships sake and next because i want the advice of our phoenix here our oracle our paragon there mr frank can you construe that for me speak low though gentlemen both there comes my father you had better give me the letter again well father whence this morning  eh company here young men you are always welcome and such as you would there were more of your sort in these dirty times how is your good mother frank eh where have i been will round the housefarm to look at the beeves that sheeted heifer of prowses is all wrong her coat stares like a hedgepigs tell jewell to go up and bring her in before night and then up the forty acres sprang two coveys and picked a leash out of them the irish hawk flies as wild as any haggard still and will never make a bird i had to hand her to tom and take the little peregrine give me a clovelly hawk against the world after all andheigh ho i am very hungry halfpast twelve and dinner not served what master amyas spoiling your appetite with strong ale better have tried sack lad have some now with me  and the worthy old gentleman having finished his oration settled himself on a great bench inside the chimney and put his hawk on a perch over his head while his cockers coiled themselves up close to the warm peatashes and his son set to work to pull off his fathers boots amid sundry warnings to take care of his corns  come master amyas a pint of white wine and sugar and a bit of a shoeinghorn to it ere we dine some pickled prawns now or a rasher off the coals to whet you  thank you quoth amyas but i have drunk a mort of outlandish liquors better and worse in the last three years and yet never found aught to come up to good ale which needs neither shoeinghorn before nor after but takes care of itself and of all honest stomachs too i think  you speak like a book boy said old cary and after all what a plague comes of these newfangled hot wines and aqua vitaes which have come in since the wars but maddening of the brains and fever of the blood  i fear we have not seen the end of that yet said frank my friends write me from the netherlands that our men are falling into a swinish trick of swilling like the hollanders heaven grant that they may not bring home the fashion with them  a man must drink they say or die of the ague in those vile swamps said amyas when they get home here they will not need it  heaven grant it said frank i should be sorry to see devonshire a drunken county and there are many of our men out there with mr champernoun  ah said cary there as in ireland we are proving her majestys saying true that devonshire is her right hand and the young children thereof like the arrows in the hand of the giant  they may well be said his son when some of them are giants themselves like my tall schoolfellow opposite  he will be up and doing again presently ill warrant him said old cary  and that i shall quoth amyas i have been devising brave deeds and see in the distance enchanters to be bound dragons choked empires conquered though not in holland  you do asked will a little sharply for he had had a half suspicion that more was meant than met the ear  yes said amyas turning off his jest again i go to what raleigh calls the land of the nymphs another month i hope will see me abroad in ireland  abroad call it rather at home said old cary for it is full of devon men from end to end and you will be among friends all day long george bourchier from tawstock has the army now in munster and warham st leger is marshal george carew is with lord grey of wilton poor peter carew was killed at glendalough and after the defeat last year when that villain desmond cut off herbert and price the companies were made up with six hundred devon men and arthur fortescue at their head so that the old county holds her head as proudly in the land of ire as she does in the low countries and the spanish main  and where asked amyas is davils of marsland who used to teach me how to catch trout when i was staying down at stow he is in ireland too is he not  ah my lad said mr cary that is a sad story i thought all england had known it  you forget sir i am a stranger surely he is not dead  murdered foully lad murdered like a dog and by the man whom he had treated as his son and who pretended the false knave to call him father  his blood is avenged said amyas fiercely  no by heaven not yet stay dont cry out again i am getting oldi must tell my story my own way it was last julywas it not willover comes to ireland saunders one of those jesuit foxes as the popes legate with money and bulls and a banner hallowed by the pope and the devil knows what beside and with him james fitzmaurice the same fellow who had sworn on his knees to perrott in the church at kilmallock to be a true liegeman to queen elizabeth and confirmed it by all his saints and such a world of his irish howling that perrott told me he was fain to stop his own ears well he had been practising with the king of france but got nothing but laughter for his pains and so went over to the most catholic king and promises him to join ireland to spain and set up popery again and what not and he i suppose thinking it better that ireland should belong to him than to the popes bastard fits him out and sends him off on such another errand as stukelysthough i will say for the honor of devon if stukely lived like a fool he died like an honest man  sir thomas stukely dead too said amyas  wait a while lad and you shall have that tragedy afterwards well where was i oh fitzmaurice and the jesuits land at smerwick with three ships choose a place for a fort bless it with their holy water and their moppings and their scourings and the rest of it to purify it from the stain of heretic dominion but in the meanwhile one of the courtenaysa courtenay of haccombe was itor a courtenay of boconnock silence will i shall have it in a minuteyes a courtenay of haccombe it was lying at anchor near by in a ship of war of his cuts out the three ships and cuts off the dons from the sea john and james desmond with some small rabble go over to the spaniards earl desmond will not join them but will not fight them and stands by to take the winning side and then in comes poor davils sent down by the lord deputy to charge desmond and his brothers in the queens name to assault the spaniards folks say it was rash of his lordship but i say what could be better done every one knows that there never was a stouter or shrewder soldier than davils and the young desmonds i have heard him say many a time used to look on him as their father but he found out what it was to trust englishmen turned irish well the desmonds found out on a sudden that the dons were such desperate paladins that it was madness to meddle though they were five to one and poor davils seeing that there was no fight in them goes back for help and sleeps that night at some place called tralee arthur carter of bideford st legers lieutenant as stout an old soldier as davils himself sleeps in the same bed with him the lacqueyboy who is now with sir richard at stow on the floor at their feet but in the dead of night who should come in but james desmond sword in hand with a dozen of his ruffians at his heels each with his glib over his ugly face and his skene in his hand davils springs up in bed and asks but this what is the matter my son whereon the treacherous villain without giving him time to say a prayer strikes at him naked as he was crying thou shalt be my father no longer nor i thy son thou shalt die and at that all the rest fall on him the poor little lad so he says leaps up to cover his master with his naked body gets three or four stabs of skenes and so falls for dead with his master and captain carter who were dead indeedgod reward them after that the ruffians ransacked the house till they had murdered every englishman in it the lacqueyboy only excepted who crawled out wounded as he was through a window while desmond if you will believe it went back up to his elbows in blood and vaunted his deeds to the spaniards and asked themthere will you take that as a pledge that i am faithful to you and that my lad was the end of henry davils and will be of all who trust to the faith of wild savages  i would go a hundred miles to see that desmond hanged said amyas while great tears ran down his face poor mr davils and now what is the story of sir thomas  your brother must tell you that lad i am somewhat out of breath  and i have a right to tell it said frank with a smile do you know that i was very near being earl of the bog of allen and one of the peers of the realm to king buoncompagna son and heir to his holiness pope gregory the thirteenth  no surely  as i am a gentleman when i was at rome i saw poor stukely often and this and more he offered me on the part as he said of the pope if i would just oblige him in the two little matters of being reconciled to the catholic church and joining the invasion of ireland  poor deluded heretic said will cary to have lost an earldom for your family by such silly scruples of loyalty  it is not a matter for jesting after all said frank but i saw sir thomas often and i cannot believe he was in his senses so frantic was his vanity and his ambition and all the while in private matters as honorable a gentleman as ever however he sailed at last for ireland with his eight hundred spaniards and italians and what is more i know that the king of spain paid their charges marquis vinolajames buoncompagna that isstayed quietly at rome preferring that stukely should conquer his paternal heritage of ireland for him while he took care of the bona robas at home i went down to civita vecchia to see him off and though his younger by many years i could not but take the liberty of entreating him as a gentleman and a man of devon to consider his faith to his queen and the honor of his country there were high words between us god forgive me if i spoke too fiercely for i never saw him again  too fiercely to an open traitor frank why not have run him through  nay i had no clean life for sundays amyas so i could not throw away my weekday one and as for the weal of england i knew that it was little he would damage it and told him so and at that he waxed utterly mad for it touched his pride and swore that if the wind had not been fair for sailing he would have fought me there and then to which i could only answer that i was ready to meet him when he would and he parted from me saying it is a pity sir i cannot fight you now when next we meet it will be beneath my dignity to measure swords with you  i suppose he expected to come back a prince at leastheaven knows i owe him no illwill nor i hope does any man he has paid all debts now in full and got his receipt for them  how did he die then after all  on his voyage he touched in portugal king sebastian was just sailing for africa with his new ally mohammed the prince of fez to help king abdallah and conquer what he could he persuaded stukely to go with him there were those who thought that he as well as the spaniards had no stomach for seeing the popes son king of ireland others used to say that he thought an island too small for his ambition and must needs conquer a continenti know not why it was but he went they had heavy weather in the passage and when they landed many of their soldiers were seasick stukely reasonably enough counselled that they should wait two or three days and recruit but don sebastian was so mad for the assault that he must needs have his veni vidi vici and so ended with a veni vidi perii for he abdallah and his son mohammed all perished in the first battle at alcasar and stukely surrounded and overpowered fought till he could fight no more and then died like a hero with all his wounds in front and may god have mercy on his soul  ah said amyas we heard of that battle off lima but nothing about poor stukely  that last was a popish prayer master frank said old mr cary  most worshipful sir you surely would not wish god not to have mercy on his soul  noeh of course not but thats all settled by now for he is dead poor fellow  certainly my dear sir and you cannot help being a little fond of him still  eh why i should be a brute if i were not he and i were schoolfellows though he was somewhat the younger and many a good thrashing have i given him and one cannot help having a tenderness for a man after that beside we used to hunt together in exmoor and have royal nights afterward into ilfracombe when we were a couple of mad young blades fond of him why i would have sooner given my forefinger than that he should have gone to the dogs thus  then my dear sir if you feel for him still in spite of all his faults how do you know that god may not feel for him still in spite of all his faults for my part quoth frank in his fanciful way without believing in that popish purgatory i cannot help holding with plato that such heroical souls who have wanted but little of true greatness are hereafter by some strait discipline brought to a better mind perhaps as many ancients have held with the indian gymnosophists by transmigration into the bodies of those animals whom they have resembled in their passions and indeed if sir thomas stukelys soul should now animate the body of a lion all i can say is that he would be a very valiant and royal lion and also doubtless become in due time heartily ashamed and penitent for having been nothing better than a lion  what now master frank i dont trouble my head with such mattersi say stukely was a right goodhearted fellow at bottom and if you plague my head with any of your dialectics and propositions and college quips and quiddities you shant have any more sack sir but here come the knaves and i hear the cook knock to dinner  after a madrigal or two and an italian song of master franks all which went sweetly enough the ladies rose and went whereon will cary drawing his chair close to franks put quietly into his hand a dirty letter  this was the letter left for me whispered he by a country fellow this morning look at it and tell me what i am to do  whereon frank opened and read       mister cary be you wary         by deer park end tonight      yf irish ffoxe com out of rocks         grip and hold hym tight  i would have showed it my father said will but  i verily believe it to be a blind see now this is the handwriting of a man who has been trying to write vilely and yet cannot look at that b and that g their formae formativae never were begotten in a hedgeschool and what is more this is no devon mans handiwork we say to and not by will eh in the west country  of course  and man instead of him  true o daniel but am i to do nothing therefore  on that matter i am no judge let us ask muchenduring ulysses here perhaps he has not sailed round the world without bringing home a device or two  whereon amyas was called to counsel as soon as mr cary could be stopped in a long crossexamination of him as to mr doughtys famous trial and execution  amyas pondered awhile thrusting his hands into his long curls and then  will my lad have you been watching at the deer park end of late  never  where then  at the townbeach  where else  at the townhead  where else  why the fellow is turned lawyer above freshwater  where is freshwater  why where the waterfall comes over the cliff halfamile from the town there is a path there up into the forest  i know ill watch there tonight do you keep all your old haunts safe of course and send a couple of stout knaves to the mill to watch the beach at the deer park end on the chance for your poet may be a true man after all but my hearts faith is that this comes just to draw you off from some old beat of yours upon a wildgoose chase if they shoot the miller by mistake i suppose it dont much matter  marry no       when a millers knockd on the head      the less of flour makes the more of bread  or again chimed in old mr cary as they say in the north       find a miller that will not steal      or a webster that is leal      or a priest that is not greedy      and lay them three a dead corpse by      and by the virtue of them three      the said dead corpse shall quickend be  but why are you so ready to watch freshwater tonight master amyas  because sir those who come if they come will never land at mouthmill if they are strangers they dare not and if they are baysmen they are too wise as long as the westerly swell sets in as for landing at the town that would be too great a risk but freshwater is as lonely as the bermudas and they can beach a boat up under the cliff at all tides and in all weathers except north and norwest i have done it many a time when i was a boy  and give us the fruit of your experience now in your old age eh well you have a gray head on green shoulders my lad and i verily believe you are right who will you take with you to watch  sir said frank i will go with my brother and that will be enough  enough he is big enough and you brave enough for ten but still the more the merrier  but the fewer the better fare if i might ask a first and last favor worshipful sir said frank very earnestly you would grant me two things that you would let none go to freshwater but me and my brother and that whatsoever we shall bring you back shall be kept as secret as the commonweal and your loyalty shall permit i trust that we are not so unknown to you or to others that you can doubt for a moment but that whatsoever we may do will satisfy at once your honor and our own  my dear young gentleman there is no need of so many courtiers words i am your fathers friend and yours and god forbid that a caryfor i guess your driftshould ever wish to make a head or a heart ache that is more than  those of whom it is written though thou bray a fool in a mortar yet will not his folly depart from him interposed frank in so sad a tone that no one at the table replied and few more words were exchanged till the two brothers were safe outside the house and then  amyas said frank that was a devon mans handiwork nevertheless it was eustaces handwriting  impossible  no lad i have been secretary to a prince and learnt to interpret cipher and to watch every penstroke and young as i am i think that i am not easily deceived would god i were come on lad and strike no man hastily lest thou cut off thine own flesh  so forth the two went along the park to the eastward and past the head of the little woodembosomed fishingtown a steep stair of houses clinging to the cliff far below them the bright slate roofs and white walls glittering in the moonlight and on some halfmile farther along the steep hillside fenced with oak wood down to the waters edge by a narrow forest path to a point where two glens meet and pour their streamlets over a cascade some hundred feet in height into the sea below by the side of this waterfall a narrow path climbs upward from the beach and here it was that the two brothers expected to meet the messenger  frank insisted on taking his station below amyas he said that he was certain that eustace himself would make his appearance and that he was more fit than amyas to bring him to reason by parley that if amyas would keep watch some twenty yards above the escape of the messenger would be impossible moreover he was the elder brother and the post of honor was his right so amyas obeyed him after making him promise that if more than one man came up the path he would let them pass him before he challenged so that both might bring them to bay at the same time  so amyas took his station under a high marl bank and bedded in luxuriant crownferns kept his eye steadily on frank who sat down on a little knoll of rock where is now a garden on the cliffedge which parts the path and the dark chasm down which the stream rushes to its final leap over the cliff  there amyas sat a full halfhour and glanced at whiles from frank to look upon the scene around outside the southwest wind blew fresh and strong and the moonlight danced upon a thousand crests of foam but within the black jagged point which sheltered the town the sea did but heave in long oily swells of rolling silver onward into the black shadow of the hills within which the town and pier lay invisible save where a twinkling light gave token of some lonely fishers wife watching the weary night through for the boat which would return with dawn here and there upon the sea a black speck marked a herringboat drifting with its line of nets and right off the mouth of the glen amyas saw with a beating heart a large twomasted vessel lyingtothat must be the portugal eagerly he looked up the glen and listened but he heard nothing but the sweeping of the wind across the downs five hundred feet above and the sough of the waterfall upon the rocks below he saw nothing but the vast black sheets of oakwood sloping up to the narrow blue sky above and the broad bright hunters moon and the woodcocks which chuckling to each other hawked to and fro like swallows between the treetops and the sky  at last he heard a rustle of the fallen leaves he shrank closer and closer into the darkness of the bank then swift light stepsnot down the path from above but upward from below his heart beat quick and loud and in another halfminute a man came in sight within three yards of franks hidingplace  frank sprang out instantly amyas saw his bright blade glance in the clear october moonlight  stand in the queens name  the man drew a pistol from under his cloak and fired full in his face had it happened in these days of detonators franks chance had been small but to get a ponderous wheellock under weigh was a longer business and before the fizzing of the flint had ceased frank had struck up the pistol with his rapier and it exploded harmlessly over his head the man instantly dashed the weapon in his face and closed  the blow luckily did not take effect on that delicate forehead but struck him on the shoulder nevertheless frank who with all his grace and agility was as fragile as a lily and a very bubble of the earth staggered and lost his guard and before he could recover himself amyas saw a dagger gleam and one two three blows fiercely repeated  mad with fury he was with them in an instant they were scuffling together so closely in the shade that he was afraid to use his sword point but with the hilt he dealt a single blow full on the ruffians cheek it was enough with a hideous shriek the fellow rolled over at his feet and amyas set his foot on him in act to run him through  stop stay almost screamed frank it is eustace our cousin eustace and he leant against a tree  amyas sprang towards him but frank waved him off  it is nothinga scratch he has papers i am sure of it take them and for gods sake let him go  villain give me your papers cried amyas setting his foot once more on the writhing eustace whose jaw was broken across  you struck me foully from behind moaned he his vanity and envy even then coming out in that faint and foolish attempt to prove amyas not so very much better a man  hound do you think that i dare not strike you in front give me your papers letters whatever popish devilry you carry or as i live i will cut off your head and take them myself even if it cost me the shame of stripping your corpse give them up traitor murderer give them i say and setting his foot on him afresh he raised his sword  eustace was usually no craven but he was cowed between agony and shame he had no heart to resist martyrdom which looked so splendid when consummated selon les regles on tower hill or tyburn before pitying or still better scoffing multitudes looked a confused dirty ugly business there in the dark forest and as he lay a stream of moonlight bathed his mighty cousins broad clear forehead and his long golden locks and his white terrible blade till he seemed to eustaces superstitious eye like one of those fair young st michaels trampling on the fiend which he had seen abroad in old german pictures he shuddered pulled a packet from his bosom and threw it from him murmuring i have not given it  swear to me that these are all the papers which you have in cipher or out of cipher swear on your soul or you die  eustace swore  tell me who are your accomplices  never said eustace cruel have you not degraded me enough already and the wretched young man burst into tears and hid his bleeding face in his hands  one hint of honor made amyas as gentle as a lamb he lifted eustace up and bade him run for his life  i am to owe my life then to you  not in the least only to your being a leigh go or it will be worse for you and eustace went while amyas catching up the precious packet hurried to frank he had fainted already and his brother had to carry him as far as the park before he could find any of the other watchers the blind as far as they were concerned was complete they had heard and seen nothing whosoever had brought the packet had landed they knew not where and so all returned to the court carrying frank who recovered gradually having rather bruises than wounds for his foe had struck wildly and with a trembling hand  halfanhour after amyas mr cary and his son will were in deep consultation over the following epistle the only paper in the packet which was not in cipher   dear brother n s in chto et ecclesia  this is to inform you and the friends of the cause that s josephus has landed in smerwick with eight hundred valiant crusaders burning with holy zeal to imitate last years martyrs of carrigfolium and to expiate their offences which i fear may have been many by the propagation of our most holy faith i have purified the fort which they are strenuously rebuilding with prayer and holy water from the stain of heretical footsteps and consecrated it afresh to the service of heaven as the firstfruits of the isle of saints and having displayed the consecrated banner to the adoration of the faithful have returned to earl desmond that i may establish his faith weak as yet by reason of the allurements of this world though since by the valor of his brother james he that hindered was taken out of the way i mean davils the heretic sacrifice wellpleasing in the eyes of heaven the young man has lent a more obedient ear to my counsels if you can do anything do it quickly for a great door and effectual is opened and there are many adversaries but be swift for so do the poor lambs of the church tremble at the fury of the heretics that a hundred will flee before one englishman and indeed were it not for that divine charity toward the church which covers the multitude of sins with which they are resplendent neither they nor their country would be by the carnal judgment counted worthy of so great labor in their behalf for they themselves are given much to lying theft and drunkenness vain babbling and profane dancing and singing and are still as s gildas reports of them more careful to shroud their villainous faces in bushy hair than decently to cover their bodies while their land by reason of the tyranny of their chieftains and the continual wars and plunderings among their tribes which leave them weak and divided an easy prey to the myrmidons of the excommunicate and usurping englishwoman lies utterly waste with fire and defaced with corpses of the starved and slain but what are these things while the holy virtue of catholic obedience still flourishes in their hearts the church cares not for the conservation of body and goods but of immortal souls  if any devout lady shall so will you may obtain from her liberality a shirt for this worthless tabernacle and also a pair of hose for i am unsavory to myself and to others and of such luxuries none here has superfluity for all live in holy poverty except the fleas who have that consolation in this world for which this unhappy nation and those who labor among them must wait till the world to come  your loving brother  n s        see note at end of chapter  sir richard must know of this before daybreak cried old cary eight hundred men landed we must call out the posse comitatus and sail with them bodily i will go myself old as i am spaniards in ireland not a dog of them must go home again  not a dog of them answered will but where is mr winter and his squadron  safe in milford haven a messenger must be sent to him too  ill go said amyas but mr cary is right sir richard must know all first  and we must have those jesuits  what mr evans and mr morgans god help usthey are at my uncles consider the honor of our family  judge for yourself my dear boy said old mr cary gently would it not be rank treason to let these foxes escape while we have this damning proof against them  i will go myself then  why not you may keep all straight and will shall go with you call a groom will and get your horse saddled and my yorkshire gray he will make better play with this big fellow on his back than the little pony astride of which mr leigh came walking in as i hear this morning as for frank the ladies will see to him well enough and glad enough too to have so fine a bird in their cage for a week or two  and my mother  well send to her tomorrow by daybreak come a stirrup cup to start with hot and hot now boots cloaks swords a deep pull and a warm one and away  and the jolly old man bustled them out of the house and into their saddles under the broad bright winters moon  you must make your pace lads or the moon will be down before you are over the moors and so away they went  neither of them spoke for many a mile amyas because his mind was fixed firmly on the one object of saving the honor of his house and will because he was hesitating between ireland and the wars and rose salterne and lovemaking at last he spoke suddenly  ill go amyas  whither  to ireland with you old man i have dragged my anchor at last  what anchor my lad of parables  see here am i a tall and gallant ship  modest even if not true  inclination like an anchor holds me tight  to the mud  nay to a bed of rosesnot without their thorns  hillo i have seen oysters grow on fruittrees before now but never an anchor in a rosegarden  silence or my allegory will go to nogginstaves  against the rocks of my flinty discernment  poohwell up comes duty like a jolly breeze blowing dead from the northeast and as bitter and cross as a northeaster too and tugs me away toward ireland i hold on by the rosebedany ground in a stormtill every strand is parted and off i go westward ho to get my throat cut in a boghole with amyas leigh  earnest will  as i am a sinful man  well done young hawk of the white cliff  i had rather have called it gallantry bower still though said will punning on the double name of the noble precipice which forms the highest point of the deer park  well as long as you are on land you know it is gallantry bower still but we always call it white cliff when you see it from the seaboard as you and i shall do i hope tomorrow evening  what so soon  dare we lose a day  i suppose not heighho  and they rode on again in silence amyas in the meanwhile being not a little content in spite of his late selfrenunciation to find that one of his rivals at least was going to raise the siege of the rose garden for a few months and withdraw his forces to the coast of kerry  as they went over bursdon amyas pulled up suddenly  did you not hear a horses step on our left  on our leftcoming up from welsford moor impossible at this time of night it must have been a stag or a sownder of wild swine or may be only an old cow  it was the ring of iron friend let us stand and watch  bursdon and welsford were then as now a rolling range of dreary moors unbroken by tor or tree or anything save few and far between a worldold furzebank which marked the common rights of some distant cattle farm and crossed then not as now by a decent road but by a rough confused trackway the remnant of an old roman road from clovelly dikes to launceston to the left it trended down towards a lower range of moors which form the watershed of the heads of torridge and thither the two young men peered down over the expanse of bog and furze which glittered for miles beneath the moon one sheet of frosted silver in the heavy autumn dew  if any of eustaces party are trying to get home from freshwater they might save a couple of miles by coming across welsford instead of going by the main track as we have done so said amyas who though luckily for him no genius was cunning as a fox in all matters of tactic and practic and would have in these days proved his right to be considered an intellectual person by being a thorough man of business  if any of his party are mad theyll try it and be stogged till the day of judgment there are bogs in the bottom twenty feet deep plague on the fellow whoever he is he has dodged us look there  it was too true the unknown horseman had evidently dismounted below and led his horse up on the other side of a long furzedike till coming to the point where it turned away again from his intended course he appeared against the sky in the act of leading his nag over a gap  ride like the wind and both youths galloped across furze and heather at him but ere they were within a hundred yards of him he had leapt again on his horse and was away far ahead  there is the dor to us with a vengeance cried cary putting in the spurs  it is but a lad we shall never catch him  ill try though and do you lumber after as you can old heavysides and cary pushed forward  amyas lost sight of him for ten minutes and then came up with him dismounted and feeling disconsolately at his horses knees  look for my head it lies somewhere about among the furze there and oh i am as full of needles as ever was a pincushion  are his knees broken  i darent look no i believe not come along and make the best of a bad matter the fellow is a mile ahead and to the right too  he is going for moorwinstow then but where is my cousin  behind us i dare say we shall nab him at least  cary promise me that if we do you will keep out of sight and let me manage him  my boy i only want evan morgans and morgan evans he is but the cats paw and we are after the cats themselves  and so they went on another dreary six miles till the land trended downwards showing dark glens and masses of woodland far below  now then straight to chapel and stop the foxes earth or through the kings park to stow and get out sir richards hounds hue and cry and queens warrant in proper form  let us see sir richard first and whatsoever he decides about my uncle i will endure as a loyal subject must  so they rode through the kings park while sir richards colts came whinnying and staring round the intruders and down through a rich woodland lane five hundred feet into the valley till they could hear the brawling of the little troutstream and beyond the everlasting thunder of the ocean surf  down through warm woods all fragrant with dying autumn flowers leaving far above the keen atlantic breeze into one of those delicious western combes and so past the mill and the little knot of flowerclad cottages in the window of one of them a light was still burning the two young men knew well whose window that was and both hearts beat fast for rose salterne slept or rather seemed to wake in that chamber  folks are late in combe tonight said amyas as carelessly as he could  cary looked earnestly at the window and then sharply enough at amyas but amyas was busy settling his stirrup and cary rode on unconscious that every fibre in his companions huge frame was trembling like his own  muggy and close down here said amyas who in reality was quite faint with his own inward struggles  we shall be at stow gate in five minutes said cary looking back and down longingly as his horse climbed the opposite hill but a turn of the zigzag road hid the cottage and the next thought was how to effect an entrance into stow at three in the morning without being eaten by the bandogs who were already howling and growling at the sound of the horsehoofs  however they got safely in after much knocking and calling through the postern gate in the high west wall into a mansion the description whereof i must defer to the next chapter seeing that the moon has already sunk into the atlantic and there is darkness over land and sea  sir richard in his long gown was soon downstairs in the hall the letter read and the story told but ere it was half finished  anthony call up a groom and let him bring me a horse round gentlemen if you will excuse me five minutes i shall be at your service  you will not go alone richard asked lady grenville putting her beautiful face in its nightcoif out of an adjoining door  surely sweet chuck we three are enough to take two poor polecats of jesuits go in and help me to boot and gird  in half an hour they were down and up across the valley again under the few low ashes clipt flat by the seabreeze which stood round the lonely gate of chapel  mr cary there is a back path across the downs to marsland go and guard that cary rode off and sir richard as he knocked loudly at the gate  mr leigh you see that i have consulted your honor and that of your poor uncle by adventuring thus alone what will you have me do now which may not be unfit for me and you  oh sir said amyas with tears in his honest eyes you have shown yourself once more what you always have beenmy dear and beloved master on earth not second even to my admiral sir francis drake  or the queen i hope said grenville smiling but pocas palabras what will you do  my wretched cousin sir may not have returnedand if i might watch for him on the main roadunless you want me with you  richard grenville can walk alone lad but what will you do with your cousin  send him out of the country never to return or if he refuses run him through on the spot  go lad and as he spoke a sleepy voice asked inside the gate who was there  sir richard grenville open in the queens name  sir richard he is in bed and be hanged to you no honest folk come at this hour of night  amyas shouted sir richard amyas rode back  burst that gate for me while i hold your horse  amyas leaped down took up a rock from the roadside such as homers heroes used to send at each others heads and in an instant the door was flat on the ground and the servingman on his back inside while sir richard quietly entering over it like una into the hut told the fellow to get up and hold his horse for him which the clod who knew well enough that terrible voice did without further murmurs and then strode straight to the front door it was already opened the household had been up and about all along or the noise at the entry had aroused them  sir richard knocked however at the open door and to his astonishment his knock was answered by mr leigh himself fully dressed and candle in hand  sir richard grenville what sir is this neighborly not to say gentle to break into my house in the dead of night  i broke your outer door sir because i was refused entrance when i asked in the queens name i knocked at your inner one as i should have knocked at the poorest cottagers in the parish because i found it open you have two jesuits here sir and here is the queens warrant for apprehending them i have signed it with my own hand and moreover serve it now with my own hand in order to save you scandaland it may be worse i must have these men mr leigh  my dear sir richard  i must have them or i must search the house and you would not put either yourself or me to so shameful a necessity  my dear sir richard  must i then ask you to stand back from your own doorway my dear sir said grenville and then changing his voice to that fearful lions roar for which he was famous and which it seemed impossible that lips so delicate could utter he thundered knaves behind there back  this was spoken to halfadozen grooms and servingmen who well armed were clustered in the passage  what swords out you sons of cliff rabbits and in a moment sir richards long blade flashed out also and putting mr leigh gently aside as if he had been a child he walked up to the party who vanished right and left having expected a cur dog in the shape of a parish constable and come upon a lion instead they were stout fellows enough no doubt in a fair fight but they had no stomach to be hanged in a row at launceston castle after a preliminary running through the body by that redoubted admiral and most unpeaceful justice of the peace  and now my dear mr leigh said sir richard as blandly as ever where are my men the night is cold and you as well as i need to be in our beds  the men sir richardthe jesuitsthey are not here indeed  not here sir  on the word of a gentleman they left my house an hour ago believe me sir they did i will swear to you if you need  i believe mr leigh of chapels word without oaths whither are they gone  nay sirhow can i tell they arethey are as i may say fled sir escaped  with your connivance at least with your sons where are they gone  as i live i do not know  mr leighis this possible can you add untruth to that treason from the punishment of which i am trying to shield you  poor mr leigh burst into tears  oh my god my god is it come to this over and above having the fear and anxiety of keeping these black rascals in my house and having to stop their villainous mouths every minute for fear they should hang me and themselves i am to be called a traitor and a liar in my old age and that too by richard grenville would god i had never been born would god i had no soul to be saved and id just go and drown care in drink and let the queen and the pope fight it out their own way and the poor old man sank into a chair and covered his face with his hands and then leaped up again  bless my heart excuse me sir richardto sit down and leave you standing s life sir sorrow is making a hawbuck of me sit down my dear sir my worshipful sir or rather come with me into my room and hear a poor wretched mans story for i swear before god the men are fled and my poor boy eustace is not home either and the groom tells me that his devil of a cousin has broken his jaw for him and his mother is all but mad this hour past good lack good lack  he nearly murdered his angel of a cousin sir said sir richard severely  what sir they never told me  he had stabbed his cousin frank three times sir before amyas who is as noble a lad as walks gods earth struck him down and in defence of what forsooth did he play the ruffian and the swashbuckler but to bring home to your house this letter sir which you shall hear at your leisure the moment i have taken order about your priests and walking out of the house he went round and called to cary to come to him  the birds are flown will whispered he there is but one chance for us and that is marsland mouth if they are trying to take boat there you may be yet in time if they are gone inland we can do nothing till we raise the hue and cry tomorrow  and will galloped off over the downs toward marsland while sir richard ceremoniously walked in again and professed himself ready and happy to have the honor of an audience in mr leighs private chamber and as we know pretty well already what was to be discussed therein we had better go over to marsland mouth and if possible arrive there before will cary seeing that he arrived hot and swearing half an hour too late   notei have shrunk somewhat from giving these and other sketches true and accurate as i believe them to be of ireland during elizabeths reign when the tyranny and lawlessness of the feudal chiefs had reduced the island to such a state of weakness and barbarism that it was absolutely necessary for england either to crush the normanirish nobility and organize some sort of law and order or to leave ireland an easy prey to the spaniards or any other nation which should go to war with us the work was doneclumsily rather than cruelly but wrongs were inflicted and avenged by fresh wrongs and those by fresh again may the memory of them perish forever it has been reserved for this age and for the liberal policy of this age to see the last ebullitions of celtic excitability die out harmless and ashamed of itself and to find that the irishman when he is brought as a soldier under the regenerative influence of law discipline selfrespect and loyalty can prove himself a worthy rival of the more stern norsesaxon warrior god grant that the military brotherhood between irish and english which is the special glory of the present war may be the germ of a brotherhood industrial political and hereafter perhaps religious also and that not merely the corpses of heroes but the feuds and wrongs which have parted them for centuries may lie buried once and forever in the noble graves of alma and inkerman    chapter vi  the combes of the far west              far far from hence      the adriatic breaks in a warm bay      among the green illyrian hills and there      the sunshine in the happy glens is fair      and by the sea and in the brakes      the grass is cool the seaside air      buoyant and fresh the mountain flowers      more virginal and sweet than ours                                    matthew arnold  and even such are those delightful glens which cut the high tableland of the confines of devon and cornwall and opening each through its gorge of down and rock towards the boundless western ocean each is like the other and each is like no other english scenery each has its upright walls inland of rich oakwood nearer the sea of dark green furze then of smooth turf then of weird black cliffs which range out right and left far into the deep sea in castles spires and wings of jagged ironstone each has its narrow strip of fertile meadow its crystal trout stream winding across and across from one hillfoot to the other its gray stone mill with the water sparkling and humming round the dripping wheel its dark rock pools above the tide mark where the salmontrout gather in from their atlantic wanderings after each autumn flood its ridge of blown sand bright with golden trefoil and crimson ladys finger its gray bank of polished pebbles down which the stream rattles toward the sea below each has its black field of jagged sharkstooth rock which paves the cove from side to side streaked with here and there a pink line of shell sand and laced with white foam from the eternal surge stretching in parallel lines out to the westward in strata set upright on edge or tilted towards each other at strange angles by primeval earthquakessuch is the mouthas those coves are called and such the jaw of teeth which they display one rasp of which would grind abroad the timbers of the stoutest ship to landward all richness softness and peace to seaward a waste and howling wilderness of rock and roller barren to the fisherman and hopeless to the shipwrecked mariner  in only one of these mouths is a landing for boats made possible by a long seawall of rock which protects it from the rollers of the atlantic and that mouth is marsland the abode of the white witch lucy passmore whither as sir richard grenville rightly judged the jesuits were gone but before the jesuits came two other persons were standing on that lonely beach under the bright october moon namely rose salterne and the white witch herself for rose fevered with curiosity and superstition and allured by the very wildness and possible danger of the spell had kept her appointment and a few minutes before midnight stood on the gray shingle beach with her counsellor  you be safe enough here tonight miss my old man is snoring sound abed and theres no other soul ever sets foot here o nights except it be the mermaids now and then goodness father wheres our boat it ought to be up here on the pebbles  rose pointed to a strip of sand some forty yards nearer the sea where the boat lay  oh the lazy old villain hes been round the rocks after pollock this evening and never taken the trouble to hale the boat up ill trounce him for it when i get home i only hope hes made her fast where she is thats all hes more plague to me than ever my money will be o deary me  and the goodwife bustled down toward the boat with rose behind her  iss tis fast sure enough and the oars aboard too well i never oh the lazy thief to leave they here to be stole ill just sit in the boat dear and watch mun while you go down to the say for you must be all alone to yourself you know or youll see nothing theres the lookingglass now go and dip your head three times and mind you dont look to land or sea before youve said the words and looked upon the glass now be quick its just upon midnight  and she coiled herself up in the boat while rose went faltering down the strip of sand some twenty yards farther and there slipping off her clothes stood shivering and trembling for a moment before she entered the sea  she was between two walls of rock that on her left hand some twenty feet high hid her in deepest shade that on her right though much lower took the whole blaze of the midnight moon great festoons of live and purple seaweed hung from it shading dark cracks and crevices fit haunts for all the goblins of the sea on her left hand the peaks of the rock frowned down ghastly black on her right hand far aloft the downs slept bright and cold  the breeze had died away not even a roller broke the perfect stillness of the cove the gulls were all asleep upon the ledges over all was a true autumn silence a silence which may be heard she stood awed and listened in hope of a sound which might tell her that any living thing beside herself existed  there was a faint bleat as of a newborn lamb high above her head she started and looked up then a wail from the cliffs as of a child in pain answered by another from the opposite rocks they were but the passing snipe and the otter calling to her brood but to her they were mysterious supernatural goblins come to answer to her call nevertheless they only quickened her expectation and the witch had told her not to fear them if she performed the rite duly nothing would harm her but she could hear the beating of her own heart as she stepped mirror in hand into the cold water waded hastily as far as she dare and then stopped aghast  a ring of flame was round her waist every limb was bathed in lambent light all the multitudinous life of the autumn sea stirred by her approach had flashed suddenly into glory   and around her the lamps of the sea nymphs myriad fiery globes swam heaving and panting and rainbows crimson and azure and emerald were broken in starshowers lighting far through the winedark depths of the crystal the gardens of nereus coral and seafan and tangle the blooms and the palms of the ocean   she could see every shell which crawled on the white sand at her feet every rockfish which played in and out of the crannies and stared at her with its broad bright eyes while the great palmate oarweeds which waved along the chasm halfseen in the glimmering water seemed to beckon her down with long brown hands to a grave amid their chilly bowers she turned to flee but she had gone too far now to retreat hastily dipping her head three times she hurried out to the seamarge and looking through her dripping locks at the magic mirror pronounced the incantation       a maiden pure here i stand      neither on sea nor yet on land      angels watch me on either hand      if you be landsman come down the strand      if you be sailor come up the sand      if you be angel come from the sky      look in my glass and pass me by      look in my glass and go from the shore      leave me but love me for evermore  the incantation was hardly finished her eyes were straining into the mirror where as may be supposed nothing appeared but the sparkle of the drops from her own tresses when she heard rattling down the pebbles the hasty feet of men and horses  she darted into a cavern of the high rock and hastily dressed herself the steps held on right to the boat peeping out halfdead with terror she saw there four men two of whom had just leaped from their horses and turning them adrift began to help the other two in running the boat down  whereon out of the stern sheets arose like an angry ghost the portly figure of lucy passmore and shrieked in shrillest treble  eh ye villains ye roogs what do ye want staling poor folks boats by night like this  the whole party recoiled in terror and one turned to run up the beach shouting at the top of his voice tis a marmaidena marmaiden asleep in willy passmores boat  i wish it were any sich good luck she could hear will say tis my wife oh dear and he cowered down expecting the hearty cuff which he received duly as the white witch leaping out of the boat dared any man to touch it and thundered to her husband to go home to bed  the wily dame as rose well guessed was keeping up this delay chiefly to gain time for her pupil but she had also more solid reasons for making the fight as hard as possible for she as well as rose had already discerned in the ungainly figure of one of the party the same suspicious welsh gentleman on whose calling she had divined long ago and she was so loyal a subject as to hold in extreme horror her husbands meddling with such popish skulkers as she called the whole party roundly to their faceunless on consideration of a very handsome sum of money in vain parsons thundered campian entreated mr leighs groom swore and her husband danced round in an agony of mingled fear and covetousness  no she cried as i am an honest woman and loyal this is why you left the boat down to the shoore you old traitor you is it to help off sich noxious trade as this out of the hands of her majestys quorum and rotulorum eh stand back cowards will you strike a woman  this last speech as usual was merely indicative of her intention to strike the men for getting out one of the oars she swung it round and round fiercely and at last caught father parsons such a crack across the shins that he retreated with a howl  lucy lucy shrieked her husband in shrillest devon falsetto be you mazed be you mazed lass they promised me two gold nobles before id lend them the boot  tu shrieked the matron with a tone of ineffable scorn and do yu call yourself a man  tu nobles tu nobles shrieked he again hopping about at oars length  tu and would you sell your soul under ten  oh if that is it cried poor campian give her ten give her ten brother parsmorgans i mean and take care of your shins offa cerbero you knowoh virago furens quid faemina possit certainly she is some lamia some gorgon some  take that for your lamys and gorgons to an honest woman and in a moment poor campians thin legs were cut from under him while the virago mounting on his trunk astride like that more famous one on hudibras cried ten nobles or ill kep ye here till morning and the ten nobles were paid into her hand  and now the boat its dragon guardian being pacified was run down to the sea and close past the nook where poor little rose was squeezing herself into the farthest and darkest corner among wet seaweed and rough barnacles holding her breath as they approached  they passed her and the boats keel was already in the water lucy had followed them close for reasons of her own and perceiving close to the waters edge a dark cavern cunningly surmised that it contained rose and planted her ample person right across its mouth while she grumbled at her husband the strangers and above all at mr leighs groom to whom she prophesied pretty plainly launceston gaol and the gallows while the wretched servingman who would as soon have dared to leap off welcombe cliff as to return railing for railing to the white witch in vain entreated her mercy and tried by all possible dodging to keep one of the party between himself and her lest her redoubted eye should overlook him once more to his ruin  but the nights adventures were not ended yet for just as the boat was launched a faint halloo was heard upon the beach and a minute after a horseman plunged down the pebbles and along the sand and pulling his horse up on its haunches close to the terrified group dropped rather than leaped from the saddle  the servingman though he dared not tackle a witch knew well enough how to deal with a swordsman and drawing sprang upon the newcomer and then recoiled  god forgive me its mr eustace oh dear sir i took you for one of sir richards men oh sir youre hurt  a scratch a scratch almost moaned eustace help me into the boat jack gentlemen i must with you  not with us surely my dear son vagabonds upon the face of the earth said kindhearted campian  with you forever all is over here whither god and the cause leadand he staggered toward the boat  as he passed rose she saw his ghastly bleeding face half bound up with a handkerchief which could not conceal the convulsions of rage shame and despair which twisted it from all its usual beauty his eyes glared wildly roundand once right into the cavern they met hers so full and keen and dreadful that forgetting she was utterly invisible the terrified girl was on the point of shrieking aloud  he has overlooked me said she shuddering to herself as she recollected his threat of yesterday  who has wounded you asked campian  my cousinamyasand taken the letter  the devil take him then cried parsons stamping up and down upon the sand in fury  ay curse himyou may i dare not he saved mesent me hereand with a groan he made an effort to enter the boat  oh my dear young gentleman cried lucy passmore her womans heart bursting out at the sight of pain you must not goo forth with a grane wound like to that do ye let me just bind mun updo ye now and she advanced  eustace thrust her back  no better bear it i deserve itdevils i deserve it on board or we shall all be lostwilliam cary is close behind me  and at that news the boat was thrust into the sea faster than ever it went before and only in time for it was but just round the rocks and out of sight when the rattle of carys horsehoofs was heard above  that rascal of mr leighs will catch it now the popish villain said lucy passmore aloud you lie still there dear life and settle your sperrits youm so safe as ever was rabbit to burrow ill see what happens if i die for it and so saying she squeezed herself up through a cleft to a higher ledge from whence she could see what passed in the valley  there mun is in the meadow trying to catch the horses there comes mr cary goodness father how a ridth hes over wall already ron jack ron then all get to the river no a waint goodness father theres mr cary cotched mun as down as down  is

popish praste that cant marry if he would poor wratch  he is none and i have cause enough to know it and for want of a better confidant rose poured into the willing ears of her companion the whole story of yesterdays meeting  hes a pretty wooer said lucy at last contemptuously be a brave maid then be a brave maid and never terrify yourself with his unlucky face its because there was none here worthy of ye that ye seed none in glass maybe hes to be a foreigner from over seas and thats why his sperit was so long a coming a duke or a prince to the least ill warrant hell be that carries off the rose of bideford  but in spite of all the good dames flattery rose could not wipe that fierce face away from her eyeballs she reached home safely and crept to bed undiscovered and when the next morning as was to be expected found her laid up with something very like a fever from excitement terror and cold the phantom grew stronger and stronger before her and it required all her womans tact and selfrestraint to avoid betraying by her exclamations what had happened on that fantastic night after a fortnights weakness however she recovered and went back to bideford but ere she arrived there amyas was far across the seas on his way to milford haven as shall be told in the ensuing chapters    chapter vii  the true and tragical history of mr john oxenham of plymouth       the fair breeze blew the white foam flew        the furrow followd free      we were the first that ever burst        into that silent sea                            the ancient mariner  it was too late and too dark last night to see the old house at stow we will look round us then this bright october day while sir richard and amyas about eleven oclock in the forenoon are pacing up and down the terraced garden to the south amyas has slept till luncheon i e till an hour ago but sir richard in spite of the bustle of last night was up and in the valley by six oclock recreating the valiant souls of himself and two terrier dogs by the chase of sundry badgers  old stow house stands or rather stood some four miles beyond the cornish border on the northern slope of the largest and loveliest of those combes of which i spoke in the last chapter eighty years after sir richards time there arose there a huge palladian pile bedizened with every monstrosity of bad taste which was built so the story runs by charles the second for sir richards greatgrandson the heir of that famous sir bevil who defeated the parliamentary troops at stratton and died soon after fighting valiantly at lansdowne over bath but like most other things which owed their existence to the stuarts it rose only to fall again an old man who had seen as a boy the foundation of the new house laid lived to see it pulled down again and the very bricks and timber sold upon the spot and since then the stables have become a farmhouse the tenniscourt a sheepcote the great quadrangle a rickyard and civilization spreading wave on wave so fast elsewhere has surged back from that lonely corner of the landlet us hope only for a while  but i am not writing of that great new stow house of the past glories whereof quaint pictures still hang in the neighboring houses nor of that famed sir bevil most beautiful and gallant of his generation on whom with his grandfather sir richard old prince has his pompous epigram       where next shall famous grenvils ashes stand      thy grandsire fills the sea and thou the land  i have to deal with a simpler age and a sterner generation and with the old house which had stood there in part at least from gray and mythic ages when the first sir richard son of hamon dentatus lord of carboyle the grandson of duke robert son of rou settled at bideford after slaying the prince of southgalis and the lord of glamorgan and gave to the cistercian monks of neath all his conquests in south wales it was a huge rambling building half castle half dwellinghouse such as may be seen still almost an unique specimen in compton castle near torquay the dwellingplace of humphrey gilbert walter raleighs halfbrother and richard grenvilles bosom friend of whom more hereafter on three sides to the north west and south the lofty walls of the old ballium still stood with their machicolated turrets loopholes and dark downward crannies for dropping stones and fire on the besiegers the relics of a more unsettled age but the southern court of the ballium had become a flowergarden with quaint terraces statues knots of flowers clipped yews and hollies and all the pedantries of the topiarian art and toward the east where the vista of the valley opened the old walls were gone and the frowning norman keep ruined in the wars of the roses had been replaced by the rich and stately architecture of the tudors altogether the house like the time was in a transitionary state and represented faithfully enough the passage of the old middle age into the new life which had just burst into blossom throughout europe never let us pray to see its autumn or its winter  from the house on three sides the hill sloped steeply down and the garden where sir richard and amyas were walking gave a truly english prospect at one turn they could catch over the western walls a glimpse of the blue ocean flecked with passing sails and at the next spread far below them range on range of fertile park stately avenue yellow autumn woodland and purple heather moors lapping over and over each other up the valley to the old british earthwork which stood black and furzegrown on its conical peak and standing out against the sky on the highest bank of hill which closed the valley to the east the lofty tower of kilkhampton church rich with the monuments and offerings of five centuries of grenvilles a yellow eastern haze hung soft over park and wood and moor the red cattle lowed to each other as they stood brushing away the flies in the rivulet far below the colts in the horsepark close on their right whinnied as they played together and their sires from the queens park on the opposite hill answered them in fuller though fainter voices a rutting stag made the still woodland rattle with his hoarse thunder and a rival far up the valley gave back a trumpet note of defiance and was himself defied from heathery brows which quivered far away above half seen through the veil of eastern mist and close at home upon the terrace before the house amid romping spaniels and goldenhaired children sat lady grenville herself the beautiful st leger of annery the central jewel of all that glorious place and looked down at her noble children and then up at her more noble husband and round at that broad paradise of the west till life seemed too full of happiness and heaven of light  and all the while up and down paced amyas and sir richard talking long earnestly and slow for they both knew that the turning point of the boys life was come  yes said sir richard after amyas in his blunt simple way had told him the whole story about rose salterne and his brotheryes sweet lad thou hast chosen the better part thou and thy brother also and it shall not be taken from you only be strong lad and trust in god that he will make a man of you  i do trust said amyas  thank god said sir richard that you have yourself taken from my heart that which was my great anxiety for you from the day that your good father who sleeps in peace committed you to my hands for all best things amyas become when misused the very worst and the love of woman because it is able to lift mans soul to the heavens is also able to drag him down to hell but you have learnt better amyas and know with our old german forefathers that as tacitus saith sera juvenum venus ideoque inexhausta pubertas and not only that amyas but trust me that silly fashion of the french and italians to be hanging ever at some womans apron string so that no boy shall count himself a man unless he can vagghezziare le donne whether maids or wives alas matters little that fashion i say is little less hurtful to the soul than open sin for by it are bred vanity and expense envy and heartburning yea hatred and murder often and even if that be escaped yet the rich treasure of a manly worship which should be kept for one alone is squandered and parted upon many and the bride at last comes in for nothing but the very last leavings and caput mortuum of her bridegrooms heart and becomes a mere ornament for his table and a means whereby he may obtain a progeny may god who has saved me from that death in life save you also and as he spoke he looked down toward his wife upon the terrace below and she as if guessing instinctively that he was talking of her looked up with so sweet a smile that sir richards stern face melted into a very glory of spiritual sunshine  amyas looked at them both and sighed and then turning the conversation suddenly  and i may go to ireland tomorrow  you shall sail in the mary for milford haven with these letters to winter if the wind serves you may bid the master drop down the river tonight and be off for we must lose no time  winter said amyas he is no friend of mine since he left drake and us so cowardly at the straits of magellan  duty must not wait for private quarrels even though they be just ones lad but he will not be your general when you come to the marshal or the lord deputy give either of them this letter and they will set you workand hard work too i warrant  i want nothing better  right lad the best reward for having wrought well already is to have more to do and he that has been faithful over a few things must find his account in being made ruler over many things that is the true and heroical rest which only is worthy of gentlemen and sons of god as for those who either in this world or the world to come look for idleness and hope that god shall feed them with pleasant things as it were with a spoon amyas i count them cowards and base even though they call themselves saints and elect  i wish you could persuade my poor cousin of that  he has yet to learn what losing his life to save it means amyas bad men have taught him and i fear these anabaptists and puritans at home teach little else that it is the one great business of every one to save his own soul after he dies every one for himself and that that and not divine selfsacrifice is the one thing needful and the better part which mary chose  i think men are inclined enough already to be selfish without being taught that  right lad for me if i could hang up such a teacher on high as an enemy of mankind and a corrupter of youth i would do it gladly is there not cowardice and selfseeking enough about the hearts of us fallen sons of adam that these false prophets with their baits of heaven and their terrors of hell must exalt our dirtiest vices into heavenly virtues and the means of bliss farewell to chivalry and to desperate valor farewell to patriotism and loyalty farewell to england and to the manhood of england if once it shall become the fashion of our preachers to bid every man as the jesuits do take care first of what they call the safety of his soul every man will be afraid to die at his post because he will be afraid that he is not fit to die amyas do thou do thy duty like a man to thy country thy queen and thy god and count thy life a worthless thing as did the holy men of old do thy work lad and leave thy soul to the care of him who is just and merciful in this that he rewards every man according to his work is there respect of persons with god now come in and take the letters and to horse and if i hear of thee dead there at smerwick fort with all thy wounds in front i shall weep for thy mother lad but i shall have never a sigh for thee  if any one shall be startled at hearing a fine gentleman and a warrior like sir richard quote scripture and think scripture also they must be referred to the writings of the time which they may read not without profit to themselves if they discover therefrom how it was possible then for men of the world to be thoroughly ingrained with the gospel and yet to be free from any taint of superstitious fear or false devoutness the religion of those days was such as no soldier need have been ashamed of confessing at least sir richard died as he lived without a shudder and without a whine and these were his last words fifteen years after that as he lay shot through and through a captive among popish spaniards priests crucifixes confession extreme unction and all other means and appliances for delivering men out of the hands of a god of love  here die i richard grenville with a joyful and quiet mind for that i have ended my life as a true soldier ought fighting for his country queen religion and honor my soul willingly departing from this body leaving behind the lasting fame of having behaved as every valiant soldier is in his duty bound to do  those were the last words of richard grenville the pulpits of those days had taught them to him  but to return that days events were not over yet for when they went down into the house the first person whom they met was the old steward in search of his master  there is a manner of roog sir richard a masterless man at the door a very forward fellow and must needs speak with you  a masterless man he had better not to speak to me unless he is in love with gaol and gallows  well your worship said the steward i expect that is what he does want for he swears he will not leave the gate till he has seen you  seen me halidame he shall see me here and at launceston too if he likes bring him in  fegs sir richard we are half afeard with your good leave  hillo tony cried amyas who was ever afeard yet with sir richards good leave  what has the fellow a tail or horns  massy no but i be afeard of treason for your honor for the fellow is pinked all over in heathen patterns and as brown as a filbert and a tall roog a very strong roog sir and a foreigner too and a mighty staff with him i expect him to be a manner of jesuit or wild irish sir and indeed the grooms have no stomach to handle him nor the dogs neither or he had been under the pump before now for they that saw him coming up the hill swear that he had fire coming out of his mouth  fire out of his mouth said sir richard the men are drunk  pinked all over he must be a sailor said amyas let me out and see the fellow and if he needs putting forth  why i dare say he is not so big but what he will go into thy pocket so go lad while i finish my writing  amyas went out and at the back door leaning on his staff stood a tall rawboned ragged man pinked all over as the steward had said  hillo lad quoth amyas before we come to talk thou wilt please to lay down that plymouth cloak of thine and he pointed to the cudgel which among westcountry mariners usually bore that name  ill warrant said the old steward that where he found his cloak he found purse not far off  but not hose or doublet so the magical virtue of his staff has not helped him much but put down thy staff man and speak like a christian if thou be one  i am a christian though i look like a heathen and no rogue though a masterless man alas but i want nothing deserving nothing and only ask to speak with sir richard before i go on my way  there was something stately and yet humble about the mans tone and manner which attracted amyas and he asked more gently where he was going and whence he came  from padstow port sir to clovelly town to see my old mother if indeed she be yet alive which god knoweth  clovally man why didnt thee say thee was clovally man asked all the grooms at once to whom a westcountryman was of course a brother the old steward asked  whats thy mothers name then  susan yeo  what that lived under the archway asked a groom  lived said the man  iss sure her died three days since so we heard poor soul  the man stood quite silent and unmoved for a minute or two and then said quietly to himself in spanish that which is is best  you speak spanish asked amyas more and more interested  i had need to do so young sir i have been five years in the spanish main and only set foot on shore two days ago and if you will let me have speech of sir richard i will tell him that at which both the ears of him that heareth it shall tingle and if not i can but go on to mr cary of clovelly if he be yet alive and there disburden my soul but i would sooner have spoken with one that is a mariner like to myself  and you shall said amyas steward we will have this man in for all his rags he is a man of wit and he led him in  i only hope he bent one of those popish murderers said the old steward keeping at a safe distance from him as they entered the hall  popish old master theres little fear of my being that look here and drawing back his rags he showed a ghastly scar which encircled his wrist and wound round and up his forearm  i got that on the rack said he quietly in the inquisition at lima  o father father why didnt you tell us that you were a poor christian asked the penitent steward  because i have had naught but my deserts and but a taste of them either as the lord knoweth who delivered me and i wasnt going to make myself a beggar and a show on their account  by heaven you are a brave fellow said amyas come along straight to sir richards room  so in they went where sir richard sat in his library among books despatches statepapers and warrants for though he was not yet as in after times after the fashion of those days admiral general member of parliament privy councillor justice of the peace and so forth all at once yet there were few great men with whom he did not correspond or great matters with which he was not cognizant  hillo amyas have you bound the wild man already and brought him in to swear allegiance  but before amyas could answer the man looked earnestly on himamyas said he is that your name sir  amyas leigh is my name at your service good fellow  of burrough by bideford  why then what do you know of me  oh sir sir young brains and happy ones have short memories but old and sad brains too long ones often do you mind one that was with mr oxenham sir a swearing reprobate he was god forgive him and hath forgiven him too for his dear sons sakeone sir that gave you a horn a toy with a chart on it  soul alive cried amyas catching him by the hand and are you he the horn why i have it still and will keep it to my dying day too but where is mr oxenham  yes my good fellow where is mr oxenham asked sir richard rising you are somewhat overhasty in welcoming your old acquaintance amyas before we have heard from him whether he can give honest account of himself and of his captain for there is more than one way by which sailors may come home without their captains as poor mr barker of bristol found to his cost god grant that there may have been no such traitorous dealing here  sir richard grenville if i had been a guilty man to my noble captain as i have to god i had not come here this day to you from whom villainy has never found favor nor ever will for i know your conditions well sir and trust in the lord that if you will be pleased to hear me you shall know mine  thou art a wellspoken knave we shall see  my dear sir said amyas in a whisper i will warrant this man guiltless  i verily believe him to be but this is too serious a matter to be left on guess if he will be sworn  whereon the man humbly enough said that if it would please sir richard he would rather not be sworn  but it does not please me rascal did i not warn thee amyas  sir said the man proudly god forbid that my word should not be as good as my oath but it is against my conscience to be sworn  what have we here some fantastical anabaptist who is wiser than his teachers  my conscience sir  the devil take it and thee i never heard a man yet begin to prate of his conscience but i knew that he was about to do something more than ordinarily cruel or false  sir said the man coolly enough do you sit here to judge me according to law and yet contrary to the law swear profane oaths for which a fine is provided  amyas expected an explosion but sir richard pulled a shilling out and put it on the table theremy fine is paid sirrah to the poor of kilkhampton but hearken thou all the same if thou wilt not speak an oath thou shalt speak on compulsion for to launceston gaol thou goest there to answer for mr oxenhams death on suspicion whereof and of mutiny causing it i will attach thee and every soul of his crew that comes home we have lost too many gallant captains of late by treachery of their crews and he that will not clear himself on oath must be held for guilty and selfcondemned  my good fellow said amyas who could not give up his belief in the mans honesty why for such fantastical scruples peril not only your life but your honor and mr oxenhams also for if you be examined by question you may be forced by torment to say that which is not true  little fear of that young sir answered he with a grim smile i have had too much of the rack already and the strappado too to care much what man can do unto me i would heartily that i thought it lawful to be sworn but not so thinking i can but submit to the cruelty of man though i did expect more merciful things as a most miserable and wrecked mariner at the hands of one who hath himself seen gods ways in the sea and his wonders in the great deep sir richard grenville if you will hear my story may god avenge on my head all my sins from my youth up until now and cut me off from the blood of christ and if it were possible from the number of his elect if i tell you one whit more or less than truth and if not i commend myself into the hands of god  sir richard smiled well thou art a brave ass and valiant though an ass manifest dost thou not see fellow how thou hast sworn a tentimes bigger oath than ever i should have asked of thee but this is the way with your anabaptists who by their very hatred of forms and ceremonies show of how much account they think them and then bind themselves out of their own fantastical selfwill with far heavier burdens than ever the lawful authorities have laid on them for the sake of the commonweal but what do they care for the commonweal as long as they can save as they fancy each man his own dirty soul for himself however thou art sworn now with a vengeance go on with thy tale and first who art thou and whence  well sir said the man quite unmoved by this last explosion my name is salvation yeo born in clovelly street in the year 1526 where my father exercised the mystery of a barber surgeon and a preacher of the people since called anabaptists for which i return humble thanks to god  sir richardfie thou naughty knave return thanks that thy father was an ass  yeonay but because he was a barber surgeon for i myself learnt a touch of that trade and thereby saved my life as i will tell presently and i do think that a good mariner ought to have all knowledge of carnal and worldly cunning even to tailoring and shoemaking that he may be able to turn his hand to whatsoever may hap  sir richardwell spoken fellow but let us have thy text without thy comments forwards  yeowell sir i was bred to the sea from my youth and was with captain hawkins in his three voyages which he made to guinea for negro slaves and thence to the west indies  sir richardthen thrice thou wentest to a bad end though captain hawkins be my good friend and the last time to a bad end thou camest  yeono denying that last your worship but as for the former i doubtabout the unlawfulness i mean being the negroes are of the children of ham who are cursed and reprobate as scripture declares and their blackness testifies being satans own livery among whom therefore there can be none of the elect wherefore the elect are not required to treat them as brethren  sir richardwhat a plague of a pragmatical sealawyer have we here and i doubt not thou hypocrite that though thou wilt call the negroes black skin satans livery when it serves thy turn to steal them thou wilt find out sables to be heavens livery every sunday and up with a godly howl unless a parson shall preach in a black gown geneva fashion out upon thee go on with thy tale lest thou finish thy sermon at launceston after all  yeothe lords people were always a reviled people and a persecuted people but i will go forward sir for heaven forbid but that i should declare what god has done for me for till lately from my youth up i was given over to all wretchlessness and unclean living and was by nature a child of the devil and to every good work reprobate even as others  sir richardhark to his even as others thou newwhelped pharisee canst not confess thine own villainies without making out others as bad as thyself and so thyself no worse than others i only hope that thou hast shown none of thy devils doings to mr oxenham  yeoon the word of a christian man sir as i said before i kept true faith with him and would have been a better friend to him sir what is more than ever he was to himself  sir richardalas that might easily be  yeoi think sir and will make good against any man that mr oxenham was a noble and valiant gentleman true of his word stout of his sword skilful by sea and land and worthy to have been lord high admiral of england saving your worships presence but that through two great sins wrath and avarice he was cast away miserably or ever his soul was brought to the knowledge of the truth ah sir he was a captain worth sailing under  and yeo heaved a deep sigh  sir richardsteady steady good fellow if thou wouldst quit preaching thou art no fool after all but tell us the story without more bushbeating  so at last yeo settled himself to his tale  well sirs i went as mr leigh knows to nombre de dios with mr drake and mr oxenham in 1572 where what we saw and did your worship i suppose knows as well as i and there was as youve heard maybe a covenant between mr oxenham and mr drake to sail the south seas together which they made your worship in my hearing under the tree over panama for when mr drake came down from the tree after seeing the sea afar off mr oxenham and i went up and saw it too and when we came down drake says john i have made a vow to god that i will sail that water if i live and god gives me grace which he had done sir upon his bended knees like a godly man as he always was and would i had taken after him and mr o says i am with you drake to live or die and i think i know some one there already so we shall not be quite among strangers and laughed withal well sirs that voyage as you know never came off because captain drake was fighting in ireland so mr oxenham who must be up and doing sailed for himself and i who loved him god knows like a brother saving the difference in our ranks helped him to get the crew together and went as his gunner that was in 1575 as you know he had a 140ton ship sir and seventy men out of plymouth and fowey and dartmouth and many of them old hands of drakes beside a dozen or so from bideford that i picked up when i saw young master here  thank god that you did not pick me up too  amen amen said yeo clasping his hands on his breast those seventy men sirseventy gallant men sir with every one of them an immortal soul within himwhere are they now gone like the spray and he swept his hands abroad with a wild and solemn gesture and their blood is upon my head  both sir richard and amyas began to suspect that the mans brain was not altogether sound  god forbid my man said the knight kindly  thirteen men i persuaded to join in bideford town beside william penberthy of marazion my good comrade and what if it be said to me at the day of judgment salvation yeo where are those fourteen whom thou didst tempt to their deaths by covetousness and lust of gold not that i was alone in my sin if the truth must be told for all the way out mr oxenham was making loud speech after his pleasant way that he would make all their fortunes and take them to such a paradise that they should have no lust to come home again and igod knows whyfor every one boast of his would make two even to lying and empty fables and anything to keep up the mens hearts for i had really persuaded myself that we should all find treasures beyond solomon his temple and mr oxenham would surely show us how to conquer some golden city or discover some island all made of precious stones and one day as the captain and i were talking after our fashion i said and you shall be our king captain to which he if i be i shall not be long without a queen and that no indian one either and after that he often jested about the spanish ladies saying that none could show us the way to their hearts better than he which speeches i took no count of then sirs but after i minded them whether i would or not well sirs we came to the shore of new spain near to the old placethats nombre de dios and there mr oxenham went ashore into the woods with a boats crew to find the negroes who helped us three years before those are the cimaroons gentles negro slaves who have fled from those devils incarnate their spanish masters and live wild like the beasts that perish men of great stature sirs and fierce as wolves in the onslaught but poor jabbering mazed fellows if they be but a bit dismayed and have many indian women with them who take to these negroes a deal better than to their own kin which breeds war enough as you may guess  well sirs after three days the captain comes back looking heavy enough and says we played our trick once too often when we played it once there is no chance of stopping another reco that is a muletrain sirs now the cimaroons say that since our last visit they never move without plenty of soldiers two hundred shot at least therefore he said my gallants we must either return emptyhanded from this the very market and treasury of the whole indies or do such a deed as men never did before which i shall like all the better for that very reason and we asking his meaning why he said if drake will not sail the south seas we will adding profanely that drake was like moses who beheld the promised land afar but he was joshua who would enter into it and smite the inhabitants thereof and for our confirmation showed me and the rest the superscription of a letter and said how i came by this is none of your business but i have had it in my bosom ever since i left plymouth and i tell you now what i forbore to tell you at first that the south seas have been my mark all along such news have i herein of plateships and goldships and what not which will come up from quito and lima this very month all which with the pearls of the gulf of panama and other wealth unspeakable will be ours if we have but true english hearts within us  at which gentles we were like madmen for lust of that gold and cheerfully undertook a toil incredible for first we run our ship aground in a great wood which grew in the very sea itself and then took out her masts and covered her in boughs with her four cast pieces of great ordnance of which more hereafter and leaving no man in her started for the south seas across the neck of panama with two small pieces of ordnance and our culverins and good store of victuals and with us six of those negroes for a guide and so twelve leagues to a river which runs into the south sea  and there having cut wood we made a pinnace and work enough we had at it of fiveandforty foot in the keel and in her down the stream and to the isle of pearls in the gulf of panama  into the south sea impossible said sir richard have a care what you say my man for there is that about you which would make me sorry to find you out a liar  impossible or not liar or none we went there sir  question him amyas lest he turn out to have been beforehand with you  the man looked inquiringly at amyas who said  well my man of the gulf of panama i cannot ask you for i never was inside it but what other parts of the coast do you know  every inch sir from cabo san francisco to lima more is my sorrow for i was a galleyslave there for two years and more  you know lima  i was there three times worshipful gentlemen and the last was february come two years and there i helped lade a great plateship the cacafuogo they called her  amyas started sir richard nodded to him gently to be silent and then  and what became of her my lad  god knows who knows all and the devil who freighted her i broke prison six weeks afterwards and never heard but that she got safe into panama  you never heard then that she was taken  taken your worships who should take her  why should not a good english ship take her as well as another said amyas  lord love you sir yes faith if they had but been there manys the time that i thought to myself as we went alongside oh if captain drake was but here well to windward and our old crew of the dragon ask your pardon gentles but how is captain drake if i may make so bold  neither could hold out longer  fellow fellow cried sir richard springing up either thou art the cunningest liar that ever earned a halter or thou hast done a deed the like of which never man adventured dost thou not know that captain drake took that cacafuogo and all her freight in february come two years  captain drake god forgive me sir butcaptain drake in the south seas he saw them sir from the treetop over panama when i was with him and i too but sailed them sirsailed them  yes and round the world too said amyas and i with him and took that very cacafuogo off cape san francisco as she came up to panama  one glance at the mans face was enough to prove his sincerity the great stern anabaptist who had not winced at the news of his mothers death dropt right on his knees on the floor and burst into violent sobs  glory to god glory to god o lord i thank thee captain drake in the south seas the blood of thy innocents avenged o lord the spoiler spoiled and the proud robbed and all they whose hands were mighty have found nothing glory glory oh tell me sir did she fight  we gave her three pieces of ordnance only and struck down her mizzenmast and then boarded sword in hand but never had need to strike a blow and before we left her one of her own boys had changed her name and rechristened her the cacaplata  glory glory cowards they are as i told them i told them they never could stand the devon mastiffs and well they flogged me for saying it but they could not stop my mouth o sir tell me did you get the ship that came up after her  what was that  a long raceship sir from guayaquil with an old gentleman on boarddon francisco de xararte was his name and by token he had a gold falcon hanging to a chain round his neck and a green stone in the breast of it i saw it as we rowed him aboard o tell me sir tell me for the love of god did you take that ship  we did take that ship and the jewel too and her majesty has it at this very hour  then tell me sir said he slowly as if he dreaded an answer tell me sir and oh try and mindwas there a little maid aboard with the old gentleman  a little maid let me think no i saw none  the man settled his features again sadly  i thought not i never saw her come aboard still i hoped like i hoped alackaday god help me salvation yeo  what have you to do with this little maid then good fellow asked grenville  ah sir before i tell you that i must go back and finish the story of mr oxenham if you will believe me enough to hear it  i do believe thee good fellow and honor thee too  then sir i can speak with a free tongue where was i  where was he amyas  at the isle of pearls  and yet o gentles tell me first how captain drake came into the south seasover the neck as we did  through the straits good fellow like any spaniard but go on with thy story and thou shalt have mr leighs after  through the straits o glory but ill tell my tale well sirs bothto the island of pearls we came we and some of the negroes we found many huts and indians fishing for pearls and also a fair house with porches but no spaniard therein save one man at which mr oxenham was like a man transported and fell on that spaniard crying perro where is your mistress where is the bark from lima to which he boldly enough what was his mistress to the englishman but mr o threatened to twine a cord round his head till his eyes burst out and the spaniard being terrified said that the ship from lima was expected in a fortnights time so for ten days we lay quiet letting neither negro nor spaniard leave the island and took good store of pearls feeding sumptuously on wild cattle and hogs until the tenth day when there came by a small bark her we took and found her from quito and on board 60000 pezos of gold and other store with which if we had been content gentlemen all had gone well and some were willing to go back at once having both treasure and pearls in plenty but mr o he waxed right mad and swore to slay any one who made that motion again assuring us that the lima ship of which he had news was far greater and richer and would make princes of us all which bark came in sight on the sixteenth day and was taken without shot or slaughter the taking of which bark i verily believe was the ruin of every mothers son of us  and being asked why he answered first because of the discontent which was bred thereby for on board was found no gold but only 100000 pezos of silver  sir richard grenvillethou greedy fellow and was not that enough to stay your stomachs  yeo answered that he would to god it had been and that moreover the weight of that silver was afterwards a hindrance to them and fresh cause of discontent as he would afterwards declare so that it had been well for us sirs if we had left it behind as mr drake left his three years before and carried away the gold only in which i do see the evident hand of god and his just punishment for our greediness of gain who caused mr oxenham by whom we had hoped to attain great wealth to be a snare to us and a cause of utter ruin  do you think then said sir richard that mr oxenham deceived you wilfully  i will never believe that sir mr oxenham had his private reasons for waiting for that ship for the sake of one on board whose face would that he had never seen though he saw it then as i fear not for the first time by many a one and so was silent  come said both his hearers you have brought us thus far and you must go on  gentlemen i have concealed this matter from all men both on my voyage home and since and i hope you will be secret in the matter for the honor of my noble captain and the comfort of his friends who are alive for i think it shame to publish harm of a gallant gentleman and of an ancient and worshipful family and to me a true and kind captain when what is done cannot be undone and least said soonest mended neither now would i have spoken of it but that i was inwardly moved to it for the sake of that young gentleman there looking at amyas that he might be warned in time of gods wrath against the crying sin of adultery and flee youthful lusts which war against the soul  thou hast done wisely enough then said sir richard and look to it if i do not reward thee but the young gentleman here thank god needs no such warnings having got them already both by precept and example where thou and poor oxenham might have had them also  you mean captain drake your worship  i do sirrah if all men were as clean livers as he the world would be spared one half the tears that are shed in it  amen sir at least there would have been many a tear spared to us and ours foras all must outin that bark of lima he took a young lady as fair as the sunshine sir and seemingly about two or threeandtwenty years of age having with her a tall young lad of sixteen and a little girl a marvellously pretty child of about a six or seven and the lady herself was of an excellent beauty like a whales tooth for whiteness so that all the crew wondered at her and could not be satisfied with looking upon her and gentlemen this was strange that the lady seemed in no wise afraid or mournful and bid her little girl fear naught as did also mr oxenham but the lad kept a very sour countenance and the more when he saw the lady and mr oxenham speaking together apart  well sir after this good luck we were minded to have gone straight back to the river whence we came and so home to england with all speed but mr oxenham persuaded us to return to the island and get a few more pearls to which foolishness which after caused the mishap i verily believe he was moved by the instigation of the devil and of that lady for as we were about to go ashore i going down into the cabin of the prize saw mr oxenham and that lady making great cheer of each other with my life and my king and light of my eyes and such toys and being bidden by mr oxenham to fetch out the ladys mails and take them ashore heard how the two laughed together about the old ape of panama which ape or devil rather i saw afterwards to my cost and also how she said that she had been dead for five years and now that mr oxenham was come she was alive again and so forth  mr oxenham bade take the little maid ashore kissing her and playing with her and saying to the lady what is yours is mine and what is mine is yours and she asking whether the lad should come ashore he answered he is neither yours nor mine let the spawn of beelzebub stay on shore after which i coming on deck again stumbled over that very lad upon the hatchway ladder who bore so black and despiteful a face that i verily believe he had overheard their speech and so thrust him upon deck and going below again told mr oxenham what i thought and said that it were better to put a dagger into him at once professing to be ready so to do for which grievous sin seeing that it was committed in my unregenerate days i hope i have obtained the grace of forgiveness as i have that of hearty repentance but the lady cried out though he be none of mine i have sin enough already on my soul and so laid her hand on mr oxenhams mouth entreating pitifully and mr oxenham answered laughing when she would let him what care we let the young monkey go and howl to the old one and so went ashore with the lady to that house whence for three days he never came forth and would have remained longer but that the men finding but few pearls and being wearied with the watching and warding so many spaniards and negroes came clamoring to him and swore that they would return or leave him there with the lady so all went on board the pinnace again every one in ill humor with the captain and he with them  well sirs we came back to the mouth of the river and there began our troubles for the negroes as soon as we were on shore called on mr oxenham to fulfil the bargain he had made with them and now it came out what few of us knew till then that he had agreed with the cimaroons that they should have all the prisoners which were taken save the gold and he though loath was about to give up the spaniards to them near forty in all supposing that they intended to use them as slaves but as we all stood talking one of the spaniards understanding what was forward threw himself on his knees before mr oxenham and shrieking like a madman entreated not to be given up into the hands of those devils said he who never take a spanish prisoner but they roast him alive and then eat his heart among them we asked the negroes if this was possible to which some answered what was that to us but others said boldly that it was true enough and that revenge made the best sauce and nothing was so sweet as spanish blood and one pointing to the lady said such foul and devilish things as i should be ashamed either for me to speak or you to hear at this we were like men amazed for very horror and mr oxenham said you incarnate fiends if you had taken these fellows for slaves it had been fair enough for you were once slaves to them and i doubt not cruelly used enough but as for this abomination says he god do so to me and more also if i let one of them come into your murderous hands so there was a great quarrel but mr oxenham stoutly bade put the prisoners on board the ships again and so let the prizes go taking with him only the treasure and the lady and the little maid and so the lad went on to panama gods wrath having gone out against us  well sirs the cimaroons after that went away from us swearing revenge for which we cared little enough and we rowed up the river to a place where three streams met and then up the least of the three some four days journey till it grew all shoal and swift and there we hauled the pinnace upon the sands and mr oxenham asked the men whether they were willing to carry the gold and silver over the mountains to the north sea some of them at first were loath to do it and i and others advised that we should leave the plate behind and take the gold only for it would have cost us three or four journeys at the least but mr oxenham promised every man 100 pezos of silver over and above his wages which made them content enough and we were all to start the morrow morning but sirs that night as god had ordained came a mishap by some rash speeches of mr oxenhams which threw all abroad again for when we had carried the treasure about half a league inland and hidden it away in a house which we made of boughs mr o being always full of that his fair lady spoke to me and william penberthy of marazion my good comrade and a few more saying that we had no need to return to england seeing that we were already in the very garden of eden and wanted for nothing but could live without labor or toil and that it was better when we got over to the north sea to go and seek out some fair island and there dwell in joy and pleasure till our lives end and we two he said will be king and queen and you whom i can trust my officers and for servants we will have the indians who i warrant will be more fain to serve honest and merry masters like us than those spanish devils and much more of the like which words i liked wellmy mind alas being given altogether to carnal pleasure and vanityas did william penberthy my good comrade on whom i trust god has had mercy but the rest sirs took the matter all across and began murmuring against the captain saying that poor honest mariners like them had always the labor and the pain while he took his delight with his lady and that they would have at least one merry night before they were slain by the cimaroons or eaten by panthers and lagartos and so got out of the pinnace two great skins of canary wine which were taken in the lima prize and sat themselves down to drink moreover there were in the pinnace a great sight of hens which came from the same prize by which mr o set great store keeping them for the lady and the little maid and falling upon these the men began to blaspheme saying what a plague had the captain to fill the boat with dirty live lumber for that giglets sake they had a better right to a good supper than ever she had and might fast awhile to cool her hot blood and so cooked and ate those hens plucking them on board the pinnace and letting the feathers fall into the stream but when william penberthy my good comrade saw the feathers floating away down he asked them if they were mad to lay a trail by which the spaniards would surely track them out if they came after them as without doubt they would but they laughed him to scorn and said that no spanish cur dared follow on the heels of true english mastiffs as they were and other boastful speeches and at last being heated with wine began afresh to murmur at the captain and one speaking of his counsel about the island the rest altogether took it amiss and out of the way and some sprang up crying treason and others that he meant to defraud them of the plate which he had promised and others that he meant to desert them in a strange land and so forth till mr o hearing the hubbub came out to them from the house when they reviled him foully swearing that he meant to cheat them and one edward stiles a wapping man mad with drink dared to say that he was a fool for not giving up the prisoners to the negroes and what was it to him if the lady roasted the negroes should have her yet and drawing his sword ran upon the captain for which i was about to strike him through the body but the captain not caring to waste steel on such a ribald with his fist caught him such a buffet behind the ear that he fell down stark dead and all the rest stood amazed then mr oxenham called out all honest men who know me and can trust me stand by your lawful captain against these ruffians whereon sirs i and penberthy my good comrade and four plymouth men who had sailed with mr o in mr drakes ship and knew his trusty and valiant conditions came over to him and swore before god to stand by him and the lady then said mr o to the rest will you carry this treasure knaves or will you not give me an answer here and they refused unless he would before they started give each man his share so mr o waxed very mad and swore that he would never be served by men who did not trust him and so went in again and that night was spent in great disquiet i and those five others keeping watch about the house of boughs till the rest fell asleep in their drink and next morning when the wine was gone out of them mr o asked them whether they would go to the hills with him and find those negroes and persuade them after all to carry the treasure to which they agreed after awhile thinking that so they should save themselves labor and went off with mr oxenham leaving us six who had stood by him to watch the lady and the treasure after he had taken an oath of us that we would deal justly and obediently by him and by her which god knows gentlemen we did so he parted with much weeping and wailing of the lady and was gone seven days and all that time we kept that lady faithfully and honestly bringing her the best we could find and serving her upon our bended knees both for her admirable beauty and for her excellent conditions for she was certainly of some noble kin and courteous and without fear as if she had been a very princess but she kept always within the house which the little maid god bless her did not but soon learned to play with us and we with her so that we made great cheer of her gentlemen sailor fashionfor you know we must always have our minions aboard to pet and amuse usmaybe a monkey or a little dog or a singing bird ay or mice and spiders if we have nothing better to play withal and she was wonderful sharp sirs was the little maid and picked up her english from us fast calling us jolly mariners which i doubt but she has forgotten by now but i hope in god it be not so and therewith the good fellow began wiping his eyes  well sir on the seventh day we six were down by the pinnace clearing her out and the little maid with us gathering of flowers and william penberthy fishing on the bank about a hundred yards below when on a sudden he leaps up and runs toward us crying here come our hens feathers back again with a vengeance and so bade catch up the little maid and run for the house for the spaniards were upon us  which was too true for before we could win the house there were full eighty shot at our heels but could not overtake us nevertheless some of them stopping fixed their calivers and let fly killing one of the plymouth men the rest of us escaped to the house and catching up the lady fled forth not knowing whither we went while the spaniards finding the house and treasure pursued us no farther  for all that day and the next we wandered in great misery the lady weeping continually and calling for mr oxenham most piteously and the little maid likewise till with much ado we found the track of our comrades and went up that as best we might but at nightfall by good hap we met the whole crew coming back and with them 200 negroes or more with bows and arrows at which sight was great joy and embracing and it was a strange thing sirs to see the lady for before that she was altogether desperate and yet she was now a very lioness as soon as she had got her love again and prayed him earnestly not to care for that gold but to go forward to the north sea vowing to him in my hearing that she cared no more for poverty than she had cared for her good name and thenthey being a little apart from the restpointed round to the green forest and said in spanishwhich i suppose they knew not that i understoodsee all round us is paradise were it not enough for you and me to stay here forever and let them take the gold or leave it as they will  to which mr oxenhamthose who lived in paradise had not sinned as we have and would never have grown old or sick as we shall  and sheif we do that there are poisons enough in these woods by which we may die in each others arms as would to heaven we had died seven years agone  but heno no my life it stands upon my honor both to fulfil my bond with these men whom i have brought hither and to take home to england at least something of my prize as a proof of my own valor  then she smilingam i not prize enough and proof enough but he would not be so tempted and turning to us offered us the half of that treasure if we would go back with him and rescue it from the spaniard at which the lady wept and wailed much but i took upon myself to comfort her though i was but a simple mariner telling her that it stood upon mr oxenhams honor and that in england nothing was esteemed so foul as cowardice or breaking word and troth betwixt man and man and that better was it for him to die seven times by the spaniards than to face at home the scorn of all who sailed the seas so after much ado back they went again i and penberthy and the three plymouth men which escaped from the pinnace keeping the lady as before  well sirs we waited five days having made houses of boughs as before without hearing aught and on the sixth we saw coming afar off mr oxenham and with him fifteen or twenty men who seemed very weary and wounded and when we looked for the rest to be behind them behold there were no more at which sirs as you may well think our hearts sank within us  and mr o coming nearer cried out afar off all is lost and so walked into the camp without a word and sat himself down at the foot of a great tree with his head between his hands speaking neither to the lady or to any one till she very pitifully kneeling before him cursing herself for the cause of all his mischief and praying him to avenge himself upon that her tender body won him hardly to look once upon her after which as is the way of vain and unstable man all between them was as before  but the men were full of curses against the negroes for their cowardice and treachery yea and against high heaven itself which had put the most part of their ammunition into the spaniards hands and told me and i believe truly how they forced the enemy awaiting them in a little copse of great trees well fortified with barricades of boughs and having with them our two falcons which they had taken out of the pinnace and how mr oxenham divided both the english and the negroes into two bands that one might attack the enemy in front and the other in the rear and so set upon them with great fury and would have utterly driven them out but that the negroes who had come on with much howling like very wild beasts being suddenly scared with the shot and noise of the ordnance turned and fled leaving the englishmen alone in which evil strait mr o fought like a very guy of warwick and i verily believe every man of them likewise for there was none of them who had not his shrewd scratch to show and indeed mr oxenhams party had once gotten within the barricades but the spaniards being sheltered by the tree trunks and especially by one mighty tree which stood as i remembered it and remember it now borne up two fathoms high upon its own roots as it were upon arches and pillars shot at them with such advantage that they had several slain and seven more taken alive only among the roots of that tree so seeing that they could prevail nothing having little but their pikes and swords they were fain to give back though mr oxenham swore he would not stir a foot and making at the spanish captain was borne down with pikes and hardly pulled away by some who at last reminding him of his lady persuaded him to come away with the rest whereon the other party fled also but what had become of them they knew not for they took another way and so they miserably drew off having lost in men eleven killed and seven taken alive besides five of the rascal negroes who were killed before they had time to run and there was an end of the matter        in the documents from which i have drawn this veracious      history a note is appended to this point of yeos story      which seems to me to smack sufficiently of the old      elizabethan seaman to be inserted at length       all so far and most after agreeth with lopez vaz his      tale taken from his pocket by my lord cumberlands mariners      at the river plate in the year 1586  but note here his      vainglory and falsehood or else fear of the spaniard       first lest it should be seen how great an advantage the      spaniards had he maketh no mention of the english calivers      nor those two pieces of ordnance which were in the pinnace       second he saith nothing of the flight of the cimaroons      though it was evidently to be gathered from that which he      himself saith that of less than seventy english were slain      eleven and of the negroes but five  and while of the      english seven were taken alive yet of the negroes none      and why but because the rascals ran       thirdly it is a thing incredible and out of experience      that eleven english should be slain and seven taken with      loss only of two spaniards killed       search now and see for i will not speak of mine own small      doings in all those memorable voyages which the worthy      and learned mr hakluyt hath so painfully collected and      which are to my old age next only to my bible whether in      all the fights which we have endured with the spaniards      their loss even in victory hath not far exceeded ours      for we are both bigger of body and fiercer of spirit being      even to the poorest of us thanks so the care of our      illustrious princes the best fed men of europe the most      trained to feats of strength and use of weapons and put our      trust also not in any virgin or saints dead rags and bones      painted idols which have no breath in their mouths or st      bartholomew medals and such devils remembrancers but in      the only true god and our lord jesus christ in whom      whosoever trusteth one of them shall chase a thousand  so      i hold having had good experience and say if they have      done it once let them do it again and kill their eleven to      our two with any weapon they will save paper bullets blown      out of fames lying trumpet  yet i have no quarrel with the      poor portugal for i doubt not but friend lopez vaz had      looking over his shoulder as he wrote some mighty black      velvet don with a name as long as that don bernaldino      delgadillo de avellaneda who set forth lately his      vainglorious libel of lies concerning the last and fatal      voyage of my dear friends sir f drake and sir john hawkins      who rest in peace having finished their labors as would      god i rested  to whose shameless and unspeakable lying my      good friend mr henry savile of this county did most pithily      and wittily reply stripping the ass out of his lions skin      and sir thomas baskerville general of the fleet by my      advice send him a cartel of defiance offering to meet him      with choice of weapons in any indifferent kingdom of equal      distance from this realm which challenge he hath prudently      put in his pipe or rather rolled it up for one of his      spanish cigarros and smoked it and i doubt not found it      foul in the mouth  but the next day gentlemen in came some fiveandtwenty more being the wreck of the other party and with them a few negroes and these last proved themselves no honester men than they were brave for there being great misery among us english and every one of us straggling where he could to get food every day one or more who went out never came back and that caused a suspicion that the negroes had betrayed them to the spaniards or maybe slain and eaten them so these fellows being upbraided with that altogether left us telling us boldly that if they had eaten our fellows we owed them a debt instead of the spanish prisoners and we in great terror and hunger went forward and over the mountains till we came to a little river which ran northward which seemed to lead into the northern sea and there mr owho sirs i will say after his first rage was over behaved himself all through like a valiant and skilful commanderbade us cut down trees and make canoes to go down to the sea which we began to do with great labor and little profit hewing down trees with our swords and burning them out with fire which after much labor we kindled but as we were aburning out of the first tree and cutting down of another a great party of negroes came upon us and with much friendly show bade us flee for our lives for the spaniards were upon us in great force and so we were up and away again hardly able to drag our legs after us for hunger and weariness and the broiling heat and some were taken god help them and some fled with the negroes of whom what became god alone knoweth but eight or ten held on with the captain among whom was i and fled downward toward the sea for one day but afterwards finding by the noise in the woods that the spaniards were on the track of us we turned up again toward the inland and coming to a cliff climbed up over it drawing up the lady and the little maid with cords of liana which hang from those trees as honeysuckle does here but exceeding stout and long even to fifty fathoms and so breaking the track hoped to be out of the way of the enemy  by which nevertheless we only increased our misery for two fell from that cliff as men asleep for very weariness and miserably broke their bones and others whether by the great toil or sunstrokes or eating of strange berries fell sick of fluxes and fevers where was no drop of water but rock of pumice stone as bare as the back of my hand and full moreover of great cracks black and without bottom over which we had not strength to lift the sick but were fain to leave them there aloft in the sunshine like dives in his torments crying aloud for a drop of water to cool their tongues and every man a great stinking vulture or two sitting by him like an ugly black fiend out of the pit waiting till the poor soul should depart out of the corpse but nothing could avail and for the dear life we must down again and into the woods or be burned up alive upon those rocks  so getting down the slope on the farther side we came into the woods once more and there wandered for many days i know not how many our shoes being gone and our clothes all rent off us with brakes and briars and yet how the lady endured all was a marvel to see for she went barefoot many days and for clothes was fain to wrap herself in mr oxenhams cloak while the little maid went all but naked but ever she looked still on mr oxenham and seemed to take no care as long as he was by comforting and cheering us all with pleasant words yea and once sitting down under a great figtree sang us all to sleep with very sweet music yet waking about midnight i saw her sitting still upright weeping very bitterly on whom sirs god have mercy for she was a fair and a brave jewel  and so to make few words of a sad matter at last there were none left but mr oxenham and the lady and the little maid together with me and william penberthy of marazion my good comrade and mr oxenham always led the lady and penberthy and i carried the little maid and for food we had fruits such as we could find and water we got from the leaves of certain lilies which grew on the bark of trees which i found by seeing the monkeys drink at them and the little maid called them monkeycups and asked for them continually making me climb for them and so we wandered on and upward into very high mountains always fearing lest the spaniards should track us with dogs which made the lady leap up often in her sleep crying that the bloodhounds were upon her and it befell upon a day that we came into a great wood of ferns which grew not on the ground like ours but on stems as big as a pinnaces mast and the bark of them was like a fine meshed net very strange to see where was very pleasant shade cool and green and there gentlemen we sat down on a bank of moss like folk desperate and fordone and every one looked the other in the face for a long while after which i took off the bark of those ferns for i must needs be doing something to drive away thought and began to plait slippers for the little maid  and as i was plaiting mr oxenham said what hinders us from dying like men every man falling on his own sword to which i answered that i dare not for a wise woman had prophesied of me sirs that i should die at sea and yet neither by water or battle wherefore i did not think right to meddle with the lords purposes and william penberthy said that he would sell his life and that dear but never give it away but the lady said ah how gladly would i die but then la paouvre garse which is in french the poor maid meaning the little one then mr oxenham fell into a very great weeping a weakness i never saw him in before or since and with many tears besought me never to desert that little maid whatever might befall which i promised swearing to it like a heathen but would if i had been able have kept it like a christian but on a sudden there was a great cry in the wood and coming through the trees on all sides spanish arquebusiers a hundred strong at least and negroes with them who bade us stand or they would shoot william penberthy leapt up crying treason and running upon the nearest negro ran him through and then another and then falling on the spaniards fought manfully till he was borne down with pikes and so died but i seeing no thing better to do sate still and finished my plaiting and so we were all taken and i and mr oxenham bound with cords but the soldiers made a litter for the lady and child by commandment of senor diego de trees their commander a very courteous gentleman  well sirs we were brought down to the place where the house of boughs had been by the riverside there we went over in boats and found waiting for us certain spanish gentlemen and among others one old and illfavored man graybearded and bent in a suit of black velvet who seemed to be a great man among them and if you will believe me mr leigh that was none other than the old man with the gold falcon at his breast don francisco xararte by name whom you found aboard of the lima ship and had you known as much of him as i do or as mr oxenham did either you had cut him up for sharks bait or ever you let the cur ashore again  well sirs as soon as the lady came to shore that old man ran upon her sword in hand and would have slain her but some there held him back on which he turned to and reviled with every foul and spiteful word which he could think of so that some there bade him be silent for shame and mr oxenham said it is worthy of you don francisco thus to trumpet abroad your own disgrace did i not tell you years ago that you were a cur and are you not proving my words for me  he answered english dog would to heaven i had never seen you  and mr oxenham spanish ape would to heaven that i had sent my dagger through your herringribs when you passed me behind st ildegondes church eight years last eastereve at which the old man turned pale and then began again to upbraid the lady vowing that he would have her burnt alive and other devilish words to which she answered at last  would that you had burnt me alive on my wedding morning and spared me eight years of misery and he  misery hear the witch senors oh have i not pampered her heaped with jewels clothes coaches what not the saints alone know what i have spent on her what more would she have of me  to which she answered only but this one word fool but in so terrible a voice though low that they who were about to laugh at the old pantaloon were more minded to weep for her  fool she said again after a while i will waste no words upon you i would have driven a dagger to your heart months ago but that i was loath to set you free so soon from your gout and your rheumatism selfish and stupid know when you bought my body from my parents you did not buy my soul farewell my love my life and farewell senors may you be more merciful to your daughters than my parents were to me and so catching a dagger from the girdle of one of the soldiers smote herself to the heart and fell dead before them all  at which mr oxenham smiled and said that was worthy of us both if you will unbind my hands senors i shall be most happy to copy so fair a schoolmistress  but don diego shook his head and said  it were well for you valiant senor were i at liberty to do so but on questioning those of your sailors whom i have already taken i cannot hear that you have any letters of license either from the queen of england or any other potentate i am compelled therefore to ask you whether this is so for it is a matter of life and death  to which mr oxenham answered merrily that so it was but that he was not aware that any potentates license was required to permit a gentlemans meeting his lady love and that as for the gold which they had taken if they had never allowed that fresh and fair young may to be forced into marrying that old january he should never have meddled with their gold so that was rather their fault than his and added that if he was to be hanged as he supposed the only favor which he asked for was a long drop and no priests and all the while gentlemen he still kept his eyes fixed on the ladys corpse till he was led away with me while all that stood by god reward them for it lamented openly the tragical end of those two sinful lovers  and now sirs what befell me after that matters little for i never saw captain oxenham again nor ever shall in this life  he was hanged then  so i heard for certain the next year and with him the gunner and sundry more but some were given away for slaves to the spaniards and may be alive now unless like me they have fallen into the cruel clutches of the inquisition for the inquisition now gentlemen claims the bodies and souls of all heretics all over the world as the devils told me with their own lips when i pleaded that i was no spanish subject and none that it catches whether peaceable merchants or shipwrecked mariners but must turn or burn  but how did you get into the inquisition  why sir after we were taken we set forth to go down the river again and the old don took the little maid with him in one boat and bitterly she screeched at parting from us and from the poor dead corpse and mr oxenham with don diego de trees in another and i in a third and from the spaniards i learnt that we were to be taken down to lima to the viceroy but that the old man lived hard by panama and was going straight back to panama forthwith with the little maid but they said it will be well for her if she ever gets there for the old man swears she is none of his and would have left her behind him in the woods now if don diego had not shamed him out of it and when i heard that seeing that there was nothing but death before me i made up my mind to escape and the very first night sirs by gods help i did it and went southward away into the forest avoiding the tracks of the cimaroons till i came to an indian town and there gentlemen i got more mercy from heathens than ever i had from christians for when they found that i was no spaniard they fed me and gave me a house and a wife and a good wife she was to me and painted me all over in patterns as you see and because i had some knowledge of surgery and bloodletting and my fleams in my pocket which were worth to me a fortune i rose to great honor among them though they taught me more of simples than ever i taught them of surgery so i lived with them merrily enough being a very heathen like them or indeed worse for they worshipped their xemes but i nothing and in time my wife bare me a child in looking at whose sweet face gentlemen i forgot mr oxenham and his little maid and my oath ay and my native land also wherefore it was taken from me else had i lived and died as the beasts which perish for one night after we were all lain down came a noise outside the town and i starting up saw armed men and calivers shining in the moonlight and heard one read in spanish with a loud voice some fools sermon after their custom when they hunt the poor indians how god had given to st peter the dominion of the whole earth and st peter again the indies to the catholic king wherefore if they would all be baptized and serve the spaniard they should have some monkeys allowance or other of more kicks than pence and if not then have at them with fire and sword but i dare say your worships know that devilish trick of theirs better than i  i know it man go on  wellno sooner were the words spoken than without waiting to hear what the poor innocents within would answer though that mattered little for they understood not one word of it what do the villains but let fly right into the town with their calivers and then rush in sword in hand killing pellmell all they met one of which shots gentlemen passing through the doorway and close by me struck my poor wife to the heart that she never spoke word more i catching up the babe from her breast tried to run but when i saw the town full of them and their dogs with them in leashes which was yet worse i knew all was lost and sat down again by the corpse with the babe on my knees waiting the end like one stunned and in a dream for now i thought god from whom i had fled had surely found me out as he did jonah and the punishment of all my sins was come well gentlemen they dragged me out and all the young men and women and chained us together by the neck and one catching the pretty babe out of my arms calls for water and a priest for they had their shavelings with them and no sooner was it christened than catching the babe by the heels he dashed out its brainsoh gentlemen gentlemenagainst the ground as if it had been a kitten and so did they to several more innocents that night after they had christened them saying it was best for them to go to heaven while they were still sure thereof and so marched us all for slaves leaving the old folk and the wounded to die at leisure but when morning came and they knew by my skin that i was no indian and by my speech that i was no spaniard they began threatening me with torments till i confessed that i was an englishman and one of oxenhams crew at that says the leader then you shall to lima to hang by the side of your captain the pirate by which i first knew that my poor captain was certainly gone but alas for me the priest steps in and claims me for his booty calling me lutheran heretic and enemy of god and so to make short a sad story to the inquisition at cartagena i went where what i suffered gentlemen were as disgustful for you to hear as unmanly for me to complain of but so it was that being twice racked and having endured the watertorment as best i could i was put to the scarpines whereof i am as you see somewhat lame of one leg to this day at which i could abide no more and so wretch that i am denied my god in hope to save my life which indeed i did but little it profited me for though i had turned to their superstition i must have two hundred stripes in the public place and then go to the galleys for seven years and there gentlemen ofttimes i thought that it had been better for me to have been burned at once and for all but you know as well as i what a floating hell of heat and cold hunger and thirst stripes and toil is every one of those accursed craft in which hell nevertheless gentlemen i found the road to heaveni had almost said heaven itself for it fell out by gods mercy that my next comrade was an englishman like myself a young man of bristol who as he told me had been some manner of factor on board poor captain barkers ship and had been a preacher among the anabaptists here in england and oh sir richard grenville if that man had done for you what he did for me you would never say a word against those who serve the same lord because they dont altogether hold with you for from time to time sir seeing me altogether despairing and furious like a wild beast in a pit he set before me in secret earnestly the sweet promises of god in christwho says come to me all ye that are heavy laden and i will refresh you and though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snowtill all that past sinful life of mine looked like a dream when one awaketh and i forgot all my bodily miseries in the misery of my soul so did i loathe and hate myself for my rebellion against that loving god who had chosen me before the foundation of the world and come to seek and save me when i was lost and falling into very despair at the burden of my heinous sins knew no peace until i gained sweet assurance that my lord had hanged my burden upon his cross and washed my sinful soul in his most sinless blood amen  and sir richard grenville said amen also  but gentlemen if that sweet youth won a soul to christ he paid as dearly for it as ever did saint of god for after a three or four months when i had been all that while in sweet converse with him and i may say in heaven in the midst of hell there came one night to the barranco at lima where we were kept when on shore three black devils of the holy office and carried him off without a word only saying to me look that your turn come not next for we hear that you have had much talk with the villain and at these words i was so struck cold with terror that i swooned right away and verily if they had taken me there and then i should have denied my god again for my faith was but young and weak but instead they left me aboard the galley for a few months more that was a whole voyage to panama and back in daily dread lest i should find myself in their cruel claws againand then nothing for me but to burn as a relapsed heretic but when we came back to lima the officers came on board again and said to me that heretic has confessed naught against you so we will leave you for this time but because you have been seen talking with him so much and the holy office suspects your conversion to be but a rotten one you are adjudged to the galleys for the rest of your life in perpetual servitude  but what became of him asked amyas  he was burned sir a day or two before we got to lima and five others with him at the same stake of whom two were englishmen old comrades of mine as i guess  ah said amyas we heard of that when we were off lima and they said too that there were six more lying still in prison to be burnt in a few days if we had had our fleet with us as we should have had if it had not been for john winter we would have gone in and rescued them all poor wretches and sacked the town to boot but what could we do with one ship  would to god you had sir for the story was true enough and among them i heard were two young ladies of quality and their confessor who came to their ends for reproving out of scripture the filthy and loathsome living of those parts which as i saw well enough and too well is liker to sodom than to a christian town but god will avenge his saints and their sins amen  amen said sir richard but on with thy tale for it is as strange as ever man heard  well gentlemen when i heard that i must end my days in that galley i was for awhile like a madman but in a day or two there came over me i know not how a full assurance of salvation both for this life and the life to come such as i had never had before and it was revealed to me i speak the truth gentlemen before heaven that now i had been tried to the uttermost and that my deliverance was at hand  and all the way up to panama that was after we had laden the cacafuogo i cast in my mind how to escape and found no way but just as i was beginning to lose heart again a door was opened by the lords own hand for i know not why we were marched across from panama to nombre which had never happened before and there put all together into a great barranco close by the quayside shackled as is the fashion to one long bar that ran the whole length of the house and the very first night that we were there i looking out of the window spied lying close aboard of the quay a goodsized caravel well armed and just loading for sea and the land breeze blew off very strong so that the sailors were laying out a fresh warp to hold her to the shore and it came into my mind that if we were aboard of her we should be at sea in five minutes and looking at the quay i saw all the soldiers who had guarded us scattered about drinking and gambling and some going into taverns to refresh themselves after their journey that was just at sundown and half an hour after in comes the gaoler to take a last look at us for the night and his keys at his girdle whereon sirs whether by madness or whether by the spirit which gave samson strength to rend the lion i rose against him as he passed me without forethought or treachery of any kind chained though i was caught him by the head and threw him there and then against the wall that he never spoke word after and then with his keys freed myself and every soul in that room and bid them follow me vowing to kill any man who disobeyed my commands they followed as men astounded and leaping out of night into day and death into life and so aboard that caravel and out of the harbor the lord only knows how who blinded the eyes of the idolaters with no more hurt than a few chanceshot from the soldiers on the quay but my tale has been overlong already gentlemen  go on till midnight my good fellow if you will  well sirs they chose me for captain and a certain genoese for lieutenant and away to go i would fain have gone ashore after all and back to panama to hear news of the little maid but that would have been but a fools errand some wanted to turn pirates but i and the genoese too who was a prudent man though an evil one persuaded them to run for england and get employment in the netherland wars assuring them that there would be no safety in the spanish main when once our escape got wind and the more part being of one mind for england we sailed watering at the barbadoes because it was desolate and so eastward toward the canaries in which voyage what we endured being taken by long calms by scurvy calentures hunger and thirst no tongue can tell many a time were we glad to lay out sheets at night to catch the dew and suck them in the morning and he that had a noggin of rainwater out of the scuppers was as much sought to as if he had been adelantado of all the indies till of a hundred and forty poor wretches a hundred and ten were dead blaspheming god and man and above all me and the genoese for taking the europe voyage as if i had not sins enough of my own already and last of all when we thought ourselves safe we were wrecked by southwesters on the coast of brittany near to cape race from which but nine souls of us came ashore with their lives and so to brest where i found a flushinger who carried me to falmouth and so ends my tale in which if i have said one word more or less than truth i can wish myself no worse than to have it all to undergo a second time  and his voice as he finished sank from very weariness of soul while sir richard sat opposite him in silence his elbows on the table his cheeks on his doubled fists looking him through and through with kindling eyes no one spoke for several minutes and then  amyas you have heard this story you believe it  every word sir or i should not have the heart of a christian man  so do i anthony  the butler entered  take this man to the buttery clothe him comfortably and feed him with the best and bid the knaves treat him as if he were their own father  but yeo lingered  if i might be so bold as to ask your worship a favor  anything in reason my brave fellow  if your worship could put me in the way of another adventure to the indies  another hast not had enough of the spaniards already  never enough sir while one of the idolatrous tyrants is left unhanged said he with a right bitter smile but its not for that only sir but my little maidoh sir my little maid that i swore to mr oxenham to look to and never saw her from that day to this i must find her sir or i shall go mad i believe not a night but she comes and calls to me in my dreams the poor darling and not a morning but when i wake there is my oath lying on my soul like a great black cloud and i no nearer the keeping of it i told that poor young minister of it when we were in the galleys together and he said oaths were oaths and keep it i must and keep it i will sir if youll but help me  have patience man god will take as good care of thy little maid as ever thou wilt  i know it sir i know it but faiths weak sir and oh if she were bred up a papist and an idolater wouldnt her blood be on my head then sir sooner than that sooner than that id be in the inquisition again tomorrow i would  my good fellow there are no adventures to the indies forward now but if you want to fight spaniards here is a gentleman will show you the way amyas take him with you to ireland if he has learnt half the lessons god has set him to learn he ought to stand you in good stead  yeo looked eagerly at the young giant  will you have me sir theres few matters i cant turn my hand to and maybe youll be going to the indies again some day eh and take me with you id serve your turn well though i say it either for gunner or for pilot i know every stone and tree from nombre to panama and all the ports of both the seas youll never be content ill warrant till youve had another turn along the gold coasts will you now  amyas laughed and nodded and the bargain was concluded  so out went yeo to eat and amyas having received his despatches got ready for his journey home  go the short way over the moors lad and send back carys gray when you can you must not lose an hour but be ready to sail the moment the wind goes about  so they started but as amyas was getting into the saddle he saw that there was some stir among the servants who seemed to keep carefully out of yeos way whispering and nodding mysteriously and just as his foot was in the stirrup anthony the old butler plucked him back  dear father alive mr amyas whispered he and you bent going by the moor road all alone with that chap  why not then im too big for him to eat i reckon  oh mr amyas hes not right i tell you not company for a christianto go forth with creatures as has flames of fire in their inwards tis temptation of providence indeed then it is  tale of a tub  tale of a christian sir there was two boys pigminding seed him at it down the hill beside a maiden that was taken mazed and no wonder poor soul and lying in screeching asterisks now down to the millyou ask as you go byand saw the flames come out of the mouth of mun and the smoke out of muns nose like a viredrake and the roaring of mun like the roaring of ten thousand bulls oh sir and to go with he after dark over moor tis the devils devices sir against you because youm going against his sarvants the pope of room and the spaniard and youll be pixyled sure as life and locked into a bog you will and see mun vanish away to fire and brimstone like a jackolantern oh have a care then have a care  and the old man wrung his hands while amyas bursting with laughter rode off down the park with the unconscious yeo at his stirrup chatting away about the indies and delighting amyas more and more by his shrewdness high spirit and rough eloquence  they had gone ten miles or more the day began to draw in and the western wind to sweep more cold and cheerless every moment when amyas knowing that there was not an inn hard by around for many a mile ahead took a pull at a certain bottle which lady grenville had put into his holster and then offered yeo a pull also  he declined he had meat and drink too about him heaven be praised  meat and drink fall to then man and dont stand on manners  whereon yeo seeing an old decayed willow by a brook went to it and took therefrom some touchwood to which he set a light with his knife and a stone while amyas watched a little puzzled and startled as yeos fiery reputation came into his mind was he really a salamandersprite and going to warm his inside by a meal of burning tinder but now yeo in his solemn methodical way pulled out of his bosom a brown leaf and began rolling a piece of it up neatly to the size of his little finger and then putting the one end into his mouth and the other on the tinder sucked at it till it was alight and drinking down the smoke began puffing it out again at his nostrils with a grunt of deepest satisfaction and resumed his dogtrot by amyass side as if he had been a walking chimney  on which amyas burst into a loud laugh and cried  why no wonder they said you breathed fire is not that the indians tobacco  yea verily heaven be praised but did you never see it before  never though we heard talk of it along the coast but we took it for one more spanish lie humphwell live and learn  ah sir no lie but a blessed truth as i can tell who have ere now gone in the strength of this weed three days and nights without eating and therefore sir the indians always carry it with them on their warparties and no wonder for when all things were made none was made better than this to be a lone mans companion a bachelors friend a hungry mans food a sad mans cordial a wakeful mans sleep and a chilly mans fire sir while for stanching of wounds purging of rheum and settling of the stomach theres no herb like unto it under the canopy of heaven  the truth of which eulogium amyas tested in after years as shall be fully set forth in due place and time but mark in the meanwhile says one of the veracious chroniclers from whom i draw these facts writing seemingly in the palmy days of good queen anne and not having as he says before his eyes the fear of that misocapnic solomon james i or of any other lying stuart that not to south devon but to north not to sir walter raleigh but to sir amyas leigh not to the banks of dart but to the banks of torridge does europe owe the dayspring of the latter age that age of smoke which shall endure and thrive when the age of brass shall have vanished like those of iron and of gold for whereas mr lane is said to have brought home that divine weed as spenser well names it from virginia in the year 1584 it is hereby indisputable that full four years earlier by the bridge of putford in the torridge moors which all true smokers shall hereafter visit as a hallowed spot and point of pilgrimage first twinkled that fiery beacon and beneficent lodestar of bidefordian commerce to spread hereafter from port to port and peak to peak like the watchfires which proclaimed the coming of the armada or the fall of troy even to the shores of the bosphorus the peaks of the caucasus and the farthest isles of the malayan sea while bideford metropolis of tobacco saw her pool choked with virginian traders and the pavement of her bridgeland street groaning beneath the savory bales of roll trinadado leaf and pudding and her grave burghers bolstered and blocked out of their own houses by the scarce less savory stockfish casks which filled cellar parlor and attic were fain to sit outside the door a silver pipe in every strong right hand and each left hand chinking cheerfully the doubloons deep lodged in the auriferous caverns of their trunkhose while in those fairyrings of fragrant mist which circled round their contemplative brows flitted most pleasant visions of wiltshire farmers jogging into sherborne fair their heaviest shillings in their pockets to buy unless old aubrey lies the lotusleaf of torridge for its weight in silver and draw from thence after the example of the caciques of dariena supplies of inspiration much needed then as now in those gothamite regions and yet did these improve as englishmen upon the method of those heathen savages for the latter so salvation yeo reported as a truth and dampiers surgeon mr wafer after him when they will deliberate of war or policy sit round in the hut of the chief where being placed enter to them a small boy with a cigarro of the bigness of a rollingpin and puffs the smoke thereof into the face of each warrior from the eldest to the youngest while they putting their hand funnelwise round their mouths draw into the sinuosities of the brain that more than delphic vapor of prophecy which boy presently falls down in a swoon and being dragged out by the heels and laid by to sober enter another to puff at the sacred cigarro till he is dragged out likewise and so on till the tobacco is finished and the seed of wisdom has sprouted in every soul into the tree of meditation bearing the flowers of eloquence and in due time the fruit of valiant action with which quaint fact for fact it is in spite of the bombast i end the present chapter    chapter viii  how the noble brotherhood of the rose was founded       it is virtue yea virtue gentlemen that maketh gentlemen that      maketh the poor rich the baseborn noble the subject a sovereign      the deformed beautiful the sick whole the weak strong the most      miserable most happy  there are two principal and peculiar gifts      in the nature of man knowledge and reason the one commandeth and      the other obeyeth these things neither the whirling wheel of      fortune can change neither the deceitful cavillings of worldlings      separate neither sickness abate neither age abolishlillys      euphues 1586  it now falls to my lot to write of the foundation of that most chivalrous brotherhood of the rose which after a few years made itself not only famous in its native country of devon but formidable as will be related hereafter both in ireland and in the netherlands in the spanish main and the heart of south america and if this chapter shall seem to any quixotic and fantastical let them recollect that the generation who spoke and acted thus in matters of love and honor were nevertheless practised and valiant soldiers and prudent and crafty politicians that he who wrote the arcadia was at the same time in spite of his youth one of the subtlest diplomatists of europe that the poet of the faerie queene was also the author of the state of ireland and if they shall quote against me with a sneer lillys euphues itself i shall only answer by askinghave they ever read it for if they have done so i pity them if they have not found it in spite of occasional tediousness and pedantry as brave righteous and pious a book as man need look into and wish for no better proof of the nobleness and virtue of the elizabethan age than the fact that euphues and the arcadia were the two popular romances of the day it may have suited the purposes of sir walter scott in his cleverly drawn sir piercie shafton to ridicule the euphuists and that affectatam comitatem of the travelled english of which languet complains but over and above the anachronism of the whole character for to give but one instance the euphuist knight talks of sidneys quarrel with lord oxford at least ten years before it happened we do deny that lillys book could if read by any man of common sense produce such a coxcomb whose spiritual ancestors would rather have been gabriel harvey and lord oxfordif indeed the former has not maligned the latter and illtempered tom nash maligned the maligner in his turn  but indeed there is a double anachronism in sir piercie for he does not even belong to the days of sidney but to those worse times which began in the latter years of elizabeth and after breaking her mighty heart had full license to bear their crop of fools heads in the profligate days of james of them perhaps hereafter and in the meanwhile let those who have not read euphues believe that if they could train a son after the fashion of his ephoebus to the great saving of their own money and his virtue all fathers even in these moneymaking days would rise up and call them blessed let us rather open our eyes and see in these old elizabeth gallants our own ancestors showing forth with the luxuriant wildness of youth all the virtues which still go to the making of a true englishman let us not only see in their commercial and military daring in their political astuteness in their deep reverence for law and in their solemn sense of the great calling of the english nation the antitypes or rather the examples of our own but let us confess that their chivalry is only another garb of that beautiful tenderness and mercy which is now as it was then the twin sister of english valor and even in their extravagant fondness for continental manners and literature let us recognize that old anglonorman teachableness and wideheartedness which has enabled us to profit by the wisdom and civilization of all ages and of all lands without prejudice to our own distinctive national character  and so i go to my story which if any one dislikes he has but to turn the leaf till he finds pasturage which suits him better  amyas could not sail the next day or the day after for the southwester freshened and blew three parts of a gale dead into the bay so having got the mary grenville down the river into appledore pool ready to start with the first shift of wind he went quietly home and when his mother started on a pillion behind the old servingman to ride to clovelly where frank lay wounded he went in with her as far as bideford and there met coming down the high street a procession of horsemen headed by will cary who clad capapie in a shining armor sword on thigh and helmet at saddlebow looked as gallant a young gentleman as ever bideford dames peeped at from door and window behind him upon country ponies came four or five stout servingmen carrying his lances and baggage and their own longbows swords and bucklers and behind all in a horselitter to mrs leighs great joy master frank himself he deposed that his wounds were only fleshwounds the dagger having turned against his ribs that he must see the last of his brother and that with her good leave he would not come home to burrough but take up his abode with cary in the ship tavern close to the bridgefoot this he did forthwith and settling himself on a couch held his levee there in state mobbed by all the gossips of the town not without white fibs as to who had brought him into that sorry plight  but in the meanwhile he and amyas concocted a scheme which was put into effect the next day being marketday first by the innkeeper who began under amyass orders a bustle of roasting boiling and frying unparalleled in the annals of the ship tavern and next by amyas himself who going out into the market invited as many of his old schoolfellows one by one apart as frank had pointed out to him to a merry supper and a rowse thereon consequent by which crafty scheme in came each of rose salternes gentle admirers and found himself to his considerable disgust seated at the same table with six rivals to none of whom had he spoken for the last six months however all were too well bred to let the leighs discern as much and they though of course they knew all settled their guests frank on his couch lying at the head of the table and amyas taking the bottom and contrived by filling all mouths with good things to save them the pain of speaking to each other till the wine should have loosened their tongues and warmed their hearts in the meanwhile both amyas and frank ignoring the silence of their guests with the most provoking goodhumor chatted and joked and told stories and made themselves such good company that will cary who always found merriment infectious melted into a jest and then into another and finding goodhumor far more pleasant than bad tried to make mr coffin laugh and only made him bow and to make mr fortescue laugh and only made him frown and unabashed nevertheless began playing his light artillery upon the waiters till he drove them out of the room bursting with laughter  so far so good and when the cloth was drawn and sack and sugar became the order of the day and queen and bible had been duly drunk with all the honors frank tried a fresh move and  i have a toast gentlemenhere it is the gentlemen of the irish wars and may ireland never be without a st leger to stand by a fortescue a fortescue to stand by a st leger and a chichester to stand by both  which toast of course involved the drinking the healths of the three representatives of those families and their returning thanks and paying a compliment each to the others house and so the ice cracked a little further and young fortescue proposed the health of amyas leigh and all bold mariners to which amyas replied by a few blunt kindly words that he wished to know no better fortune than to sail round the world again with the present company as fellowadventurers and so give the spaniards another taste of the men of devon  and by this time the wine going down sweetly caused the lips of them that were asleep to speak till the ice broke up altogether and every man began talking like a rational englishman to the man who sat next him  and now gentlemen said frank who saw that it was the fit moment for the grand assault which he had planned all along let me give you a health which none of you i dare say will refuse to drink with heart and soul as well as with lipsthe health of one whom beauty and virtue have so ennobled that in their light the shadow of lowly birth is unseenthe health of one whom i would proclaim as peerless in loveliness were it not that every gentleman here has sisters who might well challenge from her the girdle of venus and yet what else dare i say while those same lovely ladies who if they but use their own mirrors must needs be far better judges of beauty than i can be have in my own hearing again and again assigned the palm to her surely if the goddesses decide among themselves the question of the golden apple paris himself must vacate the judgmentseat gentlemen your hearts i doubt not have already bid you as my unworthy lips do now to drink the rose of torridge  if the rose of torridge herself had walked into the room she could hardly have caused more blank astonishment than franks bold speech every guest turned red and pale and red again and looked at the other as much as to say what right has any one but i to drink her lift your glass and i will dash it out of your hand but frank with sweet effrontery drank the health of the rose of torridge and a double health to that worthy gentleman whosoever he may be whom she is fated to honor with her love  well done cunning frank leigh cried blunt will cary none of us dare quarrel with you now however much we may sulk at each other for theres none of us ill warrant but thinks that she likes him the best of all and so we are bound to believe that you have drunk our healths all round  and so i have and what better thing can you do gentlemen than to drink each others healths all round likewise and so show yourselves true gentlemen true christians ay and true lovers for what is love let me speak freely to you gentlemen and guests what is love but the very inspiration of that deity whose name is love be sure that not without reason did the ancients feign eros to be the eldest of the gods by whom the jarring elements of chaos were attuned into harmony and order how then shall lovers make him the father of strife shall psyche wed with cupid to bring forth a cockatrices egg or the soul be filled with love the likeness of the immortals to burn with envy and jealousy division and distrust true the rose has its thorn but it leaves poison and stings to the nettle cupid has his arrow but he hurls no scorpions venus is awful when despised as the daughters of proetus found but her handmaids are the graces not the furies surely he who loves aright will not only find love lovely but become himself lovely also i speak not to reprehend you gentlemen for to you as your piercing wits have already perceived to judge by your honorable blushes my discourse tends but to point you if you will but permit me to that rock which i myself have i know not by what divine good hap attained if indeed i have attained it and am not about to be washed off again by the next tide  franks rapid and fantastic oratory utterly unexpected as it was had as yet left their wits no time to set their tempers on fire but when weak from his wounds he paused for breath there was a haughty murmur from more than one young gentleman who took his speech as an impertinent interference with each mans right to make a fool of himself and mr coffin who had sat quietly bolt upright and looking at the opposite wall now rose as quietly and with a face which tried to look utterly unconcerned was walking out of the room another minute and lady baths prophecy about the feast of the lapithae might have come true  but franks heart and head never failed him  mr coffin said he in a tone which compelled that gentleman to turn round and so brought him under the power of a face which none could have beheld for five minutes and borne malice so imploring tender earnest was it my dear mr coffin if my earnestness has made me forget even for a moment the bounds of courtesy let me entreat you to forgive me do not add to my heavy griefs heavy enough already the grief of losing a friend only hear me patiently to the end generously i know you will hear me and then if you are still incensed i can but again entreat your forgiveness a second time  mr coffin to tell the truth had at that time never been to court and he was therefore somewhat jealous of frank and his court talk and his court clothes and his court company and moreover being the eldest of the guests and only two years younger than frank himself he was a little nettled at being classed in the same category with some who were scarce eighteen and if frank had given the least hint which seemed to assume his own superiority all had been lost but when instead thereof he sued in forma pauperis and threw himself upon coffins mercy the latter who was a truehearted man enough and after all had known frank ever since either of them could walk had nothing to do but to sit down again and submit while frank went on more earnestly than ever  believe me believe me mr coffin and gentlemen all i no more arrogate to myself a superiority over you than does the sailor hurled on shore by the surge fancy himself better than his comrade who is still battling with the foam for i too gentlemenlet me confess it that by confiding in you i may perhaps win you to confide in mehave loved ay and do love where you love also do not start is it a matter of wonder that the sun which has dazzled you has dazzled me that the lodestone which has drawn you has drawn me do not frown either gentlemen i have learnt to love you for loving what i love and to admire you for admiring that which i admire will you not try the same lesson so easy and when learnt so blissful what breeds more close communion between subjects than allegiance to the same queen between brothers than duty to the same father between the devout than adoration for the same deity and shall not worship for the same beauty be likewise a bond of love between the worshippers and each lover see in his rival not an enemy but a fellowsufferer you smile and say in your hearts that though all may worship but one can enjoy and that one mans meat must be the poison of the rest be it so though i deny it shall we anticipate our own doom and slay ourselves for fear of dying shall we make ourselves unworthy of her from our very eagerness to win her and show ourselves her faithful knights by cherishing envymost unknightly of all sins shall we dream with the italian or the spaniard that we can become more amiable in a ladys eyes by becoming hateful in the eyes of god and of each other will she love us the better if we come to her with hands stained in the blood of him whom she loves better than us let us recollect ourselves rather gentlemen and be sure that our only chance of winning her if she be worth winning is to will what she wills honor whom she honors love whom she loves if there is to be rivalry among us let it be a rivalry in nobleness an emulation in virtue let each try to outstrip the other in loyalty to his queen in valor against her foes in deeds of courtesy and mercy to the afflicted and oppressed and thus our love will indeed prove its own divine origin by raising us nearer to those gods whose gift it is but yet i show you a more excellent way and that is charity why should we not make this common love to her whom i am unworthy to name the sacrament of a common love to each other why should we not follow the heroical examples of those ancient knights who having but one grief one desire one goddess held that one heart was enough to contain that grief to nourish that desire to worship that divinity and so uniting themselves in friendship till they became but one soul in two bodies lived only for each other in living only for her vowing as faithful worshippers to abide by her decision to find their own bliss in hers and whomsoever she esteemed most worthy of her love to esteem most worthy also and count themselves by that her choice the bounden servants of him whom their mistress had condescended to advance to the dignity of her masteras i not without hope that i shall be outdone in generous strife do here promise to be the faithful friend and to my ability the hearty servant of him who shall be honored with the love of the rose of torridge  he ceased and there was a pause  at last young fortescue spoke  i may be paying you a lefthanded compliment sir but it seems to me that you are so likely in that case to become your own faithful friend and hearty servant even if you have not borne off the bell already while we have been asleep that the bargain is hardly fair between such a gay italianist and us country swains  you undervalue yourself and your country my dear sir but set your mind at rest i know no more of that ladys mind than you do nor shall i know for the sake of my own peace i have made a vow neither to see her nor to hear if possible tidings of her till three full years are past dixi  mr coffin rose  gentlemen i may submit to be outdone by mr leigh in eloquence but not in generosity if he leaves these parts for three years i do so also  and go in charity with all mankind said cary give us your hand old fellow if you are a coffin you were sawn out of no wishywashy elmboard but right heartofoak i am going too as amyas here can tell to ireland away to cool my hot liver in a bog like a jackhare in march come give us thy neif and let us part in peace i was minded to have fought thee this day  i should have been most happy sir said coffin  but now i am all love and charity to mankind can i have the pleasure of begging pardon of the world in general and thee in particular does any one wish to pull my nose send me an errand make me lend him five pounds ay make me buy a horse of him which will be as good as giving him ten come along join hands all round and swear eternal friendship as brothers of the sacred order of theof what frank leigh open thy mouth daniel and christen us  the rose said frank quietly seeing that his new lovephiltre was working well and determined to strike while the iron was hot and carry the matter too far to carry it back again  the rose cried cary catching hold of coffins hand with his right and fortescues with his left come mr coffin bend sturdy oak woe to the stiffnecked and stouthearted says scripture  and somehow or other whether it was franks chivalrous speech or carys fun or amyass good wine or the nobleness which lies in every young lads heart if their elders will take the trouble to call it out the whole party came in to terms one by one shook hands all round and vowed on the hilt of amyass sword to make fools of themselves no more at least by jealousy but to stand by each other and by their ladylove and neither grudge nor grumble let her dance with flirt with or marry with whom she would and in order that the honor of their peerless dame and the brotherhood which was named after her might be spread through all lands and equal that of angelica or isonde of brittany they would each go home and ask their fathers leave easy enough to obtain in those brave times to go abroad wheresoever there were good wars to emulate there the courage and the courtesy of walter manny and gonzalo fernandes bayard and gaston de foix why not sidney was the hero of europe at fiveandtwenty and why not they  and frank watched and listened with one of his quiet smiles his eyes as some folks do smiled even when his lips were still and only said gentlemen be sure that you will never repent this day  repent said cary i feel already as angelical as thou lookest saint silvertongue what was it that sneezedthe cat  the lion rather by the roar of it said amyas making a dash at the arras behind him why here is a doorway here and  and rushing under the arras through an open door behind he returned dragging out by the head mr john brimblecombe  who was mr john brimblecombe  if you have forgotten him you have done pretty nearly what every one else in the room had done but you recollect a certain fat lad son of the schoolmaster whom sir richard punished for talebearing three years before by sending him not to coventry but to oxford that was the man he was now oneandtwenty and a bachelor of oxford where he had learnt such things as were taught in those days with more or less success and he was now hanging about bideford once more intending to return after christmas and read divinity that he might become a parson and a shepherd of souls in his native land  jack was in person exceedingly like a pig but not like every pig not in the least like the devon pigs of those days which i am sorry to say were no more shapely than the true irish greyhound who pays pats rint for him or than the lanky monsters who wallow in german rivulets while the village swineherd beneath a shady lime forgets his fleas in the melody of a jews harpstrange mudcolored creatures four feet high and four inches thick which look as if they had passed their lives as a collar of oxford brawn is said to do between two tight boards such were then the pigs of devon not to be compared with the true wild descendant of noahs stock highwithered furry grizzled gameflavored little rooklers whereof many a sownder still grunted about swinley down and braunton woods clovelly glens and bursdon moor not like these nor like the tame abomination of those barbarous times was jack but prophetic in face figure and complexion of fisher hobbs and the triumphs of science a fisher hobbs pig of twelve stone on his hindlegsthat was what he was and nothing else and if you do not know reader what a fisher hobbs is you know nothing about pigs and deserve no bacon for breakfast but such was jack the same plump mulberry complexion garnished with a few scattered black bristles the same sleek skin looking always as if it was upon the point of bursting the same little toddling legs the same dapper bend in the small of the back the same cracked squeak the same low upright forehead and tiny eyes the same round selfsatisfied jowl the same charming sensitive little cocked nose always on the lookout for a savory smelland yet while watching for the best contented with the worst a pig of selfhelpful and serene spirit as jack was and therefore like him fatting fast while other pigs ribs are staring through their skins  such was jack and lucky it was for him that such he was for it was little that he got to fat him at oxford in days when a servitor meant really a servantstudent and wistfully that day did his eyes led by his nose survey at the end of the ship inn passage the preparations for amyass supper the innkeeper was a friend of his for in the first place they had lived within three doors of each other all their lives and next jack was quite pleasant company enough beside being a learned man and an oxford scholar to be asked in now and then to the innkeepers private parlor when there were no gentlemen there to crack his little joke and tell his little story sip the leavings of the guests sack and sometimes help the host to eat the leavings of their supper and it was perhaps with some such hope that jack trotted off round the corner to the ship that very afternoon for that faithful little nose of his as it sniffed out of a back window of the school had given him warning of sabean gales and scents of paradise from the inn kitchen below so he went round and asked for his pot of small ale his only luxury and stood at the bar to drink it and looked inward with his little twinkling right eye and sniffed inward with his little curling right nostril and beheld in the kitchen beyond salad in stacks and fagots salad of lettuce salad of cress and endive salad of boiled coleworts salad of pickled coleworts salad of angelica salad of scurvywort and seven salads more for potatoes were not as yet and salads were during eight months of the year the only vegetable and on the dresser and before the fire whole hecatombs of fragrant victims which needed neither frankincense nor myrrh clovelly herrings and torridge salmon exmoor mutton and stow venison stubble geese and woodcocks curlew and snipe hams of hampshire chitterlings of taunton and botargos of cadiz such as pantagruel himself might have devoured and jack eyed them as a ragged boy eyes the cakes in a pastrycooks window and thought of the scraps from the commoners dinner which were his wages for cleaning out the hall and meditated deeply on the unequal distribution of human bliss  ah mr brimblecombe said the host bustling out with knife and apron to cool himself in the passage here are doings nine gentlemen to supper  nine are they going to eat all that  well i cant saythat mr amyas is as good as three to his trencher but still theres crumbs mr brimblecombe crumbs and waste not want not is my doctrine so you and i may have a somewhat to stay our stomachs about an eight oclock  eight said jack looking wistfully at the clock its but four now well its kind of you and perhaps ill look in  just you step in now and look to this venison theres a breast you may lay your two fingers into the say there and not get to the bottom of the fat thats sir richards sending hes all for them leighs and no wonder theym brave lads surely and theres a saddleomutton i rode twenty miles for mun yesterday i did over beyond barnstaple and five year old mr john it is if ever five years was and not a tooth to muns head for i looked to that and smelt all the way home like any apple and if it dont ate so soft as ever was scald cream never you call me thomas burman  humph said jack and thats their dinner well some are born with a silver spoon in their mouth  some be born with roast beef in their mouths and plumpudding in their pocket to take away the taste o mun and thats better than empty spunes eh  for them that get it said jack but for them that dont and with a sigh he returned to his small ale and then lingered in and out of the inn watching the dinner as it went into the best room where the guests were assembled  and as he lounged there amyas went in and saw him and held out his hand and said  hillo jack how goes the world how youve grown and passed onwhat had jack brimblecombe to do with rose salterne  so jack lingered on hovering around the fragrant smell like a fly round a honeypot till he found himself invisibly attracted and as it were led by the nose out of the passage into the adjoining room and to that side of the room where there was a door and once there he could not help hearing what passed inside till rose salternes name fell on his ear so as it was ordained he was taken in the fact and now behold him brought in redhand to judgment not without a kick or two from the wrathful foot of amyas leigh whereat there fell on him a storm of abuse which for the honor of that gallant company i shall not give in detail but which abuse strange to say seemed to have no effect on the impenitent and unabashed jack who as soon as he could get his breath made answer fiercely amid much puffing and blowing  what business have i here as much as any of you if you had asked me in i would have come but as you didnt i came without asking  you shameless rascal said cary come if you were asked where there was good wine ill warrant you for that  why said amyas no lad ever had a cake at school but he would dog him up one street and down another all day for the crumbs the trencherscraping spaniel  patience masters said frank that jacks is somewhat of a gnathonic and parasitic soul or stomach all bideford applewomen know but i suspect more than deus venter has brought him hither  deus eavesdropping then we shall have the whole story over the town by tomorrow said another beginning at that thought to feel somewhat ashamed of his late enthusiasm  ah mr frank you were always the only one that would stand up for me deus venter quotha twas deus cupid it was  a roar of laughter followed this announcement  what asked frank was it cupid then who sneezed approval to our love jack as he did to that of dido and aeneas  but jack went on desperately  i was in the next room drinking of my beer i couldnt help that could i and then i heard her name and i couldnt help listening then flesh and blood couldnt  nor fat either  no nor fat mr cary do you suppose fat men havent souls to be saved as well as thin ones and hearts to burst too as well as stomachs fat fat can feel i reckon as well as lean do you suppose theres naught inside here but beer  and he laid his hand as drayton might have said on that stout bastion hornwork ravelin or demilune which formed the outworks to the citadel of his purple isle of man  naught but beercheese i suppose  bread  beef  love cried jack yes loveay you laugh but my eyes are not so grown up with fat but what i can see whats fair as well as you  oh jack naughty jack dost thou heap sin on sin and luxury on gluttony  sin if i sin you sin i tell you and i dont care who knows it ive loved her these three years as well as eer a one of you i have ive thought o nothing else prayed for nothing else god forgive me and then you laugh at me because im a poor parsons son and you fine gentlemen god made us both i reckon youyou make a deal of giving her up today why its what ive done for three miserable years as ever poor sinner spent ay from the first day i said to myself jack if you cant have that pearl youll have none and that you cant have for its meat for your masters so conquer or die and i couldnt conquer i cant help loving her worshipping her no more than you and i will die but you neednt laugh meanwhile at me that have done as much as you and will do again  it is the old tale said frank to himself whom will not love transform into a hero  and so it was jacks squeaking voice was firm and manly his pigs eyes flashed very fire his gestures were so free and earnest that the ungainliness of his figure was forgotten and when he finished with a violent burst of tears frank forgetting his wounds sprang up and caught him by the hand  john brimblecombe forgive me gentlemen if we are gentlemen we ought to ask his pardon has he not shown already more chivalry more selfdenial and therefore more true love than any of us my friends let the fierceness of affection which we have used as an excuse for many a sin of our own excuse his listening to a conversation in which he well deserved to bear a part  ah said jack you make me one of your brotherhood and see if i do not dare to suffer as much as any of you you laugh do you fancy none can use a sword unless he has a bakers dozen of quarterings in his arms or that oxford scholars know only how to handle a pen  let us try his metal said st leger heres my sword jack draw coffin and have at him  nonsense said coffin looking somewhat disgusted at the notion of fighting a man of jacks rank but jack caught at the weapon offered to him  give me a buckler and have at any of you  heres a chair bottom cried cary and jack seizing it in his left flourished his sword so fiercely and called so loudly to coffin to come on that all present found it necessary unless they wished blood to be spilt to turn the matter off with a laugh but jack would not hear of it  nay if you will let me be of your brotherhood well and good but if not one or other i will fight and thats flat  you see gentlemen said amyas we must admit him or die the death so we needs must go when sir urian drives come up jack and take the oaths you admit him gentlemen  let me but be your chaplain said jack and pray for your luck when youre at the wars if i do stay at home in a country curacy tis not much that you need be jealous of me with her i reckon said jack with a pathetical glance at his own stomach  sia said cary but if he be admitted it must be done according to the solemn forms and ceremonies in such cases provided take him into the next room amyas and prepare him for his initiation  whats that asked amyas puzzled by the word but judging from the corner of wills eye that initiation was latin for a practical joke he led forth his victim behind the arras again and waited five minutes while the room was being darkened till franks voice called to him to bring in the neophyte  john brimblecombe said frank in a sepulchral tone you cannot be ignorant as a scholar and bachelor of oxford of that dread sacrament by which catiline bound the soul of his fellowconspirators in order that both by the daring of the deed he might have proof of their sincerity and by the horror thereof astringe their souls by adamantine fetters and novemstygian oaths to that wherefrom hereafter the weakness of the flesh might shrink wherefore o jack we too have determined following that ancient and classical example to fill as he did a bowl with the lifeblood of our most heroic selves and to pledge each other therein with vows whereat the stars shall tremble in their spheres and luna blushing veil her silver cheeks your blood alone is wanted to fill up the goblet sit down john brimblecombe and bare your arm  but mr frank said jack who was as superstitious as any old wife and what with the darkness and the discourse already in a cold perspiration  but me no buts or depart as recreant not by the door like a man but up the chimney like a flittermouse  but mr frank  thy vital juice or the chimney choose roared cary in his ear  well if i must said jack but its desperate hard that because you cant keep faith without these barbarous oaths i must take them too that have kept faith these three years without any  at this pathetic appeal frank nearly melted but amyas and cary had thrust the victim into a chair and all was prepared for the sacrifice  bind his eyes according to the classic fashion said will  oh no dear mr cary ill shut them tight enough i warrant but not with your dagger dear mr williamsure not with your dagger i cant afford to lose blood though i do look lustyi cant indeed sure a pin would doive got one here to my sleeve somewhereoh  see the fount of generous juice flow on fair stream how he bleedspints quarts ah this proves him to be in earnest  a true lovers blood is always at his fingers ends  he does not grudge it of course not eh jack what matters an odd gallon for her sake  for her sake nothing nothing take my life if you will butoh gentlemen a surgeon if you love me im going offi m fainting  drink then quick drink and swear pat his back cary courage man it will be over in a minute now frank  and frank spoke   if plighted troth i fail or secret speech reveal may cocytean ghosts around my pillow squeal while ates brazen claws distringe my spleen in sunder and drag me deep to plutos keep mid brimstone smoke and thunder   placetne domine  placet squeaked jack who thought himself at the last gasp and gulped down full threequarters of the goblet which cary held to his lips  ughahpuh mercy on us it tastes mighty like wine  a proof my virtuous brother said frank first of thy abstemiousness which has thus forgotten what wine tastes like and next of thy pure and heroical affection by which thy carnal senses being exalted to a higher and supralunar sphere like those platonical daemonizomenoi and enthusiazomenoi of whom jamblichus says that they were insensible to wounds and flame and much more therefore to evil savors doth make even the most nauseous draught redolent of that celestial fragrance which proceeding o jack from thine own inward virtue assimilates by sympathy even outward accidents unto its own harmony and melody for fragrance is as has been said well the song of flowers and sweetness the music of applesahem go in peace thou hast conquered  put him out of the door will said amyas or he will swoon on our hands  give him some sack said frank  not a blessed drop of yours sir said jack i like good wine as well as any man on earth and see as little of it but not a drop of yours sirs after your frumps and flouts about hangingon and trencherscraping when i first began to love her i bid goodbye to all dirty tricks for i had some one then for whom to keep myself clean  and so jack was sent home with a pint of good red alicant wine in him more poor fellow than he had tasted at once in his life before while the rest in high glee with themselves and the rest of the world relighted the candles had a right merry evening and parted like good friends and sensible gentlemen of devon thinking all except frank jack brimblecombe and his vow the merriest jest they had heard for many a day after which they all departed amyas and cary to winters squadron frank as soon as he could travel to the court again and with him young basset whose father sir arthur being in london procured for him a pages place in leicesters household fortescue and chicester went to their brothers in dublin st leger to his uncle the marshal of munster coffin joined champernoun and norris in the netherlands and so the brotherhood of the rose was scattered far and wide and mistress salterne was left alone with her lookingglass    chapter ix  how amyas kept his christmas day       take aim you noble musqueteers      and shoot you round about      stand to it valiant pikemen      and we shall keep them out      theres not a man of all of us      a foot will backward flee      ill be the foremost man in fight      says brave lord willoughby                     elizabethan ballad  it was the blessed christmas afternoon the light was fading down the evensong was done and the good folks of bideford were trooping home in merry groups the father with his children the lover with his sweetheart to cakes and ale and flapdragons and mummers plays and all the happy sports of christmas night one lady only wrapped close in her black muffler and followed by her maid walked swiftly yet sadly toward the long causeway and bridge which led to northam town sir richard grenville and his wife caught her up and stopped her courteously  you will come home with us mrs leigh said lady grenville and spend a pleasant christmas night  mrs leigh smiled sweetly and laying one hand on lady grenvilles arm pointed with the other to the westward and said  i cannot well spend a merry christmas night while that sound is in my ears  the whole party around looked in the direction in which she pointed above their heads the soft blue sky was fading into gray and here and there a misty star peeped out but to the westward where the downs and woods of raleigh closed in with those of abbotsham the blue was webbed and turfed with delicate white flakes iridescent spots marking the path by which the sun had sunk showed all the colors of the dying dolphin and low on the horizon lay a long band of grassy green but what was the sound which troubled mrs leigh none of them with their merry hearts and ears dulled with the din and bustle of the town had heard it till that moment and yet nowlisten it was dead calm there was not a breath to stir a blade of grass and yet the air was full of sound a low deep roar which hovered over down and wood saltmarsh and river like the roll of a thousand wheels the tramp of endless armies orwhat it wasthe thunder of a mighty surge upon the boulders of the pebble ridge  the ridge is noisy tonight said sir richard there has been wind somewhere  there is wind now where my boy is god help him said mrs leigh and all knew that she spoke truly the spirit of the atlantic storm had sent forward the token of his coming in the smooth groundswell which was heard inland two miles away tomorrow the pebbles which were now rattling down with each retreating wave might be leaping to the ridge top and hurled like roundshot far ashore upon the marsh by the force of the advancing wave fleeing before the wrath of the western hurricane  god help my boy said mrs leigh again  god is as near him by sea as by land said good sir richard  true but i am a lone mother and one that has no heart just now but to go home and pray  and so mrs leigh went onward up the lane and spent all that night in listening between her prayers to the thunder of the surge till it was drowned long ere the sun rose in the thunder of the storm  and where is amyas on this same christmas afternoon  amyas is sitting bareheaded in a boats stern in smerwick bay with the spray whistling through his curls as he shouts cheerfully  pull and with a will my merry men all and never mind shipping a sea cannon balls are a cargo that dont spoil by taking saltwater  his mothers presage has been true enough christmas eve has been the last of the still dark steaming nights of the early winter and the western gale has been roaring for the last twelve hours upon the irish coast  the short light of the winter day is fading fast behind him is a leaping line of billows lashed into mist by the tempest beside him green foamfringed columns are rushing up the black rocks and falling again in a thousand cataracts of snow before him is the deep and sheltered bay but it is not far up the bay that he and his can see for some four miles out at sea begins a sloping roof of thick gray cloud which stretches over their heads and up and far away inland cutting the cliffs off at midheight hiding all the kerry mountains and darkening the hollows of the distant firths into the blackness of night and underneath that awful roof of whirling mist the storm is howling inland ever sweeping before it the great foamsponges and the gray salt spray till all the land is hazy dim and dun let it howl on for there is more mist than ever salt spray made flying before that gale more thunder than ever seasurge wakened echoing among the cliffs of smerwick bay along those sandhills flash in the evening gloom red sparks which never came from heaven for that fort now christened by the invaders the fort del oro where flaunts the hated golden flag of spain holds san josepho and eight hundred of the foe and but three nights ago amyas and yeo and the rest of winters shrewdest hands slung four culverins out of the admirals main deck and floated them ashore and dragged them up to the battery among the sandhills and now it shall be seen whether spanish and italian condottieri can hold their own on british ground against the men of devon  small blame to amyas if he was thinking not of his lonely mother at burrough court but of those quick bright flashes on sandhill and on fort where salvation yeo was hurling the eighteenpound shot with deadly aim and watching with a cool and bitter smile of triumph the flying of the sand and the crashing of the gabions amyas and his party had been on board at the risk of their lives for a fresh supply of shot for winters battery was out of ball and had been firing stones for the last four hours in default of better missiles they ran the boat on shore through the surf where a cove in the shore made landing possible and almost careless whether she stove or not scrambled over the sandhills with each man his brace of shot slung across his shoulder and amyas leaping into the trenches shouted cheerfully to salvation yeo  more food for the bulldogs gunner and plums for the spaniards christmas pudding  dont speak to a man at his business master amyas five mortal times have i missed but i will have that accursed popish rag down as im a sinner  down with it then nobody wants you to shoot crooked take good iron to it and not footy pavingstones  i believe sir that the foul fiend is there a turning of my shot aside i do i thought i saw him once but thank heaven heres ball again ah sir if one could but cast a silver one now stand by men  and once again yeos eighteenpounder roared and away and oh glory the great yellow flag of spain which streamed in the gale lifted clean into the air flagstaff and all and then pitched wildly down headforemost far to leeward  a hurrah from the sailors answered by the soldiers of the opposite camp shook the very cloud above them but ere its echoes had died away a tall officer leapt upon the parapet of the fort with the fallen flag in his hand and rearing it as well as he could upon his lance point held it firmly against the gale while the fallen flagstaff was raised again within  in a moment a dozen long bows were bent at the daring foeman but amyas behind shouted  shame lads stop and let the gallant gentleman have due courtesy  so they stopped while amyas springing on the rampart of the battery took off his hat and bowed to the flagholder who as soon as relieved of his charge returned the bow courteously and descended  it was by this time all but dark and the firing began to slacken on all sides salvation and his brother gunners having covered up their slaughtering tackle with tarpaulings retired for the night leaving amyas who had volunteered to take the watch till midnight and the rest of the force having got their scanty supper of biscuit for provisions were running very short lay down under arms among the sandhills and grumbled themselves to sleep  he had paced up and down in the gusty darkness for some hour or more exchanging a passing word now and then with the sentinel when two men entered the battery chatting busily together one was in complete armor the other wrapped in the plain short cloak of a man of pens and peace but the talk of both was neither of sieges nor of sallies catapult bombard nor culverin but simply of english hexameters  and fancy not gentle reader that the two were therein fiddling while rome was burning for the commonweal of poetry and letters in that same critical year 1580 was in far greater danger from those same hexameters than the common woe of ireland as raleigh called it was from the spaniards  imitating the classic metres versifying as it was called in contradistinction to rhyming was becoming fast the fashion among the more learned stonyhurst and others had tried their hands at hexameter translations from the latin and greek epics which seem to have been doggerel enough and ever and anon some youthful wit broke out in iambics sapphics elegiacs and what not to the great detriment of the queens english and her subjects ears  i know not whether mr william webbe had yet given to the world any fragments of his precious hints for the reformation of english poetry to the tune of his own tityrus happily thou liest tumbling under a beechtree but the cambridge malvolio gabriel harvey had succeeded in arguing spenser dyer sidney and probably sidneys sister and the whole clique of beauxesprits round them into following his model of       what might i call this tree  a laurel  o bonny laurel      needes to thy bowes will i bowe this knee and vail my bonetto  after snubbing the first book of that elvish queene which was then in manuscript as a base declension from the classical to the romantic school  and now spenser perhaps in mere melancholy wilfulness and want of purpose for he had just been jilted by a fair maid of kent was wasting his mighty genius upon doggerel which he fancied antique and some piratical publisher bitter tom nash swears and with likelihood that harvey did it himself had just given to the worldthree proper wittie and familiar letters lately past between two university men touching the earthquake in april last and our english reformed versifying which had set all town wits abuzzing like a swarm of flies being none other than a correspondence between spenser and harvey which was to prove to the world forever the correctness and melody of such lines as       for like magnificoes not a beck but glorious in show      in deede most frivolous not a looke but tuscanish always  let them passalma mater has seen as bad hexameters since but then the matter was serious there is a story i know not how true that spenser was half bullied into rewriting the faerie queene in hexameters had not raleigh a true romanticist whose vein for ditty or amorous ode was most lofty insolent and passionate persuaded him to follow his better genius the great dramatists had not yet arisen to form completely that truly english school of which spenser unconscious of his own vast powers was laying the foundation and indeed it was not till daniel twenty years after in his admirable apology for rhyme had smashed mr campian and his eight several kinds of classical numbers that the matter was finally settled and the english tongue left to go the road on which heaven had started it so that we may excuse raleighs answering somewhat waspish to some quotation of spensers from the three letters of immerito and g h  tut tut colin clout much learning has made thee mad a good old fishwives ballad jingle is worth all your sapphics and trimeters and riffraff thurlery bouncing hey have i you there old lad do you mind that precious verse  but dear wat homer and virgil  but dear ned petrarch and ovid  but wat what have we that we do not owe to the ancients  ancients quotha why the legend of king arthur and chevy chase too of which even your fellowsinner sidney cannot deny that every time he hears it even from a blind fiddler it stirs his heart like a trumpetblast speak well of the bridge that carries you over man did you find your redcross knight in virgil or such a dame as una in old ovid no more than you did your pater and credo you renegado baptized heathen you  yet surely our younger and more barbarous taste must bow before divine antiquity and imitate afar  as dottrels do fowlers if homer was blind lad why dost not poke out thine eye ay this hexameter is of an ancient house truly ned spenser and so is many a rogue but he cannot make way on our rough english roads he goes hopping and twitching in our language like a threelegged terrier over a pebblebank tumble and up again rattle and crash  nay hear now       see ye the blindfolded pretty god that feathered archer         of lovers miseries which maketh his bloody game  true the accent gapes in places as i have often confessed to harvey but        strange as it may seem this distich is spensers own and      the other hexameters are all authentic  harvey be hanged for a pedant and the whole crew of versifiers from lord dorset but he poor man has been past hanging some time since to yourself why delude you into playing procrustes as he does with the queens english racking one word till its joints be pulled asunder and squeezing the next all aheap as the inquisitors do heretics in their banca cava out upon him and you and sidney and the whole kin you have not made a verse among you and never will which is not as lame a gosling as harveys own       oh thou weathercocke that stands on the top of allhallows      come thy ways down if thou darst for thy crown and take the wall      on us  hark now there is our young giant comforting his soul with a ballad you will hear rhyme and reason together here now he will not miscall blindfolded blindfolded i warrant or make an of and a which and a his carry a whole verse on their wretched little backs  and as he spoke amyas who had been grumbling to himself some christmas carol broke out fullmouthed       as joseph was awalking      he heard an angel sing      this night shall be the birth night      of christ our heavenly king       his birthbed shall be neither      in housen nor in hall      nor in the place of paradise      but in the oxens stall       he neither shall be rocked      in silver nor in gold      but in the wooden manger      that lieth on the mould       he neither shall be washen      with white wine nor with red      but with the fair spring water      that on you shall be shed       he neither shall be clothed      in purple nor in pall      but in the fair white linen      that usen babies all       as joseph was awalking      thus did the angel sing      and marys son at midnight      was born to be our king       then be you glad good people      at this time of the year      and light you up your candles      for his star it shineth clear  there edmunde classicaster said raleigh does not that simple strain go nearer to the heart of him who wrote the shepherds calendar than all artificial and outlandish       wote ye why his mother with a veil hath covered his face  why dost not answer man  but spenser was silent awhile and then  because i was thinking rather of the rhymer than the rhyme good heaven how that brave lad shames me singing here the hymns which his mother taught him before the very muzzles of spanish guns instead of bewailing unmanly as i have done the love which he held i doubt not as dear as i did even my rosalind this is his welcome to the winters storm while i who dream forsooth of heavenly inspiration can but see therein an image of mine own cowardly despair       thou barren ground whom winters wrath has wasted      art made a mirror to behold my plight  pah away with frosts icicles and tears and sighs        the shepherds calendar  and with hexameters and trimeters too i hope interrupted raleigh and all the trickeries of selfpleasing sorrow  i will set my heart to higher work than barking at the hand which chastens me  wilt put the lad into the faerie queene then by my side he deserves as good a place there believe me as ever a guyon or even as lord grey your arthegall let us hail him hallo young chanticleer of devon art not afraid of a chance shot that thou crowest so lustily upon thine own mixen  cocks crow all night long at christmas captain raleigh and so do i said amyass cheerful voice but whos there with you  a penitent pupil of yoursmr secretary spenser  pupil of mine said amyas i wish hed teach me a little of his art i could fill up my time here with making verses  and who would be your theme fair sir said spenser  no who at all i dont want to make sonnets to blue eyes nor black either but if i could put down some of the things i saw in the spice islands  ah said raleigh he would beat you out of parnassus mr secretary remember you may write about fairyland but he has seen it  and so have others said spenser it is not so far off from any one of us wherever is love and loyalty great purposes and lofty souls even though in a hovel or a mine there is fairyland  then fairyland should be here friend for you represent love and leigh loyalty while as for great purposes and lofty souls who so fit to stand for them as i being unless my enemies and my conscience are liars both as ambitious and as proud as lucifers own self  ah walter walter why wilt always slander thyself thus  slander tuti do but give the world a fair challenge and tell it thereyou know the worst of me come on and try a fall for either you or i must down slander ask leigh here who has but known me a fortnight whether i am not as vain as a peacock as selfish as a fox as imperious as a bona roba and ready to make a cats paw of him or any man if there be a chestnut in the fire and yet the poor fool cannot help loving me and running of my errands and taking all my schemes and my dreams for gospel and verily believes now i think that i shall be the man in the moon some day and he my big dog  well said amyas half apologetically if you are the cleverest man in the world what harm in my thinking so  hearken to him edmund he will know better when he has outgrown this same callow trick of honesty and learnt of the great goddess detraction how to show himself wiser than the wise by pointing out to the world the fools motley which peeps through the rents in the philosophers cloak go to lad slander thy equals envy thy betters pray for an eye which sees spots in every sun and for a vultures nose to scent carrion in every rosebed if thy friend win a battle show that he has needlessly thrown away his men if he lose one hint that he sold it if he rise to a place argue favor if he fall from one argue divine justice believe nothing hope nothing but endure all things even to kicking if aught may be got thereby so shalt thou be clothed in purple and fine linen and sit in kings palaces and fare sumptuously every day  and wake with dives in the torment said amyas thank you for nothing captain  go to misanthropos said spenser thou hast not yet tasted the sweets of this worlds comfits and thou railest at them  the grapes are sour lad  and will be to the end said amyas if they come off such a devils tree as that i really think you are out of your mind captain raleigh at times  i wish i were for it is a troublesome hungry windy mind as man ever was cursed withal but come in lad we were sent from the lord deputy to bid thee to supper there is a dainty lump of dead horse waiting for thee  send me some out then said matteroffact amyas and tell his lordship that with his good leave i dont stir from here till morning if i can keep awake there is a stir in the fort and i expect them out on us  tut man their hearts are broken we know it by their deserters  seeings believing i never trust runaway rogues if they are false to their masters theyll be false to us  well go thy ways old honesty and mr secretary shall give you a book to yourself in the faerie queenesir monoculus or the legend of common sense eh edmund  monoculus  ay singleeye my prince of wordcoinerswont that fitand give him the cyclops head for a device heighho they may laugh that win i am sick of this irish work were it not for the chance of advancement id sooner be driving a team of red devons on dartside and now i am angry with the dear lad because he is not sick of it too what a plague business has he to be paddling up and down contentedly doing his duty like any city watchman it is an insult to the mighty aspirations of our nobler heartseh my wouldbe ariosto  ah raleigh you can afford to confess yourself less than some for you are greater than all go on and conquer noble heart but as for me i sow the wind and i suppose i shall reap the whirlwind  your harvest seems come already what a blast that was hold on by me colin clout and ill hold on by thee so dont tread on that pikemans stomach lest he take thee for a marauding don and with sudden dagger slit cohns pipe and colins weasand too  and the two stumbled away into the darkness leaving amyas to stride up and down as before puzzling his brains over raleighs wild words and spensers melancholy till he came to the conclusion that there was some mysterious connection between cleverness and unhappiness and thanking his stars that he was neither scholar courtier nor poet said grace over his lump of horseflesh when it arrived devoured it as if it had been venison and then returned to his pacing up and down but this time in silence for the night was drawing on and there was no need to tell the spaniards that any one was awake and watching  so he began to think about his mother and how she might be spending her christmas and then about frank and wondered at what grand court festival he was assisting amid bright lights and sweet music and gay ladies and how he was dressed and whether he thought of his brother there far away on the dark atlantic shore and then he said his prayers and his creed and then he tried not to think of rose salterne and of course thought about her all the more so on passed the dull hours till it might be past eleven oclock and all lights were out in the battery and the shipping and there was no sound of living thing but the monotonous tramp of the two sentinels beside him and now and then a grunt from the party who slept under arms some twenty yards to the rear  so he paced to and fro looking carefully out now and then over the strip of sandhill which lay between him and the fort but all was blank and black and moreover it began to rain furiously  suddenly he seemed to hear a rustle among the harsh sandgrass true the wind was whistling through it loudly enough but that sound was not altogether like the wind then a soft sliding noise something had slipped down a bank and brought the sand down after it amyas stopped crouched down beside a gun and laid his ear to the rampart whereby he heard clearly as he thought the noise of approaching feet whether rabbits or christians he knew not but he shrewdly guessed the latter  now amyas was of a sober and businesslike turn at least when he was not in a passion and thinking within himself that if he made any noise the enemy whether four or twolegged would retire and all the sport be lost he did not call to the two sentries who were at the opposite ends of the battery neither did he think it worth while to rouse the sleeping company lest his ears should have deceived him and the whole camp turn out to repulse the attack of a buck rabbit  so he crouched lower and lower beside the culverin and was rewarded in a minute or two by hearing something gently deposited against the mouth of the embrasure which by the noise should be a piece of timber  so far so good said he to himself when the scaling ladder is up the soldier follows i suppose i can only humbly thank them for giving my embrasure the preference there he comes i hear his feet scuffling  he could hear plainly enough some one working himself into the mouth of the embrasure but the plague was that it was so dark that he could not see his hand between him and the sky much less his foe at two yards off however he made a pretty fair guess as to the whereabouts and rising softly discharged such a blow downwards as would have split a yule log a volley of sparks flew up from the hapless spaniards armor and a grunt issued from within it which proved that whether he was killed or not the blow had not improved his respiration  amyas felt for his head seized it dragged him in over the gun sprang into the embrasure on his knees felt for the top of the ladder found it hove it clean off and out with four or five men on it and then of course tumbled after it ten feet into the sand roaring like a town bull to her majestys liege subjects in general  sailorfashion he had no armor on but a light morion and a cuirass so he was not too much encumbered to prevent his springing to his legs instantly and setting to work cutting and foining right and left at every sound for sight there was none  battles as soldiers know and newspaper editors do not are usually fought not as they ought to be fought but as they can be fought and while the literary man is laying down the law at his desk as to how many troops should be moved here and what rivers should be crossed there and where the cavalry should have been brought up and when the flank should have been turned the wretched man who has to do the work finds the matter settled for him by pestilence want of shoes empty stomachs bad roads heavy rains hot suns and a thousand other stern warriors who never show on paper  so with this skirmish according to cocker it ought to have been a very pretty one for hercules of pisa who planned the sortie had arranged it all being a very sansappel in all military science upon the best italian precedents and had brought against this very hapless battery a column of a hundred to attack directly in front a company of fifty to turn the right flank and a company of fifty to turn the left flank with regulations orders passwords countersigns and what not so that if every man had had his rights as seldom happens don guzman maria magdalena de soto who commanded the sortie ought to have taken the work out of hand and annihilated all therein but alas here stern fate interfered they had chosen a dark night as was politic they had waited till the moon was up lest it should be too dark as was politic likewise but just as they had started on came a heavy squall of rain through which seven moons would have given no light and which washed out the plans of hercules of pisa as if they had been written on a schoolboys slate the company who were to turn the left flank walked manfully down into the sea and never found out where they were going till they were kneedeep in water the company who were to turn the right flank bewildered by the utter darkness turned their own flank so often that tired of falling into rabbitburrows and filling their mouths with sand they halted and prayed to all the saints for a compass and lantern while the centre body who held straight on by a trackway to within fifty yards of the battery so miscalculated that short distance that while they thought the ditch two pikes length off they fell into it one over the other and of six scaling ladders the only one which could be found was the very one which amyas threw down again after which the clouds broke the wind shifted and the moon shone out merrily and so was the deep policy of hercules of pisa on which hung the fate of ireland and the papacy decided by a ten minutes squall  but where is amyas  in the ditch aware that the enemy is tumbling into it but unable to find them while the company above finding it much too dark to attempt a counter sortie have opened a smart fire of musketry and arrows on things in general whereat the spaniards are swearing like spaniards i need say no more and the italians spitting like venomous cats while amyas not wishing to be riddled by friendly balls has got his back against the foot of the rampart and waits on providence  suddenly the moon clears and with one more fierce volley the english sailors seeing the confusion leap down from the embrasures and to it pellmell whether this also was according to cocker i know not but the sailor then as now is not susceptible of highlyfinished drill  amyas is now in his element and so are the brave fellows at his heels and there are ten breathless furious minutes among the sandhills and then the trumpets blow a recall and the sailors drop back again by twos and threes and are helped up into the embrasures over many a dead and dying foe while the guns of fort del oro open on them and blaze away for half an hour without reply and then all is still once more and in the meanwhile the sortie against the deputys camp has fared no better and the victory of the night remains with the english  twenty minutes after winter and the captains who were on shore were drying themselves round a peatfire on the beach and talking over the skirmish when will cary asked  where is leigh who has seen him i am sadly afraid he has gone too far and been slain  slain never less gentlemen replied the voice of the very person in question as he stalked out of the darkness into the glare of the fire and shot down from his shoulders into the midst of the ring as he might a sack of corn a huge dark body which was gradually seen to be a man in rich armor who being so shot down lay quietly where he was dropped with his feet luckily for him mailed in the fire  i say quoth amyas some of you had better take him up if he is to be of any use unlace his helm will cary  pull his feet out of the embers i dare say he would have been glad enough to put us to the scarpines but thats no reason we should put him to them  as has been hinted there was no love lost between admiral winter and amyas and amyas might certainly have reported himself in a more ceremonious manner so winter whom amyas either had not seen or had not chosen to see asked him pretty sharply what the plague he had to do with bringing dead men into camp  if hes dead its not my fault he was alive enough when i started with him and i kept him right end uppermost all the way and what would you have more sir  mr leigh said winter it behoves you to speak with somewhat more courtesy if not respect to captains who are your elders and commanders  ask your pardon sir said the giant as he stood in front of the fire with the rain steaming and smoking off his armor but i was bred in a school where getting good service done was more esteemed than making fine speeches  whatsoever school you were trained in sir said winter nettled at the hint about drake it does not seem to have been one in which you learned to obey orders why did you not come in when the recall was sounded  because said amyas very coolly in the first place i did not hear it and in the next in my school i was taught when i had once started not to come home emptyhanded  this was too pointed and winter sprang up with an oathdo you mean to insult me sir  i am sorry sir that you should take a compliment to sir francis drake as an insult to yourself i brought in this gentleman because i thought he might give you good information if he dies meanwhile the loss will be yours or rather the queens  help me then said cary glad to create a diversion in amyass favor and we will bring him round while raleigh rose and catching winters arm drew him aside and began talking earnestly  what a murrain have you leigh to quarrel with winter asked two or three  i say my reverend fathers and dear children do get the dons talking tackle free again and leave me and the admiral to settle it our own way  there was more than one captain sitting in the ring but discipline and the degrees of rank were not so severely defined as now and amyas as a gentleman adventurer was on land in a position very difficult to be settled though at sea he was as liable to be hanged as any other person on board and on the whole it was found expedient to patch the matter up so captain raleigh returning said that though admiral winter had doubtless taken umbrage at certain words of mr leighs yet that he had no doubt that mr leigh meant nothing thereby but what was consistent with the profession of a soldier and a gentleman and worthy both of himself and of the admiral  from which proposition amyas found it impossible to dissent whereon raleigh went back and informed winter that leigh had freely retracted his words and fully wiped off any imputation which mr winter might conceive to have been put upon him and so forth so winter returned and amyas said frankly enough  admiral winter i hope as a loyal soldier that you will understand thus far that naught which has passed tonight shall in any way prevent you finding me a forward and obedient servant to all your commands be they what they may and a supporter of your authority among the men and honor against the foe even with my life for i should be ashamed if private differences should ever prejudice by a grain the public weal  this was a great effort of oratory for amyas and he therefore in order to be safe by following precedent tried to talk as much as he could like sir richard grenville of course winter could answer nothing to it in spite of the plain hint of private differences but that he should not fail to show himself a captain worthy of so valiant and trusty a gentleman whereon the whole party turned their attention to the captive who thanks to will cary was by this time sitting up standing much in need of a handkerchief and looking about him having been unhelmed in a confused and doleful manner  take the gentleman to my tent said winter and let the surgeon see to him mr leigh who is he  an enemy but whether spaniard or italian i know not but he seemed somebody among them i thought the captain of a company he and i cut at each other twice or thrice at first and then lost each other and after that i came on him among the sandhills trying to rally his men and swearing like the mouth of the pit whereby i guess him a spaniard but his men ran so i brought him in  and how asked raleigh thou art giving us all the play but the murders and the marriages  why i bid him yield and he would not then i bid him run and he would not and it was too pitchdark for fighting so i took him by the ears and shook the wind out of him and so brought him in  shook the wind out of him cried cary amid the roar of laughter which followed dost know thou hast nearly wrung his neck in two his vizor was full of blood  he should have run or yielded then said amyas and getting up slipped off to find some ale and then to sleep comfortably in a dry burrow which he scratched out of a sandbank  the next morning as amyas was discussing a scanty breakfast of biscuit for provisions were running very short in camp raleigh came up to him  what eating thats more than i have done today  sit down and share then  nay lad i did not come abegging i have set some of my rogues to dig rabbits but as i live young colbrand you may thank your stars that you are alive today to eat poor young cheeksir john cheek the grammarians songot his quittance last night by a spanish pike rushing headlong on just as you did but have you seen your prisoner  no nor shall while he is in winters tent  why not then what quarrel have you against the admiral friend bobadil cannot you let francis drake fight his own battles without thrusting your head in between them  well that is good as if the quarrel was not just as much mine and every mans in the ship why when he left drake he left us all did he not  and what if he did let bygones be bygones is the rule of a christian and of a wise man too amyas here the man is at least safe home in favor and in power and a prudent youth will just hold his tongue mumchance and swim with the stream  but thats just what makes me mad to see this fellow after deserting us there in unknown seas win credit and rank at home here for being the first man who ever sailed back through the straits what had he to do with sailing back at all as well make the fox a knight for being the first that ever jumped down a jakes to escape the hounds the fiercer the flight the fouler the fear say i  amyas amyas thou art a hard hitter but a soft politician  i am no politician captain raleigh nor ever wish to be an honest mans my friend and a rogues my foe and ill tell both as much as long as i breathe  and die a poor saint said raleigh laughing but if winter invites you to his tent himself you wont refuse to come  why no considering his years and rank but he knows too well to do that  he knows too well not to do it said raleigh laughing as he walked away and verily in halfanhour came an invitation extracted of course from the admiral by raleighs silver tongue which amyas could not but obey  we all owe you thanks for last nights service sir said winter who had for some good reasons changed his tone your prisoner is found to be a gentleman of birth and experience and the leader of the assault last night he has already told us more than we had hoped for which also we are beholden to you and indeed my lord grey has been asking for you already  i have young sir said a quiet and lofty voice and amyas saw limping from the inner tent the proud and stately figure of the stern deputy lord grey of wilton a brave and wise man but with a naturally harsh temper which had been soured still more by the wound which had crippled him while yet a boy at the battle of leith he owed that limp to mary queen of scots and he did not forget the debt  i have been asking for you having heard from many both of your last nights prowess and of your conduct and courage beyond the promise of your years displayed in that evermemorable voyage which may well be ranked with the deeds of the ancient argonauts  amyas bowed low and the lord deputy went on you will needs wish to see your prisoner you will find him such a one as you need not be ashamed to have taken and as need not be ashamed to have been taken by you but here he is and will i doubt not answer as much for himself know each other better gentlemen both last night was an ill one for making acquaintances don guzman maria magdalena sotomayor de soto know the hidalgo amyas leigh  as he spoke the spaniard came forward still in his armor all save his head which was bound up in a handkerchief  he was an exceedingly tall and graceful personage of that sangre azul which marked high visigothic descent goldenhaired and fairskinned with hands as small and white as a womans his lips were delicate but thin and compressed closely at the corners of the mouth and his pale blue eye had a glassy dulness in spite of his beauty and his carriage amyas shrank from him instinctively and yet he could not help holding out his hand in return as the spaniard holding out his said languidly in most sweet and sonorous spanish  i kiss his hands and feet the senor speaks i am told my native tongue  i have that honor  then accept in it for i can better express myself therein than in english though i am not altogether ignorant of that witty and learned language the expression of my pleasure at having fallen into the hands of one so renowned in war and travel and of one also he added glancing at amyass giant bulk the vastness of whose strength beyond that of common mortality makes it no more shame for me to have been overpowered and carried away by him than if my captor had been a paladin of charlemagnes  honest amyas bowed and stammered a little thrown off his balance by the unexpected assurance and cool flattery of his prisoner but he said  if you are satisfied illustrious senor i am bound to be so i only trust that in my hurry and the darkness i have not hurt you unnecessarily  the don laughed a pretty little hollow laugh no kind senor my head i trust will after a few days have become united to my shoulders and for the present your company will make me forget any slight discomfort  pardon me senor but by this daylight i should have seen that armor before  i doubt it not senor as having been yourself also in the forefront of the battle said the spaniard with a proud smile  if i am right senor you are he who yesterday held up the standard after it was shot down  i do not deny that undeserved honor and i have to thank the courtesy of you and your countrymen for having permitted me to do so with impunity  ah i heard of that brave feat said the lord deputy you should consider yourself mr leigh honored by being enabled to show courtesy to such a warrior  how long this interchange of solemn compliments of which amyas was getting somewhat weary would have gone on i know not but at that moment raleigh entered hastily  my lord they have hung out a white flag and are calling for a parley  the spaniard turned pale and felt for his sword which was gone and then with a bitter laugh murmured to himselfas i expected  i am very sorry to hear it would to heaven they had simply fought it out said lord grey half to himself and then go captain raleigh and answer them that saving this gentlemans presence the laws of war forbid a parley with any who are leagued with rebels against their lawful sovereign  but what if they wish to treat for this gentlemans ransom  for their own more likely said the spaniard but tell them on my part senor that don guzman refuses to be ransomed and will return to no camp where the commanding officer unable to infect his captains with his own cowardice dishonors them against their will  you speak sharply senor said winter after raleigh had gone out  i have reason senor admiral as you will find i fear erelong  we shall have the honor of leaving you here for the present sir as admiral winters guest said the lord deputy  but not my sword it seems  pardon me senor but no one has deprived you of your sword said winter  i dont wish to pain you sir said amyas but i fear that we were both careless enough to leave it behind last night  a flash passed over the spaniards face which disclosed terrible depths of fury and hatred beneath that quiet mask as the summer lightning displays the black abysses of the thunderstorm but like the summer lightning it passed almost unseen and blandly as ever he answered  i can forgive you for such a neglect most valiant sir more easily than i can forgive myself farewell sir one who has lost his sword is no fit company for you and as amyas and the rest departed he plunged into the inner tent stamping and writhing gnawing his hands with rage and shame  as amyas came out on the battery yeo hailed him  master amyas hillo sir for the love of heaven tell me  what then  is his lordship stanch will he do the lords work faithfully root and branch or will he spare the amalekites  the latter i think old hipandthigh said amyas hurrying forward to hear the news from raleigh who appeared in sight once more  they ask to depart with bag and baggage said he when he came up  god do so to me and more also if they carry away a straw said lord grey make short work of it sir  i do not know how that will be my lord as i came up a captain shouted to me off the walls that there were mutineers and denying that he surrendered would have pulled down the flag of truce but the soldiers beat him off  a house divided against itself will not stand long gentlemen tell them that i give no conditions let them lay down their arms and trust in the bishop of rome who sent them hither and may come to save them if he wants them gunners if you see the white flag go down open your fire instantly captain raleigh we need your counsel here mr cary will you be my herald this time  a better protestant never went on a pleasanter errand my lord  so cary went and then ensued an argument as to what should be done with the prisoners in case of a surrender  i cannot tell whether my lord grey meant by offering conditions which the spaniards would not accept to force them into fighting the quarrel out and so save himself the responsibility of deciding on their fate or whether his mere natural stubbornness as well as his just indignation drove him on too far to retract but the council of war which followed was both a sad and a stormy one and one which he had reason to regret to his dying day what was to be done with the enemy they already outnumbered the english and some fifteen hundred of desmonds wild irish hovered in the forests round ready to side with the winning party or even to attack the english at the least sign of vacillation or fear they could not carry the spaniards away with them for they had neither shipping nor food not even handcuffs enough for them and as mackworth told winter when he proposed it the only plan was for him to make san josepho a present of his ships and swim home himself as he could to turn loose in ireland as captain touch urged on the other hand seven hundred such monsters of lawlessness cruelty and lust as spanish and italian condottieri were in those days was as fatal to their own safety as cruel to the wretched irish all the captains without exception followed on the same side what was to be done then asked lord grey impatiently would they have him murder them all in cold blood  and for a while every man knowing that it must come to that and yet not daring to say it till sir warham st leger the marshal of munster spoke out stoutly foreigners had been scoffing them too long and too truly with waging these irish wars as if they meant to keep them alive rather than end them mercy and faith to every irishman who would show mercy and faith was his motto but to invaders no mercy ireland was englands vulnerable point it might be some day her ruin a terrible example must be made of those who dare to touch the sore rather pardon the spaniards for landing in the thames than in irelandtill lord grey became much excited and turning as a last hope to raleigh asked his opinion but raleighs silver tongue was that day not on the side of indulgence he skilfully recapitulated the arguments of his fellowcaptains improving them as he went on till each worthy soldier was surprised to find himself so much wiser a man than he had thought and finished by one of his rapid and passionate perorations upon his favorite themethe west indian cruelties of the spaniards    by which great tracts and fair countries are now utterly stripped of inhabitants by heavy bondage and torments unspeakable oh witless islanders said he apostrophizing the irish would to heaven that you were here to listen to me what other fate awaits you if this viper which you are so ready to take into your bosom should be warmed to life but to groan like the indians slaves to the spaniard but to perish like the indians by heavy burdens cruel chains plunder and ravishment scourged racked roasted stabbed sawn in sunder cast to feed the dogs as simple and more righteous peoples have perished ere now by millions and what else i say had been the fate of ireland had this invasion prospered which god has now by our weak hands confounded and brought to naught shall we then answer it my lord either to our conscience our god or our queen if we shall set loose men not one of whom i warrant but is stained with murder on murder to go and fill up the cup of their iniquity among these silly sheep have not their native wolves their barbarous chieftains shorn peeled and slaughtered them enough already but we must add this pack of foreign wolves to the number of their tormentors and fit the desmond with a bodyguard of seven yea seven hundred devils worse than himself nay rather let us do violence to our own human nature and show ourselves in appearance rigorous that we may be kind indeed lest while we presume to be overmerciful to the guilty we prove ourselves to be overcruel to the innocent  captain raleigh captain raleigh said lord grey the blood of these men be on your head  it ill befits your lordship answered raleigh to throw on your subordinates the blame of that which your reason approves as necessary  i should have thought sir that one so noted for ambition as captain raleigh would have been more careful of the favor of that queen for whose smiles he is said to be so longing a competitor if you have not yet been of her counsels sir i can tell you you are not likely to be she will be furious when she hears of this cruelty  lord grey had lost his temper but raleigh kept his and answered quietly  her majesty shall at least not find me among the number of those who prefer her favor to her safety and abuse to their own profit that overtenderness and mercifulness of heart which is the only blemish and yet rather like a mole on a fair cheek but a new beauty in her manifold perfections  at this juncture cary returned  my lord said he in some confusion i have proposed your terms but the captains still entreat for some mitigation and to tell you truth one of them has insisted on accompanying me hither to plead his cause himself  i will not see him sir who is he  his name is sebastian of modena my lord  sebastian of modena what think you gentlemen may we make an exception in favor of so famous a soldier  so villainous a cutthroat said zouch to raleigh under his breath  all however were for speaking with so famous a man and in came in full armor a short bullnecked italian evidently of immense strength of the true caesar borgia stamp  will you please to be seated sir said lord grey coldly  i kiss your hands most illustrious but i do not sit in an enemys camp ha my friend zouch how has your signoria fared since we fought side by side at lepanto so you too are here sitting in council on the hanging of me  what is your errand sir time is short said the lord deputy  corpo di bacco it has been long enough all the morning for my rascals have kept me and my friend the colonel hercules whom you know doubtless prisoners in our tents at the pikes point my lord deputy i have but a few words i shall thank you to take every soldier in the fortitalian spaniard and irishand hang them up as high as haman for a set of mutinous cowards with the archtraitor san josepho at their head  i am obliged to you for your offer sir and shall deliberate presently as to whether i shall not accept it  but as for us captains really your excellency must consider that we are gentlemen born and give us either buena querra as the spaniards say or a fair chance for life and so to my business  stay sir answer this first have you or yours any commission to show either from the king of spain or any other potentate  never a one but the cause of heaven and our own swords and with them my lord we are ready to meet any gentlemen of your camp man to man with our swords only halfway between your leaguer and ours and i doubt not that your lordship will see fair play will any gentleman accept so civil an offer there sits a tall youth in that corner who would suit me very well will any fit my gallant comrades with halfanhours punto and stoccado  there was a silence all looking at the lord deputy whose eyes were kindling in a very ugly way  no answer then i must proceed to exhortation so will that be sufficient  and walking composedly across the tent the fearless ruffian quietly stooped down and smote amyas leigh full in the face  up sprang amyas heedless of all the august assembly and with a single buffet felled him to the earth  excellent said he rising unabashed i can always trust my instinct i knew the moment i saw him that he was a cavalier worth letting blood now sir your sword and harness and i am at your service outside  the solemn and sententious englishmen were altogether taken aback by the italians impudence but zouch settled the matter  most noble captain will you be pleased to recollect a certain little occurrence at messina in the year 1575 for if you do not i do and beg to inform this gentleman that you are unworthy of his sword and had you unluckily for you been an englishman would have found the fashions of our country so different from your own that you would have been then hanged sir and probably may be so still  the italians sword flashed out in a moment but lord grey interfered  no fighting here gentlemen that may wait and what is more shall wait tillstrike their swords down raleigh mackworth strike their swords down colonel sebastian you will be pleased to return as you came in safety having lost nothing as i frankly tell you you have gained nothing by your wild bearing here we shall proceed to deliberate on your fate  i trust my lord said amyas that you will spare this braggarts life at least for a day or two for in spite of captain zouchs warning i must have to do with him yet or my cheek will rise up in judgment against me at the last day  well spoken lad said the colonel as he swung out so worth a reprieve by this sword to have one more rapierrattle before the gallows then i take back no further answer my lord deputy not even our swords our virgin blades signor the soldiers cherished bride shall we go forth weeping widowers and leave to strange embrace the lovely steel  none sir by heaven said he waxing wroth do you come hither pirates as you are to dictate terms upon a foreign soil is it not enough to have set up here the spanish flag and claimed the land of ireland as the popes gift to the spaniard violated the laws of nations and the solemn treaties of princes under color of a mad superstition  superstition my lord nothing less believe a philosopher who has not said a pater or an ave for seven years past at least quod tango credo is my motto and though i am bound to say under pain of the inquisition that the most holy father the pope has given this land of ireland to his most catholic majesty the king of spain queen elizabeth having forfeited her title to it by heresywhy my lord i believe it as little as you do i believe that ireland would have been mine if i had won it i believe religiously that it is not mine now i have lost it what is is and a fig for priests today to thee tomorrow to me addio and out he swung  there goes a most gallant rascal said the lord deputy  and a most rascally gallant said zouch the murder of his own page of which i gave him a remembrancer is among the least of his sins  and now captain raleigh said lord grey as you have been so earnest in preaching this butchery i have a right to ask none but you to practise it  raleigh bit his lip and replied by the quip courteous  i am at least a man my lord who thinks it shame to allow others to do that which i dare not do myself  lord grey might probably have returned the countercheck quarrelsome had not mackworth risen  and i my lord being in that matter at least one of captain raleighs kidney will just go with him to see that he takes no harm by being bold enough to carry out an ugly business and serving these rascals as their countrymen served mr oxenham  i bid you good morning then gentlemen though i cannot bid you god speed said lord grey and sitting down again covered his face with his hands and to the astonishment of all bystanders burst say the chroniclers into tears  amyas followed raleigh out the latter was pale but determined and very wroth against the deputy  does the man take me for a hangman said he that he speaks to me thus but such is the way of the great if you neglect your duty they haul you over the coals if you do it you must do it on your own responsibility farewell amyas you will not shrink from me as a butcher when i return  god forbid but how will you do it  march one company in and drive them forth and let the other cut them down as they come outpah                          it was done right or wrong it was done the shrieks and curses had died away and the fort del oro was a red shambles which the soldiers were trying to cover from the sight of heaven and earth by dragging the bodies into the ditch and covering them with the ruins of the rampart while the irish who had beheld from the woods that awful warning fled trembling into the deepest recesses of the forest it was done and it never needed to be done again the hint was severe but it was sufficient many years passed before a spaniard set foot again in ireland  the spanish and italian officers were spared and amyas had don guzman maria magdalena sotomayor de soto duly adjudged to him as his prize by right of war he was of course ready enough to fight sebastian of modena but lord grey forbade the duel blood enough had been shed already the next question was where to bestow don guzman till his ransom should arrive and as amyas could not well deliver the gallant don into the safe custody of mrs leigh at burrough and still less into that of frank at court he was fain to write to sir richard grenville and ask his advice and in the meanwhile keep the spaniard with him upon parole which he frankly gavesaying that as for running away he had nowhere to run to and as for joining the irish he had no mind to turn pig and amyas found him as shall be hereafter told pleasant company enough but one morning raleigh entered  i have done you a good turn leigh if you think it one i have talked st leger into making you my lieutenant and giving you the custody of a right pleasant hermitagesome castle shackatory or other in the midst of a big bog where time will run swift and smooth with you between hunting wild irish snaring snipes and drinking yourself drunk with usquebaugh over a turf fire  ill go quoth amyas anything for work so he went and took possession of his lieutenancy and his black robber tower and there passed the rest of the winter fighting or hunting all day and chatting and reading all the evening with senor don guzman who like a good soldier of fortune made himself thoroughly at home and a general favorite with the soldiers  at first indeed his spanish pride and stateliness and amyass english taciturnity kept the two apart somewhat but they soon began if not to trust at least to like each other and don guzman told amyas bit by bit who he was of what an ancient house and of what a poor one and laughed over the very small chance of his ransom being raised and the certainty that at least it could not come for a couple of years seeing that the only de soto who had a penny to spare was a fat old dean at st yago de leon in the caracas at which place don guzman had been born this of course led to much talk about the west indies and the don was as much interested to find that amyas had been one of drakes worldfamous crew as amyas was to find that his captive was the grandson of none other than that most terrible of manhunters don ferdinando de soto the conqueror of florida of whom amyas had read many a time in las casas as the captain of tyrants the notoriousest and most experimented amongst them that have done the most hurts mischiefs and destructions in many realms and often enough his blood boiled and he had much ado to recollect that the speaker was his guest as don guzman chatted away about his grandfathers hunts of innocent women and children murders of caciques and burnings alive of guides pour encourager les autres without seemingly the least feeling that the victims were human beings or subjects for human pity anything in short but heathen dogs enemies of god servants of the devil to be used by the christian when he needed and when not needed killed down as cumberers of the ground but don guzman was a most finished gentleman nevertheless and told many a good story of the indies and told it well and over and above his stories he had among his baggage two booksthe one antonio galvanos discoveries of the world a mine of winter evening amusement to amyas and the other a manuscript book which perhaps it had been well for amyas had he never seen for it was none other than a sort of rough journal which don guzman had kept as a lad when he went down with the adelantado gonzales ximenes de casada from peru to the river of amazons to look for the golden country of el dorado and the city of manoa which stands in the midst of the white lake and equals or surpasses in glory even the palace of the inca huaynacapac all the vessels of whose house and kitchen are of gold and silver and in his wardrobe statues of gold which seemed giants and figures in proportion and bigness of all the beasts birds trees and herbs of the earth and the fishes of the water and ropes budgets chests and troughs of gold yea and a garden of pleasure in an island near puna where they went to recreate themselves when they would take the air of the sea which had all kind of garden herbs flowers and trees of gold and silver of an invention and magnificence till then never seen  now the greater part of this treasure and be it remembered that these wonders were hardly exaggerated and that there were many men alive then who had beheld them as they had worse things with their corporal and mortal eyes was hidden by the indians when pizarro conquered peru and slew atahuallpa son of huaynacapac at whose death it was said one of the incas younger brothers fled out of peru and taking with him a great army vanquished all that tract which lieth between the great rivers of amazons and baraquan otherwise called maranon and orenoque  there he sits to this day beside the golden lake in the golden city which is in breadth a three days journey covered he and his court with gold dust from head to foot waiting for the fulfilment of the ancient prophecy which was written in the temple of caxamarca where his ancestors worshipped of old that heroes shall come out of the west and lead him back across the forests to the kingdom of peru and restore him to the glory of his forefathers  golden phantom so possible so probable to imaginations which were yet reeling before the actual and veritable prodigies of peru mexico and the east indies golden phantom which has cost already the lives of thousands and shall yet cost more from diego de ordas and juan corteso and many another who went forth on the quest by the andes and by the orinoco and by the amazons antonio sedenno with his ghastly caravan of manacled indians on whose dead carcasses the tigers being fleshed assaulted the spaniards augustine delgado who came to a cacique who entertained him with all kindness and gave him beside much gold and slaves three nymphs very beautiful which bare the names of three provinces guanba gotoguane and maiarare to requite which manifold courtesies he carried off not only all the gold but all the indians he could seize and took them in irons to cubagua and sold them for slaves after which delgado was shot in the eye by an indian of which hurt he died pedro dorsua who found the cinnamon forests of loxas whom his men murdered and afterwards beheaded lady anes his wife who forsook not her lord in all his travels unto death and many another who has vanished with valiant comrades at his back into the green gulfs of the primaeval forests never to emerge again golden phantom mandevouring whose maw is never satiate with souls of heroes fatal to spain more fatal still to england upon that shameful day when the last of elizabeths heroes shall lay down his head upon the block nominally for having believed what all around him believed likewise till they found it expedient to deny it in order to curry favor with the crowned cur who betrayed him really because he alone dared to make one last protest in behalf of liberty and protestantism against the incoming night of tyranny and superstition little thought amyas as he devoured the pages of that manuscript that he was laying a snare for the life of the man whom next to drake and grenville he most admired on earth  but don guzman on the other hand seemed to have an instinct that that book might be a fatal gift to his captor for one day ere amyas had looked into it he began questioning the don about el dorado whereon don guzman replied with one of those smiles of his which as amyas said afterwards was so abominably like a sneer that he had often hard work to keep his hands off the man  ah you have been eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge senor well if you have any ambition to follow many another brave captain to the pit i know no shorter or easier path than is contained in that little book  i have never opened your book said amyas your private manuscripts are no concern of mine but my man who recovered your baggage read part of it knowing no better and now you are at liberty to tell me as little as you like  the man it should be said was none other than salvation yeo who had attached himself by this time inseparably to amyas in quality of bodyguard and as was common enough in those days had turned soldier for the nonce and taken under his patronage two or three rusty bases swivels and falconets fourpounders which grinned harmlessly enough from the tower top across the cheerful expanse of bog  amyas once asked him how he reconciled this irish sojourn with his vow to find his little maid yeo shook his head  i cant tell sir but theres something that makes me always to think of you when i think of her and thats often enough the lord knows whether it is that i bent to find the dear without your help or whether it is your pleasant face puts me in mind of hers or what i cant tell but dont you part me from you sir for im like ruth and where you lodge i lodge and where you go i go and where you diethough i shall die many a year firstthere ill die i hope and trust for i cant abear you out of my sight and thats the truth thereof  so yeo remained with amyas while cary went elsewhere with sir warham st leger and the two friends met seldom for many months so that amyass only companion was don guzman who as he grew more familiar and more careless about what he said and did in his captors presence often puzzled and scandalized him by his waywardness fits of deep melancholy alternated with bursts of spanish boastfulness utterly astonishing to the modest and soberminded englishman who would often have fancied him inspired by usquebaugh had he not had ocular proof of his extreme abstemiousness  miserable said he one night in one of these fits and have i not a right to be miserable why should i not curse the virgin and all the saints and die i have not a friend not a ducat on earth not even a swordhell and the furies it was my all the only bequest i ever had from my father and i lived by it and earned by it two years ago i had as pretty a sum of gold as cavalier could wishand now  what is become of it then i cannot hear that our men plundered you of any  your men no senor what fifty men dared not have done one woman did a painted patched fucused periwigged bolstered charybdis cannibal megaera lamia why did i ever go near that cursed naples the common sewer of europe whose women i believe would be swallowed up by vesuvius tomorrow if it were not that belphegor is afraid of their making the pit itself too hot to hold him well sir she had all of mine and more and when all was gone in wine and dice woodcocks brains and ortolans tongues i met the witch walking with another man i had a sword and a dagger i gave him the first though the dog fought well enough to give him his due and her the second left them lying across each other and fled for my lifeand here i am after twenty years of fighting from the levant to the orellanafor i began ere i had a hair on my chinand this is the endno it is not ill have that el dorado yet the adelantado made berreo when he gave him his daughter swear that he would hunt for it through life and deathwell see who finds it first he or i hes a bungler orsua was a bunglerpooh cortes and pizarro well see whether there are not as good castilians as they left still i can do it senor i know a track a plan over the llanos is the road and ill be emperor of manoa yetpossess the jewels of all the incas and gold gold pizarro was a beggar to what i will be  conceive sir he broke forth during another of these peacock fits as amyas and he were riding along the hillside conceive with forty chosen cavaliers what need of more i present myself before the golden king trembling amid his myriad guards at the new miracle of the mailed centaurs of the west and without dismounting i approach his throne lift the crucifix which hangs around my neck and pressing it to my lips present it for the adoration of the idolater and give him his alternative that which gayferos and the cid my ancestors offered the soldan and the moorbaptism or death he hesitates perhaps smiles scornfully upon my little band i answer him by deeds as don ferdinando my illustrious grandfather answered atahuallpa at peru in sight of all his court and camp  with your lancepoint as gayferos did the soldan asked amyas amused  no sir persuasion first for the salvation of a soul is at stake not with the lancepoint but the spur sir thus  and striking his heels into his horses flanks he darted off at full speed  the spanish traitor shouted yeo hes going to escape shall we shoot sir shall we shoot  for heavens sake no said amyas looking somewhat blank nevertheless for he much doubted whether the whole was not a ruse on the part of the spaniard and he knew how impossible it was for his fifteen stone of flesh to give chase to the spaniards twelve but he was soon reassured the spaniard wheeled round towards him and began to put the rough hackney through all the paces of the manege with a grace and skill which won applause from the beholders  thus he shouted waving his hand to amyas between his curvets and caracoles did my illustrious grandfather exhibit to the paynim emperor the prowess of a castilian cavalier thusand thusand thus at last he dashed up to his very feet as i to yours and bespattering that unbaptized visage with his christian bridle foam pulled up his charger on his haunches thus  and as was to be expected from a blown irish garron on a peaty irish hillside down went the hapless hackney on his tail away went his heels a yard in front of him and ere don guzman could avoid his selle horse and man rolled over into neighboring boghole  after pride comes a fall quoth yeo with unmoved visage as he lugged him out  and what would you do with the emperor at last asked amyas when the don had been scrubbed somewhat clean with a bunch of rushes kill him as your grandfather did atahuallpa  my grandfather answered the spaniard indignantly was one of those who to their eternal honor protested to the last against that most cruel and unknightly massacre he could be terrible to the heathen but he kept his plighted word sir and taught me to keep mine as you have seen today  i have senor said amyas you might have given us the slip easily enough just now and did not pardon me if i have offended you  the spaniard who after all was cross principally with himself and the unlucky mares son as the old romances have it which had played him so scurvy a trick was all smiles again forthwith and amyas as they chatted on could not help asking him next  i wonder why you are so frank about your own intentions to an enemy like me who will surely forestall you if he can  sir a spaniard needs no concealment and fears no rivalry he is the soldier of the cross and in it he conquers like constantine of old not that you english are not very heroes but you have not sir and you cannot have who have forsworn our lady and the choir of saints the same divine protection the same celestial mission which enables the catholic cavalier singlehanded to chase a thousand paynims  and don guzman crossed himself devoutly and muttered halfadozen ave marias in succession while amyas rode silently by his side utterly puzzled at this strange compound of shrewdness with fanaticism of perfect highbreeding with a boastfulness which in an englishman would have been the sure mark of vulgarity  at last came a letter from sir richard grenville complimenting amyas on his success and promotion bearing a long and courtly message to don guzman whom grenville had known when he was in the mediterranean at the battle of lepanto and offering to receive him as his own guest at bideford till his ransom should arrive a proposition which the spaniard who of course was getting sufficiently tired of the irish bogs could not but gladly accept and one of winters ships returning to england in the spring of 1581 delivered duly at the quay of bideford the body of don guzman maria magdalena raleigh after forming for that summer one of the triumvirate by which munster was governed after ormonds departure at last got his wish and departed for england and the court and amyas was left alone with the snipes and yellow mantles for two more weary years    chapter x  how the mayor of bideford baited his hook with his own flesh       and therewith he blent and cried ha      as though he had been stricken to the harte                                palamon and arcite  so it befell to chaucers knight in prison and so it befell also to don guzman and it befell on this wise  he settled down quietly enough at bideford on his parole in better quarters than he had occupied for many a day and took things as they came like a true soldier of fortune till after he had been with grenville hardly a month old salterne the mayor came to supper  now don guzman however much he might be puzzled at first at our strange english ways of asking burghers and such lowbred folk to eat and drink above the salt in the company of noble persons was quite gentleman enough to know that richard grenville was gentleman enough to do only what was correct and according to the customs and proprieties so after shrugging the shoulders of his spirit he submitted to eat and drink at the same board with a tradesman who sat at a desk and made up ledgers and took apprentices and hearing him talk with grenville neither unwisely nor in a vulgar fashion actually before the evening was out condescended to exchange words with him himself whereon he found him a very prudent and courteous person quite aware of the spaniards superior rank and making him feel in every sentence that he was aware thereof and yet holding his own opinion and asserting his own rights as a wise elder in a fashion which the spaniard had only seen before among the merchant princes of genoa and venice  at the end of supper salterne asked grenville to do his humble roof the honor etc etc of supping with him the next evening and then turning to the don said quite frankly that he knew how great a condescension it would be on the part of a nobleman of spain to sit at the board of a simple merchant but that if the spaniard deigned to do him such a favor he would find that the cheer was fit enough for any rank whatsoever the company might be which invitation don guzman being on the whole glad enough of anything to amuse him graciously condescended to accept and gained thereby an excellent supper and if he had chosen to drink it much good wine  now mr salterne was of course as a wise merchant as ready as any man for an adventure to foreign parts as was afterwards proved by his great exertions in the settlement of virginia and he was therefore equally ready to rack the brains of any guest whom he suspected of knowing anything concerning strange lands and so he thought no shame first to try to loose his guests tongue by much good sack and next to ask him prudent and wellconcocted questions concerning the spanish main peru the moluccas china the indies and all parts  the first of which schemes failed for the spaniard was as abstemious as any monk and drank little but water the second succeeded not over well for the spaniard was as cunning as any fox and answered little but wind  in the midst of which tonguefence in came the rose of torridge looking as beautiful as usual and hearing what they were upon added artlessly enough her questions to her fathers to her don guzman could not but answer and without revealing any very important commercial secrets gave his host and his hosts daughter a very amusing evening  now little eros though spirits like frank leighs may choose to call him as perhaps he really is to them the eldest of the gods and the son of jove and venus yet is reported by other equally good authorities as burton has set forth in his anatomy of melancholy to be after all only the child of idleness and fulness of bread to which scandalous calumny the thoughts of don guzmans heart gave at least a certain color for he being idle as captives needs must be and also full of bread for sir richard kept a very good table had already looked round for mere amusements sake after some one with whom to fall in love lady grenville as nearest was i blush to say thought of first but the spaniard was a man of honor and sir richard his host so he put away from his mind with a selfdenial on which he plumed himself much the pleasure of a chase equally exciting to his pride and his love of danger as for the sinfulness of the said chase he of course thought no more of that than other southern europeans did then or than i blush again to have to say it the english did afterwards in the days of the stuarts nevertheless he had put lady grenville out of his mind and so left room to take rose salterne into it not with any distinct purpose of wronging her but as i said before half to amuse himself and half too because he could not help it for there was an innocent freshness about the rose of torridge fond as she was of being admired which was new to him and most attractive the train of the peacock as he said to himself and yet the heart of the dove made so charming a combination that if he could have persuaded her to love no one but him perhaps he might become fool enough to love no one but her and at that thought he was seized with a very panic of prudence and resolved to keep out of her way and yet the days ran slowly and lady grenville when at home was stupid enough to talk and think about nothing but her husband and when she went to stow and left the don alone in one corner of the great house at bideford what could he do but lounge down to the buttgardens to show off his fine black cloak and fine black feather see the shooting have a game or two of rackets with the youngsters a game or two of bowls with the elders and get himself invited home to supper by mr salterne  and there of course he had it all his own way and ruled the roast which he was fond enough of doing right royally not only on account of his rank but because he had something to say worth hearing as a travelled man for those times were the daydawn of english commerce and not a merchant in bideford or in all england but had his imagination all on fire with projects of discoveries companies privileges patents and settlements with gallant rivalry of the brave adventures of sir edward osborne and his new london company of turkey merchants with the privileges just granted by the sultan murad khan to the english with the worthy levant voyages of roger bodenham in the great bark aucher and of john fox and lawrence aldersey and john rule and with hopes from the vast door for mediterranean trade which the crushing of the venetian power at famagusta in cyprus and the alliance made between elizabeth and the grand turk had just thrown open so not a word could fall from the spaniard about the mediterranean but took root at once in right fertile soil besides master edmund hogan had been on a successful embassy to the emperor of morocco john hawkins and george fenner had been to guinea and with the latter mr walter wren a bideford man and had traded there for musk and civet gold and grain and african news was becoming almost as valuable as west indian moreover but two months before had gone from london captain hare in the bark minion for brazil and a company of adventurers with him with sheffield hardware and devonshire and northern kersies hollands and manchester cottons for there was a great opening for english goods by the help of one john whithall who had married a spanish heiress and had an ingenio and slaves in santos dont smile reader or despise the day of small things and those who sowed the seed whereof you reap the mighty harvest in the meanwhile drake had proved not merely the possibility of plundering the american coasts but of establishing an east indian trade frobisher and davis worthy forefathers of our parrys and franklins had begun to bore their way upward through the northern ice in search of a passage to china which should avoid the dangers of the spanish seas and anthony jenkinson not the least of english travellers had in sixandtwenty years of travel in behalf of the muscovite company penetrated into not merely russia and the levant but persia and armenia bokhara tartary siberia and those waste arctic shores where thirty years before the brave sir hugh willoughby            in arzina caught      perished with all his crew  everywhere english commerce under the genial sunshine of elizabeths wise rule was spreading and taking root and as don guzman talked with his new friends he soon saw for he was shrewd enough that they belonged to a race which must be exterminated if spain intended to become as she did intend the mistress of the world and that it was not enough for spain to have seized in the popes name the whole new world and claimed the exclusive right to sail the seas of america not enough to have crushed the hollanders not enough to have degraded the venetians into her bankers and the genoese into her mercenaries not enough to have incorporated into herself with the kingdom of portugal the whole east indian trade of portugal while these fierce islanders remained to assert with cunning policy and texts of scripture and if they failed with sharp shot and cold steel free seas and free trade for all the nations upon earth he saw it and his countrymen saw it too and therefore the spanish armada came but of that hereafter and don guzman knew also by hard experience that these same islanders who sat in salternes parlor talking broad devon through their noses were no mere counters of money and hucksters of goods but men who though they thoroughly hated fighting and loved making money instead could fight upon occasion after a very dogged and terrible fashion as well as the bluest blood in spain and who sent out their merchant ships armed up to the teeth and filled with men who had been trained from childhood to use those arms and had orders to use them without mercy if either spaniard portugal or other created being dared to stop their moneymaking and one evening he waxed quite mad when after having civilly enough hinted that if englishmen came where they had no right to come they might find themselves sent back again he was answered by a volley of  well see that sir  depends on who says no right  you found might right said another when you claimed the indian seas we may find right might when we try them  try them then gentlemen by all means if it shall so please your worships and find the sacred flag of spain as invincible as ever was the roman eagle  we have sir did you ever hear of francis drake  or of george fenner and the portugals at the azores one against seven  or of john hawkins at st juan dulloa  you are insolent burghers said don guzman and rose to go  sir said old salterne as you say we are burghers and plain men and some of us have forgotten ourselves a little perhaps we must beg you to forgive our want of manners and to put it down to the strength of my wine for insolent we never meant to be especially to a noble gentleman and a foreigner  but the don would not be pacified and walked out calling himself an ass and a blinkard for having demeaned himself to such a company forgetting that he had brought it on himself  salterne prompted by the great devil mammon came up to him next day and begged pardon again promising moreover that none of those who had been so rude should be henceforth asked to meet him if he would deign to honor his house once more and the don actually was appeased and went there the very next evening sneering at himself the whole time for going  fool that i am that girl has bewitched me i believe go i must and eat my share of dirt for her sake  so he went and cunningly enough hinted to old salterne that he had taken such a fancy to him and felt so bound by his courtesy and hospitality that he might not object to tell him things which he would not mention to every one for that the spaniards were not jealous of single traders but of any general attempt to deprive them of their hardearned wealth that however in the meanwhile there were plenty of opportunities for one man here and there to enrich himself etc  old salterne shrewd as he was had his weak point and the spaniard had touched it and delighted at this opportunity of learning the mysteries of the spanish monopoly he often actually set rose on to draw out the don without a fear so blind does money make men lest she might be herself drawn in for first he held it as impossible that she would think of marrying a popish spaniard as of marrying the man in the moon and next as impossible that he would think of marrying a burghers daughter as of marrying a negress and trusted that the religion of the one and the family pride of the other would keep them as separate as beings of two different species and as for love without marriage if such a possibility ever crossed him the thought was rendered absurd on roses part by her virtue on which the old roan and rightly would have staked every farthing he had on earth and on the dons part by a certain human fondness for the continuity of the carotid artery and the parts adjoining for which and that not altogether justly seeing that don guzman cared as little for his own life as he did for his neighbors mr salterne gave him credit and so it came to pass that for weeks and months the merchants house was the dons favorite haunt and he saw the rose of torridge daily and the rose of torridge heard him  and as for her poor child she had never seen such a man he had or seemed to have all the highbred grace of frank and yet he was cast in a manlier mould he had just enough of his nations proud selfassertion to make a woman bow before him as before a superior and yet tact enough to let it very seldom degenerate into that boastfulness of which the spaniards were then so often and so justly accused he had marvels to tell by flood and field as many and more than amyas and he told them with a grace and an eloquence of which modest simple old amyas possessed nothing besides he was on the spot and the leighs were not nor indeed were any of her old lovers and what could she do but amuse herself with the only person who came to hand  so thought in time more ladies than she for the country the north of it at least was all but bare just then of young gallants what with the netherland wars and the irish wars and the spaniard became soon welcome at every house for many a mile round and made use of his welcome so freely and received so much unwonted attention from fair young dames that his head might have been a little turned and rose salterne have thereby escaped had not sir richard delicately given him to understand that in spite of the free and easy manners of english ladies brothers were just as jealous and ladies honors at least as inexpugnable as in the land of demureness and duennas don guzman took the hint well enough and kept on good terms with the country gentlemen as with their daughters and to tell the truth the cunning soldier of fortune found his account in being intimate with all the ladies he could in order to prevent old salterne from fancying that he had any peculiar predilection for mistress rose  nevertheless mr salternes parlor being nearest to him still remained his most common haunt where while he discoursed for hours about       antres vast and deserts idle      and of the cannibals that each other eat      of anthropophagi and men whose heads      do grow beneath their shoulders  to the boundless satisfaction of poor roses fancy he took care to season his discourse with scraps of mercantile information which kept the old merchant always expectant and hankering for more and made it worth his while to ask the spaniard in again and again  and his stories certainly were worth hearing he seemed to have been everywhere and to have seen everything born in peru and sent home to spain at ten years old brought up in italy a soldier in the levant an adventurer to the east indies again in america first in the islands and then in mexico then back again to spain and thence to rome and thence to ireland shipwrecked captive among savages looking down the craters of volcanoes hanging about all the courts of europe fighting turks indians lions elephants alligators and what not at fiveandthirty he had seen enough for three lives and knew how to make the best of what he had seen  he had shared as a lad in the horrors of the memorable siege of famagusta and had escaped he hardly knew himself how from the hands of the victorious turks and from the certainty if he escaped being flayed alive or impaled as most of the captive officers were of ending his life as a janissary at the sultans court he had been at the battle of the three kings had seen stukely borne down by a hundred lances unconquered even in death and had held upon his knee the head of the dying king of portugal  and now as he said to rose one evening what had he left on earth but a heart trampled as hard as the pavement whom had he to love who loved him he had nothing for which to live but fame and even that was denied to him a prisoner in a foreign land  had he no kindred then asked pitying rose  my two sisters are in a conventthey had neither money nor beauty so they are dead to me my brother is a jesuit so he is dead to me my father fell by the hands of indians in mexico my mother a penniless widow is companion duennawhatsoever they may choose to call itcarrying fans and lapdogs for some princess or other there in seville of no better blood than herself and idevil i have lost even my swordand so fares the house of de soto  don guzman of course intended to be pitied and pitied he was accordingly and then he would turn the conversation and begin telling italian stories after the italian fashion according to his auditory the pathetic ones when rose was present the racy ones when she was absent so that rose had wept over the sorrows of juliet and desdemona and over many another moving tale long before they were ever enacted on an english stage and the ribs of the bideford worthies had shaken to many a jest which cinthio and bandellos ghosts must come and make for themselves over again if they wish them to be remembered for i shall lend them no shove toward immortality  and so on and so on what need of more words before a year was out rose salterne was far more in love with don guzman than he with her and both suspected each others mind though neither hinted at the truth she from fear and he to tell the truth from sheer spanish pride of blood for he soon began to find out that he must compromise that blood by marrying the heretic burghers daughter or all his labor would be thrown away  he had seen with much astonishment and then practised with much pleasure that graceful old english fashion of saluting every lady on the cheek at meeting which like the old dutch fashion of asking young ladies out to feasts without their mothers used to give such cause of brutal calumny and scandal to the coarse minds of romish visitors from the continent and he had seen too fuming with jealous rage more than one bideford burgher redolent of onions profane in that way the velvet cheek of rose salterne  so one day he offered his salute in like wise but he did it when she was alone for something within perhaps a guilty conscience whispered that it might be hardly politic to make the proffer in her fathers presence however to his astonishment he received a prompt though quiet rebuff  no sir you should know that my cheek is not for you  why said he stifling his anger it seems free enough to every counterjumper in the town  was it love or simple innocence which made her answer apologetically  true don guzman but they are my equals  and i  you are a nobleman sir and should recollect that you are one  well said he forcing a sneer it is a strange taste to prefer the shopkeeper  prefer said she forcing a laugh in her turn it is a mere form among us they are nothing to me i can tell you  and i then less than nothing  rose turned very red but she had nerve to answer  and why should you be anything to me you have condescended too much sir already to us in giving us many amany a pleasant evening you must condescend no further you wrong yourself sir and me too no sir not a step neareri will not a salute between equals means nothing but between you and mei vow sir if you do not leave me this moment i will complain to my father  do so madam i care as little for your fathers anger as you for my misery  cruel cried rose trembling from head to foot  i love you madam cried he throwing himself at her feet i adore you never mention differences of rank to me more for i have forgotten them forgotten all but love all but you madam my light my lodestar my princess my goddess you see where my pride is gone remember i plead as a suppliant a beggarthough one who may be one day a prince a king ay and a prince now a very lucifer of pride to all except to you to you a wretch who grovels at your feet and cries have mercy on me on my loneliness my homelessness my friendlessness ah rose madam i should have said forgive the madness of my passion you know not the heart which you break cold northerns you little dream how a spaniard can love love worship rather as i worship you madam as i bless the captivity which brought me the sight of you and the ruin which first made me rich is it possible saints and virgin do my own tears deceive my eyes or are there tears too in those radiant orbs  go sir cried poor rose recovering herself suddenly and let me never see you more and as a last chance for life she darted out of the room  your slave obeys you madam and kisses your hands and feet forever and a day said the cunning spaniard and drawing himself up walked serenely out of the house while she poor fool peeped after him out of her window upstairs and her heart sank within her as she watched his jaunty and careless air  how much of that rhapsody of his was honest how much premeditated i cannot tell though she poor child began to fancy that it was all a set speech when she found that he had really taken her at her word and set foot no more within her fathers house so she reproached herself for the cruelest of women settled that if he died she should be his murderess watched for him to pass at the window in hopes that he might look up and then hid herself in terror the moment he appeared round the corner and so forth and so forthone lovemaking is very like another and has been so i suppose since that first blessed marriage in paradise when adam and eve made no love at all but found it readymade for them from heaven and really it is fiddling while rome is burning to spend more pages over the sorrows of poor little rose salterne while the destinies of europe are hanging on the marriage between elizabeth and anjou and sir humphrey gilbert is stirring heaven and earth and devonshire of course as the most important portion of the said earth to carry out his dormant patent which will give to england in due time we are not jesting now newfoundland nova scotia and canada and the northern states and to humphrey gilbert himself something better than a new world namely another world and a crown of glory therein which never fades away    chapter xi  how eustace leigh met the popes legate       misguided rash intruding fool farewell      thou seest to be too busy is some danger                                          hamlet  it is the spring of 15823 the gray march skies are curdling hard and high above black mountain peaks the keen march wind is sweeping harsh and dry across a dreary sheet of bog still red and yellow with the stains of winter frost one brown knoll alone breaks the waste and on it a few leafless windclipt oaks stretch their mossgrown arms like giant hairy spiders above a desolate pool which crisps and shivers in the biting breeze while from beside its brink rises a mournful cry and sweeps down faint and fitful amid the howling of the wind  along the brink of the bog picking their road among crumbling rocks and green spongy springs a company of english soldiers are pushing fast clad capapie in helmet and quilted jerkin with arquebus on shoulder and pikes trailing behind them stern steadfast men who two years since were working the guns at smerwick fort and have since then seen many a bloody fray and shall see more before they die two captains ride before them on shaggy ponies the taller in armor stained and rusted with many a storm and fray the other in brilliant inlaid cuirass and helmet gaudy sash and plume and sword hilt glittering with gold a quaint contrast enough to the meager garron which carries him and his finery beside them secured by a cord which a pikeman has fastened to his own wrist trots a barelegged irish kerne whose only clothing is his ragged yellow mantle and the unkempt glib of hair through which his eyes peer out right and left in mingled fear and sullenness he is the guide of the company in their hunt after the rebel baltinglas and woe to him if he play them false  a pleasant country truly captain raleigh says the dingy officer to the gay one i wonder how having once escaped from it to whitehall you have the courage to come back and spoil that gay suit with bogwater and mud  a very pleasant country my friend amyas what you say in jest i say in earnest  hillo our tastes have changed places i am sick of it already as you foretold would heaven that i could hear of some adventure westwardho and find these big bones swinging in a hammock once more pray what has made you so suddenly in love with bog and rock that you come back to tramp them with us i thought you had spied out the nakedness of the land long ago  bog and rock nakedness of the land what is needed here but prudence and skill justice and law this soil see is fat enough if men were here to till it these rockswho knows what minerals they may hold i hear of gold and jewels found already in divers parts and daniel my brother humphreys german assayer assures me that these rocks are of the very same kind as those which yield the silver in peru tut man if her gracious majesty would but bestow on me some few square miles of this same wilderness in seven years time i would make it blossom like the rose by gods good help  humph i should be more inclined to stay here then  so you shall and be my agent if you will to get in my minerents and my cornrents and my fisheryrents eh could you keep accounts old knight of the bearspaw  well enough for such short reckonings as yours would be on the profit side at least no noid sooner carry lime all my days from cauldy to bideford than pass another twelvemonth in the land of ire among the children of wrath there is a curse upon the face of the earth i believe  there is no curse upon it save the old one of mans sinthorns and thistles it shall bring forth to thee but if you root up the thorns and thistles amyas i know no fiend who can prevent your growing wheat instead and if you till the ground like a man you plough and barrow away natures curse and other fables of the schoolmen beside added he in that daring fashion which afterwards obtained for him and never did good christian less deserve it the imputation of atheism  it is sword and bullet i think that are needed here before plough and harrow to clear away some of the curse until a few more of these irish lords are gone where the desmonds are there is no peace for ireland  humph not so far wrong i fear and yetirish lords these very traitors are better english blood than we who hunt them down when yeo here slew the desmond the other day he no more let out a drop of irish blood than if he had slain the lord deputy himself  his blood be on his own head said yeo he looked as wild a savage as the worst of them more shame to him and the ancient here had nigh cut off his arm before he told us who he was and then your worship having a price upon his head and like to bleed to death too  enough enough good fellow said raleigh thou hast done what was given thee to do strange amyas is it not noble normans sunk into savageshibernis ipsis hiberniores is there some uncivilizing venom in the air  some venom at least which makes english men traitors but the irish themselves are well enough if their tyrants would let them be see now what more faithful liegeman has her majesty than the inchiquin who they say is prince of themond and should be king of all ireland if every man had his right  dont talk of rights in the land of wrongs man but the inchiquin knows well that the true irish esau has no worse enemy than his supplanter the norman jacob and yet amyas are even these men worse than we might be if we had been bred up masters over the bodies and souls of men in some remote land where law and order had never come look at this desmond brought up a savage among savages a papist among papists a despot among slaves a thousand easy maidens deeming it honor to serve his pleasure a thousand wild ruffians deeming it piety to fulfil his revenge and let him that is without sin among us cast the first stone  ay went on raleigh to himself as the conversation dropped what hadst thou been raleigh hadst thou been that desmond whose lands thou now desirest what wilt thou be when thou hast them will thy children sink downwards as these noble barons sank will the genius of tyranny and falsehood find soil within thy heart to grow and ripen fruit what guarantee hast thou for doing better here than those who went before thee and yet cannot i do justice and love mercy can i not establish plantations build and sow and make the desert valleys laugh with corn shall i not have my spenser with me to fill me with all noble thoughts and raise my soul to his heroic pitch is not this true knighterrantry to redeem to peace and use and to the glory of that glorious queen whom god has given to me a generous soil and a more generous race trustful and tenderhearted they arenone more and if they be fickle and passionate will not that very softness of temper which makes them so easily led to evil make them as easy to be led towards good yeshere away from courts among a people who should bless me as their benefactor and delivererwhat golden days might be mine and yetis this but another angels mask from that same cunning fiend ambitions stage and will my house be indeed the house of god the foundations of which are loyalty and its bulwarks righteousness and not the house of fame whose walls are of the soapbubble and its floor a sea of glass mingled with fire i would be good and greatwhen will the day come when i shall be content to be good and yet not great like this same simple leigh toiling on by my side to do his duty with no more thought for the morrow than the birds of god greatness i have tasted that cup within the last twelve months do i not know that it is sweet in the mouth but bitter in the belly greatness and was not essex great and john of austria great and desmond great whose race but three short years ago had stood for ages higher than i shall ever hope to climbcastles and lands and slaves by thousands and five hundred gentlemen of his name who had vowed to forswear god before they forswore him and well have they kept their vow and now dead in a turfhovel like a coney in a burrow leigh what noise was that  an irish howl i fancied but it came from off the bog it may be only a plovers cry  something not quite right sir captain to my mind said the ancient they have ugly stories here of pucks and banshees and what not of ghosts there it was again wailing just like a woman they say the banshee cried all night before desmond was slain  perhaps then this one may be crying for baltinglas for his turn is likely to come nextnot that i believe in such old wives tales  shamus my man said amyas to the guide do you hear that cry in the bog  the guide put on the most stolid of faces and answered in broken english  shamus hear naught perhapswhat you call himfishing in ta pool  an otter he means and i believe he is right stay no did you not hear it then shamus it was a womans voice  shamus is shick in his ears ever since christmas  shamus will go after desmond if he lies said amyas ancient we had better send a few men to see what it is there may be a poor soul taken by robbers or perhaps starving to death as i have seen many a one  and i too poor wretches and by no fault of their own or ours either but if their lords will fall to quarrelling and then drive each others cattle and waste each others lands sir you know  i know said amyas impatiently why dost not take the men and go  cry you mercy noble captain buti fear nothing born of woman  well what of that said amyas with a smile  but these pucks sir the wild irish do say that they haunt the pools and they do no manner of harm sir when you are coming up to them but when you are past sir they jump on your back like to apes sirand who can tackle that manner of fiend  why then by thine own showing ancient said raleigh thou mayst go and see all safely enough and then if the puck jumps on thee as thou comest back just run in with him here and ill buy him of thee for a noble or thou mayst keep him in a cage and make money in london by showing him for a monster  good heavens forefend captain raleigh but you talk rashly but if i must captain leigh             where duty calls             to brazen walls      how base the slave who flinches  lads wholl follow me  thou askest for volunteers as if thou wert to lead a forlorn hope pull away at the usquebaugh man and swallow dutch courage since thine english is oozed away stay ill go myself  and i with you said raleigh as the queens true knighterrant i am bound to be behindhand in no adventure who knows but we may find a wicked magician just going to cut off the head of some saffronmantled princess and he dismounted  oh sirs sirs to endanger your precious  pooh said raleigh i wear an amulet and have a spell of artmagic at my tongues end whereby sir ancient neither can a ghost see me nor i see them come with us yeo the desmondslayer and we will shame the devil or be shamed by him  he may shame me sir but he will never frighten me quoth yeo but the bog captains  tut devonshire men and heathtrotters born and not know our way over a peat moor  and the three strode away  they splashed and scrambled for some quarter of a mile to the knoll while the cry became louder and louder as they neared  thats neither ghost nor otter sirs but a true irish howl as captain leigh said and ill warrant master shamus knew as much long ago said yeo  and in fact they could now hear plainly the ochone ochonorie of some wild woman and scrambling over the boulders of the knoll in another minute came full upon her  she was a young girl sluttish and unkempt of course but fair enough her only covering as usual was the ample yellow mantle there she sat upon a stone tearing her black dishevelled hair and every now and then throwing up her head and bursting into a long mournful cry for all the world as yeo said like a dumb fourfooted hound and not a christian soul  on her knees lay the head of a man of middle age in the long soutane of a romish priest one look at the attitude of his limbs told them that he was dead  the two paused in awe and raleighs spirit susceptible of all poetical images felt keenly that strange scenethe bleak and bitter sky the shapeless bog the stunted trees the savage girl alone with the corpse in that utter desolation and as she bent her head over the still face and called wildly to him who heard her not and then utterly unmindful of the intruders sent up again that dreary wail into the dreary air they felt a sacred horror which almost made them turn away and leave her unquestioned but yeo whose nerves were of tougher fibre asked quietly  shall i go and search the fellow captain  better i think said amyas  raleigh went gently to the girl and spoke to her in english she looked up at him his armor and his plume with wide and wondering eyes and then shook her head and returned to her lamentation  raleigh gently laid his hand on her arm and lifted her up while yeo and amyas bent over the corpse  it was the body of a large and coarsefeatured man but wasted and shrunk as if by famine to a very skeleton the hands and legs were cramped up and the trunk bowed together as if the man had died of cold or famine yeo drew back the clothes from the thin bosom while the girl screamed and wept but made no effort to stop him  ask her who it is yeo you know a little irish said amyas  he asked but the girl made no answer the stubborn jade wont tell of course sir if she were but a man id make her soon enough  ask her who killed him  no one she says and i believe she says true for i can find no wound the man has been starved sirs as i am a sinful man god help him though he is a priest and yet he seems full enough down below whats here a big pouch sirs stuffed full of somewhat  hand it hither  the two opened the pouch papers papers but no scrap of food then a parchment they unrolled it  latin said amyas you must construe don scholar  is it possible said raleigh after reading a moment this is indeed a prize this is saunders himself  yeo sprang up from the body as if he had touched an adder nick saunders the legacy sir  nicholas saunders the legate  the villain why did not he wait for me to have the comfort of killing him dog and he kicked the corpse with his foot  quiet quiet remember the poor girl said amyas as she shrieked at the profanation while raleigh went on half to himself  yes this is saunders misguided fool and this is the end to this thou hast come with thy plotting and thy conspiring thy lying and thy boasting consecrated banners and popes bulls agnus deis and holy waters the blessing of all saints and angels and thy lady of the immaculate conception thou hast called on the heavens to judge between thee and us and here is their answer what is that in his hand amyas give it me a pastoral epistle to the earl of ormond and all nobles of the realm of ireland to all who groan beneath the loathsome tyranny of an illegitimate adulteress etc nicholas saunders by the grace of god legate etc bah and this forsooth was thy last meditation incorrigible pedant victrix causa diis placuit sed victa catoni  he ran his eye through various other documents written in the usual strain full of huge promises from the pope and the king of spain frantic and filthy slanders against elizabeth burghley leicester essex the elder sidney and every great and good man never mind of which party who then upheld the commonweal bombastic attempts to terrify weak consciences by denouncing endless fire against those who opposed the true faith fulsome ascriptions of martyrdom and sanctity to every rebel and traitor who had been hanged for the last twenty years wearisome arguments about the bull in caena domini elizabeths excommunication the nullity of english law the sacred duty of rebellion the right to kill a prince impenitently heretical and the like insanities and villainies which may be read at large in camden the phoenix britannicus foxs martyrs or surest of all in the writings of the worthies themselves  with a gesture of disgust raleigh crammed the foul stuff back again into the pouch taking it with them they walked back to the company and then remounting marched away once more towards the lands of the desmonds and the girl was left alone with the dead  an hour had passed when another englishman was standing by the wailing girl and round him a dozen shockheaded kernes skene on thigh and javelin in hand were tossing about their tawny rags and adding their lamentations to those of the lonely watcher  the englishman was eustace leigh a layman still but still at his old work by two years of intrigue and labor from one end of ireland to the other he had been trying to satisfy his conscience for rejecting the higher calling of the celibate for mad hopes still lurked within that fiery heart his brow was wrinkled now his features harshened the scar upon his face and the slight distortion which accompanied it was hidden by a bushy beard from all but himself and he never forgot it for a day nor forgot who had given it to him  he had been with desmond wandering in moor and moss for many a month in danger of his life and now he was on his way to james fitzeustace lord baltinglas to bring him the news of desmonds death and with him a remnant of the clan who were either too stouthearted or too desperately stained with crime to seek peace from the english and as their fellows did find it at once and freely  there eustace stood looking down on all that was left of the most sacred personage of ireland the man who as he once had hoped was to regenerate his native land and bring the proud island of the west once more beneath that gentle yoke in which united christendom labored for the commonweal of the universal church there he was and with him all eustaces dreams in the very heart of that country which he had vowed and believed as he vowed was ready to rise in arms as one man even to the baby at the breast so he had said in vengeance against the saxon heretic and sweep the hated name of englishman into the deepest abysses of the surge which walled her coasts with spain and the pope to back him and the wealth of the jesuits at his command in the midst of faithful catholics valiant soldiers noblemen who had pledged themselves to die for the cause serfs who worshipped him as a demigodstarved to death in a bog it was a pretty plain verdict on the reasonableness of his expectations but not to eustace leigh  it was a failure of course but it was an accident indeed to have been expected in a wicked world whose prince and master as all knew was the devil himself indeed proof of the righteousness of the causefor when had the true faith been other than persecuted and trampled under foot if one came to think of it with eyes purified from the tears of carnal impatience what was it but a glorious martyrdom  blest saunders murmured eustace leigh let me die the death of the righteous and let my last end he like this ora pro me most excellent martyr while i dig thy grave upon this lonely moor to wait there for thy translation to one of those stately shrines which cemented by the blood of such as thee shall hereafter rise restored toward heaven to make this land once more the isle of saints  the corpse was buried a few prayers said hastily and eustace leigh was away again not now to find baltinglas for it was more than his life was worth the girl had told him of the english soldiers who had passed and he knew that they would reach the earl probably before he did the game was up all was lost so he retraced his steps as a desperate resource to the last place where he would be looked for and after a month of disguising hiding and other expedients found himself again in his native county of devon while fitzeustace viscount baltinglas had taken ship for spain having got little by his famous argument to ormond in behalf of his joining the church of rome had not thine ancestor blessed thomas of canterbury died for the church of rome thou hadst never been earl of ormond the premises were certainly sounder than those of his party were wont to be for it was to expiate the murder of that turbulent hero that the ormond lands had been granted by henry ii but as for the conclusion therefrom it was much on a par with the rest  and now let us return to raleigh and amyas as they jog along their weary road they have many things to talk of for it is but three days since they met  amyas as you see is coming fast into raleighs old opinion of ireland raleigh under the inspiration of a possible grant of desmonds lands looks on bogs and rocks transfigured by his own hopes and fancy as if by the glory of a rainbow he looked at all things so noble fellow even thirty years after when old worn out and ruined well for him had it been otherwise and his heart had grown old with his head amyas who knows nothing about desmonds lands is puzzled at the change  why what is this raleigh you are like children sitting in the marketplace and nothing pleases you you wanted to get to court and you have got there and are lord and master i hear or something very like it alreadyand as soon as fortune stuffs your mouth full of sweetmeats do you turn informer on her  raleigh laughed insignificantly but was silent  and how is your friend mr secretary spenser who was with us at smerwick  spenser he has thriven even as i have and he has found as i have that in making one friend at court you make ten foes but oderint dum metuant is no more my motto than his leigh i want to be greatgreat i am already they say if princes favor can swell the frog into an ox but i want to be liked lovedi want to see people smile when i enter  so they do ill warrant said amyas  so do hyenas said raleigh grin because they are hungry and i may throw them a bone ill throw you one now old lad or rather a good sirloin of beef for the sake of your smile thats honest at least ill warrant whosoevers else is not have you heard of my brother humphreys new project  how should i hear anything in this waste howling wilderness  kiss hands to the wilderness then and come with me to newfoundland  you to newfoundland  yes i to newfoundland unless my little matter here is settled at once gloriana dont know it and shant till im off shed send me to the tower i think if she caught me playing truant i could hardly get leave to come hither but i must out and try my fortune i am over ears in debt already and sick of courts and courtiers humphrey must go next spring and take possession of his kingdom beyond seas or his patent expires and with him i go and you too my circumnavigating giant  and then raleigh expounded to amyas the details of the great newfoundland scheme which whoso will may read in the pages of hakluyt  sir humphrey gilbert raleighs halfbrother held a patent for planting the lands of newfoundland and meta incognita labrador he had attempted a voyage thither with raleigh in 1578 whereof i never could find any news save that he came back again after a heavy brush with some spanish ships in which his best captain mr morgan was killed having done nothing and much impaired his own estate but now he had collected a large sum sir gilbert peckham of london mr hayes of south devon and various other gentlemen of whom more hereafter had adventured their money and a considerable colony was to be sent out the next year with miners assayers and what was more parmenius budaeus franks old friend who had come to england full of thirst to see the wonders of the new world and over and above this as raleigh told amyas in strictest secrecy adrian gilbert humphreys brother was turning every stone at court for a patent of discovery in the northwest and this newfoundland colony though it was to produce gold silver merchandise and what not was but a basis of operations a halfway house from whence to work out the northwest passage to the indiesthat golden dream as fatal to english valor as the guiana one to spanishand yet hardly hardly to be regretted when we remember the seamanship the science the chivalry the heroism unequalled in the history of the english nation which it has called forth among those our later arctic voyagers who have combined the knighterrantry of the middle age with the practical prudence of the modern and dared for duty more than cortez or pizarro dared for gold  amyas simple fellow took all in greedily he knew enough of the dangers of the magellan passage to appreciate the boundless value of a road to the east indies which would as all supposed then save half the distance and be as it were a private possession of the english safe from spanish interference and he listened reverently to sir humphreys quaint proofs half true half fantastic of such a passage which raleigh detailed to himof the primum mobile and its diurnal motion from east to west in obedience to which the seacurrent flowed westward ever round the cape of good hope and being unable to pass through the narrow strait between south america and the antarctic continent rushed up the american shore as the gulf stream and poured northwestward between greenland and labrador towards cathay and india of that most crafty argument of sir humphreyshow aristotle in his book de mundo and simon gryneus in his annotations thereon declare that the world the old world is an island compassed by that which homer calls the river oceanus ergo the new world is an island also and there is a northwest passage of the three brothers names unknown who had actually made the voyage and named what was afterwards called daviss strait after themselves of the indians who were cast ashore in germany in the reign of frederic barbarossa who as sir humphrey had learnedly proved per modum tollendi could have come only by the northwest and above all of salvaterra the spaniard who in 1568 had told sir henry sidney philips father there in ireland how he had spoken with a mexican friar named urdaneta who had himself come from mar del zur the pacific into germany by that very northwest passage at which last amyas shook his head and said that friars were liars and seeing believing but if you must needs have an adventure you insatiable soul you why not try for the golden city of manoa  manoa asked raleigh who had heard as most had dim rumors of the place what do you know of it  whereon amyas told him all that he had gathered from the spaniard and raleigh in his turn believed every word  humph said he after a long silence to find that golden emperor offer him help and friendship from the queen of england defend him against the spaniards if we became strong enough conquer back all peru from the popish tyrants and reinstate him on the throne of the incas with ourselves for his bodyguard as the norman varangians were to the effeminate emperors of byzanthey amyas you would make a gallant chieftain of varangs well do it lad  well try said amyas but we must be quick for theres one berreo sworn to carry out the quest to the death and if the spaniards once get thither their plan of works will be much more like pizarros than like yours and by the time we come there will be neither gold nor city left  nor indians either ill warrant the butchers but lad i am promised to humphrey i have a bark fitting out already and all i have and more adventured in her so manoa must wait  it will wait well enough if the spaniards prosper no better on the amazon than they have done but must i come with you to tell the truth i am quite shoresick and to sea i must go what will my mother say  ill manage thy mother said raleigh and so he did for to cut a long story short he went back the month after and he not only took home letters from amyas to his mother but so impressed on that good lady the enormous profits and honors to be derived from meta incognita and which was most true the advantage to any young man of sailing with such a general as humphrey gilbert most pious and most learned of seamen and of cavaliers beloved and honored above all his compeers by queen elizabeth that she consented to amyass adventuring in the voyage some two hundred pounds which had come to him as his share of prizemoney after the ever memorable circumnavigation for mrs leigh be it understood was no longer at burrough court by franks persuasion she had let the old place moved up to london with her eldest son and taken for herself a lodging somewhere by palace stairs which looked out upon the silver thames for thames was silver then with its busy ferries and gliding boats across to the pleasant fields of lambeth and the archbishops palace and the wooded surrey hills and there she spent her peaceful days close to her frank and to the court elizabeth would have had her reenter it offering her a small place in the household but she declined saying that she was too old and heartweary for aught but prayer so by prayer she lived under the sheltering shadow of the tall minster where she went morn and even to worship and to entreat for the two in whom her heart was bound up and frank slipped in every day if but for five minutes and brought with him spenser or raleigh or dyer or budaeus or sometimes sidneys self and there was talk of high and holy things of which none could speak better than could she and each guest went from that hallowed room a humbler and yet a loftier man so slipped on the peaceful months and few and far between came irish letters for ireland was then farther from westminster than is the black sea now but those were days in which wives and mothers had learned as they have learned once more sweet souls to walk by faith and not by sight for those they love and mrs leigh was content though when was she not content to hear that amyas was winning a good report as a brave and prudent officer sober just and faithful beloved and obeyed alike by english soldiers and irish kernes  those two years and the one which followed were the happiest which she had known since her husbands death but the cloud was fast coming up the horizon though she saw it not a little longer and the sun would be hid for many a wintry day  amyas went to plymouth with yeo of course at his heels and there beheld for the first time the majestic countenance of the philosopher of compton castle he lodged with drake and found him not oversanguine as to the success of the voyage  for learning and manners amyas theres not his equal and the queen may well love him and devon be proud of him but booklearning is not business booklearning didnt get me round the world booklearning didnt make captain hawkins nor his father neither the best shipbuilders from hull to cadiz and booklearning i very much fear wont plant newfoundland  however the die was cast and the little fleet of five sail assembled in cawsand bay amyas was to go as a gentleman adventurer on board of raleighs bark raleigh himself however at the eleventh hour had been forbidden by the queen to leave england ere they left sir humphrey gilberts picture was painted by some plymouth artist to be sent up to elizabeth in answer to a letter and a gift sent by raleigh which as a specimen of the men and of the time i here transcribe   brotheri have sent you a token from her majesty an anchor guided by a lady as you see and further her highness willed me to send you word that she wisheth you as great good hap and safety to your ship as if she were there in person desiring you to have care of yourself as of that which she tendereth and therefore for her sake you must provide for it accordingly furthermore she commandeth that you leave your picture with her for the rest i leave till our meeting or to the report of the bearer who would needs be the messenger of this good news so i commit you to the will and protection of god who send us such life and death as he shall please or hath appointed  richmond this friday morning  your true brother  w raleigh        this letter was a few years since in the possession of mr      pomeroy gilbert fortmajor at dartmouth a descendant of      the admirals  who would not die sir for such a woman said sir humphrey and he said truly as he showed that letter to amyas  who would not but she bids you rather live for her  i shall do both young man and for god too i trust we are going in gods cause we go for the honor of gods gospel for the deliverance of poor infidels led captive by the devil for the relief of my distressed countrymen unemployed within this narrow isle and to god we commit our cause we fight against the devil himself and stronger is he that is within us than he that is against us  some say that raleigh himself came down to plymouth accompanied the fleet a days sail to sea and would have given her majesty the slip and gone with them westwardho but for sir humphreys advice it is likely enough but i cannot find evidence for it at all events on the 11th june the fleet sailed out having says mr hayes in number about 260 men among whom we had of every faculty good choice as shipwrights masons carpenters smiths and such like requisite for such an action also mineral men and refiners beside for solace of our people and allurement of the savages we were provided of musique in good variety not omitting the least toys as morrisdancers hobbyhorses and maylike conceits to delight the savage people whom we intended to win by all fair means possible an armament complete enough even to that tenderness towards the indians which is so striking a feature of the elizabethan seamen called out in them perhaps by horror at the spanish cruelties as well as by their more liberal creed and to the daily service of god on board of every ship according to the simple old instructions of captain john hawkins to one of his little squadrons keep good company beware of fire serve god daily and love one anotheran armament in short complete in all but men the sailors had been picked up hastily and anywhere and soon proved themselves a mutinous and in the case of the bark swallow a piratical set the mechanics were little better the gentlemenadventurers puffed up with vain hopes of finding a new mexico became soon disappointed and surly at the hard practical reality while over all was the head of a sage and an enthusiast a man too noble to suspect others and too pure to make allowances for poor dirty human weaknesses he had got his scheme perfect upon paper well for him and for his company if he had asked francis drake to translate it for him into fact as early as the second day the seeds of failure began to sprout above ground the men of raleighs bark the viceadmiral suddenly found themselves seized or supposed themselves seized with a contagious sickness and at midnight forsook the fleet and went back to plymouth whereto mr hayes can only say the reason i never could understand sure i am that mr raleigh spared no cost in setting them forth and so i leave it unto god  but amyas said more he told butler the captain plainly that if the bark went back he would not that he had seen enough of ships deserting their consorts that it should never be said of him that he had followed winters example and that too on a fair easterly wind and finally that he had seen doughty hanged for trying to play such a trick and that he might see others hanged too before he died whereon captain butler offered to draw and fight to which amyas showed no repugnance whereon the captain having taken a second look at amyass thews and sinews reconsidered the matter and offered to put amyas on board of sir humphreys delight if he could find a crew to row him  amyas looked around  are there any of sir francis drakes men on board  three sir said yeo robert drew and two others  pelicans roared amyas you have been round the world and will you turn back from westwardho  there was a moments silence and then drew came forward  lower us a boat captain and lend us a caliver to make signals with while i get my kit on deck ill after captain leigh if i row him aboard all alone to my own hands  if i ever command a ship i will not forget you said amyas  nor us either sir we hope for we havent forgotten you and your honest conditions said both the other pelicans and so away over the side went all the five and pulled away after the admirals lantern firing shots at intervals as signals luckily for the five desperadoes the night was all but calm they got on board before the morning and so away into the boundless west        the raleigh the largest ship of the squadron was of only      200 tons burden the golden hind hayes ship which      returned safe of 40 and the squirrel whereof more      hereafter of 10 tons  in such cockboats did these old      heroes brave the unknown seas    chapter xii  how bideford bridge dined at annery house       three lords sat drinking late yestreen      and ere they paid the lawing      they set a combat them between      to fight it in the dawingscotch ballad  every one who knows bideford cannot but know bideford bridge for it is the very omphalos cynosure and soul around which the town as a body has organized itself and as edinburgh is edinburgh by virtue of its castle rome rome by virtue of its capitol and egypt egypt by virtue of its pyramids so is bideford bideford by virtue of its bridge but all do not know the occult powers which have advanced and animated the said wondrous bridge for now five hundred years and made it the chief wonder according to prince and fuller of this fair land of devon being first an inspired bridge a soulsaving bridge an almsgiving bridge an educational bridge a sentient bridge and last but not least a dinnergiving bridge all do not know how when it began to be built some half mile higher up hands invisible carried the stones downstream each night to the present site until sir richard gurney parson of the parish going to bed one night in sore perplexity and fear of the evil spirit who seemed so busy in his sheepfold beheld a vision of an angel who bade build the bridge where he himself had so kindly transported the materials for there alone was sure foundation amid the broad sheet of shifting sand all do not know how bishop grandison of exeter proclaimed throughout his diocese indulgences benedictions and participation in all spiritual blessings for ever to all who would promote the bridging of that dangerous ford and so consulting alike the interests of their souls and of their bodies make the best of both worlds  all do not know nor do i that though the foundation of the bridge is laid upon wool yet it shakes at the slightest step of a horse or that though it has twentythree arches yet one wm alford another milo carried on his back for a wager four bushels saltwater measure all the length thereof or that the bridge is a veritable esquire bearing arms of its own a ship and bridge proper on a plain field and owning lands and tenements in many parishes with which the said miraculous bridge has from time to time founded charities built schools waged suits at law and finally for this concerns us most given yearly dinners and kept for that purpose luxurious and liquorish bridge that it was the best stocked cellar of wines in all devon  to one of these dinners as it happened were invited in the year 1583 all the notabilities of bideford and beside them mr st leger of annery close by brother of the marshal of munster and of lady grenville a most worthy and hospitable gentleman who finding riches a snare parted with them so freely to all his neighbors as long as he lived that he effectually prevented his children after him from falling into the temptations thereunto incident  between him and one of the bridge trustees arose an argument whether a salmon caught below the bridge was better or worse than one caught above and as that weighty question could only be decided by practical experiment mr st leger vowed that as the bridge had given him a good dinner he would give the bridge one offered a bet of five pounds that he would find them out of the pool below annery as firm and flaky a salmon as the appledore one which they had just eaten and then in the fulness of his heart invited the whole company present to dine with him at annery three days after and bring with them each a wife or daughter and don guzman being at table he was invited too  so there was a mighty feast in the great hall at annery such as had seldom been since judge hankford feasted edward the fourth there and while every one was eating their best and drinking their worst rose salterne and don guzman were pretending not to see each other and watching each other all the more but rose at least had to be very careful of her glances for not only was her father at the table but just opposite her sat none other than messrs william cary and arthur st leger lieutenants in her majestys irish army who had returned on furlough a few days before  rose salterne and the spaniard had not exchanged a word in the last six months though they had met many times the spaniard by no means avoided her company except in her fathers house he only took care to obey her carefully by seeming always unconscious of her presence beyond the stateliest of salutes at entering and departing but he took care at the same time to lay himself out to the very best advantage whenever he was in her presence to be more witty more eloquent more romantic more full of wonderful tales than he ever yet had been the cunning don had found himself foiled in his first tactic and he was now trying another and a far more formidable one in the first place rose deserved a very severe punishment for having dared to refuse the love of a spanish nobleman and what greater punishment could he inflict than withdrawing the honor of his attentions and the sunshine of his smiles there was conceit enough in that notion but there was cunning too for none knew better than the spaniard that women like the world are pretty sure to value a man especially if there be any real worth in him at his own price and that the more he demands for himself the more they will give for him  and now he would put a high price on himself and pique her pride as she was too much accustomed to worship to be won by flattering it he might have done that by paying attention to some one else but he was too wise to employ so coarse a method which might raise indignation or disgust or despair in roses heart but would have never brought her to his feetas it will never bring any woman worth bringing so he quietly and unobtrusively showed her that he could do without her and she poor fool as she was meant to do began forthwith to ask herselfwhy what was the hidden treasure what was the reserve force which made him independent of her while she could not say that she was independent of him had he a secret how pleasant to know it some huge ambition how pleasant to share in it some mysterious knowledge how pleasant to learn it some capacity of love beyond the common how delicious to have it all for her own he must be greater wiser richerhearted than she was as well as betterborn ah if his wealth would but supply her poverty and so step by step she was being led to sue in forma pauperis to the very man whom she had spurned when he sued in like form to her that temptation of having some mysterious private treasure of being the priestess of some hidden sanctuary and being able to thank heaven that she was not as other women are was becoming fast too much for rose as it is too much for most for none knew better than the spaniard how much more fond women are by the very law of their sex of worshipping than of being worshipped and of obeying than of being obeyed how their coyness often their scorn is but a mask to hide their consciousness of weakness and a mask too of which they themselves will often be the first to tire  and rose was utterly tired of that same mask as she sat at table at annery that day and don guzman saw it in her uneasy and downcast looks and thinking conceited coxcomb that she must be by now sufficiently punished stole a glance at her now and then and was not abashed when he saw that she dropped her eyes when they met his because he saw her silence and abstraction increase and something like a blush steal into her cheeks so he pretended to be as much downcast and abstracted as she was and went on with his glances till he once found her poor thing looking at him to see if he was looking at her and then he knew his prey was safe and asked her with his eyes do you forgive me and saw her stop dead in her talk to her next neighbor and falter and drop her eyes and raise them again after a minute in search of his that he might repeat the pleasant question and then what could she do but answer with all her face and every bend of her pretty neck and do you forgive me in turn  whereon don guzman broke out jubilant like nightingale on bough with story and jest and repartee and became forthwith the soul of the whole company and the most charming of all cavaliers and poor rose knew that she was the cause of his sudden change of mood and blamed herself for what she had done and shuddered and blushed at her own delight and longed that the feast was over that she might hurry home and hide herself alone with sweet fancies about a love the reality of which she felt she dared not face  it was a beautiful sight the great terrace at annery that afternoon with the smart dames in their gaudy dresses parading up and down in twos and threes before the stately house or looking down upon the park with the old oaks and the deer and the broad landlocked river spread out like a lake beneath all bright in the glare of the midsummer sun or listening obsequiously to the two great ladies who did the honors mrs st leger the hostess and her sisterinlaw fair lady grenville all chatted and laughed and eyed each others dresses and gossiped about each others husbands and servants only rose salterne kept apart and longed to get into a corner and laugh or cry she knew not which  our pretty rose seems sad said lady grenville coming up to her cheer up child we want you to come and sing to us  rose answered she knew not what and obeyed mechanically  she took the lute and sat down on a bench beneath the house while the rest grouped themselves round her  what shall i sing  let us have your old song earl haldans daughter  rose shrank from it it was a loud and dashing ballad which chimed in but little with her thoughts and frank had praised it too in happier days long since gone by she thought of him and of others and of her pride and carelessness and the song seemed ominous to her and yet for that very reason she dared not refuse to sing it for fear of suspicion where no one suspected and so she began per force   i  it was earl haldans daughter she lookd across the sea she lookd across the water and long and loud laughd she the locks of six princesses must be my marriagefee so hey bonny boat and ho bonny boat who comes a wooing me  ii  it was earl haldans daughter she walkd along the sand when she was aware of a knight so fair come sailing to the land his sails were all of velvet his mast of beaten gold and hey bonny boat and ho bonny boat who saileth here so bold  iii  the locks of five princesses i won beyond the sea i shore their golden tresses to fringe a cloak for thee one handful yet is wanting but one of all the tale so hey bonny boat and ho bonny boat furl up thy velvet sail  iv  he leapt into the water that rover young and bold he gript earl haldans daughter he shore her locks of gold go weep go weep proud maiden the tale is full today now hey bonny boat and ho bonny boat sail westwardho and away   as she ceased a measured voice with a foreign accent thrilled through her  in the east they say the nightingale sings to the rose devon more happy has nightingale and rose in one  we have no nightingales in devon don guzman said lady grenville but our little forest thrushes sing as you hear sweetly enough to content any ear but what brings you away from the gentlemen so early  these letters said he which have just been put into my hand and as they call me home to spain i was loath to lose a moment of that delightful company from which i must part so soon  to spain asked halfadozen voices for the don was a general favorite  yes and thence to the indies my ransom has arrived and with it the promise of an office i am to be governor of la guayra in caracas congratulate me on my promotion  a mist was over roses eyes the spaniards voice was hard and flippant did he care for her after all and if he did was it nevertheless hopeless how her cheeks glowed everybody must see it anything to turn away their attention from her and in that nervous haste which makes people speak and speak foolishly too just because they ought to be silent she asked  and where is la guayra  half round the world on the coast of the spanish main the loveliest place on earth and the loveliest governors house in a forest of palms at the foot of a mountain eight thousand feet high i shall only want a wife there to be in paradise  i dont doubt that you may persuade some fair lady of seville to accompany you thither said lady grenville  thanks gracious madam but the truth is that since i have had the bliss of knowing english ladies i have begun to think that they are the only ones on earth worth wooing  a thousand thanks for the compliment but i fear none of our free english maidens would like to submit to the guardianship of a duenna eh rose how should you like to be kept under lock and key all day by an ugly old woman with a horn on her forehead  poor rose turned so scarlet that lady grenville knew her secret on the spot and would have tried to turn the conversation but before she could speak some burghers wife blundered out a commonplace about the jealousy of spanish husbands and another to make matters better giggled out something more true than delicate about west indian masters and fair slaves  ladies said don guzman reddening believe me that these are but the calumnies of ignorance if we be more jealous than other nations it is because we love more passionately if some of us abroad are profligate it is because they poor men have no helpmate which like the amethyst keeps its wearer pure i could tell you stories ladies of the constancy and devotion of spanish husbands even in the indies as strange as ever romancer invented  can you then we challenge you to give us one at least  i fear it would be too long madam  the longer the more pleasant senor how can we spend an hour better this afternoon while the gentlemen within are finishing their wine  storytelling in those old times when books and authors also lucky for the public were rarer than now was a common amusement and as the spaniards accomplishments in that line were well known all the ladies crowded round him the servants brought chairs and benches and don guzman taking his seat in the midst with a proud humility at lady grenvilles feet began  your perfections fair and illustrious ladies must doubtless have heard ere now how sebastian cabota some fortyfive years ago sailed forth with a commission from my late master the emperor charles the fifth to discover the golden lands of tarshish ophir and cipango but being in want of provisions stopped short at the mouth of that mighty south american river to which he gave the name of rio de la plata and sailing up it discovered the fair land of paraguay but you may not have heard how on the bank of that river at the mouth of the rio terceiro he built a fort which men still call cabots tower nor have you perhaps heard of the strange tale which will ever make the tower a sacred spot to all true lovers  for when he returned to spain the year after he left in his tower a garrison of a hundred and twenty men under the command of nuno de lara ruiz moschera and sebastian da hurtado old friends and fellowsoldiers of my invincible grandfather don ferdinando da soto and with them a jewel than which spain never possessed one more precious lucia miranda the wife of hurtado who famed in the court of the emperor no less for her wisdom and modesty than for her unrivalled beauty had thrown up all the pomp and ambition of a palace to marry a poor adventurer and to encounter with him the hardships of a voyage round the world mangora the cacique of the neighboring timbuez indians with whom lara had contrived to establish a friendship cast his eyes on this fair creature and no sooner saw than he coveted no sooner coveted than he plotted with the devilish subtilty of a savage to seize by force what he knew he could never gain by right she soon found out his passion she was wise enoughwhat every woman is notto know when she is loved and telling her husband kept as much as she could out of her new lovers sight while the savage pressed hurtado to come and visit him and to bring his lady with him hurtado suspecting the snare and yet fearing to offend the cacique excused himself courteously on the score of his soldiers duty and the savage mad with desire and disappointment began plotting against hurtados life  so went on several weeks till food grew scarce and don hurtado and don ruiz moschera with fifty soldiers were sent up the river on a foraging party mangora saw his opportunity and leapt at it forthwith  the tower ladies as i have heard from those who have seen it stands on a knoll at the meeting of the two rivers while on the land side stretches a dreary marsh covered with tall grass and bushes a fit place for the ambuscade of four thousand indians which mangora with devilish cunning placed around the tower while he himself went boldly up to it followed by thirty men laden with grain fruit game and all the delicacies which his forests could afford  there with a smiling face he told the unsuspecting lara his sorrow for the spaniards want of food besought him to accept the provision he had brought and was as he had expected invited by lara to come in and taste the wines of spain  in went he and his thirty fellowbandits and the feast continued with songs and libations far into the night while mangora often looked round and at last boldly asked for the fair miranda but she had shut herself into her lodging pleading illness  a plea fair ladies which little availed that hapless dame for no sooner had the spaniards retired to rest leaving by i know not what madness mangora and his indians within than they were awakened by the cry of fire the explosion of their magazine and the inward rush of the four thousand from the marsh outside  why pain your gentle ears with details of slaughter a few fearful minutes sufficed to exterminate my bewildered and unarmed countrymen to bind the only survivors miranda innocent cause of the whole tragedy and four other women with their infants and to lead them away in triumph across the forest towards the indian town  stunned by the suddenness of the evils which had passed and still more by the thought of those worse which were to come as she too well foresaw miranda travelled all night through the forest and was brought in triumph at daydawn before the indian king to receive her doom judge of her astonishment when on looking up she saw that he was not mangora  a ray of hope flashed across her and she asked where he was  he was slain last night said the king and i his brother siripa am now cacique of the timbuez  it was true lara maddened with drink rage and wounds had caught up his sword rushed into the thick of the fight singled out the traitor and slain him on the spot and then forgetting safety in revenge had continued to plunge his sword into the corpse heedless of the blows of the savages till he fell pierced with a hundred wounds  a ray of hope as i said flashed across the wretched miranda for a moment but the next she found that she had been freed from one bandit only to be delivered to another  yes said the new king in broken spanish my brother played a bold stake and lost it but it was well worth the risk and he showed his wisdom thereby you cannot be his queen now you must content yourself with being mine  miranda desperate answered him with every fierce taunt which she could invent against his treachery and his crime and asked him how he came to dream that the wife of a christian spaniard would condescend to become the mistress of a heathen savage hoping unhappy lady to exasperate him into killing her on the spot but in vain she only prolonged thereby her own misery for whether it was ladies that the novel sight of divine virtue and beauty awed as it may have awed me ere now where it had just before maddened or whether some dream crossed the savage as it may have crossed me ere now that he could make the wisdom of a mortal angel help his ambition as well as her beauty his happiness or whether which i will never believe of one of those dark children of the devil though i can boldly assert it of myself some spark of boldness within him made him too proud to take by force what he could not win by persuasion certain it is as the indians themselves confessed afterwards that the savage only answered her by smiles and bidding his men unbind her told her that she was no slave of his and that it only lay with her to become the sovereign of him and all his vassals assigned her a hut to herself loaded her with savage ornaments and for several weeks treated her with no less courtesy so miraculous is the power of love than if he had been a cavalier of castile  three months and more ladies as i have heard passed in this misery and every day miranda grew more desperate of all deliverance and saw staring her in the face nearer and nearer some hideous and shameful end when one day going down with the wives of the cacique to draw water in the river she saw on the opposite bank a white man in a tattered spanish dress with a drawn sword in his hand who had no sooner espied her than shrieking her name he plunged into the stream swam across landed at her feet and clasped her in his arms it was no other ladies incredible as it may seem than don sebastian himself who had returned with ruiz moschera to the tower and found it only a charred and bloodstained heap of ruins  he guessed as by inspiration what had passed and whither his lady was gone and without a thought of danger like a true spanish gentleman and a true spanish lover darted off alone into the forest and guided only by the inspiration of his own loyal heart found again his treasure and found it still unstained and his own  who can describe the joy and who again the terror of their meeting the indian women had fled in fear and for the short ten minutes that the lovers were left together life to be sure was one long kiss but what to do they knew not to go inland was to rush into the enemys arms he would have swum with her across the river and attempted it but his strength worn out with hunger and travel failed him he drew her with difficulty on shore again and sat down by her to await their doom with prayer the first and last resource of virtuous ladies as weapons are of cavaliers  alas for them may no true lovers ever have to weep over joys so soon lost after having been so hardly found for ere a quarter of an hour was passed the indian women who had fled at his approach returned with all the warriors of the tribe don sebastian desperate would fain have slain his wife and himself on the spot but his hand sank againand whose would not but an indiansas he raised it against that fair and faithful breast in a few minutes he was surrounded seized from behind disarmed and carried in triumph into the village and if you cannot feel for him in that misery fair ladies who have known no sorrow yet i a prisoner can  don guzman paused a moment as if overcome by emotion and i will not say that as he paused he did not look to see if rose salternes eyes were on him as indeed they were  yes i can feel with him i can estimate better than you ladies the greatness of that love which could submit to captivity to the loss of his sword to the loss of that honor which next to god and his mother is the true spaniards deity there are those who have suffered that shame at the hands of valiant gentlemen and again don guzman looked up at rose and yet would have sooner died a thousand deaths but he dared to endure it from the hands of villains savages heathens for he was a true spaniard and therefore a true lover but i will go on with my tale  this wretched pair then as i have been told by ruiz moschera himself stood together before the cacique he like a true child of the devil comprehending in a moment who don sebastian was laughed with delight at seeing his rival in his power and bade bind him at once to a tree and shoot him to death with arrows  but the poor miranda sprang forward and threw herself at his feet and with piteous entreaties besought for mercy from him who knew no mercy  and yet love and the sight of her beauty and the terrible eloquence of her words while she invoked on his head the just vengeance of heaven wrought even on his heart nevertheless the pleasure of seeing her who had so long scorned him a suppliant at his feet was too delicate to be speedily foregone and not till she was all but blind with tears and dumb with agony of pleading did he make answer that if she would consent to become his wife her husbands life should be spared she in her haste and madness sobbed out desperately i know not what consent don sebastian who understood if not the language still the meaning so had love quickened his understanding shrieked to her not to lose her precious soul for the sake of his worthless body that death was nothing compared to the horror of that shame and such other words as became a noble and valiant gentleman she shuddering now at her own frailty would have recalled her promise but siripa kept her to it vowing if she disappointed him again such a death to her husband as made her blood run cold to hear of and the wretched woman could only escape for the present by some story that it was not the custom of her race to celebrate nuptials till a month after the betrothment that the anger of heaven would be on her unless she first performed in solitude certain religious rites and lastly that if he dared to lay hands on her husband she would die so resolutely that every drop of water should be deep enough to drown her every thorn sharp enough to stab her to the heart till fearing lest by demanding too much he should lose all and awed too as he had been at first by a voice and looks which seemed to be in comparison with his own divine siripa bade her go back to her hut promising her husband life but promising too that if he ever found the two speaking together even for a moment he would pour out on them both all the cruelty of those tortures in which the devil their father has so perfectly instructed the indians  so don sebastian being stripped of his garments and painted after the indian fashion was set to all mean and toilsome work amid the buffetings and insults of the whole village and this ladies he endured without a murmur ay took delight in enduring it as he would have endured things worse a thousand times only for the sake like a true lover as he was of being near the goddess whom he worshipped and of seeing her now and then afar off happy enough to be repaid even by that for all indignities  and yet you who have loved may well guess as i can that ere a week had passed don sebastian and the lady miranda had found means in spite of all spiteful eyes to speak to each other once and again and to assure each other of their love even to talk of escape before the months grace should be expired and miranda whose heart was full of courage as long as she felt her husband near her went so far as to plan a means of escape which seemed possible and hopeful  for the youngest wife of the cacique who till mirandas coming had been his favorite often talked with the captive insulting and tormenting her in her spite and jealousy and receiving in return only gentle and conciliatory words and one day when the woman had been threatening to kill her miranda took courage to say do you fancy that i shall not be as glad to be rid of your husband as you to be rid of me why kill me needlessly when all that you require is to get me forth of the place out of sight out of mind when i am gone your husband will soon forget me and you will be his favorite as before soon seeing that the girl was inclined to listen she went on to tell her of her love to don sebastian entreating and adjuring her by the love which she bore the cacique to pity and help her and so won upon the girl that she consented to be privy to mirandas escape and even offered to give her an opportunity of speaking to her husband about it and at last was so won over by miranda that she consented to keep all intruders out of the way while don sebastian that very night visited miranda in her hut  the hapless husband thirsting for his love was in that hut be sure the moment that kind darkness covered his stepsand what cheer these two made of each other when they once found themselves together lovers must fancy for themselves but so it was that after many a leavetaking there was no departure and when the night was wellnigh past sebastian and miranda were still talking together as if they had never met before and would never meet again  but it befell ladies would that i was not speaking truth but inventing that i might have invented something merrier for your ears it befell that very night that the young wife of the cacique whose heart was lifted up with the thought that her rival was now at last disposed of tried all her wiles to win back her faithless husband but in vain he only answered her caresses by indifference then by contempt then insults then blows for with the indians woman is always a slave or rather a beast of burden and went on to draw such cruel comparisons between her dark skin and the glorious fairness of the spanish lady that the wretched girl beside herself with rage burst out at last with her own secret fool that you are to madden yourself about a stranger who prizes one hair of her spanish husbands head more than your whole body much does your new bride care for you she is at this moment in her husbands arms  the cacique screamed furiously to know what she meant and she her jealousy and hate of the guiltless lady boiling over once for all bade him if he doubted her go see for himself  what use of many words they were taken love or rather lust repelled turned in a moment into devilish hate and the cacique summoning his indians bade them bind the wretched don sebastian to a tree and there inflicted on him the lingering death to which he had at first been doomed for miranda he had more exquisite cruelty in store and shall i tell it yes ladies for the honor of love and of spain and for a justification of those cruelties against the indians which are so falsely imputed to our most christian nation it shall be told he delivered the wretched lady over to the tender mercies of his wives and what they were is neither fit for me to tell nor you to hear  the two wretched lovers cast themselves upon each others neck drank each others salt tears with the last kisses accused themselves as the cause of each others death and then rising above fear and grief broke out into triumph at thus dying for and with each other and proclaiming themselves the martyrs of love commended their souls to god and then stepped joyfully and proudly to their doom  and what was that asked halfadozen trembling voices  don sebastian as i have said was shot to death with arrows but as for the lady miranda the wretches themselves confessed afterwards when they received due vengeance for their crimes as they did receive it that after all shameful and horrible indignities she was bound to a tree and there burned slowly in her husbands sight stifling her shrieks lest they should wring his heart by one additional pang and never taking her eyes to the last off that beloved face and so died but not unavenged sebastian de hurtado and lucia mirandaa spanish husband and a spanish wife  the don paused and the ladies were silent awhile for indeed there was many a gentle tear to be dried but at last mrs st leger spoke half it seemed to turn off the too painful impression of the overtrue tale the outlines whereof may be still read in old charlevoix  you have told a sad and a noble tale sir and told it well but though your story was to set forth a perfect husband it has ended rather by setting forth a perfect wife  and if i have forgotten madam in praising her to praise him also have i not done that which would have best pleased his heroical and chivalrous spirit he be sure would have forgotten his own virtue in the light of hers and he would have wished me i doubt not to do the same also and beside madam where ladies are the theme who has time or heart to cast one thought upon their slaves and the don made one of his deliberate and highlyfinished bows  don guzman is courtier enough as far as compliments go said one of the young ladies but it was hardly courtierlike of him to find us so sad an entertainment upon a merry evening  yes said another we must ask him for no more stories  or songs either said a third i fear he knows none but about forsaken maidens and despairing lovers  i know nothing at all about forsaken ladies madam because ladies are never forsaken in spain  nor about lovers despairing there i suppose  that good opinion of ourselves madam with which you english are pleased to twit us now and then always prevents so sad a state of mind for myself i have had little to do with love but i have had still less to do with despair and intend by help of heaven to have less  you are valiant sir  you would not have me a coward madam and so forth  now all this time don guzman had been talking at rose salterne and giving her the very slightest hint every now and then that he was talking at her till the poor girls face was almost crimson with pleasure and she gave herself up to the spell he loved her still perhaps he knew that she loved him he must know some day she felt now that there was no escape she was almost glad to think that there was none  the dark handsome stately face the melodious voice with its rich spanish accent the quiet grace of the gestures the wild pathos of the story even the measured and inflated style as of one speaking of another and a loftier world the chivalrous respect and admiration for woman and for faithfulness to womanwhat a man he was if he had been pleasant heretofore he was now enchanting all the ladies round felt that she could see as much as she herself did no not quite as much she hoped she surely understood him and felt for his loneliness more than any of them had she not been feeling for it through long and sad months but it was she whom he was thinking of she whom he was speaking to all along oh why had the tale ended so soon she would gladly have sat and wept her eyes out till midnight over one melodious misery after another but she was quite wise enough to keep her secret to herself and sat behind the rest with greedy eyes and demure lips full of strange and new happinessor misery she knew not which to call it  in the meanwhile as it was ordained cary could see and hear through the window of the hall a good deal of what was going on  how that spanish crocodile ogles the rose whispered he to young st leger  what wonder he is not the first by many a one  aybutby heaven she is making sideshots at him with those languishing eyes of hers the little baggage  what wonder he is not the first say i and wont be the last pass the wine man  i have had enough between sack and singing my head is as mazed as a dizzy sheep let me slip out  not yet man remember you are bound for one song more  so cary against his will sat and sang another song and in the meanwhile the party had broken up and wandered away by twos and threes among trim gardens and pleasaunces and clipped yewwalks       where westwinds with musky wing      about the cedarn alleys fling      nard and cassias balmy smells  admiring the beauty of that stately place long since passed into other hands and fallen to decay but then if old prince speaks true one of the noblest mansions of the west  at last cary got away and out sober but just enough flushed with wine to be ready for any quarrel and luckily for him had not gone twenty yards along the great terrace before he met lady grenville  has your ladyship seen don guzman  yeswhy where is he he was with me not ten minutes ago you know he is going back to spain  going has his ransom come  yes and with it a governorship in the indies  governorship much good may it do the governed  why not then he is surely a most gallant gentleman  gallant enoughyes said cary carelessly i must find him and congratulate him on his honors  i will help you to find him said lady grenville whose womans eye and ear had already suspected something escort me sir  it is but too great an honor to squire the queen of bideford said cary offering his hand  if i am your queen sir i must be obeyed answered she in a meaning tone cary took the hint and went on chattering cheerfully enough  but don guzman was not to be found in garden or in pleasaunce  perhaps at last said a burghers wife with a toss of her head your ladyship may meet with him at hankfords oak  at hankfords oak what should take him there  pleasant company i reckon with another toss i heard him and mistress salterne talking about the oak just now  cary turned pale and drew in his breath  very likely said lady grenville quietly will you walk with me so far mr cary  to the worlds end if your ladyship condescends so far and off they went lady grenville wishing that they were going anywhere else but afraid to let cary go alone and suspecting too that some one or other ought to go  so they went down past the herds of deer by a trimkept path into the lonely dell where stood the fatal oak and as they went lady grenville to avoid more unpleasant talk poured into carys unheeding ears the story which he probably had heard fifty times before how old chiefjustice hankford whom some contradictory myths make the man who committed prince henry to prison for striking him on the bench weary of life and sickened at the horrors and desolations of the wars of the roses went down to his house at annery there and bade his keeper shoot any man who passing through the deerpark at night should refuse to stand when challenged and then going down into that glen himself and hiding himself beneath that oak met willingly by his keepers hand the death which his own dared not inflict but ere the story was half done cary grasped lady grenvilles hand so tightly that she gave a little shriek of pain  there they are whispered he heedless of her and pointed to the oak where half hidden by the tall fern stood rose and the spaniard  her head was on his bosom she seemed sobbing trembling he talking earnestly and passionately but lady grenvilles little shriek made them both look up to turn and try to escape was to confess all and the two collecting themselves instantly walked towards her rose wishing herself fathoms deep beneath the earth  mind sir whispered lady grenville as they came up you have seen nothing  madam  if you are not on my ground you are on my brothers obey me  cary bit his lip and bowed courteously to the don  i have to congratulate you i hear senor on your approaching departure  i kiss your hands senor in return but i question whether it be a matter of congratulation considering all that i leave behind  so do i answered cary bluntly enough and the four walked back to the house lady grenville taking everything for granted with the most charming good humor and chatting to her three silent companions till they gained the terrace once more and found four or five of the gentlemen with sir richard at their head proceeding to the bowlinggreen  lady grenville in an agony of fear about the quarrel which she knew must come would have gladly whispered five words to her husband but she dared not do it before the spaniard and dreaded too a faint or a scream from the rose whose father was of the party so she walked on with her fair prisoner commanding cary to escort them in and the spaniard to go to the bowlinggreen  cary obeyed but he gave her the slip the moment she was inside the door and then darted off to the gentlemen  his heart was on fire all his old passion for the rose had flashed up again at the sight of her with a loverand that lover a spaniard he would cut his throat for him if steel could do it only he recollected that salterne was there and shrank from exposing rose and shrank too as every gentleman should from making a public quarrel in another mans house never mind where there was a will there was a way he could get him into a corner and quarrel with him privately about the cut of his beard or the color of his ribbon so in he went and luckily or unluckily found standing together apart from the rest sir richard the don and young st leger  well don guzman you have given us winebibbers the slip this afternoon i hope you have been well employed in the meanwhile  delightfully to myself senor said the don who enraged at being interrupted if not discovered was as ready to fight as cary but disliked of course an explosion as much as he did and to others i doubt not  so the ladies say quoth st leger he has been making them all cry with one of his stories and robbing us meanwhile of the pleasure we had hoped for from some of his spanish songs  the devil take spanish songs said cary in a low voice but loud enough for the spaniard don guzman clapt his hand on his swordhilt instantly  lieutenant cary said sir richard in a stern voice the wine has surely made you forget yourself  as sober as yourself most worshipful knight but if you want a spanish song heres one and a very scurvy one it is like its subject         don desperado         walked on the prado      and there he met his enemy         he pulled out a knife a         and let out his life a      and fled for his own across the sea  and he bowed low to the spaniard  the insult was too gross to require any spluttering  senor cary we meet  i thank your quick apprehension don guzman maria magdalena sotomayor de soto when where and with what weapons  for gods sake gentlemen nephew arthur cary is your guest do you know the meaning of this  st leger was silent cary answered for him  an old irish quarrel i assure you sir a matter of years standing in unlacing the senors helmet the evening that he was taken prisoner i was unlucky enough to twitch his mustachios you recollect the fact of course senor  perfectly said the spaniard and then halfamused and halfpleased in spite of his bitter wrath at carys quickness and delicacy in shielding rose he bowed and  and it gives me much pleasure to find that he whom i trust to have the pleasure of killing tomorrow morning is a gentleman whose nice sense of honor renders him thoroughly worthy of the sword of a de soto  cary bowed in return while sir richard who saw plainly enough that the excuse was feigned shrugged his shoulders  what weapons senor asked will again  i should have preferred a horse and pistols said don guzman after a moment half to himself and in spanish they make surer work of it than bodkins but with a sigh and one of his smiles beggars must not be choosers  the best horse in my stable is at your service senor said sir richard grenville instantly  and in mine also senor said cary and i shall be happy to allow you a week to train him if he does not answer at first to a spanish hand  you forget in your courtesy gentle sir that the insult being with me the time lies with me also we wipe it off tomorrow morning with simple rapiers and daggers who is your second  mr arthur st leger here senor who is yours  the spaniard felt himself alone in the world for one moment and then answered with another of his smiles  your nation possesses the soul of honor he who fights an englishman needs no second  and he who fights among englishmen will always find one said sir richard i am the fittest second for my guest  you only add one more obligation illustrious cavalier to a twoyears prodigality of favors which i shall never be able to repay  but nephew arthur said grenville you cannot surely be second against your fathers guest and your own uncle  i cannot help it sir i am bound by an oath as will can tell you i suppose you wont think it necessary to let me blood  you half deserve it sirrah said sir richard who was very angry but the don interposed quickly  heaven forbid senors we are no french duellists who are mad enough to make four or six lives answer for the sins of two this gentleman and i have quarrel enough between us i suspect to make a right bloody encounter  the dependence is good enough sir said cary licking his sinful lips at the thought very well rapiers and shirts at three tomorrow morningis that the bill of fare ask sir richard where atty it is against punctilio now for me to speak to him till after i am killed  on the sands opposite the tide will be out at three and now gallant gentlemen let us join the bowlers  and so they went back and spent a merry evening all except poor rose who ere she went back had poured all her sorrows into lady grenvilles ear for the kind woman knowing that she was motherless and guileless carried her off into mrs st legers chamber and there entreated her to tell the truth and heaped her with pity but with no comfort for indeed what comfort was there to give                          three oclock upon a still pure bright midsummer morning a broad and yellow sheet of ribbed tidesands through which the shallow river wanders from one hillfoot to the other whispering round dark knolls of rock and under low treefringed cliffs and banks of golden broom a mile below the long bridge and the white walled town all sleeping pearly in the soft haze beneath a cloudless vault of blue the white glare of dawn which last night hung high in the northwest has travelled now to the northeast and above the wooded wall of the hills the sky is flushing with rose and amber  a long line of gulls goes wailing up inland the rooks from annery come cawing and sporting round the corner at landcross while high above them four or five herons flap solemnly along to find their breakfast on the shallows the pheasants and partridges are clucking merrily in the long wet grass every copse and hedgerow rings with the voice of birds but the lark who has been singing since midnight in the blank height of the dark suddenly hushes his carol and drops headlong among the corn as a broadwinged buzzard swings from some wooded peak into the abyss of the valley and hangs highpoised above the heavenward songster the air is full of perfume sweet clover newmown hay the fragrant breath of kine the dainty scent of seaweed wreaths and fresh wet sand glorious day glorious place bridal of earth and sky decked well with bridal garlands bridal perfumes bridal songswhat do those four cloaked figures there by the river brink a dark spot on the fair face of the summer morn  yet one is as cheerful as if he too like all nature round him were going to a wedding and that is will cary he has been bathing down below to cool his brain and steady his hand and he intends to stop don guzman maria magdalena sotomayor de sotos wooing for ever and a day the spaniard is in a very different mood fierce and haggard he is pacing up and down the sand he intends to kill will cary but then will he be the nearer to rose by doing so can he stay in bideford will she go with him shall he stoop to stain his family by marrying a burghers daughter it is a confused all but desperate business and don guzman is certain but of one thing that he is madly in love with this fair witch and that if she refuse him then rather than see her accept another man he would kill her with his own hands  sir richard grenville too is in no very pleasant humor as st leger soon discovers when the two seconds begin whispering over their arrangements  we cannot have either of them killed arthur  mr cary swears he will kill the spaniard sir  he shant the spaniard is my guest i am answerable for him to leigh and for his ransom too and how can leigh accept the ransom if the man is not given up safe and sound they wont pay for a dead carcass boy the mans life is worth two hundred pounds  a very bad bargain sir for those who pay the said two hundred for the rascal but what if he kills cary  worse still cary must not be killed i am very angry with him but he is too good a lad to be lost and his father would never forgive us we must strike up their swords at the first scratch  it will make them very mad sir  hang them let them fight us then if they dont like our counsel it must be arthur  be sure sir said arthur that whatsoever you shall command i shall perform it is only too great an honor to a young man as i am to find myself in the same duel with your worship and to have the advantage of your wisdom and experience  sir richard smiles and saysnow gentlemen are you ready  the spaniard pulls out a little crucifix and kisses it devoutly smiting on his breast crosses himself two or three times and saysmost willingly senor  cary kisses no crucifix but says a prayer nevertheless  cloaks and doublets are tossed off the men placed the rapiers measured hilt and point sir richard and st leger place themselves right and left of the combatants facing each other the points of their drawn swords on the sand cary and the spaniard stand for a moment quite upright their swordarms stretched straight before them holding the long rapier horizontally the left hand clutching the dagger close to their breasts so they stand eye to eye with clenched teeth and pale crushed lips while men might count a score st leger can hear the beating of his own heart sir richard is praying inwardly that no life may be lost suddenly there is a quick turn of carys wrist and a leap forward the spaniards dagger flashes and the rapier is turned aside cary springs six feet back as the spaniard rushes on him in turn parry thrust parrythe steel rattles the sparks fly the men breathe fierce and loud the devils game is begun in earnest  five minutes have the two had instant death a short six inches off from those wild sinful hearts of theirs and not a scratch has been given yes the spaniards rapier passes under carys left arm he bleeds  a hit a hit strike up atty and the swords are struck up instantly  cary nettled by the smart tries to close with his foe but the seconds cross their swords before him  it is enough gentlemen don guzmans honor is satisfied  but not my revenge senor says the spaniard with a frown this duel is a loutrance on my part and i believe on mr carys also  by heaven it is says will trying to push past let me go arthur st leger one of us must down let me go i say  if you stir mr cary you have to do with richard grenville thunders the lion voice i am angry enough with you for having brought on this duel at all dont provoke me still further young hothead  cary stops sulkily  you do not know all sir richard or you would not speak in this way  i do sir all and i shall have the honor of talking it over with don guzman myself  hey said the spaniard you came here as my second sir richard as i understood but not as my counsellor  arthur take your man away cary obey me as you would your father sir can you not trust richard grenville  come away for gods sake says poor arthur dragging carys sword from him sir richard must know best  so cary is led off sulking and sir richard turns to the spaniard  and now don guzman allow me though much against my will to speak to you as a friend to a friend you will pardon me if i say that i cannot but have seen last nights devotion to  you will be pleased senor not to mention the name of any lady to whom i may have shown devotion i am not accustomed to have my little affairs talked over by any unbidden counsellors  well senor if you take offence you take that which is not given only i warn you with all apologies for any seeming forwardness that the quest on which you seem to be is one on which you will not be allowed to proceed  and who will stop me asked the spaniard with a fierce oath  you are not aware illustrious senor said sir richard parrying the question that our english laity look upon mixed marriages with full as much dislike as your own ecclesiastics  marriage sir who gave you leave to mention that word to me  sir richards brow darkened the spaniard in his insane pride had forced upon the good knight a suspicion which was not really just  is it possible then senor don guzman that i am to have the shame of mentioning a baser word  mention what you will sir all words are the same to me for just or unjust i shall answer them alike only by my sword  you will do no such thing sir you forget that i am your host  and do you suppose that you have therefore a right to insult me stand on your guard sir  grenville answered by slapping his own rapier home into the sheath with a quiet smile  senor don guzman must be well enough aware of who richard grenville is to know that he may claim the right of refusing duel to any man if he shall so think fit  sir cried the spaniard with an oath this is too much do you dare to hint that i am unworthy of your sword know insolent englishman i am not merely a de soto though that by st james were enough for you or any man i am a sotomayor a mendoza a bovadilla a losada asir i have blood royal in my veins and you dare to refuse my challenge  richard grenville can show quarterings probably against even don guzman maria magdalena sotomayor de soto or against with no offence to the unquestioned nobility of your pedigree the bluest blood of spain but he can show moreover thank god a reputation which raises him as much above the imputation of cowardice as it does above that of discourtesy if you think fit senor to forget what you have just in very excusable anger vented and to return with me you will find me still as ever your most faithful servant and host if otherwise you have only to name whither you wish your mails to be sent and i shall with unfeigned sorrow obey your commands concerning them  the spaniard bowed stiffly answered to the nearest tavern senor and then strode away his baggage was sent thither he took a boat down to appledore that very afternoon and vanished none knew whither a very courteous note to lady grenville enclosing the jewel which he had been used to wear round his neck was the only memorial he left behind him except indeed the scar on carys arm and poor roses broken heart  now county towns are scandalous places at best and though all parties tried to keep the duel secret yet of course before noon all bideford knew what had happened and a great deal more and what was even worse rose in an agony of terror had seen sir richard grenville enter her fathers private room and sit there closeted with him for an hour and more and when he went upstairs came old salterne with his stick in his hand and after rating her soundly for far worse than a flirt gave her i am sorry to have to say it but such was the mild fashion of paternal rule in those times even over such daughters as lady jane grey if roger ascham is to be believed such a beating that her poor sides were black and blue for many a day and then putting her on a pillion behind him carried her off twenty miles to her old prison at stow mill commanding her aunt to tame down her saucy blood with bread of affliction and water of affliction which commands were willingly enough fulfilled by the old dame who had always borne a grudge against rose for being rich while she was poor and pretty while her daughter was plain so that between flouts and sneers and watchings and pretty open hints that she was a disgrace to her family and no better than she should be the poor innocent child watered her couch with her tears for a fortnight or more stretching out her hands to the wide atlantic and calling wildly to don guzman to return and take her where he would and she would live for him and die for him and perhaps she did not call in vain    chapter xiii  how the golden hind came home again       the spirits of your fathers        shall start from every wave      for the deck it was their field of fame        and ocean was their grave                                  campbell  so you see my dear mrs hawkins having the silver as your own eyes show you beside the ores of lead manganese and copper and above all this gossan as the cornish call it which i suspect to be not merely the matrix of the ore but also the very crude form and materia prima of all metalsyou mark meif my recipes which i had from doctor dee succeed only half so well as i expect then i refine out the luna the silver lay it by and transmute the remaining ores into sol gold whereupon peru and mexico become superfluities and england the mistress of the globe strange no doubt distant no doubt but possible my dear madam possible  and what good to you if it be mr gilbert if you could find a philosophers stone to turn sinners into saints nowbut naught save gods grace can do that and that last seems ofttimes over long in coming and mrs hawkins sighed  but indeed my dear madam conceive nowthe comb martin mine thus becomes a gold mine perhaps inexhaustible yields me wherewithal to carry out my northwest patent meanwhile my brother humphrey holds newfoundland and builds me fresh ships year by year for the forests of pine are boundless for my china voyage  sir humphrey has better thoughts in his dear heart than gold mr adrian a very close and gracious walker he has been this seven year i wish my captain john were so too  and how do you know i have naught better in my minds eye than gold or indeed what better could i have is not gold the spaniards strengththe very mainspring of antichrist by gold only therefore can we outwrestle him you shake your head but say dear madam for gold england must have which is better to make gold bloodlessly at home or take it bloodily abroad  oh mr gilbert mr gilbert is it not written that those who make haste to be rich pierce themselves through with many sorrows oh mr gilbert gods blessing is not on it all  not on you madam be sure that brave captain john hawkinss star told me a different tale when i cast his nativity for himborn under stormy planets truly but under right royal and fortunate ones  ah mr adrian i am a simple body and you a great philosopher but i hold there is no star for the seaman like the star of bethlehem and that goes with peace on earth and good will to men and not with such arms as that mr adrian i cant abide to look upon them  and she pointed up to one of the bosses of the ribbed oakroof on which was emblazoned the fatal crest which clarencieux hervey had granted years before to her husband the demimoor proper bound  ah mr gilbert since first he went to guinea after those poor negroes little lightness has my heart known and the very day that that crest was put up in our grand new house as the parson read the first lesson there was this text in it mr gilbert woe to him that buildeth his house by iniquity and his chambers by wrong shalt thou live because thou closest thyself in cedar and it went into my ears like fire mr gilbert and into my heart like lead and when the parson went on did not thy father eat and drink and do judgment and justice then it was well with him i thought of good old captain will andi tell you mr gilbert those negroes are on my soul from morning until night we are all mighty grand now and money comes in fast but the lord will require the blood of them at our hands yet he will  my dearest madam who can prosper more than you if your husband copied the dons too closely once or twice in the matter of those negroes which i do not deny was he not punished at once when he lost ships men all but life at st juan dulloa  ay yes she said and that did give me a bit of comfort especially when the queengod save her tender heartwas so sharp with him for pity of the poor wretches but it has not mended him he is growing fast like the rest now mr gilbert greedy to win and niggardly to spend god forgive him and always fretting and plotting for some new gain and envying and grudging at drake and all who are deeper in the snare of prosperity than he is gold gold nothing but gold in every mouththere it is ah i mind when plymouth was a quiet little godfearing place as god could smile upon but ever since my john and sir francis and poor mr oxenham found out the way to the indies its been a sad place not a sailors wife but is crying give give like the daughters of the horseleech and every woman must drive her husband out across seas to bring her home money to squander on hoods and farthingales and go mincing with outstretched necks and wanton eyes and they will soon learn to do worse than that for the sake of gain but the lords hand will be against their tires and crispingpins their mufflers and farthingales as it was against the jews of old ah dear me  the two interlocutors in this dialogue were sitting in a low oakpanelled room in plymouth town handsomely enough furnished adorned with carving and gilding and coats of arms and noteworthy for many strange knickknacks spanish gold and silver vessels on the sideboard strange birds and skins and charts and rough drawings of coast which hung about the room while over the fireplace above the portrait of old captain will hawkins pet of henry the eighth hung the spanish ensign which captain john had taken in fair fight at rio de la hacha fifteen years before when with two hundred men he seized the town in despite of ten hundred spanish soldiers and watered his ship triumphantly at the enemys wells  the gentleman was a tall fair man with a broad and lofty forehead wrinkled with study and eyes weakened by long poring over the crucible and the furnace  the lady had once been comely enough but she was aged and worn as sailors wives are apt to be by many sorrows many a sad day had she had already for although john hawkins portadmiral of plymouth and patriarch of british shipbuilders was a faithful husband enough and as ready to forgive as he was to quarrel yet he was obstinate and ruthless and in spite of his religiosity for all men were religious then was by no means a consistent walker  and sadder days were in store for her poor soul nine years hence she would be asked to name her sons brave new ship and would christen it the repentance giving no reason in her quiet steadfast way so says her son sir richard but that repentance was the best ship in which we could sail to the harbor of heaven and she would hear that queen elizabeth complaining of the name for an unlucky one had rechristened her the dainty not without some byquip perhaps at the character of her most dainty captain richard hawkins the complete seaman and euphuist afloat of whom perhaps more hereafter  with sad eyes mrs then lady hawkins would see that gallant bark sail westwardho to go the world around as many another ship sailed and then wait as many a mother beside had waited for the sail which never returned till dim and uncertain came tidings of her boy fighting for four days three great armadas for the coxcomb had his fathers heart in him after all a prisoner wounded ruined languishing for weary years in spanish prisons and a sadder day than that was in store when a gallant fleet should round the ram head not with drum and trumpet but with solemn minuteguns and all flags halfmast high to tell her that her terrible husbands work was done his terrible heart broken by failure and fatigue and his body laid by drakes beneath the faroff tropic seas  and if at the close of her eventful life one gleam of sunshine opened for a while when her boy richard returned to her bosom from his spanish prison to be knighted for his valor and made a privy councillor for his wisdom yet soon how soon was the old cloud to close in again above her until her weary eyes should open in the light of paradise for that son dropped dead some say at the very counciltable leaving behind him naught but broken fortunes and huge purposes which never were fulfilled and the stormy star of that bold race was set forever and lady hawkins bowed her weary head and died the groan of those stolen negroes ringing in her ears having lived long enough to see her husbands youthful sin become a national institution and a national curse for generations yet unborn  i know not why she opened her heart that night to adrian gilbert with a frankness which she would hardly have dared to use to her own family perhaps it was that adrian like his great brothers humphrey and raleigh was a man full of all lofty and delicate enthusiasms tender and poetical such as women cling to when their hearts are lonely but so it was and adrian half ashamed of his own ambitious dreams sate looking at her a while in silence and then  the lord be with you dearest lady strange how you women sit at home to love and suffer while we men rush forth to break our hearts and yours against rocks of our own seeking ah well were it not for scripture i should have thought that adam rather than eve had been the one who plucked the fruit of the forbidden tree  we women i fear did the deed nevertheless for we bear the doom of it our lives long  you always remind me madam of my dear mrs leigh of burrough and her counsels  do you see her often i hear of her as one of the lords most precious vessels  i would have done more ere now than see her said he with a blush had she allowed me but she lives only for the memory of her husband and the fame of her noble sons  as he spoke the door opened and in walked wrapped in his rough seagown none other than one of those said noble sons  adrian turned pale  amyas leigh what brings you hither how fares my brother where is the ship  your brother is well mr gilbert the golden hind is gone on to dartmouth with mr hayes i came ashore here meaning to go north to bideford ere i went to london i called at drakes just now but he was away  the golden hind what brings her home so soon  yet welcome ever sir said mrs hawkins this is a great surprise though captain john did not look for you till next year  amyas was silent  something is wrong cried adrian speak  amyas tried but could not  will you drive a man mad sir has the adventure failed you said my brother was well  he is well  then whatwhy do you look at me in that fashion sir and springing up adrian rushed forward and held the candle to amyass face  amyass lip quivered as he laid his hand on adrians shoulder  your great and glorious brother sir is better bestowed than in settling newfoundland  dead shrieked adrian  he is with the god whom he served  he was always with him like enoch parable me no parables if you love me sir  and like enoch he was not for god took him  adrian clasped his hands over his forehead and leaned against the table  go on sir go on god will give me strength to hear all  and gradually amyas opened to adrian that tragic story which mr hayes has long ago told far too well to allow a second edition of it from me of the unruliness of the men ruffians as i said before caught up at haphazard of conspiracies to carry off the ships plunder of fishing vessels desertions multiplying daily licenses from the general to the lazy and fearful to return home till adrian broke out with a groan  from him conspired against him deserted from him dotards buzzards where would they have found such another leader  your illustrious brother sir said amyas if you will pardon me was a very great philosopher but not so much of a general  general sir where was braver man  not on gods earth but that does not make a general sir if cortez had been brave and no more mexico would have been mexico still the truth is sir cortez like my captain drake knew when to hang a man and your great brother did not  amyas as i suppose was right gilbert was a man who could be angry enough at baseness or neglect but who was too kindly to punish it he was one who could form the wisest and bestdigested plans but who could not stoop to that hailfellowwellmet drudgery among his subordinates which has been the talisman of great captains  then amyas went on to tell the rest of his story the setting sail from st johns to discover the southward coast sir humphreys chivalrous determination to go in the little squirrel of only ten tons and overcharged with nettings fights and small ordnance not only because she was more fit to examine the creeks but because he had heard of some taunt against him among the men that he was afraid of the sea  after that woe on woe how seven days after they left cape raz their largest ship the delight after she had most part of the night i quote hayes like the swan that singeth before her death continued in sounding of trumpets drums and fifes also winding of the comets and hautboys and in the end of their jollity left off with the battle and doleful knells struck the next day the golden hind and the squirrel sheering off just in time upon unknown shoals where were lost all but fourteen and among them franks philosopher friend poor budaeus and those who escaped after all horrors of cold and famine were cast on shore in newfoundland how worn out with hunger and want of clothes the crews of the two remaining ships persuaded sir humphrey to sail toward england on the 31st of august and on that very instant even in winding about beheld close alongside a very lion in shape hair and color not swimming but sliding on the water with his whole body who passed along turning his head to and fro yawning and gaping wide with ugly demonstration of long teeth and glaring eyes and to bid us farewell coming right against the hind he sent forth a horrible voice roaring or bellowing as doth a lion what opinion others had thereof and chiefly the general himself i forbear to deliver but he took it for bonum omen rejoicing that he was to war against such an enemy if it were the devil  and the devil it was doubtless said adrian the roaring lion who goes about seeking whom he may devour  he has not got your brother at least quoth amyas  no rejoined mrs hawkins smile not reader for those were days in which men believed in the devil he roared for joy to think how many poor souls would be left still in heathen darkness by sir humphreys death god be with that good knight and send all mariners where he is now  then amyas told the last scene how when they were off the azores the storms came on heavier than ever with terrible seas breaking short and pyramidwise till on the 9th september the tiny squirrel nearly foundered and yet recovered and the general sitting abaft with a book in his hand cried out to us in the hind so oft as we did approach within hearing we are as near heaven by sea as by land reiterating the same speech well beseeming a soldier resolute in jesus christ as i can testify he was  the same monday about twelve of the clock or not long after the frigate the squirrel being ahead of us in the golden hind suddenly her lights were out and withal our watch cried the general was cast away which was true for in that moment the frigate was devoured and swallowed up of the sea  and so ended i have used hayes own words amyas leighs story  oh my brother my brother moaned poor adrian the glory of his house the glory of devon  ah what will the queen say asked mrs hawkins through her tears  tell me asked adrian had he the jewel on when he died  the queens jewel he always wore that and his own posy too mutare vel timere sperno he wore it and he lived it  ay said adrian the same to the last  not quite that said amyas he was a meeker man latterly than he used to be as he said himself once a better refiner than any whom he had on board had followed him close all the seas over and purified him in the fire and gold seven times tried he was when god having done his work in him took him home at last  and so the talk ended there was no doubt that the expedition had been an utter failure adrian was a ruined man and amyas had lost his venture  adrian rose and begged leave to retire he must collect himself  poor gentleman said mrs hawkins it is little else he has left to collect  or i either said amyas i was going to ask you to lend me one of your sons shirts and five pounds to get myself and my men home  five fifty mr leigh god forbid that john hawkinss wife should refuse her last penny to a distressed mariner and he a gentleman born but you must eat and drink  its more than i have done for many a day worth speaking of  and amyas sat down in his rags to a good supper while mrs hawkins told him all the news which she could of his mother whom adrian gilbert had seen a few months before in london and then went on naturally enough to the bideford news  and by the by captain leigh ive sad news for you from your place and i had it from one who was there at the time you must know a spanish captain a prisoner  what the one i sent home from smerwick  you sent mercy on us then perhaps youve heard  how can i have heard what  that hes gone off the villain  without paying his ransom  i cant say that but theres a poor innocent young maid gone off with him one salternes daughterthe popish serpent  rose salterne the mayors daughter the rose of torridge  thats her bless your dear soul what ails you  amyas had dropped back in his seat as if he had been shot but he recovered himself before kind mrs hawkins could rush to the cupboard for cordials  youll forgive me madam but im weak from the sea and your good ale has turned me a bit dizzy i think  ay yes tis too too heavy till youve been on shore a while try the aqua vitae my captain john has it right good and a bit too fond of it too poor dear soul between whiles heaven forgive him  so she poured some strong brandy and water down amyass throat in spite of his refusals and sent him to bed but not to sleep and after a night of tossing he started for bideford having obtained the means for so doing from mrs hawkins    chapter xiv  how salvation yeo slew the king of the gubbings       ignorance and evil even in full flight deal terrible backhanded      strokes at their pursuershelps  now i am sorry to say for the honor of my country that it was by no means a safe thing in those days to travel from plymouth to the north of devon because to get to your journeys end unless you were minded to make a circuit of many miles you must needs pass through the territory of a foreign and hostile potentate who had many times ravaged the dominions and defeated the forces of her majesty queen elizabeth and was named behind his back at least the king of the gubbings so now i dare call them says fuller secured by distance which one of more valor durst not do to their face for fear their fury fall upon him yet hitherto have i met with none who could render a reason of their name we call the shavings of fish which are little worth gubbings and sure it is that they are sensible that the word importeth shame and disgrace  as for the suggestion of my worthy and learned friend mr joseph maynard that such as did inhabitare montes gibberosos were called gubbings such will smile at the ingenuity who dissent from the truth of the etymology  i have read of an england beyond wales but the gubbings land is a scythia within england and they pure heathens therein it lieth nigh brent for in the edge of dartmoor it is reported that some two hundred years since two bad women being with child fled thither to hide themselves to whom certain lewd fellows resorted and this was their first original they are a peculiar of their own making exempt from bishop archdeacon and all authority either ecclesiastical or civil they live in cots rather holes than houses like swine having all in common multiplied without marriage into many hundreds their language is the dross of the dregs of the vulgar devonian and the more learned a man is the worse he can understand them during our civil wars no soldiers were quartered upon them for fear of being quartered amongst them their wealth consisteth in other mens goods they live by stealing the sheep on the moors and vain is it for any to search their houses being a work beneath the pains of any sheriff and above the power of any constable such is their fleetness they will outrun many horses vivaciousness they outlive most men living in an ignorance of luxury the extinguisher of life they hold together like bees offend one and all will revenge his quarrel  but now i am informed that they begin to be civilized and tender their children to baptism and return to be men yea christians again i hope no civil people amongst us will turn barbarians now these barbarians begin to be civilized        fuller p 398  with which quip against the anabaptists of his day fuller ends his story and i leave him to set forth how amyas in fear of these same scythians and heathens rode out of plymouth on a right good horse in his full suit of armor carrying lance and sword and over and above two great dags or horsepistols and behind him salvation yeo and five or six north devon men who had served with him in ireland and were returning on furlough clad in headpieces and quilted jerkins each man with his pike and sword and yeo with arquebuse and match while two sumpter ponies carried the baggage of this formidable troop  they pushed on as fast as they could through tavistock to reach before nightfall lydford where they meant to sleep but what with buying the horses and other delays they had not been able to start before noon and night fell just as they reached the frontiers of the enemys country a dreary place enough it was by the wild glare of sunset a high tableland of heath banked on the right by the crags and hills of dartmoor and sloping away to the south and west toward the foot of the great cone of brenttor which towered up like an extinct volcano as some say that it really is crowned with the tiny church the votive offering of some plymouth merchant of old times who vowed in sore distress to build a church to the blessed virgin on the first point of english land which he should see far away down those waste slopes they could see the tiny threads of blue smoke rising from the dens of the gubbings and more than once they called a halt to examine whether distant furzebushes and ponies might not be the patrols of an advancing army it is all very well to laugh at it now in the nineteenth century but it was no laughing matter then as they found before they had gone two miles farther  on the middle of the down stood a wayside inn a desolate and villainouslooking lump of lichenspotted granite with windows paperpatched and rotting thatch kept down by stones and strawbanks and at the back a rambling courtledge of barns and walls around which pigs and barefoot children grunted in loving communion of dirt at the door rapt apparently in the contemplation of the mountain peaks which glowed rich orange in the last lingering sunrays but really watching which way the sheep on the moor were taking stood the innkeeper a brawny soddenvisaged bleareyed six feet of brutishness holding up his hose with one hand for want of points and clawing with the other his elflocks on which a fair sprinkling of feathers might denote first that he was just out of bed having been out sheepstealing all the night before and secondly that by natural genius he had anticipated the opinion of that great apostle of sluttishness fridericus dedekind and his faithful disciple dekker which last speaks thus to all gulls and grobians consider that as those trees of cobweb lawn woven by spinners in the fresh may mornings do dress the curled heads of the mountains and adorn the swelling bosoms of the valleys or as those snowy fleeces which the naked briar steals from the innocent sheep to make himself a warm winter livery are to either of them both an excellent ornament so make thou account that to have feathers sticking here and there on thy head will embellish thee and set thy crown out rarely none dare upbraid thee that like a beggar thou hast lain on straw or like a travelling pedlar upon musty flocks for those feathers will rise up as witnesses to choke him that says so and to prove thy bed to have been of the softest down even so did those feathers bear witness that the possessor of rogues harbor inn on brenttor down whatever else he lacked lacked not geese enough to keep him in soft lying  presently he spies amyas and his party coming slowly over the hill pricks up his ears and counts them sees amyass armor shakes his head and grunts and then being a man of few words utters a sleepy howl  mirooifushing pooale  a strapping lasswhose only covering for country women at work in those days dispensed with the ornament of a gown is a green bodice and red petticoat neither of them over amplebrings out his fishingrod and basket and the man having tied up his hose with some ends of string examines the footlink  don vlies gone  may be says mary shouldnt hay left mun out to coort may be old hens ate mun off i see her chocking about a while agone  the host receives this intelligence with an oath and replies by a violent blow at marys head which she accustomed to such slight matters dodges and then returns the blow with good effect on the shock head  whereon mine host equally accustomed to such slight matters quietly shambles off howling as he departs  tell patrico  mary runs in combs her hair slips a pair of stockings and her best gown over her dirt and awaits the coming guests who make a few long faces at the mucksy sort of a place but prefer to spend the night there than to bivouac close to the enemys camp  so the old hen who has swallowed the dun fly is killed plucked and roasted and certain black dartmoor mutton is put on the gridiron and being compelled to confess the truth by that fiery torment proclaims itself to all noses as reddeer venison in the meanwhile amyas has put his horse and the ponies into a shed to which he can find neither lock nor key and therefore returns grumbling not without fear for his steeds safety the baggage is heaped in a corner of the room and amyas stretches his legs before a turf fire while yeo who has his notions about the place posts himself at the door and the men are seized with a desire to superintend the cooking probably to be attributed to the fact that mary is cook  presently yeo comes in again  theres a gentleman just coming up sir all alone  ask him to make one of our party then with my compliments yeo goes out and returns in five minutes  please sir hes gone in back ways by the court  well he has an odd taste if he makes himself at home here  out goes yeo again and comes back once more after five minutes in high excitement  come out sir for goodness sake come out ive got him safe as a rat in a trap i have  who  a jesuit sir  nonsense man  i tell you truth sir i went round the house for i didnt like the looks of him as he came up i knew he was one of them villains the minute he came up by the way he turned in his toes and put down his feet so still and careful like as if he was afraid of offending god at every step so i just put my eye between the wall and the dern of the gate and i saw him come up to the back door and knock and call mary quite still like any jesuit and the wench flies out to him ready to eat him and go away i heard her say theres a dear man and then something about a queer cuffin thats a justice in these canters thieves latin and with that he takes out a somewhatill swear it was one of those popish agnusesand gives it her and she kisses it and crosses herself and asks him if thats the right way and then puts it into her bosom and he says bless you my daughter and then i was sure of the dog and he slips quite still to the stable and peeps in and when he sees no one there in he goes and out i go and shut to the door and back a cart that was there up against it and call out one of the men to watch the stable and the girls crying like mad  what a fools trick man how do you know that he is not some honest gentleman after all  fool or none sir honest gentlemen dont give maidens agnuses ive put him in and if you want him let out again you must come and do it yourself for my conscience is against it sir if the lords enemies are delivered into my hand im answerable sir went on yeo as amyas hurried out with him tis written if any let one of them go his life shall be for the life of him  so amyas ran out pulled back the cart grumbling opened the door and began a string of apologies tohis cousin eustace  yes here he was with such a countenance half foolish half venomous as reynard wears when the last spadeful of earth is thrown back and he is revealed sitting disconsolately on his tail within a yard of the terriers noses  neither cousin spoke for a minute or two at last amyas  well cousin hideandseek how long have you added horsestealing to your other trades  my dear amyas said eustace very meekly i may surely go into an inn stable without intending to steal what is in it  of course old fellow said amyas mollified i was only in jest but what brings you here not prudence certainly  i am bound to know no prudence save for the lords work  thats giving away agnus deis and deceiving poor heathen wenches i suppose said yeo  eustace answered pretty roundly  heathens yes truly you protestants leave these poor wretches heathens and then insult and persecute those who with a devotion unknown to you labor at the danger of their lives to make them christians mr amyas leigh you can give me up to be hanged at exeter if it shall so please you to disgrace your own family but from this spot neither you no nor all the myrmidons of your queen shall drive me while there is a soul here left unsaved  come out of the stable at least said amyas you dont want to make the horses papists as well as the asses do you come out man and go to the devil your own way i shant inform against you and yeo here will hold his tongue if i tell him i know  it goes sorely against my conscience sir but being that he is your cousin of course  of course and now come in and eat with me suppers just ready and bygones shall be bygones if you will have them so  how much forgiveness eustace felt in his heart i know not but he knew of course that he ought to forgive and to go in and eat with amyas was to perform an act of forgiveness and for the best of motives too for by it the cause of the church might be furthered and acts and motives being correct what more was needed so in he went and yet he never forgot that scar upon his cheek and amyas could not look him in the face but eustace must fancy that his eyes were on the scar and peep up from under his lids to see if there was any smile of triumph on that honest visage they talked away over the venison guardedly enough at first but as they went on amyass straightforward kindliness warmed poor eustaces frozen heart and ere they were aware they found themselves talking over old haunts and old passages of their boyhooduncles aunts and cousins and eustace without any sinister intention asked amyas why he was going to bideford while frank and his mother were in london  to tell you the truth i cannot rest till i have heard the whole story about poor rose salterne  what about her cried eustace  do you not know  how should i know anything here for heavens sake what has happened  amyas told him wondering at his eagerness for he had never had the least suspicion of eustaces love  eustace shrieked aloud  fool fool that i have been caught in my own trap villain villain that he is after all he promised me at lundy  and springing up eustace stamped up and down the room gnashing his teeth tossing his head from side to side and clutching with outstretched hands at the empty air with the horrible gesture heaven grant that no reader has ever witnessed it of that despair which still seeks blindly for the object which it knows is lost forever  amyas sat thunderstruck his first impulse was to ask lundy what knew you of him what had he or you to do at lundy but pity conquered curiosity  oh eustace and you then loved her too  dont speak to me loved her yes sir and had as good a right to love her as any one of your precious brotherhood of the rose dont speak to me i say or i shall do you a mischief  so eustace knew of the brotherhood too amyas longed to ask him how but what use in that if he knew it he knew it and what harm so he only answered  my good cousin why be wroth with me if you really love her now is the time to take counsel with me how best we shall  eustace did not let him finish his sentence conscious that he had betrayed himself upon more points than one he stopped short in his walk suddenly collected himself by one great effort and eyed amyas from underneath his brows with the old down look  how best we shall do what my valiant cousin said he in a meaning and halfscornful voice what does your most chivalrous brotherhood of the rose purpose in such a case  amyas a little nettled stood on his guard in return and answered bluntly  what the brotherhood of the rose will do i cant yet say what it ought to do i have a pretty sure guess  so have i to hunt her down as you would an outlaw because forsooth she has dared to love a catholic to murder her lover in her arms and drag her home again stained with his blood to be forced by threats and persecution to renounce that church into whose maternal bosom she has doubtless long since found rest and holiness  if she has found holiness it matters little to me where she has found it master eustace but that is the very point that i should be glad to know for certain  and you will go and discover for yourself  have you no wish to discover it also  and if i had what would that be to you  only said amyas trying hard to keep his temper that if we had the same purpose we might sail in the same ship  you intend to sail then  i mean simply that we might work together  our paths lie on very different roads sir  i am afraid you never spoke a truer word sir in the meanwhile ere we part be so kind as to tell me what you meant by saying that you had met this spaniard at lundy  i shall refuse to answer that  you will please to recollect eustace that however good friends we have been for the last halfhour you are in my power i have a right to know the bottom of this matter and by heaven i will know it  in your power see that you are not in mine remember sir that you are within awithin a few miles at least of those who will obey me their catholic benefactor but who owe no allegiance to those protestant authorities who have left them to the lot of the beasts which perish  amyas was very angry he wanted but little more to make him catch eustace by the shoulders shake the life out of him and deliver him into the tender guardianship of yeo but he knew that to take him at all was to bring certain death on him and disgrace on the family and remembering franks conduct on that memorable night at clovelly he kept himself down  take me said eustace if you will sir you who complain of us that we keep no faith with heretics will perhaps recollect that you asked me into this room as your guest and that in your good faith i trusted when i entered it  the argument was a worthless one in law for eustace had been a prisoner before he was a guest and amyas was guilty of something very like misprision of treason in not handing him over to the nearest justice however all he did was to go to the door open it and bowing to his cousin bid him walk out and go to the devil since he seemed to have set his mind on ending his days in the company of that personage  whereon eustace vanished  pooh said amyas to himself i can find out enough and too much i fear without the help of such crooked vermin i must see cary i must see salterne and i suppose if i am ready to do my duty i shall learn somehow what it is now to sleep tomorrow up and away to what god sends  come in hither men shouted he down the passage and sleep here havent you had enough of this villainous sour cider  the men came in yawning and settled themselves to sleep on the floor  wheres yeo  no one knew he had gone out to say his prayers and had not returned  never mind said amyas who suspected some plot on the old mans part hell take care of himself ill warrant him  no fear of that sir and the four tars were soon snoring in concert round the fire while amyas laid himself on the settle with his saddle for a pillow                           it was about midnight when amyas leaped to his feet or rather fell upon his back upsetting saddle settle and finally table under the notion that ten thousand flying dragons were bursting in the window close to his ear with howls most fierce and fell the flying dragons past however being only a flock of terrorstricken geese which flew flapping and screaming round the corner of the house but the noise which had startled them did not pass and another minute made it evident that a sharp fight was going on in the courtyard and that yeo was hallooing lustily for help  out turned the men sword in hand burst the back door open stumbling over pails and pitchers and into the courtyard where yeo his back against the stabledoor was holding his own manfully with sword and buckler against a dozen men  dire and manifold was the screaming geese screamed chickens screamed pigs screamed donkeys screamed mary screamed from an upper window and to complete the chorus a flock of plovers attracted by the noise wheeled round and round overhead and added their screams also to that dutch concert  the screaming went on but the fight ceased for as amyas rushed into the yard the whole party of ruffians took to their heels and vanished over a low hedge at the other end of the yard  are you hurt yeo  not a scratch thank heaven but ive got two of them the ringleaders i have one of thems against the wall your horse did for tother  the wounded man was lifted up a huge ruffian nearly as big as amyas himself yeos sword had passed through his body he groaned and choked for breath  carry him indoors where is the other  dead as a herring in the straw have a care men have a care how you go in the horses are near mad  however the man was brought out after a while with him all was over they could feel neither pulse nor breath  carry him in too poor wretch and now yeo what is the meaning of all this  yeos story was soon told he could not get out of his puritan head the notion quite unfounded of course that eustace had meant to steal the horses he had seen the innkeeper sneak off at their approach and expecting some nightattack he had taken up his lodging for the night in the stable  as he expected an attempt was made the door was opened how he could not guess for he had fastened it inside and two fellows came in and began to loose the beasts yeos account was that he seized the big fellow who drew a knife on him and broke loose the horses terrified at the scuffle kicked right and left one man fell and the other ran out calling for help with yeo at his heels whereon said yeo seeing a dozen more on me with clubs and bows i thought best to shorten the number while i could ran the rascal through and stood on my ward and only just in time i was whats more theres two arrows in the house wall and two or three more in my buckler which i caught up as i went out for i had hung it close by the door you see sir to be all ready in case said the cunning old philistineslayer as they went in after the wounded man  but hardly had they stumbled through the low doorway into the backkitchen when a fresh hubbub arose insidemore shouts for help amyas ran forward breaking his head against the doorway and beheld as soon as he could see for the flashes in his eyes an old acquaintance held on each side by a sturdy sailor  with one arm in the sleeve of his doublet and the other in a not over spotless shirt holding up his hose with one hand and with the other a candle whereby he had lighted himself to his own confusion foaming with rage stood mr evan morgans alias father parsons looking between his confused habiliments and his fiery visage as yeo told him to his face the very moral of a halfplucked turkeycock and behind him dressed stood eustace leigh  we found the maid letting these here two out by the front door said one of the captors  well mr parsons said amyas and what are you about here a pretty nest of thieves and jesuits we seem to have routed out this evening  about my calling sir said parsons stoutly by your leave i shall prepare this my wounded lamb for that account to which your mans cruelty has untimely sent him  the wounded man who lay upon the floor heard parsons voice and moaned for the patrico  you see sir said he pompously the sheep know their shepherds voice  the wolves you mean you hypocritical scoundrel said amyas who could not contain his disgust let the fellow truss up his points lads and do his work after all the man is dying  the requisite matters sir are not at hand said parsons unabashed  eustace go and fetch his matters for him you seem to be in all his plots  eustace went silently and sullenly  whats that fresh noise at the back now  the maid sir a wailing over her uncle the fellow that we saw sneak away when we came up it was him the horse killed  it was true the wretched host had slipped off on their approach simply to call the neighboring outlaws to the spoil and he had been filled with the fruit of his own devices  his blood be on his own head said amyas  i question sir said yeo in a low voice whether some of it will not be on the heads of those proud prelates who go clothed in purple and fine linen instead of going forth to convert such as he and then wonder how these jesuits get hold of them if they give place to the devil in their sheepfolds sure hell come in and lodge there look sir theres a sight in a gospel land  and indeed the sight was curious enough for parsons was kneeling by the side of the dying man listening earnestly to the confession which the man sobbed out in his gibberish between the spasms of his wounded chest now and then parsons shook his head and when eustace returned with the holy wafer and the oil for extreme unction he asked him in a low voice ballard interpret for me  and eustace knelt down on the other side of the sufferer and interpreted his thieves dialect into latin and the dying man held a hand of each and turned first to one and then to the other stupid eyesnot without affection though and gratitude  i cant stand this mummery any longer said yeo heres a soul perishing before my eyes and its on my conscience to speak a word in season  silence whispered amyas holding him back by the arm he knows them and he dont know you they are the first who ever spoke to him as if he had a soul to be saved and first come first served you can do no good see the mans face is brightening already  but sir tis a false peace  at all events he is confessing his sins yeo and if thats not good for him and you and me what is  yea amen sir but this is not to the right person  how do you know his words will not go to the right person after all though he may not send them there by heaven the man is dead  it was so the dark catalogue of brutal deeds had been gasped out but ere the words of absolution could follow the head had fallen back and all was over  confession in extremis is sufficient said parsons to eustace ballard as parsons called him to amyass surprise as he rose as for the rest the intention will be accepted instead of the act  the lord have mercy on his soul said eustace  his soul is lost before our very eyes said yeo  mind your own business said amyas  humph but ill tell you sir what our business is if youll step aside with me i find that poor fellow that lies dead is none other than the leader of the gubbings the king of them as they dare to call him  well what of that  mark my words sir if we have not a hundred stout rogues upon us before two hours are out forgive us they never will and if we get off with our lives which i dont much expect we shall leave our horses behind for we can hold the house sir well enough till morning but the courtyard we cant thats certain  we had better march at once then  think sir if they catch us upas they are sure to do knowing the country better than wehow will our shot stand their arrows  true old wisdom we must keep the road and we must keep together and so be a mark for them while they will be behind every rock and bank and two or three flights of arrows will do our business for us humph stay i have a plan and stepping forward he spoke  eustace you will be so kind as to go back to your lambs and tell them that if they meddle with us cruel wolves again tonight we are ready and willing to fight to the death and have plenty of shot and powder at their service father parsons you will be so kind as to accompany us it is but fitting that the shepherd should be hostage for his sheep  if you carry me off this spot sir you carry my corpse only said parsons i may as well die here as be hanged elsewhere like my martyred brother campian  if you take him you must take me too said eustace  what if we wont  how will you gain by that you can only leave me here you cannot make me go to the gubbings if i do not choose  amyas uttered sotto voce an anathema on jesuits gubbings and things in general he was in a great hurry to get to bideford and he feared that this business would delay him as it was a day or two he wanted to hang parsons he did not want to hang eustace and eustace he knew was well aware of that latter fact and played his game accordingly but time ran on and he had to answer sulkily enough  well then if you eustace will go and give my message to your converts i will promise to set mr parsons free again before we come to lydford town and i advise you if you have any regard for his life to see that your eloquence be persuasive enough for as sure as i am an englishman and he none if the gubbings attack us the first bullet that i shall fire at them will have gone through his scoundrelly brains  parsons still kicked  very well then my merry men all tie this gentlemans hands behind his back get the horses out and well right away up into dartmoor find a good high tor stand our ground there till morning and then carry him into okehampton to the nearest justice if he chooses to delay me in my journey it is fair that i should make him pay for it  whereon parsons gave in and being fast tied by his arm to amyass saddle trudged alongside his horse for several weary miles while yeo walked by his side like a friar by a condemned criminal and in order to keep up his spirits told him the woful end of nicholas saunders the legate and how he was found starved to death in a bog  and if you wish sir to follow in his blessed steps which i heartily hope you will do you have only to go over that big cowbacked hill there on your right hand and down again the other side to crawmere pool and there youll find as pretty a bog to die in as ever jesuit needed and your ghost may sit there on a grass tummock and tell your beads without any one asking for you till the day of judgment and much good may it do you  at which imagination yeo was actually heard for the first and last time in this history to laugh most heartily  his hohos had scarcely died away when they saw shining under the moon the old tower of lydford castle  cast the fellow off now said amyas  ay ay sir and yeo and simon evans stopped behind and did not come up for ten minutes after  what have you been about so long  why sir said evans you see the man had a very fair pair of hose on and a brannew kersey doublet very warmlined and so thinking it a pity good clothes should be wasted on such noxious trade weve just brought them along with us  spoiling the egyptians said yeo as comment  and what have you done with the man  hove him over the bank sir he pitched into a big furzebush and for aught i know there hell bide  you rascal have you killed him  never fear sir said yeo in his cool fashion a jesuit has as many lives as a cat and i believe rides broomsticks post like a witch he would be at lydford now before us if his master satan had any business for him there  leaving on their left lydford and its illomened castle which a century after was one of the principal scenes of judge jeffreyss cruelty amyas and his party trudged on through the mire toward okehampton till sunrise and ere the vapors had lifted from the mountain tops they were descending the long slopes from sourton down while yestor and amicombe slept steep and black beneath their misty pall and roaring far below unseen       ockment leapt from crag and cloud      down her cataracts laughing loud  the voice of the stream recalled these words to amyass mind the nymph of torridge had spoken them upon the day of his triumph he recollected too his vexation on that day at not seeing rose salterne why he had never seen her since never seen her now for six years and more of her ripened beauty he knew only by hearsay she was still to him the lovely fifteen years girl for whose sake he had smitten the barnstaple draper over the quay what a chain of petty accidents had kept them from meeting though so often within a mile of each other and what a lucky one said practical old amyas to himself if i had seen her as she is now i might have loved her as frank doespoor frank what will he say what does he say for he must know it already and what ought i to sayto do rather for talking is no use on this side the grave nor on the other either i expect and then he asked himself whether his old oath meant nothing or something whether it was a mere tavern frolic or a sacred duty and he held the more that he looked at it that it meant the latter  but what could he do he had nothing on earth but his sword so he could not travel to find her after all she might not be gone far perhaps not gone at all it might be a mistake an exaggerated scandal he would hope so and yet it was evident that there had been some passages between her and don guzman eustaces mysterious words about the promise at lundy proved that the villain he had felt all along that he was a villain but just the one to win a womans heart too frank had been awayall the brotherhood away what a fool he had been to turn the wolf loose into the sheepfold and yet who would have dreamed of it     at all events said amyas trying to comfort himself i need not complain i have lost nothing i stood no more chance of her against frank than i should have stood against the don so there is no use for me to cry about the matter and he tried to hum a tune concerning the general frailty of women but nevertheless like sir hugh felt that he had a great disposition to cry  he never had expected to win her and yet it seemed bitter to know that she was lost to him forever it was not so easy for a heart of his make to toss away the image of a first love and all the less easy because that image was stained and ruined  curses on the man who had done that deed i will yet have his hearts blood somehow if i go round the world again to find him if theres no law for it on earth theres law in heaven or im much mistaken  with which determination he rode into the ugly dirty and stupid town of okehampton with which fallen man by some strange perversity has chosen to defile one of the loveliest sites in the pleasant land of devon and heartily did amyas abuse the old town that day for he was detained there as he expected full three hours while the justice shallow of the place was sent for from his farm whither he had gone at sunrise after the earlyrising fashion of those days to take yeos deposition concerning last nights affray moreover when shallow came he refused to take the depositions because they ought to have been made before a brother shallow at lydford and in the wrangling which ensued was very near finding out what amyas fearing fresh loss of time and worse evils beside had commanded to be concealed namely the presence of jesuits in that moorland utopia then in broadest devon  and do you call this christian conduct sir to set a quiet man like me upon they gubbings as if i was going to risk my precious lifeno nor ever a constable to okehampton neither let lydfor men mind lydfor roogs and by lydfor law if they will hang first and try after but as for me ive rade my bible and he that meddleth with strife is like him that taketh a dog by the ears so if you choose to sit down and ate your breakfast with me well and good but depositions ill have none if your man is enquired for youll be answerable for his appearing in course but i expect mortally with a wink you waint hear much more of the matter from any hand leave well alone is a good rule but leave ill alone is a betterso we says round about here and so youll say captain when you be so old as i  so amyas sat down and ate his breakfast and went on afterwards a long and weary days journey till he saw at last beneath him the broad shining river and the long bridge and the white houses piled up the hillside and beyond over raleigh downs the dear old tower of northam church  alas northam was altogether a desert to him then and bideford as it turned out hardly less so for when he rode up to sir richards door he found that the good knight was still in ireland and lady grenville at stow whereupon he rode back again down the high street to that same bowwindowed ship tavern where the brotherhood of the rose made their vow and settled himself in the very room where they had supped  ah mr leighcaptain leigh now i beg pardon quoth mine host bideford is an empty place nowadays and nothing stirring sir what with sir richard to ireland and sir john to london and all the young gentlemen to the wars theres no one to buy good liquor and no one to court the young ladies neither sack sir i hope so i havent brewed a gallon of it this fortnight if youll believe me ale sir and aqua vitae and such lowbred trade is all i draw nowadays try a pint of sherry sir now to give you an appetite you mind my sherry of old jane sherry and sugar quick while i pull off the captains boots  amyas sat weary and sad while the innkeeper chattered on  ah sir two or three like you would set the young ladies all alive again bytheby theres been strange doings among them since you were here last you mind mistress salterne  for gods sake dont let us have that story man i heard enough of it at plymouth said amyas in so disturbed a tone that mine host looked up and said to himself  ah poor young gentleman hes one of the hardhit ones  how is the old man asked amyas after a pause  bears it well enough sir but a changed man never speaks to a soul if he can help it some folk say hes not right in his head or turned miser or somewhat and takes naught but bread and water and sits up all night in the room as was hers turning over her garments heaven knows whats on his mindthey do say he was over hard on her and that drove her to it all i know is he has never been in here for a drop of liquor and he came as regular every evening as the town clock sir since she went except a ten days ago and then he met young mr cary at the door and i heard him ask mr cary when you would be home sir  put on my boots again ill go and see him  bless you sir what without your sack  drink it yourself man  but you wouldnt go out again this time o night on an empty stomach now  fill my mens stomachs for them and never mind mine its marketday is it not send out and see whether mr cary is still in town and amyas strode out and along the quay to bridgeland street and knocked at mr salternes door  salterne himself opened it with his usual stern courtesy  i saw you coming up the street sir i have been expecting this honor from you for some time past i dreamt of you only last night and many a night before that too welcome sir into a lonely house i trust the good knight your general is well  the good knight my general is with god who made him mr salterne  dead sir  foundered at sea on our way home and the delight lost too  humph growled salterne after a minutes silence i had a venture in her i suppose its gone no matteri can afford it sir and more i trust and he was three years younger than i and draper heard was buried yesterday five years youngerhow is it that every one can die except me come in sir come in i have forgotten my manners  and he led amyas into his parlor and called to the apprentices to run one way and to the cook to run another  you must not trouble yourself to get me supper indeed  i must though sir and the best of wine too and old salterne had a good tap of alicant in old time old time old time sir and you must drink it now whether he does or not and out he bustled  amyas sat still wondering what was coming next and puzzled at the sudden hilarity of the man as well as his hospitality so different from what the innkeeper had led him to expect  in a minute more one of the apprentices came in to lay the cloth and amyas questioned him about his master  thank the lord that you are come sir said the lad  why then  because therell be a chance of us poor fellows getting a little broken meat wem halfstarved this three monthsbread and dripping bread and dripping oh dear sir and now hes sent out to the inn for chickens and game and salads and all that money can buy and down in the cellar haling out the best of wineand the lad smacked his lips audibly at the thought  is he out of his mind  i cant tell he saith as how he must save muns money nowadays for heve a got a great venture on hand but what a be he tellth no man they callth mun bread and dripping now sir all town over said the prentice confidentially to amyas  they do do they sirrah then they will call me bread and no dripping tomorrow and old salterne entering from behind made a dash at the poor fellows ears but luckily thought better of it having a couple of bottles in each hand  my dear sir said amyas you dont mean us to drink all that wine  why not sir answered salterne in a grim halfsneering tone thrusting out his squaregrizzled beard and chin why not sir why should i not make merry when i have the honor of a noble captain in my house one who has sailed the seas sir and cut spaniards throats and may cut them again too eh sir boy wheres the kettle and the sugar  what on earth is the man at quoth amyas to himselfflattering me or laughing at me  yes he ran on half to himself in a deliberate tone evidently intending to hint more than he said as he began brewing the sackin plain english hot negus yes bread and dripping for those who cant fight spaniards but the best that money can buy for those who can i heard of you at smerwick siryes bread and dripping for me tooi cant fight spaniards but for such as you look here sir i should like to feed a crew of such up as youd feed a main of fightingcocks and then start them with a pair of sheffield spurs apieceyouve a good one there to your side sir but dont you think a man might carry two now and fight as they say those chineses do a sword to each hand you could kill more that way captain leigh i reckon  amyas half laughed  one will do mr salterne if one is quick enough with it  humphahno use being in a hurry i havent been in a hurry noi waited for you and here you are and welcome sir here comes supper a light matter sir you see a capon and a brace of partridges i had no time to feast you as you deserve  and so he ran on all suppertime hardly allowing amyas to get a word in edgeways but heaping him with coarse flattery and urging him to drink till after the cloth was drawn and the two left alone he grew so outrageous that amyas was forced to take him to task goodhumoredly  now my dear sir you have feasted me royally and better far than i deserve but why will you go about to make me drunk twice over first with vainglory and then with wine  salterne looked at him a while fixedly and then sticking out his chinbecause captain leigh i am a man who has all his life tried the crooked road first and found the straight one the safer after all  eh sir that is a strange speech for one who bears the character of the most upright man in bideford  humph so i thought myself once sir and well i have proved it but ill be plain with you sir youve heard howhow ive fared since you saw me last  amyas nodded his head  i thought so shame rides post now then captain leigh listen to me i being a plain man and a burgher and one that never drew iron in my life except to mend a pen ask you being a gentleman and a captain and a man of honor with a weapon to your side and harness to your backwhat would you do in my place  humph said amyas that would very much depend on whether my place was my own fault or not  and what if it were sir what if all that the charitable folks of bidefordheaven reward them for their tender mercieshave been telling you in the last hour be true sirtrue and yet not half the truth  amyas gave a start  ah you shrink from me of course a man is too righteous to forgive those who repent though god is not  god knows sir  yes sir god does knowall and you shall know a littleas much as i can tellor you understand come upstairs with me sir as youll drink no more i have a liking for you i have watched you from your boyhood and i can trust you and ill show you what i never showed to mortal man but one  and taking up a candle he led the way upstairs while amyas followed wondering  he stopped at a door and unlocked it  there come in those shutters have not been opened since she and the old man was silent  amyas looked round the room it was a low wainscoted room such as one sees in old houses everything was in the most perfect neatness the snowwhite sheets on the bed were turned down as if ready for an occupant there were books arranged on the shelves fresh flowers on the table the dressingtable had all its womans mundus of pins and rings and brushes even the dressinggown lay over the chairback everything was evidently just as it had been left  this was her room sir whispered the old man  amyas nodded silently and half drew back  you need not be modest about entering it now sir whispered he with a sort of sneer there has been no frail flesh and blood in it for many a day  amyas sighed  i sweep it out myself every morning and keep all tidy see here and he pulled open a drawer here are all her gowns and there are her hoods and therei know em all by heart now and the place of every one and there sir  and he opened a cupboard where lay in rows all roses dolls and the wornout playthings of her childhood  thats the pleasantest place of all in the room to me said he whispering still for it minds me of whenand maybe she may become a little child once more sir its written in the scripture you know  amen said amyas who felt to his own wonder a big tear stealing down each cheek  and now he whispered one thing more look hereand pulling out a key he unlocked a chest and lifted up tray after tray of necklaces and jewels furs lawns cloth of gold look there two thousand pound wont buy that chest twenty years have i been getting those things together thats the cream of many a levant voyage and east indian voyage and west indian voyage my lady bath cant match those pearls in her grand house at tawstock i got em from a genoese though and paid for em look at that embroidered lawn theres not such a piece in london no nor in alexandria ill warrant nor short of calicut where it came from    look here again theres a golden cup i bought that of one that was out with pizarro in peru and look here againand the old man gloated over the treasure  and whom do you think i kept all these for these were for her weddingdayfor her weddingday for your weddingday if youd been minded sir yes yours sir and yet i believe i was so ambitious that i would not have let her marry under an earl all the while i was pretending to be too proud to throw her at the head of a squires son ah well there was my idol sir i made her mad i pampered her up with gewgaws and vanity and then because my idol was just what i had made her i turned again and rent her  and now said he pointing to the open chest that was what i meant and that pointing to the empty bed was what god meant never mind come downstairs and finish your wine i see you dont care about it all why should you you are not her father and you may thank god you are not go and be merry while you can young sir    and yet all this might have been yours andbut i dont suppose you are one to be won by moneybut all this may be yours still and twenty thousand pounds to boot  i want no money sir but what i can earn with my own sword  earn my money then  what on earth do you want of me  to keep your oath said salterne clutching his arm and looking up into his face with searching eyes  my oath how did you know that i had one  ah you were well ashamed of it i suppose next day a drunken frolic all about a poor merchants daughter but there is nothing hidden that shall not be revealed nor done in the closet that is not proclaimed on the housetops  ashamed of it sir i never was but i have a right to ask how you came to know it  what if a poor fat squinny rogue a lowborn fellow even as i am whom you had baffled and made a laughingstock had come to me in my loneliness and sworn before god that if you honorable gentlemen would not keep your words he the clown would  john brimblecombe  and what if i had brought him where i have brought you and shown him what i have shown you and instead of standing as stiff as any spaniard as you do he had thrown himself on his knees by that bedside and wept and prayed sir till he opened my hard heart for the first and last time and i fell down on my sinful knees and wept and prayed by him  i am not given to weeping mr salterne said amyas and as for praying i dont know yet what i have to pray for on her account my business is to work show me what i can do and when you have done that it will be full time to upbraid me with not doing it  you can cut that fellows throat  it will take a long arm to reach him  i suppose it is as easy to sail to the spanish main as it was to sail round the world  my good sir said amyas i have at this moment no more worldly goods than my clothes and my sword so how to sail to the spanish main i dont quite see  and do you suppose sir that i should hint to you of such a voyage if i meant you to be at the charge of it no sir if you want two thousand pounds or five to fit a ship take it take it sir i hoarded money for my child and now i will spend it to avenge her  amyas was silent for a while the old man still held his arm still looked up steadfastly and fiercely in his face  bring me home that mans head and take ship prizesall keep the gain sir and give me the revenge  gain do you think i need bribing sir what kept me silent was the thought of my mother i dare not go without her leave  salterne made a gesture of impatience  i dare not sir i must obey my parent whatever else i do  humph said he if others had obeyed theirs as wellbut you are right captain leigh right you will prosper whoever else does not now sir goodnight if you will let me be the first to say so my old eyes grow heavy early nowadays perhaps its old age perhaps its sorrow  so amyas departed to the inn and there to his great joy found cary waiting for him from whom he learnt details which must be kept for another chapter and which i shall tell for convenience sake in my own words and not in his    chapter xv  how mr john brimblecombe understood the nature of an oath       the kynge of spayn is a foul paynim      and lieveth on mahound      and pity it were that lady fayre      should marry a heathen hound                             kyng estmere  about six weeks after the duel the miller at stow had come up to the great house in much tribulation to borrow the bloodhounds rose salterne had vanished in the night no man knew whither  sir richard was in bideford but the old steward took on himself to send for the keepers and down went the servingmen to the mill with all the idle lads of the parish at their heels thinking a maidenhunt very good sport and of course taking a view of the case as favorable as possible to rose  they reviled the miller and his wife roundly for hardhearted old heathens and had no doubt that they had driven the poor maid to throw herself over cliff or drown herself in the sea while all the women of stow on the other hand were of unanimous opinion that the hussy had gone off with some bad fellow and that pride was sure to have a fall and so forth  the facts of the case were that all roses trinkets were left behind so that she had at least gone off honestly and nothing seemed to be missing but some of her linen which old anthony the steward broadly hinted was likely to be found in other peoples boxes the only trace was a little footmark under her bedroom window on that the bloodhound was laid of course in leash and after a premonitory whimper lifted up his mighty voice and started bellmouthed through the garden gate and up the lane towing behind him the panting keeper till they reached the downs above and went straight away for marslandmouth where the whole posse comitatus pulled up breathless at the door of lucy passmore  lucy as perhaps i should have said before was now a widow and found her widowhood not altogether contrary to her interest her augury about her old man had been fulfilled he had never returned since the night on which he put to sea with eustace and the jesuits       some natural tears she shed but dried them soon  as many of them at least as were not required for purposes of business and then determined to prevent suspicion by a bold move she started off to stow and told lady grenville a most pathetic tale how her husband had gone out to pollock fishing and never returned but how she had heard horsemen gallop past her window in the dead of night and was sure they must have been the jesuits and that they had carried off her old man by main force and probably after making use of his services had killed and salted him down for provision on their voyage back to the pope at rome after which she ended by entreating protection against those popish skulkers up to chapel who were sworn to do her a mischief and by an appeal to lady grenvilles sense of justice as to whether the queen ought not to allow her a pension for having had her hearts love turned into a sainted martyr by the hands of idolatrous traitors  lady grenville who had a great opinion of lucys medical skill and always sent for her if one of the children had a housty i e sore throat went forth and pleaded the case before sir richard with such effect that lucy was on the whole better off than ever for the next two or three years  but nowwhat had she to do with roses disappearance and indeed where was she herself  her door was fast and round it her flock of goats stood crying in vain for her to come and milk them while from the down above her donkeys wandering at their own sweet will answered the bay of the bloodhound with a burst of harmony  theym laughing at us keper they neddies sure enough wem lost our labor here  but the bloodhound after working about the door a while turned down the glen and never stopped till he reached the margin of the sea  theym taken water  lets go back and rout out the old witchs house  tis just like that old lucy to lock a poor maid into shame  and returning they attacked the cottage and by a general plebiscitum ransacked the little dwelling partly in indignation and partly if the truth be told in the hope of plunder but plunder there was none  lucy had decamped with all her movable wealth saving the huge black cat among the embers who at the sight of the bloodhound vanished up the chimney some said with a strong smell of brimstone and being viewed outside was chased into the woods where she lived i doubt not many happy years a scourge to all the rabbits of the glen  the goats and donkeys were driven off up to stow and the mob returned a little ashamed of themselves when their brief wrath was past and a little afraid too of what sir richard might say  he when he returned sold the donkeys and goats and gave the money to the poor promising to refund the same if lucy returned and gave herself up to justice  but lucy did not return and her cottage from which the neighbors shrank as from a haunted place remained as she had left it and crumbled slowly down to four ferncovered walls past which the little stream went murmuring on from pool to poolthe only voice for many a year to come which broke the silence of that lonely glen  a few days afterwards sir richard on his way from bideford to stow looked in at clovelly court and mentioned with a by the by news which made will cary leap from his seat almost to the ceiling  what it was we know already  and there is no clue asked old cary for his son was speechless  only this i hear that some fellow prowling about the cliffs that night saw a pinnace running for lundy  will rose and went hastily out of the room  in half an hour he and three or four armed servants were on board a trawlingskiff and away to lundy  he did not return for three days and then brought news that an elderly man seemingly a foreigner had been lodging for some months past in a part of the ruined moresco castle which was tenanted by one john braund that a few weeks since a younger man a foreigner also had joined him from on board a ship the ship a flushinger or easterling of some sort  the ship came and went more than once and the young man in her  a few days since a lady and her maid a stout woman came with him up to the castle and talked with the elder man a long while in secret abode there all night and then all three sailed in the morning  the fishermen on the beach had heard the young man call the other father  he was a very still man much as a masspriest might be  more they did not know or did not choose to know  whereon old cary and sir richard sent will on a second trip with the parish constable of hartland in which huge parish for its sins is situate the isle of lundy ten miles out at sea who returned with the body of the hapless john braund farmer fisherman smuggler etc which worthy after much fruitless examination wherein examinate was afflicted with extreme deafness and loss of memory departed to exeter gaol on a charge of harboring priests jesuits gipsies and other suspect and traitorous persons  poor john braund whose motive for entertaining the said ugly customers had probably been not treason but a wife seven children and arrears of rent did not thrive under the change from the pure air of lundy to the pestiferous one of exeter gaol made infamous but two years after if i recollect right by a black assizes nearly as fatal as that more notorious one at oxford for in it whether by the stench of the prisoners or by a stream of foul air judge jury counsel and bystanders numbering among them many members of the best families in devon sickened in court and died miserably within a few days  john braund then took the gaolfever in a week and died raving in that noisome den his secret if he had one perished with him and nothing but vague suspicion was left as to rose salternes fate  that she had gone off with the spaniard few doubted but whither and in what character  on that last subject be sure no mercy was shown to her by many a bideford dame who had hated the poor girl simply for her beauty and by many a country lady who had always expected that the girl would be brought to ruin by the absurd notice beyond what her station had a right to which was taken of her while every young maiden aspired to fill the throne which rose had abdicated  so that on the whole bideford considered itself as going on as well without poor rose as it had done with her or even better  and though she lingered in some hearts still as a fair dream the business and the bustle of each day soon swept that dream away and her place knew her no more  and will cary  he was for a while like a man distracted  he heaped himself with all manner of superfluous reproaches for having as he said first brought the rose into disgrace and then driven her into the arms of the spaniard while st leger who was a sensible man enough tried in vain to persuade him that the fault was not his at all that the two must have been attached to each other long before the quarrel that it must have ended so sooner or later that old salternes harshness rather than carys wrath had hastened the catastrophe and finally that the rose and her fortunes were now that she had eloped with a spaniard not worth troubling their heads about  poor will would not be so comforted he wrote off to frank at whitehall telling him the whole truth calling himself all fools and villains and entreating franks forgiveness to which he received an answer in which frank said that will had no reason to accuse himself that these strange attachments were due to a synastria or sympathy of the stars which ruled the destinies of each person to fight against which was to fight against the heavens themselves that he as a brother of the rose was bound to believe nay to assert at the swords point if need were that the incomparable rose of torridge could make none but a worthy and virtuous choice and that to the man whom she had honored by her affection was due on their part spaniard and papist though he might be all friendship worship and loyal faith for evermore  and honest will took it all for gospel little dreaming what agony of despair what fearful suspicions what bitter prayers this letter had cost to the gentle heart of francis leigh  he showed the letter triumphantly to st leger and he was quite wise enough to gainsay no word of it at least aloud but quite wise enough also to believe in secret that frank looked on the matter in quite a different light however he contented himself with saying  the man is an angel as his mother is and there the matter dropped for a few days till one came forward who had no mind to let it drop and that was jack brimblecombe now curate of hartland town and passing rich on forty pounds a year  i hope no offence mr william but when are you and the rest going afterafter her  the name stuck in his throat  cary was taken aback  whats that to thee catiline the blooddrinker asked he trying to laugh it off  what  dont laugh at me sir for its no laughing matter  i drank that night naught worse i expect than red wine  whatever it was we swore our oaths mr cary and oaths are oaths say i  of course jack of course but to go to look for herand when weve found her cut her lovers throat  absurd jack even if she were worth looking for or his throat worth cutting  tut tut tut  but jack looked steadfastly in his face and after some silence  how far is it to the caracas then sir  what is that to thee man  why he was made governor thereof i hear so that would be the place to find her  you dont mean to go thither to seek her shouted cary forcing a laugh  that depends on whether i can go sir but if i can scrape the money together or get a berth on board some ship why gods will must be done  will looked at him to see if he had been drinking or gone mad but the little pigs eyes were both sane and sober  will knew no answer  to laugh at the poor fellow was easy enough to deny that he was right that he was a hero and cavalier outdoing romance itself in faithfulness not so easy and cary in the first impulse wished him at the bottom of the bay for shaming him  of course his own plan of letting ill alone was the rational prudent irreproachable plan and just what any gentleman in his senses would have done but here was a vulgar fat curate out of his senses determined not to let ill alone but to do something as cary felt in his heart of a far diviner stamp  well said jack in his stupid steadfast way its a very bad lookout but mothers pretty well off if father dies and the maidens are stout wenches enough and will make tidy servants please the lord and youll see that they come to no harm mr william for old acquaintance sake if i never come back  cary was silent with amazement  and mr william you know me for an honest man i hope  will you lend me a five pound and take my books in pawn for them just to help me out  are you mad or in a dream  you will never find her  thats no reason why i shouldnt do my duty in looking for her mr william  but my good fellow even if you get to the indies you will be clapt into the inquisition and burnt alive as sure as your name is jack  i know that said he in a doleful tone and a sore struggle of the flesh i have had about it for i am a great coward mr william a dirty coward and always was as you know but maybe the lord will take care of me as he does of little children and drunken men and if not mr will id sooner burn and have it over than go on this way any longer i would and jack burst out blubbering  what way my dear old lad said will softened as he well might be  why notnot to know whetherwhetherwhether shes married to him or nother that i looked up to as an angel of god as pure as the light of day and knew she was too good for a poor pothead like me and prayed for her every night god knows that she might marry a king if there was one fit for herand i not to know whether shes living in sin or not mr williamits more than i can bear and theres an end of it and if she is married to him they keep no faith with heretics they can dissolve the marriage or make away with her into the inquisition burn her mr cary as soon as burn me the devils incarnate  cary shuddered the fact true and palpable as it was had never struck him before  yes or make her deny her god by torments if she hasnt done it already for love to thati know how love will make a body sell his soul for ive been in love  dont you laugh at me mr will or i shall go mad  god knows i was never less inclined to laugh at you in my life my brave old jack  is it so then  bless you for that word and jack held out his hand but what will become of my soul after my oath if i dont seek her out just to speak to her to warn her for gods sake even if it did no good just to set before her the lords curse on idolatry and antichrist and those who deny him for the sake of any creature though i cant think he would be hard on herfor who could  but i must speak all the same  the lord has laid the burden on me and done it must be god help me  jack said cary if this is your duty it is others  no sir i dont say that youre a layman but i am a deacon and the chaplain of you all and sworn to seek out christs sheep scattered up and down this naughty world and that innocent lamb first of all  you have sheep at hartland jack already  theres plenty better than i will tend them when i am gone but none that will tend her because none love her like me and they wont venture  who will  it cant be expected and no shame to them  i wonder what amyas leigh would say to all this if he were at home  say  hed do  he isnt one for talking  hed go through fire and water for her you trust him will cary and call me an ass if he wont  will you wait then till he comes back and ask him  he may not be back for a year and more  hear reason jack  if you will wait like a rational and patient man instead of rushing blindfold on your ruin something may be done  you think so  i cannot promise but  but promise me one thing  do you tell mr frank what i sayor rather ill warrant if i knew the truth he has said the very same thing himself already  you are out there old man for here is his own handwriting  jack read the letter and sighed bitterly  well i did take him for another guess sort of fine gentleman  still if my duty isnt his its mine all the same  i judge no man but i go mr cary  but go you shall not till amyas returns  as i live i will tell your father jack unless you promise and you dare not disobey him  i dont know even that for conscience sake said jack doubtfully  at least you stay and dine here old fellow and we will settle whether you are to break the fifth commandment or not over good brewed sack  now a good dinner was as we know what jack loved and loved too oft in vain so he submitted for the nonce and cary thought ere he went that he had talked him pretty well round  at least he went home and was seen no more for a week  but at the end of that time he returned and said with a joyful voice  i have settled all mr will  the parson of welcombe will serve my church for two sundays and i am away for london town to speak to mr frank  to london  how wilt get there  on shanks his mare said jack pointing to his bandy legs  but i expect i can get a lift on board of a coaster so far as bristol and its no way on to signify i hear  cary tried in vain to dissuade him and then forced on him a small loan with which away went jack and cary heard no more of him for three weeks  at last he walked into clovelly court again just before suppertime thin and legweary and sat himself down among the servingmen till will appeared  will took him up above the salt and made much of him which indeed the honest fellow much needed and after supper asked him in private how he had sped  i have learnt a lesson mr william  ive learnt that there is one on earth loves her better than i if she had but had the wit to have taken him  but what says he of going to seek her  he says what i say go and he says what you say wait  go  impossible  how can that agree with his letter  thats no concern of mine  of course being nearer heaven than i am he sees clearer what he should say and do than i can see for him  oh mr will thats not a man hes an angel of god but hes dying mr will  dying  yes faith of love for her  i can see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice but i am of tougher hide and stiffer clay and so you see i cant die even if i tried  but ill obey my betters and wait  and so jack went home to his parish that very evening weary as he was in spite of all entreaties to pass the night at clovelly  but he had left behind him thoughts in carys mind which gave their owner no rest by day or night till the touch of a seeming accident made them all start suddenly into shape as a touch of the freezing water covers it in an instant with crystals of ice  he was lounging so he told amyas one murky day on bideford quay when up came mr salterne  cary had shunned him of late partly from delicacy partly from dislike of his supposed hardheartedness  but this time they happened to meet full and cary could not pass without speaking to him  well mr salterne and how goes on the shipping trade  well enough sir if some of you young gentlemen would but follow mr leighs example and go forth to find us stayathomes new markets for our ware  what you want to be rid of us eh  i dont know why i should sir  we shant cross each other now sir whatever might have been once  but if i were you i should be in the indies about now if i were not fighting the queens battles nearer home  in the indies  i should make but a poor hand of drakes trade and so the conversation dropped but cary did not forget the hint  so lad to make an end of a long story said he to amyas if you are minded to take the old mans offer so am i and westwardho with you come foul come fair  it will be but a wildgoose chase will  if she is with him we shall find her at la guayra  if she is not and the villain has cast her off down the wind that will be only an additional reason for making an example of him  and if neither of them are there will the platefleets will be so it will be our own shame if we come home emptyhanded  but will your father let you run such a risk  my father said cary laughing  he has just now so good hope of a long string of little carys to fill my place that he will be in no lack of an heir come what will  little carys  i tell you truth  i think he must have had a sly sup of that fountain of perpetual youth which our friend don guzmans grandfather went to seek in florida for some twelvemonth since he must needs marry a tenants buxom daughter and mistress abishag jewell has brought him one fat baby already  so i shall go back to ireland or with you but somewhere  i cant abide the things squalling any more than i can seeing mistress abishag sitting in my poor dear mothers place and informing me every other day that she is come of an illustrious house because she is or is not third cousin seven times removed to my fathers old friend bishop jewell of glorious memory  i had threeparts of a quarrel with the dear old man the other day for after one of her peacockbouts i couldnt for the life of me help saying that as the bishop had written an apology for the people of england my father had better conjure up his ghost to write an apology for him and head it why green heads should grow on gray shoulders  you impudent villain  and what did he say  laughed till he cried again and told me if i did not like it i might leave it which is just what i intend to do  only mind if we go we must needs take jack brimblecombe with us or he will surely heave himself over harty point and his ghost will haunt us to our dying day  jack shall go  none deserves it better  after which there was a long consultation on practical matters and it was concluded that amyas should go up to london and sound frank and his mother before any further steps were taken  the other brethren of the rose were scattered far and wide each at his post and st leger had returned to his uncle so that it would be unfair to them as well as a considerable delay to demand of them any fulfilment of their vow and as amyas sagely remarked too many cooks spoil the broth and halfadozen gentlemen aboard one ship are as bad as two kings of brentford  with which maxim he departed next morning for london leaving yeo with cary    chapter xvi  the most chivalrous adventure of the good ship rose       he is brass within and steel without      with beams on his topcastle strong      and eighteen pieces of ordinance      he carries on either side along                           sir andrew barton  let us take boat as amyas did at whitehallstairs and slip down ahead of him under old london bridge and so to deptford creek where remains as it were embalmed the famous ship pelican in which drake had sailed round the world there she stands drawn up high and dry upon the sedgy bank of thames like an old warrior resting after his toil nailed upon her mainmast are epigrams and verses in honor of her and of her captain three of which by the winchester scholar camden gives in his history and elizabeths self consecrated her solemnly and having banqueted on board there and then honored drake with the dignity of knighthood at which time a bridge of planks by which they came on board broke under the press of people and fell down with a hundred men upon it who notwithstanding had none of them any harm so as that ship may seem to have been built under a lucky planet  there she has remained since as a show and moreover as a sort of dininghall for jovial parties from the city one of which would seem to be on board this afternoon to judge from the flags which bedizen the masts the sounds of revelry and savory steams which issue from those windows which once were portholes and the rushing to and fro along the river brink and across that lucky bridge of whiteaproned waiters from the neighboring pelican inn a great feast is evidently toward for with those whiteaproned waiters are gay serving men wearing on their shoulders the citybadge the lord mayor is giving a dinner to certain gentlemen of the leicester house party who are interested in foreign discoveries and what place so fit for such a feast as the pelican itself  look at the men all round a nobler company you will seldom see especially too if you be americans look at their faces and reverence them for to them and to their wisdom you owe the existence of your mighty fatherland  at the head of the table sits the lord mayor whom all readers will recognize at once for he is none other than that famous sir edward osborne clothworker and ancestor of the dukes of leeds whose romance nowadays is in every ones hands he is aged but not changed since he leaped from the window upon london bridge into the roaring tide below to rescue the infant who is now his wife the chivalry and promptitude of the prentice boy have grown and hardened into the thoughtful daring of the wealthy merchant adventurer there he sits a right kingly man with my lord earl of cumberland on his right hand and walter raleigh on his left the three talk together in a low voice on the chance of there being vast and rich countries still undiscovered between florida and the river of canada raleighs halfscientific declamation and his often quotations of doctor dee the conjuror have less effect on osborne than on cumberland who tried many an adventure to foreign parts and failed in all of them apparently for the simple reason that instead of going himself he sent other people and raleigh is fain to call to his help the quiet student who sits on his left hand richard hakluyt of oxford but he is deep in talk with a reverend elder whose long white beard flows almost to his waist and whose face is furrowed by a thousand storms anthony jenkinson by name the great asiatic traveller who is discoursing to the christchurch virtuoso of reindeer sledges and siberian steppes and of the fossil ivory plain proof of noahs flood which the tungoos dig from the icecliffs of the arctic sea next to him is christopher carlile walsinghams soninlaw as sidney also is now a valiant captain afterwards general of the soldiery in drakes triumphant west indian raid of 1585 with whom a certain bishop of carthagena will hereafter drink good wine he is now busy talking with alderman hart the grocer sheriff spencer the clothworker and charles leigh amyass merchantcousin and with aldworth the mayor of bristol and william salterne alderman thereof and cousin of our friend at bideford for carlile and secretary walsingham also have been helping them heart and soul for the last two years to collect money for humphrey and adrian gilberts great adventures to the northwest on one of which carlile was indeed to have sailed himself but did not go after all i never could discover for what reason  on the opposite side of the table is a group scarcely less interesting martin frobisher and john davis the pioneers of the northwest passage are talking with alderman sanderson the great geographer and setter forth of globes with mr towerson sir gilbert peckham our old acquaintance captain john winter and last but not least with philip sidney himself who with his accustomed courtesy has given up his rightful place toward the head of the table that he may have a knot of virtuosi all to himself and has brought with him of course his two especial intimates mr edward dyer and mr francis leigh they too are talking of the northwest passage and sidney is lamenting that he is tied to diplomacy and courts and expressing his envy of old martin frobisher in all sorts of pretty compliments to which the other replies that  its all very fine to talk of here a sailing on dry land with a good glass of wine before you but youd find it another guess sort of business knocking about among the icebergs with your beard frozen fast to your ruff sir philip specially if you were a bit squeamish about the stomach  that were a slight matter to endure my dear sir if by it i could win the honor which her majesty bestowed on you when her own ivory hand waved a farewell kerchief to your ship from the windows of greenwich palace  well sir folks say you have no reason to complain of lack of favors as you have no reason to deserve lack and if you can get them by staying ashore dont you go to sea to look for more say i eh master towerson  towersons gray beard which has stood many a foreign voyage both fair and foul wags grim assent but at this moment a waiter enters and  please my lord mayors worship there is a tall gentleman outside would speak with the right honorable sir walter raleigh  show him in man sir walters friends are ours  amyas enters and stands hesitating in the doorway  captain leigh cry half adozen voices  why did you not walk in sir says osborne you should know your way well enough between these decks  well enough my lords and gentlemen but sir walteryou will excuse meand he gave raleigh a look which was enough for his quick wit turning pale as death he rose and followed amyas into an adjoining cabin they were five minutes together and then amyas came out alone  in few words he told the company the sad story which we already know ere it was ended noble tears were glistening on some of those stern faces  the old egyptians said sir edward osborne when they banqueted set a corpse among their guests for a memorial of human vanity have we forgotten god and our own weakness in this our feast that he himself has sent us thus a message from the dead  nay my lord mayor said sidney not from the dead but from the realm of everlasting life  amen answered osborne but gentlemen our feast is at an end there are those here who would drink on merrily as brave men should in spite of the private losses of which they have just had news but none here who can drink with the loss of so great a man still ringing in his ears  it was true though many of the guests had suffered severely by the failure of the expedition they had utterly forgotten that fact in the awful news of sir humphreys death and the feast broke up sadly and hurriedly while each man asked his neighbor what will the queen say  raleigh reentered in a few minutes but was silent and pressing many an honest hand as he passed went out to call a wherry beckoning amyas to follow him sidney cumberland and frank went with them in another boat leaving the two to talk over the sad details  they disembarked at whitehallstairs raleigh sidney and cumberland went to the palace and the two brothers to their mothers lodgings  amyas had prepared his speech to frank about rose salterne but now that it was come to the point he had not courage to begin and longed that frank would open the matter frank too shrank from what he knew must come and all the more because he was ignorant that amyas had been to bideford or knew aught of the roses disappearance  so they went upstairs and it was a relief to both of them to find that their mother was at the abbey for it was for her sake that both dreaded what was coming so they went and stood in the baywindow which looked out upon the river and talked of things indifferent and looked earnestly at each others faces by the fading light for it was now three years since they had met  years and events had deepened the contrast between the two brothers and frank smiled with affectionate pride as he looked up in amyass face and saw that he was no longer merely the rollicking handy sailorlad but the selfconfident and stately warrior showing in every look and gesture       the reason firm the temperate will      endurance foresight strength and skill  worthy of one whose education had been begun by such men as drake and grenville and finished by such as raleigh and gilbert his long locks were now cropped close to the head but as a setoff the lips and chin were covered with rich golden beard his face was browned by a thousand suns and storms a long scar the trophy of some irish fight crossed his right temple his huge figure had gained breadth in proportion to its height and his hand as it lay upon the windowsill was hard and massive as a smiths frank laid his own upon it and sighed and amyas looked down and started at the contrast between the twoso slender bloodless all but transparent were the delicate fingers of the courtier amyas looked anxiously into his brothers face it was changed indeed since they last met the brilliant red was still on either cheek but the white had become dull and opaque the lips were pale the features sharpened the eyes glittered with unnatural fire and when frank told amyas that he looked aged amyas could not help thinking that the remark was far more true of the speaker himself  trying to shut his eyes to the palpable truth he went on with his chat asking the names of one building after another  and so this is old father thames with his bank of palaces  yes his banks are stately enough yet you see he cannot stay to look at them he hurries down to the sea and the sea into the ocean and the ocean westwardho forever all things move westwardho perhaps we may move that way ourselves some day amyas  what do you mean by that strange talk  only that the ocean follows the primum mobile of the heavens and flows forever from east to west is there anything so strange in my thinking of that when i am just come from a party where we have been drinking success to westwardho  and much good has come of it i have lost the best friend and the noblest captain upon earth not to mention all my little earnings in that same confounded gulf of westwardho  yes sir humphrey gilberts star has set in the westwhy not sun moon and planets sink into the west why not the meteors of this lower world why not a willothewisp like me amyas  god forbid frank  why then is not the west the land of peace and the land of dreams do not our hearts tell us so each time we look upon the setting sun and long to float away with him upon the goldencushioned clouds they bury men with their faces to the east i should rather have mine turned to the west amyas when i die for i cannot but think it some divine instinct which made the ancient poets guess that elysium lay beneath the setting sun it is bound up in the heart of man that longing for the west i complain of no one for fleeing away thither beyond the utmost sea as david wished to flee and be at peace  complain of no one for fleeing thither asked amyas that is more than i do  frank looked inquiringly at him and then  no if i had complained of any one it would have been of you just now for seeming to be tired of going westwardho  do you wish me to go then  god knows said frank after a moments pause but i must tell you now i suppose once and for all that has happened at bideford which  spare us both frank i know all i came through bideford on my way hither and came hither not merely to see you and my mother but to ask your advice and her permission  true heart noble heart cried frank i knew you would be stanch  westwardho it is then  can we escape  we  amyas does not that which binds you bind me  amyas started back and held frank by the shoulders at arms length as he did so he could feel through that his brothers arms were but skin and bone  you dearest man a month of it would kill you  frank smiled and tossed his head on one side in his pretty way  i belong to the school of thales who held that the ocean is the mother of all life and feel no more repugnance at returning to her bosom again than humphrey gilbert did  but frankmy mother  my mother knows all and would not have us unworthy of her  impossible she will never give you up  all things are possible to them that believe in god my brother and she believes but indeed doctor dee the wise man gave her but this summer i know not what of prognostics and diagnostics concerning me i am born it seems under a cold and watery planet and need if i am to be longlived to go nearer to the vivifying heat of the sun and there bask out my little life like fly on wall to tell truth he has bidden me spend no more winters here in the east but return to our native seabreezes there to warm my frozen lungs and has so filled my mothers fancy with stories of sick men who were given up for lost in germany and france and yet renewed their youth like any serpent or eagle by going to italy spain and the canaries that she herself will be more ready to let me go than i to leave her all alone and yet i must go amyas it is not merely that my heart pants as sidneys does as every gallants ought to make one of your noble choir of argonauts who are now replenishing the earth and subduing it for god and for the queen it is not merely amyas that love calls melove tyrannous and uncontrollable strengthened by absence and deepened by despair but honor amyasmy oath  and he paused for lack of breath and bursting into a violent fit of coughing leaned on his brothers shoulder while amyas cried  fools fools that we werethat i was i meanto take that fantastical vow  not so answered a gentle voice from behind you vowed for the sake of peace on earth and goodwill toward men and blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god no my sons be sure that such selfsacrifice as you have shown will meet its full reward at the hand of him who sacrificed himself for you  oh mother mother said amyas and do you not hate the very sight of mecome here to take away your firstborn  my boy god takes him and not you and if i dare believe in such predictions doctor dee assured me that some exceeding honor awaited you both in the west to each of you according to your deserts  ah said amyas my blessing i suppose will be like esaus to live by my sword while jacob here the spiritual man inherits the kingdom of heaven and an angels crown  be it what it may it will surely be a blessing as long as you are such my children as you have been at least my frank will be safe from the intrigues of court and the temptations of the world would that i too could go with you and share in your glory come now said she laying her head upon amyass breast and looking up into his face with one of her most winning smiles i have heard of heroic mothers ere now who went forth with their sons to battle and cheered them on to victory why should i not go with you on a more peaceful errand i could nurse the sick if there were any i could perhaps have speech of that poor girl and win her back more easily than you she might listen to words from a womana woman too who has lovedwhich she could not hear from men at least i could mend and wash for you i suppose it is as easy to play the good housewife afloat as on shore come now  amyas looked from one to the other  god only knows which of the two is less fit to go mother mother you know not what you ask frank frank i do not want you with me this is a sterner matter than either of you fancy it to be one that must be worked out not with kind words but with sharp shot and cold steel  how cried both together aghast  i must pay my men and pay my fellowadventurers and i must pay them with spanish gold and what is more i cannot as a loyal subject of the queens go to the spanish main with a clear conscience on my own private quarrel unless i do all the harm that my hand finds to do by day and night to her enemies and the enemies of god  what nobler knighterrantry said frank cheerfully but mrs leigh shuddered  what frank too she said half to herself but her sons knew what she meant amyass warlike life honorable and righteous as she knew it to be she had borne as a sad necessity but that frank as well should become a man of blood was more than her gentle heart could face at first sight that one youthful duel of his he had carefully concealed from her knowing her feeling on such matters and it seemed too dreadful to her to associate that gentle spirit with all the ferocities and the carnage of a battlefield and yet said she to herself is this but another of the selfwilled idols which i must renounce one by one and then catching at a last hope she answered  frank must at least ask the queens leave to go and if she permits how can i gainsay her wisdom  and so the conversation dropped sadly enough  but now began a fresh perplexity in franks soul which amused amyas at first when it seemed merely jest but nettled him a good deal when he found it earnest for frank looked forward to asking the queens permission for his voyage with the most abject despondency and terror two or three days passed before he could make up his mind to ask for an interview with her and he spent the time in making as much interest with leicester hatton and sidney as if he were about to sue for a reprieve from the scaffold  so said amyas remarking further that the queen could not cut his head off for wanting to go to sea  but what axe so sharp as her frown said frank in most lugubrious tone  amyas began to whistle in a very rude way  ah my brother you cannot comprehend the pain of parting from her  no i cant i would die for the least hair of her royal head god bless it but i could live very well from now till doomsday without ever setting eyes on the said head  platos troglodytes regretted not that sunlight which they had never beheld  amyas not understanding this recondite conceit made no answer to it and there the matter ended for the time but at last frank obtained his audience and after a couple of hours absence returned quite pale and exhausted  thank heaven it is over she was very angry at firstwhat else could she beand upbraided me with having set my love so low i could only answer that my fatal fault was committed before the sight of her had taught me what was supremely lovely and only worthy of admiration then she accused me of disloyalty in having taken an oath which bound me to the service of another than her i confessed my sin with tears and when she threatened punishment pleaded that the offence had avenged itself heavily alreadyfor what worse punishment than exile from the sunlight of her presence into the outer darkness which reigns where she is not then she was pleased to ask me how i could dare as her sworn servant to desert her side in such dangerous times as these and asked me how i should reconcile it to my conscience if on my return i found her dead by the assassins knife at which most pathetic demand i could only throw myself at once on my own knees and her mercy and so awaited my sentence whereon with that angelic pity which alone makes her awfulness endurable she turned to hatton and asked what say you mouton is he humbled sufficiently and so dismissed me  heighho yawned amyas       if the bridge had been stronger      my tale had been longer  amyas amyas quoth frank solemnly you know not what power over the soul has the native and godgiven majesty of royalty awful enough in itself when to it is superadded the wisdom of the sage and therewithal the tenderness of the woman had i my will there should be in every realm not a salique but an antisalique law whereby no kings but only queens should rule mankind then would weakness and not power be to man the symbol of divinity love and not cunning would be the arbiter of every cause and chivalry not fear the spring of all obedience  humph theres some sense in that quoth amyas id run a mile for a woman when i would not walk a yard for a man andwho is this our mother is bringing in the handsomest fellow i ever saw in my life  amyas was not far wrong for mrs leighs companion was none other than mr secretary amyass smerwick fort acquaintance alias colin clout alias immerito alias edmund spenser some halfjesting conversation had seemingly been passing between the poet and the saint for as they came in she said with a smile which was somewhat of a forced onewell my dear sons you are sure of immortality at least on earth for mr spenser has been vowing to me to give your adventure a whole canto to itself in his faerie queene  and you no less madam said spenser what were the story of the gracchi worth without the figure of cornelia if i honor the fruit i must not forget the stem which bears it frank i congratulate you  then you know the result of my interview mother  i know everything and am content said mrs leigh  mrs leigh has reason to be content said spenser with that which is but her own likeness  spare your flattery to an old woman mr spenser when pray did i with a most loving look at frank refuse knighthood for dutys sake  knighthood cried amyas you never told me that frank  that may well be captain leigh said spenser but believe me her majesty so hatton assures me told him this day no less than that by going on this quest he deprived himself of that highest earthly honor which crowned heads are fain to seek from their own subjects  spenser did not exaggerate knighthood was then the prize of merit only and one so valuable that elizabeth herself said when asked why she did not bestow a peerage upon some favorite that having already knighted him she had nothing better to bestow it remained for young essex to begin the degradation of the order in his hapless irish campaign and for james to complete that degradation by his novel method of raising money by the sale of baronetcies a new order of hereditary knighthood which was the laughingstock of the day and which however venerable it may have since become reflects anything but honor upon its first possessors  i owe you no thanks colin said frank for having broached my secret but i have lost nothing after all there is still an order of knighthood in which i may win my spurs even though her majesty refuse me the accolade  what then you will not take it from a foreign prince  frank smiled  have you never read of that knighthood which is eternal in the heavens and of those true cavaliers whom john saw in patmos riding on white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean knightserrant in the everlasting war against the false prophet and the beast let me but become worthy of their ranks hereafter what matter whether i be called sir frank on earth  my son said mrs leigh remember that they follow one whose vesture is dipped not in the blood of his enemies but in his own  i have remembered it for many a day and remembered too that the garments of the knights may need the same tokens as their captains  oh frank frank is not his precious blood enough to cleanse all sin without the sacrifice of our own  we may need no more than his blood mother and yet he may need ours said frank                          how that conversation ended i know not nor whether spenser fulfilled his purpose of introducing the two brothers and their mother into his faerie queene if so the manuscripts must have been lost among those which perished along with spensers baby in the sack of kilcolman by the irish in 1598 but we need hardly regret the loss of them for the temper of the leighs and their mother is the same which inspires every canto of that noblest of poems and which inspired too hundreds in those noble days when the chivalry of the middle ages was wedded to the free thought and enterprise of the new                          so mother and sons returned to bideford and set to work frank mortgaged a farm will cary did the same having some land of his own from his mother old salterne grumbled at any man save himself spending a penny on the voyage and forced on the adventurers a good ship of two hundred tons burden and five hundred pounds toward fitting her out mrs leigh worked day and night at clothes and comforts of every kind amyas had nothing to give but his time and his brains but as salterne said the rest would have been of little use without them and day after day he and the old merchant were on board the ship superintending with their own eyes the fitting of every rope and nail cary went about beating up recruits and made with his jests and his frankness the best of crimps while john brimblecombe beside himself with joy toddled about after him from tavern to tavern and quay to quay exalted for the time being as cary told him into a second peter the hermit and so fiercely did he preach a crusade against the spaniards through bideford and appledore clovelly and ilfracombe that amyas might have had a hundred and fifty loose fellows in the first fortnight but he knew better still smarting from the effects of a similar haste in the newfoundland adventure he had determined to take none but picked men and by dint of labor he obtained them  only one scapegrace did he take into his crew named parracombe and by that scapegrace hangs a tale he was an old schoolfellow of his at bideford and son of a merchant in that townone of those unlucky members who are nobodys enemy but their owna handsome idle clever fellow who used his scholarship of which he had picked up some smattering chiefly to justify his own escapades and to string songs together having drunk all that he was worth at home he had in a penitent fit forsworn liquor and tormented amyas into taking him to sea where he afterwards made as good a sailor as any one else but sorely scandalized john brimblecombe by all manner of heretical arguments half anacreontic half smacking of the rather loose doctrines of that family of love which tormented the orthodoxy and morality of more than one bishop of exeter poor will parracombe he was born a few centuries too early had he but lived now he might have published a volume or two of poetry and then settled down on the staff of a newspaper had he even lived thirty years later than he did he might have written frantic tragedies or filthy comedies for the edification of jamess profligate metropolis and roistered it in taverns with marlowe to die as marlowe did by a footmans sword in a drunken brawl but in those stern days such weak and hysterical spirits had no fair vent for their humors save in being reconciled to the church of rome and plotting with jesuits to assassinate the queen as parry and somerville and many other madmen did  so at least some jesuit or other seems to have thought shortly after amyas had agreed to give the spendthrift a berth on board for one day amyas going down to appledore about his business was called into the little mariners rest inn to extract therefrom poor will parracombe who in spite of his vow was drunk and outrageous and had vowed the death of the landlady and all her kin so amyas fetched him out by the collar and walked him home thereby to bideford during which walk will told him a long and confused story how an egyptian rogue had met him that morning on the sands by boathythe offered to tell his fortune and prophesied to him great wealth and honor but not from the queen of england had coaxed him to the mariners rest and gambled with him for liquor at which it seemed will always won and of course drank his winnings on the spot whereon the egyptian began asking him all sorts of questions about the projected voyage of the rosea good many of which will confessed he had answered before he saw the fellows drift after which the egyptian had offered him a vast sum of money to do some desperate villainy but whether it was to murder amyas or the queen whether to bore a hole in the bottom of the good ship rose or to set the torridge on fire by artmagic he was too drunk to recollect exactly whereon amyas treated threequarters of the story as a tipsy dream and contented himself by getting a warrant against the landlady for harboring egyptians which was then a heavy offencea gipsy disguise being a favorite one with jesuits and their emissaries she of course denied that any gipsy had been there and though there were some who thought they had seen such a man come in none had seen him go out again on which amyas took occasion to ask what had become of the suspicious popish ostler whom he had seen at the mariners rest three years before and discovered to his surprise that the said ostler had vanished from the very day of don guzmans departure from bideford there was evidently a mystery somewhere but nothing could be proved the landlady was dismissed with a reprimand and amyas soon forgot the whole matter after rating parracombe soundly after all he could not have told the gipsy if one existed anything important for the special destination of the voyage as was the custom in those times for fear of jesuits playing into the hands of spain had been carefully kept secret among the adventurers themselves and except yeo and drew none of the men had any suspicion that la guayra was to be their aim  and salvation yeo  salvation was almost wild for a few days at the sudden prospect of going in search of his little maid and of fighting spaniards once more before he died i will not quote the texts out of isaiah and the psalms with which his mouth was filled from morning to night for fear of seeming irreverent in the eyes of a generation which does not believe as yeo believed that fighting the spaniards was as really fighting in gods battle against evil as were the wars of joshua or david but the old man had his practical hint too and entreated to be sent back to plymouth to look for men  theres many a man of the old pelican sir and of captain hawkinss minion that knows the indies as well as i and longs to be back again theres drew sir that we left behind and no better sailingmaster for us in the westcountry and has accounts against the spaniards too for it was his brother the barnstaple man that was factor aboard of poor mr andrew barker and got clapt into the inquisition at the canaries you promised him sir that night he stood by you on board the raleigh and if youll be as good as your word hell be as good as his and bring a score more brave fellows with him  so off went yeo to plymouth and returned with drew and a score of old neverstrikes one look at their visages as yeo proudly ushered them into the ship tavern showed amyas that they were of the metal which he wanted and that with the four northdevon men who had gone round the world with him in the pelican who all joined in the first week he had a reserveforce on which he could depend in utter need and that utter need might come he knew as well as any  nor was this all which yeo had brought for he had with him a letter from sir francis drake full of regrets that he had not seen his dear lad as he went through plymouth but indeed i was up to dartmoor surveying with crossstaff and chain over my knees in bog for a three weeks or more for i have a project to bring down a leat of fair water from the hilltops right into plymouth town cutting off the heads of tavy meavy wallcomb and west dart and thereby purging plymouth harbor from the silt of the mines whereby it has been choked of late years and giving pure drink not only to the townsmen but to the fleets of the queens majesty which if i do i shall both make some poor return to god for all his unspeakable mercies and erect unto myself a monument better than of brass or marble not merely honorable to me but useful to my countrymen whereon frank sent drake a pretty epigram comparing drakes projected leat to that river of eternal life whereof the just would drink throughout eternity and quoting after the fashion of those days john vii 38 while amyas took more heed of a practical appendage to the same letter which was a list of hints scrawled for his use by captain john hawkins himself on all sea matters from the mounting of ordnance to the use of vitriol against the scurvy in default of oranges and limmons all which stood amyas in good stead during the ensuing month while frank grew more and more proud of his brother and more and more humble about himself        this noble monument of drakes piety and public spirit      still remains in full use  for he watched with astonishment how the simple sailor without genius scholarship or fancy had gained by plain honesty patience and common sense a power over the human heart and a power over his work whatsoever it might be which frank could only admire afar off the men looked up to him as infallible prided themselves on forestalling his wishes carried out his slightest hint worked early and late to win a smile from him while as for him no detail escaped him no drudgery sickened him no disappointment angered him till on the 15th of november 1583 dropped down from bideford quay to appledore pool the tall ship rose with a hundred men on board for sailors packed close in those days beef pork biscuit and good ale for ale went to sea always then in abundance four culverins on her main deck her poop and forecastle well fitted with swivels of every size and her racks so full of muskets calivers long bows pikes and swords that all agreed so wellappointed a ship had never sailed out over bar  the next day being sunday the whole crew received the communion together at northam church amid a mighty crowd and then going on board again hove anchor and sailed out over the bar before a soft east wind to the music of sacbut fife and drum with discharge of all ordnance great and small with cheering of young and old from cliff and strand and quay and with many a tearful prayer and blessing upon that gallant bark and all brave hearts on board  and mrs leigh who had kissed her sons for the last time after the communion at the altarsteps and what more fit place for a mothers kiss went to the rocky knoll outside the churchyard wall and watched the ship glide out between the yellow denes and lessen slowly hour by hour into the boundless west till her hull sank below the dim horizon and her white sails faded away into the gray atlantic mist perhaps forever  and mrs leigh gathered her cloak about her and bowed her head and worshipped and then went home to loneliness and prayer    chapter xvii  how they came to barbados and found no men therein       the suns rim dips the stars rush out      at one stride comes the dark                                     coleridge  land land land yes there it was far away to the south and west beside the setting sun a long blue bar between the crimson sea and golden sky land at last with fresh streams and cooling fruits and free room for cramped and scurvyweakened limbs and there too might be gold and gems and all the wealth of ind who knew why not the old world of fact and prose lay thousands of miles behind them and before them and around them was the realm of wonder and fable of boundless hope and possibility sick men crawled up out of their stifling hammocks strong men fell on their knees and gave god thanks and all eyes and hands were stretched eagerly toward the far blue cloud fading as the sun sank down yet rising higher and broader as the ship rushed on before the rich tradewind which whispered lovingly round brow and sail i am the faithful friend of those who dare blow freshly freshlier yet thou good tradewind of whom it is written that he makes the winds his angels ministering breaths to the heirs of his salvation blow freshlier yet and save if not me from death yet her from worse than death blow on and land me at her feet to call the lost lamb home and die  so murmured frank to himself as with straining eyes he gazed upon that first outlier of the new world which held his all his cheeks were thin and wasted and the hectic spot on each glowed crimson in the crimson light of the setting sun a few minutes more and the rainbows of the west were gone emerald and topaz amethyst and ruby had faded into silvergray and overhead through the dark sapphire depths the moon and venus reigned above the sea  that should be barbados your worship said drew the master unless my reckoning is far out which heaven knows it has no right to be after such a passage and god be praised  barbados i never heard of it  very like sir but yeo and i were here with captain drake and i was here after too with poor captain barlow and there is good harborage to the south and west of it i remember  and neither spaniard cannibal or other evil beast said yeo a very garden of the lord sir hid away in the seas for an inheritance to those who love him i heard captain drake talk of planting it if ever he had a chance  i recollect now said amyas some talk between him and poor sir humphrey about an island here would god he had gone thither instead of to newfoundland  nay then said yeo he is in bliss now with the lord and you would not have kept him from that sir  he would have waited as willingly as he went if he could have served his queen thereby but what say you my masters how can we do better than to spend a few days here to get our sick round before we make the main and set to our work  all approved the counsel except frank who was silent  come fellowadventurer said cary we must have your voice too  to my impatience will said he aside in a low voice there is but one place on earth and i am all day longing for wings to fly thither but the counsel is right i approve it  so the verdict was announced and received with a hearty cheer by the crew and long before morning they had run along the southern shore of the island and were feeling their way into the bay where bridgetown now stands all eyes were eagerly fixed on the low wooded hills which slept in the moonlight spangled by fireflies with a million dancing stars all nostrils drank greedily the fragrant air which swept from the land laden with the scent of a thousand flowers all ears welcomed as a grateful change from the monotonous whisper and lap of the water the hum of insects the snore of the treetoads the plaintive notes of the shorefowl which fill a tropic night with noisy life  at last she stopped at last the cable rattled through the hawsehole and then careless of the chance of lurking spaniard or carib an instinctive cheer burst from every throat poor fellows amyas had much ado to prevent them going on shore at once dark as it was by reminding them that it wanted but two hours of day  never were two such long hours said one young lad fidgeting up and down  you never were in the inquisition said yeo or youd know better how slow time can run stand you still and give god thanks youre where you are  i say gunner be there goold to that island  never heard of none and so much the better for it said yeo dryly  but i say gunner said a poor scurvystricken cripple licking his lips be there oranges and limmons there  not of my seeing but plenty of good fruit down to the beach thank the lord there comes the dawn at last  up flushed the rose up rushed the sun and the level rays glittered on the smooth stems of the palmtrees and threw rainbows across the foam upon the coralreefs and gilded lonely uplands far away where now stands many a stately countryseat and busy enginehouse long lines of pelicans went clanging out to sea the hum of the insects hushed and a thousand birds burst into jubilant song a thin blue mist crept upward toward the inner downs and vanished leaving them to quiver in the burning glare the landbreeze which had blown fresh out to sea all night died away into glassy calm and the tropic day was begun  the sick were lifted over the side and landed boatload after boatload on the beach to stretch themselves in the shade of the palms and in halfanhour the whole crew were scattered on the shore except some dozen worthy men who had volunteered to keep watch and ward on board till noon  and now the first instinctive cry of nature was for fruit fruit fruit the poor lame wretches crawled from place to place plucking greedily the violet grapes of the creeping shore vine and staining their mouths and blistering their lips with the prickly pears in spite of yeos entreaties and warnings against the thorns some of the healthy began hewing down cocoanut trees to get at the nuts doing little thereby but blunt their hatchets till yeo and drew having mustered halfadozen reasonable men went off inland and returned in an hour laden with the dainties of that primeval orchardwith acid junipaapples luscious guavas and crowned ananas queen of all the fruits which they had found by hundreds on the broiling ledges of the low tufacliffs and then all sitting on the sandy turf defiant of galliwasps and jackspaniards and all the weapons of the insect host partook of the equal banquet while old blue landcrabs sat in their housedoors and brandished their fists in defiance at the invaders and solemn cranes stood in the water on the shoals with their heads on one side and meditated how long it was since they had seen bipeds without feathers breaking the solitude of their isle  and frank wandered up and down silent but rather in wonder than in sadness while great amyas walked after him his mouth full of junipaapples and enacted the part of showman with a sort of patronizing air as one who had seen the wonders already and was above being astonished at them  new new everything new said frank meditatively oh awful feeling all things changed around us even to the tiniest fly and flower yet we the same the same forever  amyas to whom such utterances were altogether sibylline and unintelligible answered by  look frank thats a colibri you ve heard of colibris  frank looked at the living gem which hung loud humming over some fantastic bloom and then dashed away seemingly to call its mate and whirred and danced with it round and round the flowerstarred bushes flashing fresh rainbows at every shifting of the lights  frank watched solemnly awhile and then  qualis natura formatrix si talis formata oh my god how fair must be thy real world if even thy phantoms are so fair  phantoms asked amyas uneasily thats no ghost frank but a jolly little honeysucker with a wee wife and children no bigger than peas but yet solid greedy little fellows enough ill warrant  not phantoms in thy sense good fellow but in the sense of those who know the worthlessness of all below  ill tell you what brother frank you are a great deal wiser than me i know but i cant abide to see you turn up your nose as it were at gods good earth see now god made all these things and never a man perhaps set eyes on them till fifty years agone and yet they were as pretty as they are now ever since the making of the world and why do you think god could have put them here then but to please himselfand amyas took off his hatwith the sight of them now i say brother frank whats good enough to please god is good enough to please you and me  your rebuke is just dear old simplehearted fellow and god forgive me if with all my learning which has brought me no profit and my longings which have brought me no peace i presume at moments sinner that i am to be more dainty than the lord himself he walked in paradise among the trees of the garden amyas and so will we and be content with what he sends why should we long for the next world before we are fit even for this one  and in the meanwhile said amyas this earths quite good enough at least here in barbados  do you believe asked frank trying to turn his own thoughts in those tales of the spaniards that the sirens and tritons are heard singing in these seas  i cant tell theres more fish in the water than ever came out of it and more wonders in the world ill warrant than we ever dreamt of but i was never in these parts before and in the south sea i must say i never came across any though yeo says he has heard fair music at night up in the gulf far away from land  the spaniards report that at certain seasons choirs of these nymphs assemble in the sea and with ravishing music sing their watery loves it may be so for nature which has peopled the land with rational souls may not have left the sea altogether barren of them above all when we remember that the ocean is as it were the very fount of all fertility and its slime as the most learned hold with thales of miletus that prima materia out of which all things were one by one concocted therefore the ancients feigned wisely that venus the mother of all living things whereby they designed the plastic force of nature was born of the seafoam and rising from the deep floated ashore upon the isles of greece  i dont know what plastic force is but i wish i had had the luck to be by when the pretty poppet came up however the nearest thing i ever saw to that was maidens swimming alongside of us when we were in the south seas and would have come aboard too but drake sent them all off again for a lot of naughty packs and i verily believe they were no better look at the butterflies now dont you wish you were a boy again and not too proud to go catching them in your cap  and so the two wandered on together through the glorious tropic woods and then returned to the beach to find the sick already grown cheerful and many who that morning could not stir from their hammocks pacing up and down and gaining strength with every step  well done lads cried amyas keep a cheerful mind we will have the music ashore after dinner for want of mermaids to sing to us and those that can dance may  and so those four days were spent and the men like schoolboys on a holiday gave themselves up to simple merriment not forgetting however to wash the clothes take in fresh water and store up a good supply of such fruit as seemed likely to keep until tired with fruitless rambles after gold which they expected to find in every bush in spite of yeos warnings that none had been heard of on the island they were fain to lounge about fullgrown babies picking up shells and seafans to take home to their sweethearts smoking agoutis out of the hollow trees with shout and laughter and tormenting every living thing they could come near till not a landcrab dare look out of his hole or an armadillo unroll himself till they were safe out of the bay and off again to the westward unconscious pioneers of all the wealth and

on which nature had concentrated all her beauty and man all his sin if barbados had been invested in the eyes of the newcomers with some strange glory how much more the seas on which they now entered which smile in almost perpetual calm untouched by the hurricane which roars past them far to northward sky sea and islands were one vast rainbow though little marked perhaps by those sturdy practical sailors whose main thought was of spanish gold and pearls and as little by amyas who accustomed to the scenery of the tropics was speculating inwardly on the possibility of extirpating the spaniards and annexing the west indies to the domains of queen elizabeth and yet even their unpoetic eyes could not behold without awe and excitement lands so famous and yet so new around which all the wonder all the pity and all the greed of the age had concentrated itself it was an awful thought and yet inspiriting that they were entering regions all but unknown to englishmen where the penalty of failure would be worse than deaththe torments of the inquisition not more than five times before perhaps had those mysterious seas been visited by english keels but there were those on board who knew them well and too well who first of all british mariners had attempted under captain john hawkins to trade along those very coasts and interdicted from the necessaries of life by spanish jealousy had in true english fashion won their markets at the swords point and then bought and sold honestly and peaceably therein the old mariners of the pelican and the minion were questioned all day long for the names of every isle and cape every fish and bird while frank stood by listening serious and silent  a great awe seemed to have possessed his soul yet not a sad one for his face seemed daily to drink in glory from the glory round him and murmuring to himself at whiles this is the gate of heaven he stood watching all day long careless of food and rest as every forward plunge of the ship displayed some fresh wonder islands and capes hung high in air with their inverted images below them long sandhills rolled and weltered in the mirage and the yellow flowerbeds and huge thorny cacti like giant candelabra which clothed the glaring slopes twisted tossed and flickered till the whole scene seemed one blazing phantomworld in which everything was as unstable as it was fantastic even to the sun itself distorted into strange oval and pearshaped figures by the beds of crimson mist through which he sank to rest but while frank wondered yeo rejoiced for to the southward of that setting sun a cluster of tall peaks rose from the sea and they unless his reckonings were wrong were the mountains of macanao at the western end of margarita the isle of pearls then famous in all the cities of the mediterranean and at the great german fairs and second only in richness to that pearl island in the gulf of panama which fifteen years before had cost john oxenham his life  the next day saw them running along the north side of the island having passed undiscovered as far as they could see the castle which the spaniards had built at the eastern end for the protection of the pearl fisheries  at last they opened a deep and still bight wooded to the waters edge and lying in the roadstead a caravel and three boats by her and at that sight there was not a man but was on deck at once and not a mouth but was giving its opinion of what should be done some were for sailing right into the roadstead the breeze blowing fresh toward the shore as it usually does throughout those islands in the afternoon however seeing the billows break here and there off the bays mouth they thought it better for fear of rocks to run by quietly and then send in the pinnace and the boat yeo would have had them show spanish colors for fear of alarming the caravel but amyas stoutly refused counting it he said a mean thing to tell a lie in that way unless in extreme danger or for great ends of state  so holding on their course till they were shut out by the next point they started cary in the largest boat with twenty men and amyas in the smaller one with fifteen more among whom was john brimblecombe who must needs come in his cassock and bands with an old sword of his uncles which he prized mightily  when they came to the bights mouth they found as they had expected coral rocks and too many of them so that they had to run along the edge of the reef a long way before they could find a passage for the boats while they were so doing and those of them who were new to the indies were admiring through the clear element those living flowerbeds and subaqueous gardens of nereus and amphitrite there suddenly appeared below what yeo called a school of sharks some of them nearly as long as the boat who looked up at them wistfully enough out of their wicked scowling eyes  jack said amyas who sat next to him look how that big fellow eyes thee he has surely taken a fancy to that plump hide of thine and thinks thou wouldst eat as tender as any sucking porker  jack turned very pale but said nothing  now as it befell just then that very big fellow seeing a parrotfish come out of a cleft of the coral made at him from below as did two or three more the poor fish finding no other escape leaped clean into the air and almost aboard the boat while just where he had come out of the water three or four great brown shagreened noses clashed together within two yards of jack as he sat each showing its horrible rows of saw teeth and then sank sulkily down again to watch for a fresh bait at which jack said very softly in manus tuas domine and turning his eyes in board had no lust to look at sharks any more  so having got through the reef in they ran with a fair breeze the caravel not being now a musketshot off cary laid her aboard before the spaniards had time to get to their ordnance and standing up in the sternsheets shouted to them to yield the captain asked boldly enough in whose name in the name of common sense ye dogs cries will do you not see that you are but fifty strong to our twenty whereon up the side he scrambled and the captain fired a pistol at him cary knocked him over unwilling to shed needless blood on which all the crew yielded some falling on their knees some leaping overboard and the prize was taken  in the meanwhile amyas had pulled round under her stern and boarded the boat which was second from her for the nearest was fast alongside and so a sure prize the spaniards in her yielded without a blow crying misericordia and the negroes leaping overboard swam ashore like seadogs meanwhile the third boat which was not an oars length off turned to pull away whereby befell a notable adventure for john brimblecombe casting about in a valiant mind how he should distinguish himself that day must needs catch up a boathook and claw on to her stern shouting stay ye papists stay spanish dogsby which as was to be expected they being ten to his one he was forthwith pulled overboard and fell all along on his nose in the sea leaving the hook fast in her stern  where i know not how being seized with some panic fear his lively imagination filling all the sea with those sharks which he had just seen he fell aroaring like any townbull and in his confusion never thought to turn and get aboard again but struck out lustily after the spanish boat whether in hope of catching hold of the boathook which trailed behind her or from a very madness of valor no man could divine but on he swam his cassock afloat behind him looking for all the world like a great black monkfish and howling and puffing with his mouth full of salt water stay ye spanish dogs help all good fellows see you not that i am a dead man they are nuzzling already at my toes he hath hold of my leg my right thigh is bitten clean off oh that i were preaching in hartland pulpit stay spanish dogs yield papist cowards least i make mincemeat of you and take me aboard yield i say or my blood be on your heads i am no jonah if he swallow me he will never cast me up again it is better to fall into the hands of man than into the hands of devils with three rows of teeth apiece in manus tuas orate pro anima  and so forth in more frantic case than ever was panurge in that his evermemorable seasickness till the english expecting him every minute to be snapped up by sharks or brained by the spaniards oars let fly a volley into the fugitives on which they all leaped overboard like their fellows whereon jack scrambled into the boat and drawing sword with one hand while he wiped the water out of his eyes with the other began to lay about him like a very lion cutting the empty air and crying yield idolaters yield spanish dogs however coming to himself after a while and seeing that there was no one on whom to flesh his maiden steel he sits down panting in the sternsheets and begins stripping off his hose on which amyas thinking surely that the good fellow had gone mad with some stroke of the sun or by having fallen into the sea after being overheated with his rowing bade pull alongside and asked him in heavens name what he was doing with his nether tackle on which jack amid such laughter as may be conceived vowed and swore that his right thigh was bitten clean through and to the bone yea and that he felt his hose full of blood and so would have swooned away for imaginary loss of blood so strong was the delusion on him had not his friends after much arguing on their part and anger on his persuaded him that he was whole and sound  after which they set to work to overhaul their maiden prize which they found full of hides and saltpork and yet not of that alone for in the captains cabin and also in the sternsheets of the boat which brimblecombe had so valorously boarded were certain frails of leaves packed neatly enough which being opened were full of goodly pearls though somewhat brown for the spaniards used to damage the color in their haste and greediness opening the shells by fire instead of leaving them to decay gradually after the arabian fashion with which prize though they could not guess its value very exactly they went off content enough after some malicious fellow had set the ship on fire which being laden with hides was no nosegay as it burnt  amyas was very angry at this wanton damage in which his model drake had never indulged but cary had his jest ready ah said he lutheran devils we are you know so we are bound to vanish like other fiends with an evil savor  as soon however as amyas was on board again he rounded his friend mr brimblecombe in the ear and told him he had better play the man a little more roaring less before he was hurt and keeping his breath to help his strokes if he wished the crew to listen much to his discourses frank hearing this bade amyas leave the offender to him and so began upon him with  come hither thou recreant jack thou lilylivered jack thou hysterical jack tell me now thou hast read platos dialogues and aristotles logic  to which jack very meekly answered yes  then i will deal with thee after the manner of those ancient sages and ask whether the greater must not contain the less  jack yes sure  frank and that which is more than a part contain that part more than which it is  jack yes sure  frank then tell me is not a priest more than a layman  jack who was always very loud about the dignity of the priesthood as many of his cloth are who have no other dignity whereon to stand answered very boldly of course  frank then a priest containeth a man and is a man and something overviz his priesthood  jack who saw whither this would lead i suppose so  frank then if a priest show himself no man he shows himself all the more no priest  ill tell you what master frank says jack you may be right by logic but sharks arent logic nor dont understand it neither  frank nay but my recalcitrant jack my stiffnecked jack is it the part of a man to howl like a pig in a gate because he thinks that is there which is not there  jack had not a word to say  frank and still more when if that had been there it had been the duty of a brave man to have kept his mouth shut if only to keep salt water out and not add the evil of choking to that of being eaten  ah says jack thats all very fine but you know as well as i that it was not the spaniards i was afraid of they were heavens handiwork and i knew how to deal with them but as for those fiends spawn of sharks when i saw that fellow take the fish alongside it upset me clean and theres an end of it  frank oh jack jack behold how one sin begets another just now thou wert but a coward and now thou art a manichee for thou hast imputed to an evil creator that which was formed only for a good end namely sharks which were made on purpose to devour useless carcasses like thine moreover as a brother of the rose thou wert bound by the vow of thy brotherhood to have leaped joyfully down that sharks mouth  jack ay very likely if mistress rose had been in his stomach but i wanted to fight spaniards just then not to be sharkbitten  frank jack thy answer savors of selfwill if it is ordained that thou shouldst advance the ends of the brotherhood by being sharkbitten or fleabitten or bitten by sharpers to the detriment of thy carnal wealth or shortly to suffer any shame or torment whatsoever even to strappado and scarpines thou art bound to obey thy destiny and not after that vain roman conceit to choose the manner of thine own death which is indeed only another sort of selfmurder we therefore consider thee as a cause of scandal and a rotten and creaking branch to be excised by the spiritual arm and do hereby excise thee and cut thee off  jack nay faith thats a little too much master frank how long have you been bishop of exeter  frank jack thy wit being blinded and full of gross vapors by reason of the perturbations of fear which like anger is a short madness and raises in the phantasy vain spectresvidelicet of sharks and spaniards mistakes our lucidity for thy manicheeism let his lordship of exeter deal with it for thy abominable howling and caterwauling offensive in a chained cur but scandalous in a preacher and a brother of the rose we do hereby deprive thee of thine office of chaplain to the brotherhood and warn thee that unless within seven days thou do some deed equal to the seven champions or ruggiero and orlandos self thou shalt be deprived of sword and dagger and allowed henceforth to carry no more iron about thee than will serve to mend thy pen  and now jack said amyas i will give thee a piece of news no wonder that young men as the parsons complain so loudly will not listen to the gospel while it is preached to them by men on whom they cannot but look down a set of softhanded fellows who cannot dig and are ashamed to beg and as my brother has it must needs be parsons before they are men  frank ay and even though we may excuse that in popish priests and friars who are vowed not to be men and get their bread shamefully and rascally by telling sinners who owe a hundred measures to sit down quickly and take their bill and write fifty yet for a priest of the church of england whose business is not merely to smuggle sinful souls up the backstairs into heaven but to make men good christians by making them good men good gentlemen and good englishmen to show the white feather in the hour of need is to unpreach in one minute all that he had been preaching his life long  i tell thee says amyas if i had not taken thee for another guess sort of man i had never let thee have the care of a hundred brave lads immortal souls  and so on both of them boarding him at once with their heavy shot larboard and starboard till he fairly clapped his hands to his ears and ran for it leaving poor frank laughing so heartily that amyas was after all glad the thing had happened for the sake of the smile which it put into his sad and steadfast countenance  the next day was sunday on which after divine service which they could hardly persuade jack to read so shamefaced was he and as for preaching after it he would not hear of such a thing amyas read aloud according to custom the articles of their agreement and then seeing abreast of them a sloping beach with a shoot of clear water running into the sea agreed that they should land there wash the clothes and again water the ship for they had found water somewhat scarce at barbados on this party jack brimblecombe must needs go taking with him his sword and a great arquebuse for he had dreamed last night he said that he was set upon by spaniards and was sure that the dream would come true and moreover that he did not very much care if they did or if he ever got back alive for it was better to die than be made an ape and a scarecrow and laughed at by the men and badgered with ramus his logic and plato his dialectical devilries to confess himself a manichee and for aught he knew a turbaned turk or hebrew jew and so flung into the boat like a man desperate  so they went ashore after amyas had given strict commands against letting off firearms for fear of alarming the spaniards there they washed their clothes and stretched their legs with great joy admiring the beauty of the place and then began to shoot the seine which they had brought on shore with them in which says the chronicler we caught many strange fishes and beside them a seacow full seven feet long with limpets and barnacles on her back as if she had been a stick of drifttimber this is a fond and foolish beast and yet pious withal for finding a corpse she watches over it day and night until it decay or be buried the indians call her manati who carries her young under her arm and gives it suck like a woman and being wounded she lamenteth aloud with a human voice and is said at certain seasons to sing very melodiously which melody perhaps having been heard in those seas is that which mr frank reported to be the choirs of the sirens and tritons the which i do not avouch for truth neither rashly deny having seen myself such fertility of natures wonders that i hold him who denieth aught merely for its strangeness to be a ribald and an ignoramus also one of our men brought in two great black fowls which he had shot with a crossbow bodied and headed like a capon but bigger than any eagle which the spaniards call curassos which with that seacow afterwards made us good cheer both roast and sodden for the cow was very dainty meat as good as a fourmonths calf and tender and fat withal  after that they set to work filling the casks and barricos having laid the boat up to the outflow of the rivulet and lucky for them it was as it fell out that they were all close together at that work and not abroad skylarking as they had been halfanhour before  now john brimblecombe had gone apart as soon as they landed with a shamefaced and doleful countenance and sitting down under a great tree plucked a bible from his bosom and read steadfastly girded with his great sword and his arquebuse lying by him this too was well for him and for the rest for they had not yet finished their watering when there was a cry that the enemy was on them and out of the wood not twenty yards from the good parson came full fifty shot with a multitude of negroes behind them and an officer in front on horseback with a great plume of feathers in his hat and his sword drawn in his hand  stand for your lives shouted amyas and only just in time for there was ten good minutes lost in running up and down before he could get his men into some order of battle but when jack beheld the spaniards as if he had expected their coming he plucked a leaf and put it into the page of his book for a mark laid the book down soberly caught up his arquebuse ran like a mad dog right at the spanish captain shot him through the body stark dead and then flinging the arquebuse at the head of him who stood next fell on with his sword like a very colbrand breaking in among the arquebuses and striking right and left such ugly strokes that the spaniards who thought him a very fiend or luthers self come to life to plague them gave back pellmell and shot at him five or six at once with their arquebuses but whether from fear of him or of wounding each other made so bad play with their pieces that he only got one shrewd gall in his thigh which made him limp for many a day but as fast as they gave back he came on and the rest by this time ran up in good order and altogether nearly forty men well armed on which the spaniards turned and went as fast as they had come while cary hinted that the dogs had had such a taste of the parson that they had no mind to wait for the clerk and people  come back jack are you mad shouted amyas  but jack who had not all this time spoken one word followed them as fiercely as ever till reaching a great blow at one of the arquebusiers he caught his foot in a root on which down he went and striking his head against the ground knocked out of himself all the breath he had left which between fatness and fighting was not much and so lay amyas seeing the spaniards gone did not care to pursue them but picked up jack who staring about cried glory be glory behow many have i killed how many have i killed  nineteen at the least quoth cary and seven with one back stroke and then showed brimblecombe the captain lying dead and two arquebusiers one of which was the fugitive by whom he came to his fall beside three or four more who were limping away wounded some of them by their fellows shot  there said jack pausing and blowing will you laugh at me any more mr cary or say that i cannot fight because i am a poor parsons son  cary took him by the hand and asked pardon of him for his scoffing saying that he had that day played the best man of all of them and jack who never bore malice began laughing in his turn and  oh mr cary we have all known your pleasant ways ever since you used to put drumbledrones into my desk to bideford school and so they went to the boats and pulled off thanking god as they had need to do for their great deliverance while all the boats crew rejoiced over jack who after a while grew very faint having bled a good deal without knowing it and made as little of his real wound as he made much the day before of his imaginary one  frank asked him that evening how he came to show so cool and approved a valor in so sudden a mishap  well my masters said jack i dont deny that i was very downcast on account of what you said and the scandal which i had given to the crew but as it happened i was reading there under the tree to fortify my spirits the history of the ancient worthies in st paul his eleventh chapter to the hebrews and just as i came to that out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens arose the cry of the spaniards at which gentlemen thinking in myself that i fought in just so good a cause as they and as i hoped with like faith there came upon me so strange an assurance of victory that i verily believed in myself that if there had been a ten thousand of them i should have taken no hurt wherefore said jack modestly there is no credit due to me for there was no valor in me whatsoever but only a certainty of safety and any coward would fight if he knew that he were to have all the killing and none of the scratches  which words he next day being sunday repeated in his sermon which he made on that chapter with which all even salvation yeo himself were well content and edified and allowed him to be as godly a preacher as he was in spite of his simple ways a valiant and truehearted comrade  they brought away the spanish officers sword a very good blade and also a great chain of gold which he wore about his neck both of which were allotted to brimblecombe as his fair prize but he accepting the sword steadfastly refused the chain entreating amyas to put it into the common stock and when amyas refused he cut it into links and distributed it among those of the boats crew who had succored him winning thereby much goodwill and indeed says the chronicler i never saw in that worthy man from the first day of our schoolfellowship till he was laid in his parish church of hartland where he now sleeps in peace any touch of that sin of covetousness which has in all ages and in ours no less than others beset especially i know not why them who minister about the sanctuary but this man though he was ugly and lowly in person and in understanding simple and of breeding but a poor parsons son had yet in him a spirit so loving and cheerful so lifted from base and selfish purposes to the worship of duty and to a generosity rather knightly than sacerdotal that all through his life he seemed to think only that it was more blessed to give than to receive and all that wealth which he gained in the wars he dispersed among his sisters and the poor of his parish living unmarried till his death like a true lover and constant mourner as shall be said in place and leaving hardly wherewith to bring his body to the grave at whom if we often laughed once we should now rather envy him desiring to be here what he was that we may be hereafter where he is amen    chapter xix  what befell at la guayra         great was the crying the running and riding      which at that season was made in the place         the beacons were fired as need then required      to save their great treasure they had little space                                         winning of cales  the men would gladly have hawked awhile round margarita and cubagua for another pearl prize but amyas having as he phrased it fleshed his dogs was loth to hang about the islands after the alarm had been given they ran therefore southwest across the mouth of that great bay which stretches from the peninsula of paria to cape codera leaving on their right hand tortuga and on their left the meadowislands of the piritoos two long green lines but a few inches above the tideless sea yeo and drew knew every foot of the way and had good reason to know it for they the first of all english mariners had tried to trade along this coast with hawkins and now right ahead sheer out of the sea from base to peak arose higher and higher the mighty range of the caracas mountains beside which all hills which most of the crew had ever seen seemed petty mounds frank of course knew the alps and amyas the andes but carys notions of height were bounded by mgillicuddys reeks and brimblecombes by exmoor and the latter to carys infinite amusement spent a whole day holding on by the rigging and staring upwards with his chin higher than his nose till he got a stiff neck soon the sea became rough and chopping though the breeze was fair and gentle and ere they were abreast of the cape they became aware of that strong eastward current which during the winter months so often baffles the mariner who wishes to go to the westward all night long they struggled through the billows with the huge wall of cape codera a thousand feet above their heads to the left and beyond it again bank upon bank of mountain bathed in the yellow moonlight  morning showed them a large ship which had passed them during the night upon the opposite course and was now a good ten miles to the eastward yeo was for going back and taking her of the latter he made a matter of course and the former was easy enough for the breeze blowing dead off the land was a soldiers wind there and back again for either ship but amyas and frank were both unwilling  why yeo you said that one day more would bring us to la guayra  all the more reason sir for doing the lords work thoroughly when he has brought us safely so far on our journey  she can pass well enough and no loss  ah sirs sirs she is delivered into your hands and you will have to give an account of her  my good yeo said frank i trust we shall give good account enough of many a tall spaniard before we return but you know surely that la guayra and the salvation of one whom we believe dwells there was our first object in this adventure  yeo shook his head sadly ah sirs a lady brought captain oxenham to ruin  you do not dare to compare her with this one said frank and cary both in a breath  god forbid gentlemen but no adventure will prosper unless there is a single eye to the lords work and that is as i take it to cripple the spaniard and exalt her majesty the queen and i had thought that nothing was more dear than that to captain leighs heart  amyas stood somewhat irresolute his duty to the queen bade him follow the spanish vessel his duty to his vow to go on to la guayra it may seem a farfetched dilemma he found it a practical one enough  however the counsel of frank prevailed and on to la guayra he went he half hoped that the spaniard would see and attack them however he went on his way to the eastward which if he had not done my story had had a very different ending  about midday a canoe the first which they had seen came staggering toward them under a huge threecornered sail as it came near they could see two indians on board  metal floats in these seas you see quoth cary theres a fresh marvel for you frank  expound quoth frank who was really ready to swallow any fresh marvel so many had he seen already  why how else would those two bronze statues dare to go to sea in such a cockleshell eh have i given you the dor now master courtier  i am long past dors will but what noble creatures they are and how fearlessly they are coming alongside can they know that we are english and the avengers of the indians  i suspect they just take us for spaniards and want to sell their cocoanuts see the canoe is laden with vegetables  hail them yeo said amyas you talk the best spanish and i want speech of one of them  yeo did so the canoe without more ado ran alongside and lowered her felucca sail while a splendid indian scrambled on board like a cat  he was full six feet high and as bold and graceful of bearing as frank or amyass self he looked round for the first moment smilingly showing his white teeth but the next his countenance changed and springing to the side he shouted to his comrade in spanish  treachery no spaniard and would have leaped overboard but a dozen strong fellows caught him ere he could do so  it required some trouble to master him so strong was he and so slippery his naked limbs amyas meanwhile alternately entreated the men not to hurt the indian and the indian to be quiet and no harm should happen to him and so after five minutes confusion the stranger gave in sulkily  dont bind him let him loose and make a ring round him now my man theres a dollar for you  the indians eyes glistened and he took the coin  all i want of you is first to tell me what ships are in la guayra and next to go thither on board of me and show me which is the governors house and which the customhouse  the indian laid the coin down on the deck and crossing himself looked amyas in the face  no senor i am a freeman and a cavalier a christian guayqueria whose forefathers first of all the indians swore fealty to the king of spain and whom he calls to this day in all his proclamations his most faithful loyal and noble guayquerias god forbid therefore that i should tell aught to his enemies who are my enemies likewise  a growl arose from those of the men who understood him and more than one hinted that a cord twined round the head or a match put between the fingers would speedily extract the required information  god forbid said amyas a brave and loyal man he is and as such will i treat him tell me my brave fellow how do you know us to be his catholic majestys enemies  the indian with a shrewd smile pointed to halfadozen different objects saying to each not spanish  well and what of that  none but spaniards and free guayquerias have a right to sail these seas  amyas laughed  thou art a right valiant bit of copper pick up thy dollar and go thy way in peace make room for him men we can learn what we want without his help  the indian paused incredulous and astonished overboard with you quoth amyas dont you know when you are well off  most illustrious senor began the indian in the drawling sententious fashion of his race when they take the trouble to talk at all i have been deceived i heard that you heretics roasted and ate all true catholics as we guayquerias are and that all your padres had tails  plague on you sirrah squeaked jack brimblecombe have i a tail look here  quien sabe who knows quoth the indian through his nose  how do you know we are heretics said amyas  humph but in repayment for your kindness i would warn you illustrious senor not to go on to la guayra there are ships of war there waiting for you and moreover the governor don guzman sailed to the eastward only yesterday to look for you and i wonder much that you did not meet him  to look for us on the watch for us said cary impossible lies amyas this is some trick of the rascals to frighten us away  don guzman came out but yesterday to look for us are you sure you spoke truth  as i live senor he and another ship for which i took yours  amyas stamped upon the deck that then was the ship which they had passed  fool that i was to have been close to my enemy and let my opportunity slip if i had but done my duty all would have gone right  but it was too late to repine and after all the indians story was likely enough to be false  off with you said he and the indian bounded over the side into his canoe leaving the whole crew wondering at the stateliness and courtesy of this bold seacavalier  so westwardho they ran beneath the mighty northern wall the highest cliff on earth some seven thousand feet of rock parted from the sea by a narrow strip of bright green lowland here and there a patch of sugarcane or a knot of cocoanut trees close to the waters edge reminded them that they were in the tropics but above all was savage rough and bare as an alpine precipice sometimes deep clefts allowed the southern sun to pour a blaze of light down to the sea marge and gave glimpses far above of strange and stately trees lining the glens and of a veil of perpetual mist which shrouded the inner summits while up and down between them and the mountain side white fleecy clouds hung motionless in the burning air increasing the impression of vastness and of solemn rest which was already overpowering  within those mountains three thousand feet above our heads said drew the master lies saint yago de leon the great city which the spaniards founded fifteen years agone  is it a rich place asked cary  very they say  is it a strong place asked amyas  no forts to it at all they say the spaniards boast that heaven has made such good walls to it already that man need make none  i dont know quoth amyas lads could you climb those hills do you think  rather higher than harty point sir but it depends pretty much on whats behind them  and now the last point is rounded and they are full in sight of the spot in quest of which they have sailed four thousand miles of sea a low black cliff crowned by a wall a battery at either end within a few narrow streets of white houses running parallel with the sea upon a strip of flat which seemed not two hundred yards in breadth and behind the mountain wall covering the whole in deepest shade how that wall was ever ascended to the inland seemed the puzzle but drew who had been off the place before pointed out to them a narrow path which wound upwards through a glen seemingly sheer perpendicular that was the road to the capital if any man dare try it in spite of the shadow of the mountain the whole place wore a dusty and glaring look the breaths of air which came off the land were utterly stifling and no wonder for la guayra owing to the radiation of that vast firebrick of heated rock is one of the hottest spots upon the face of the whole earth  where was the harbor there was none only an open roadstead wherein lay tossing at anchor five vessels the two outer ones were small merchant caravels behind them lay two long low uglylooking craft at sight of which yeo gave a long whew  galleys as im a sinful saint and whats that big one inside of them robert drew she has more than hawseholes in her idolatrous black sides i think  we shall open her astern of the galleys in another minute said amyas look out cary your eyes are better than mine  six round portholes on the main deck quoth will  and i can see the brass patararoes glittering on her poop quoth amyas will were in for it  in for it we are captain       farewell farewell my parents dear      i never shall see you more i fear  lets go in nevertheless and pound the dons ribs my old lad of smerwick eh three to one is very fair odds  not underneath those fort guns i beg leave to say quoth yeo if the philistines will but come out unto us we will make them like unto zeba and zalmunna  quite true said amyas game cocks are game cocks but reasons reason  if the philistines are not coming out they are going to send a messenger instead quoth cary look out all thin skulls  and as he spoke a puff of white smoke rolled from the eastern fort and a heavy ball plunged into the water between it and the ship  i dont altogether like this quoth amyas what do they mean by firing on us without warning and what are these ships of war doing here drew you told me the armadas never lay here  no more i believe they do sir on account of the anchorage being so bad as you may see im mortal afeared that rascals story was true and that the dons have got wind of our coming  run up a white flag at all events if they do expect us they must have known some time since or how could they have got their craft hither  true sir they must have come from santa marta at the least perhaps from cartagena and that would take a month at least going and coming  amyas suddenly recollected eustaces threat in the wayside inn could he have betrayed their purpose impossible  let us hold a council of war at all events frank  frank was absorbed in a very different matter a halfmile to the eastward of the town two or three hundred feet up the steep mountain side stood a large low white house embosomed in trees and gardens there was no other house of similar size near no place for one and was not that the royal flag of spain which flaunted before it that must be the governors house that must be the abode of the rose of torridge and frank stood devouring it with wild eyes till he had persuaded himself that he could see a womans figure walking upon the terrace in front and that the figure was none other than hers whom he sought amyas could hardly tear him away to a council of war which was a sad and only not a peevish one  the three adventurers with brimblecombe yeo and drew went apart upon the poop and each looked the other in the face awhile for what was to be done the plans and hopes of months were brought to naught in an hour  it is impossible you see said amyas at last to surprise the town by land while these ships are here for if we land our men we leave our ship without defence  as impossible as to challenge don guzman while he is not here said cary  i wonder why the ships have not opened on us already said drew  perhaps they respect our flag of truce said cary why not send in a boat to treat with them and to inquire for  for her interrupted frank if we show that we are aware of her existence her name is blasted in the eyes of those jealous spaniards  and as for respecting our flag of truce gentlemen said yeo if you will take an old mans advice trust them not they will keep the same faith with us as they kept with captain hawkins at san juan dulloa in that accursed business which was the beginning of all the wars when we might have taken the whole platefleet with two hundred thousand pounds worth of gold on board and did not but only asked license to trade like honest men and yet after they had granted us license and deceived us by fair speech into landing ourselves and our ordnance the governor and all the fleet set upon us five to one and gave no quarter to any soul whom he took no sir i expect the only reason why they dont attack us is because their crews are not on board  they will be soon enough then said amyas i can see soldiers coming down the landingstairs  and in fact boats full of armed men began to push off to the ships  we may thank heaven said drew that we were not here two hours agone the sun will be down before they are ready for sea and the fellows will have no stomach to go looking for us by night  so much the worse for us if they will but do that we may give them the slip and back again to the town and there try our luck for i cannot find it in my heart to leave the place without having one dash at it  yeo shook his head there are plenty more towns along the coast more worth trying than this sir but heavens will be done  and as they spoke the sun plunged into the sea and all was dark  at last it was agreed to anchor and wait till midnight if the ships of war came out they were to try to run in past them and desperate as the attempt might be attempt their original plan of landing to the westward of the town taking it in flank plundering the government storehouses which they saw close to the landingplace and then fighting their way back to their boats and out of the roadstead two hours would suffice if the armada and the galleys were but once out of the way  amyas went forward called the men together and told them the plan it was not very cheerfully received but what else was there to be done  they ran down about a mile and a half to the westward and anchored  the night wore on and there was no sign of stir among the shipping for though they could not see the vessels themselves yet their lights easily distinguished by their relative height from those in the town above remained motionless and the men fretted and fumed for weary hours at thus seeing a rich prize for of course the town was paved with gold within arms reach and yet impossible  let amyas and his men have patience some short five years more and the great armada will have come and gone and then that avenging storm of which they like oxenham hawkins and drake are but the avantcouriers will burst upon every spanish port from corunna to cadiz from the canaries to havana and la guayra and st yago de leon will not escape their share captain amyas preston and captain sommers the colonist of the bermudas or sommers islands will land with a force tiny enough though larger far than leighs where leigh dare not land and taking the fort of guayra will find as leigh found that their coming has been expected and that the pass of the venta three thousand feet above has been fortified with huge barricadoes abattis and cannon making the capital amid its ring of mountainwalls impregnableto all but englishmen or zouaves for up that seven thousand feet of precipice which rises stair on stair behind the town those fierce adventurers will climb hand over hand through rain and fog while men lie down and beg their officers to kill them for no farther can they go yet farther they will go hewing a path with their swords through woods of wild plantain and rhododendron thickets over so it seems however incredible the very saddle of the silla down upon the astonished mantuanos of st jago driving all before them and having burnt the city in default of ransom will return triumphant by the right road and pass along the coast the masters of the deep        humboldt says that there is a path from caravellada to st      jago between the peaks used by smugglers  this is      probably the unknowen way of the indians which preston      used  i know not whether any men still live who count their descent from those two valiant captains but if such there be let them be sure that the history of the english navy tells no more titanic victory over nature and man than that now forgotten raid of amyas preston and his comrade in the year of grace 1595  but though a venture on the town was impossible yet there was another venture which frank was unwilling to let slip a light which now shone brightly in one of the windows of the governors house was the lodestar to which all his thoughts were turned and as he sat in the cabin with amyas cary and jack he opened his heart to them  and are we then asked he mournfully to go without doing the very thing for which we came  all were silent awhile at last john brimblecombe spoke  show me the way to do it mr frank and i will go  my dearest man said amyas what would you have any attempt to see her even if she be here would be all but certain death  and what if it were what if it were my brother amyas listen to me i have long ceased to shrink from death but till i came into these magic climes i never knew the beauty of his face  of death said cary i should have said of life god forgive me but man might wish to live forever if he had such a world as this wherein to live  and do you forget cary that the more fair this passing world of time by so much the more fair is that eternal world whereof all here is but a shadow and a dream by so much the more fair is he before whose throne the four mystic beasts the substantial ideas of nature and her powers stand day and night crying holy holy holy lord god of hosts thou hast made all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created my friends if he be so prodigal of his own glory as to have decked these lonely shores all but unknown since the foundation of the world with splendors beyond all our dreams what must be the glory of his face itself i have done with vain shadows it is better to depart and to be with him where shall be neither desire nor anger selfdeception nor pretence but the eternal fulness of reality and truth one thing i have to do before i die for god has laid it on me let that be done tonight and then farewell  frank frank remember our mother  i do remember her i have talked over these things with her many a time and where i would fain be she would fain be also she sent me out with my virgin honor as the spartan mother did her boy with the shield saying come back either with this or upon this and one or the other i must do if i would meet her either in this life or in the next but in the meanwhile do not mistake me my life is gods and i promise not to cast it away rashly  what would you do then  go up to that house amyas and speak with her if heaven gives me an opportunity as heaven i feel assured will give  and do you call that no rashness  is any duty rashness is it rash to stand amid the flying bullets if your queen has sent you is it more rash to go to seek christs lost lamb if god and your own oath hath sent you john brimblecombe answered that question for us long ago  if you go i go with you said all three at once  no amyas you owe a duty to our mother and to your ship cary you are heir to great estates and are bound thereby to your country and to your tenants john brimblecombe  ay squeaked jack and what have you to say mr frank against my goingi who have neither ship nor estatesexcept i suppose that i am not worthy to travel in such good company  think of your old parents john and all your sisters  i thought of them before i started sir as mr cary knows and you know too i came here to keep my vow and i am not going to turn renegade at the very foot of the cross  some one must go with you frank said amyas if it were only to bring back the boats crew in case and he faltered  in case i fall replied frank with a smile i will finish your sentence for you lad i am not afraid of it though you may be for me yet some one i fear must go unhappy me that i cannot risk my own worthless life without risking your more precious lives  not so mr frank your oath is our oath and your duty ours said john i will tell you what we will do gentlemen all we three will draw cuts for the honor of going with him  lots said amyas i dont like leaving such grave matters to chance friend john  chance sir when you have used all your own wit and find it fail you then what is drawing lots but taking the matter out of your own weak hands and laying it in gods strong hands  right john said frank so did the apostles choose their successor and so did holy men of old decide controversies too subtle for them and we will not be ashamed to follow their example for my part i have often said to sidney and to spenser when we have babbled together of utopian governments in days which are now dreams to me that i would have all officers of state chosen by lot out of the wisest and most fit so making sure that they should be called by god and not by man alone gentlemen do you agree to sir johns advice  they agreed seeing no better counsel and john put three slips of paper into franks hand with the simple old apostolic prayer  show which of us three thou hast chosen  the lot fell upon amyas leigh  frank shuddered and clasped his hands over his face  well said cary i have illluck tonight but frank goes at least in good company  ah that it had been i said jack though i suppose i was too poor a body to have such an honor fall on me and yet it is hard for flesh and blood hard indeed to have come all this way and not to see her after all  jack said frank you are kept to do better work than this doubt not but if the lot had fallen on youay if it had fallen on a three years child i would have gone up as cheerfully with that child to lead me as i do now with this my brother amyas can we have a boat and a crew it is near midnight already  amyas went on deck and asked for six volunteers whosoever would come amyas would double out of his own purse any prizemoney which might fall to that mans share  one of the old pelicans crew simon evans of clovelly stepped out at once  why six only captain give the word and any and all of us will go up with you sack the house and bring off the treasure and the lady before two hours are out  no no my brave lads as for treasure if there be any it is sure to have been put all safe into the forts or hidden in the mountains and as for the lady god forbid that we should force her a step without her own will  the honest sailor did not quite understand this punctilio but  well captain quoth he as you like but no man shall say that you asked for a volunteer were it to jump down a sharks throat but what you had me first of all the crew  after this sort of temper had been exhibited three or four more came forwardyeo was very anxious to go but amyas forbade him  ill volunteer sir without reward for this or anything though added he in a lower tone i would to heaven that the thought had never entered your head  and so would i have volunteered said simon evans if it were the ships quarrel or the queens but being its a private matter of the captains and ive a wife and children at home why i take no shame to myself for asking money for my life  so the crew was made up but ere they pushed off amyas called cary aside  if i perish will  dont talk of such things dear old lad  i must then you are captain do nothing without yeo and drew but if they approve go right north away for san domingo and cuba and try the ports they can have no news of us there and there is booty without end tell my mother that i died like a gentleman and mindmind dear lad to keep your temper with the men let the poor fellows grumble as they may mind but that and fear god and all will go well  the tears were glistening in carys eyes as he pressed amyass hand and watched the two brothers down over the side upon their desperate errand  they reached the pebble beach there seemed no difficulty about finding the path to the houseso bright was the moon and so careful a survey of the place had frank taken leaving the men with the boat amyas had taken care that they should be well armed they started up the beach with their swords only frank assured amyas that they would find a path leading from the beach up to the house and he was not mistaken they found it easily for it was made of white shell sand and following it struck into a tunal or belt of tall thorny cactuses through this the path wound in zigzags up a steep rocky slope and ended at a wicketgate they tried it and found it open  she may expect us whispered frank  impossible  why not she must have seen our ship and if as seems the townsfolk know who we are how much more must she yes doubt it not she still longs to hear news of her own land and some secret sympathy will draw her down towards the sea tonight see the light is in the window still  but if not said amyas who had no such expectation what is your plan  i have none  none  i have imagined twenty different ones in the last hour but all are equally uncertain impossible i have ceased to strugglei go where i am called loves willing victim if heaven accept the sacrifice it will provide the altar and the knife  aymas was at his wits end judging of his brother by himself he had taken for granted that frank had some wellconcocted scheme for gaining admittance to the rose and as the wiles of love were altogether out of his province he had followed in full faith such a sansappel as he held frank to be but now he almost doubted of his brothers sanity though franks manner was perfectly collected and his voice firm amyas honest fellow had no understanding of that intense devotion which so many in those days not content with looking on it as a lofty virtue and yet one to be duly kept in its place by other duties prided themselves on pampering into the most fantastic and selfwilled excesses  beautiful folly the deathsong of which two great geniuses were composing at that very moment each according to his light for while spenser was embalming in immortal verse all that it contained of noble and christian elements cervantes sat perhaps in his dungeon writing with his left hand don quixote saddest of books in spite of all its wit the story of a pure and noble soul who mistakes this actual life for that ideal one which he fancies and not so wrongly either eternal in the heavens and finding instead of a battlefield for heroes in gods cause nothing but frivolity heartlessness and godlessness becomes a laughingstockand dies one of the saddest books i say again which man can read  amyas hardly dare trust himself to speak for fear of saying too much but he could not help saying  you are going to certain death frank  did i not entreat answered he very quietly to go alone  amyas had half a mind to compel him to return but he feared franks obstinacy and feared too the shame of returning on board without having done anything so they went up through the wicketgate along a smooth turf walk into what seemed a pleasuregarden formed by the hand of man or rather of woman for by the light not only of the moon but of the innumerable fireflies which flitted to and fro across the sward like fiery imps sent to light the brothers on their way they could see that the bushes on either side and the trees above their heads were decked with flowers of such strangeness and beauty that as frank once said of barbados even the gardens of wilton were a desert in comparison all around were orange and lemon trees probably the only addition which man had made to natures prodigality the fruit of which in that strange colored light of the fireflies flashed in their eyes like balls of burnished gold and emerald while great white tassels swinging from every tree in the breeze which swept down the glade tossed in their faces a fragrant snow of blossoms and glittering drops of perfumed dew  what a paradise said amyas to frank with the serpent in it as of old look  and as he spoke there dropped slowly down from a bough right before them what seemed a living chain of gold ruby and sapphire both stopped and another glance showed the small head and bright eyes of a snake hissing and glaring full in their faces  see said frank and he comes as of old in the likeness of an angel of light do not strike it there are worse devils to be fought with tonight than that poor beast and stepping aside they passed the snake safely and arrived in front of the house  it was as i have said a long low house with balconies along the upper story and the under part mostly open to the wind the light was still burning in the window  whither now said amyas in a tone of desperate resignation  thither where else on earth and frank pointed to the light trembling from head to foot and pushed on  for heavens sake look at the negroes on the barbecue  it was indeed time to stop for on the barbecue or terrace of white plaster which ran all round the front lay sleeping full twenty black figures  what will you do now you must step over them to gain an entrance  wait here and i will go up gently towards the window she may see me she will see me as i step into the moonlight at least i know an air by which she will recognize me if i do but hum a stave  why you do not even know that that light is hersdown for your life  and amyas dragged him down into the bushes on his left hand for one of the negroes wakening suddenly with a cry had sat up and began crossing himself four or five times in fear of duppy and mumbling various charms ayes or what not  the light above was extinguished instantly  did you see her whispered frank  no  i didthe shadow of the face and the neck can i be mistaken and then covering his face with his hands he murmured to himself misery misery so near and yet impossible  would it be the less impossible were you face to face let us go back we cannot go up without detection even if our going were of use come back for gods sake ere all is lost if you have seen her as you say you know at least that she is alive and safe in his house  as his mistress or as his wife do i know that yet amyas and can i depart until i know there was a few minutes silence and then amyas making one last attempt to awaken frank to the absurdity of the whole thing and to laugh him if possible out of it as argument had no effect  my dear fellow i am very hungry and sleepy and this bush is very prickly and my boots are full of ants  so are minelook and frank caught amyass arm and clenched it tight  for round the farther corner of the house a dark cloaked figure stole gently turning a look now and then upon the sleeping negroes and came on right toward them  did i not tell you she would come whispered frank in a triumphant tone  amyas was quite bewildered and to his mind the apparition seemed magical and frank prophetic for as the figure came nearer incredulous as he tried to be there was no denying that the shape and the walk were exactly those of her to find whom they had crossed the atlantic true the figure was somewhat taller but then she must be grown since i saw her thought amyas and his heart for the moment beat as fiercely as franks  but what was that behind her her shadow against the white wall of the house not so another figure cloaked likewise but taller far was following on her steps it was a mans they could see that he wore a broad sombrero it could not be don guzman for he was at sea who then here was a mystery perhaps a tragedy and both brothers held their breaths while amyas felt whether his sword was loose in the sheath  the rose if indeed it was she was within ten yards of them when she perceived that she was followed she gave a little shriek the cavalier sprang forward lifted his hat courteously and joined her bowing low the moonlight was full upon his face  it is eustace our cousin how came he here in the name of all the fiends  eustace then that is she after all said frank forgetting everything else in her  and now flashed across amyas all that had passed between him and eustace in the moorland inn and parracombes story too of the suspicious gipsy eustace had been beforehand with them and warned don guzman all was explained now but how had he got hither  the devil his master sent him hither on a broomstick i suppose or what matter how here he is and here we are worse luck and setting his teeth amyas awaited the end  the two came on talking earnestly and walking at a slow pace so that the brothers could hear every word  what shall we do now said frank we have no right to be eavesdroppers  but we must be right or none and amyas held him down firmly by the arm  but whither are you going then my dear madam they heard eustace say in a wheedling tone can you wonder if such strange conduct should cause at least sorrow to your admirable and faithful husband  husband whispered frank faintly to amyas thank god thank god i am content let us go  but to go was impossible for as fate would have it the two had stopped just opposite them  the inestimable senor don guzman began eustace again  what do you mean by praising him to me in this fulsome way sir do you suppose that i do not know his virtues better than you  if you do madam this was spoken in a harder tone it were wise for you to try them less severely than by wandering down towards the beach on the very night that you know his most deadly enemies are lying in wait to slay him plunder his house and most probably to carry you off from him  carry me off i will die first  who can prove that to him appearances are at least against you  my love to him and his trust for me sir  his trust have you forgotten madam what passed last week and why he sailed yesterday  the only answer was a burst of tears eustace stood watching her with a terrible eye but they could see his face writhing in the moonlight  oh sobbed she at last and if i have been imprudent was it not natural to wish to look once more upon an english ship are you not english as well as i have you no longing recollections of the dear old land at home  eustace was silent but his face worked more fiercely than ever  how can he ever know it  why should he not know it  ah she burst out passionately why not indeed while you are here you sir the tempter you the eavesdropper you the sunderer of loving hearts you serpent who found our home a paradise and see it now a hell  do you dare to accuse me thus madam without a shadow of evidence  dare i dare anything for i know all i have watched you sir and i have borne with you too long  me madam whose only sin towards you as you should know by now is to have loved you too well rose rose have you not blighted my life for mebroken my heart and how have i repaid you how but by sacrificing myself to seek you over land and sea that i might complete your conversion to the bosom of that church where a virgin mother stands stretching forth soft arms to embrace her wandering daughter and cries to you all day long come unto me ye that are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest and this is my reward  depart with your virgin mother sir and tempt me no more you have asked me what i dare and i dare this upon my own ground and in my own garden i donna rosa de soto to bid you leave this place now and forever after having insulted me by talking of your love and tempted me to give up that faith which my husband promised me he would respect and protect go sir  the brothers listened breathless with surprise as much as with rage love and conscience and perhaps too the pride of her lofty alliance had converted the once gentle and dreamy rose into a very roxana but it was only the impulse of a moment the words had hardly passed her lips when terrified at what she had said she burst into a fresh flood of tears while eustace answered calmly  i go madam but how know you that i may not have orders and that after your last strange speech my conscience may compel me to obey those orders to take you with me  me with you  my heart has bled for you madam for many a year it longs now that it had bled itself to death and never known the last worst agony of telling you  and drawing close to her he whispered in her earwhat the brothers heard notbut her answer was a shriek which rang through the woods and sent the nightbirds fluttering up from every bough above their heads  by heaven said amyas i can stand this no longer cut that devils throat i must  she is lost if his dead body is found by her  we are lost if we stay here then said amyas for those negroes will hurry down at her cry and then found we must be  are you mad madam to betray yourself by your own cries the negroes will be here in a moment i give you one last chance for life then and eustace shouted in spanish at the top of his voice help help servants your mistress is being carried off by bandits  what do you mean sir  let your womans wit supply the rest and forget not him who thus saves you from disgrace  whether the brothers heard the last words or not i know not but taking for granted that eustace had discovered them they sprang to their feet at once determined to make one last appeal and then to sell their lives as dearly as they could  eustace started back at the unexpected apparition but a second glance showed him amyass mighty bulk and he spoke calmly  you see madam i did not call without need welcome good cousins my charity as you perceive has found means to outstrip your craft while the fair lady as was but natural has been true to her assignation  liar cried frank she never knew of our being  credat judaeus answered eustace but as he spoke amyas burst through the bushes at him there was no time to be lost and ere the giant could disentangle himself from the boughs and shrubs eustace had slipped off his long cloak thrown it over amyass head and ran up the alley shouting for help  mad with rage amyas gave chase but in two minutes more eustace was safe among the ranks of the negroes who came shouting and jabbering down the path  he rushed back frank was just ending some wild appeal to rose  your conscience your religion  no never i can face the chance of death but not the loss of him go for gods sake leave me  you are lost thenand i have ruined you  come off now or never cried amyas clutching him by the arm and dragging him away like a child  you forgive me cried he  forgive you and she burst into tears again  frank burst into tears also  let me go back and die with heramyasmy oathmy honor and he struggled to turn back  amyas looked back too and saw her standing calmly with her hands folded across her breast awaiting eustace and the servants and he half turned to go back also both saw how fearfully appearances had put her into eustaces power had he not a right to suspect that they were there by her appointment that she was going to escape with them and would not eustace use his power the thought of the inquisition crossed their minds was that the threat which eustace had whispered asked he of frank  it was groaned frank in answer  for the first and last time in his life amyas leigh stood irresolute  back and stab her to the heart first said frank struggling to escape from him  oh if amyas were but alone and frank safe home in england to charge the whole mob kill her kill eustace and then cut his way back again to the ship or diewhat matter as he must die some daysword in hand but frankand then flashed before his eyes his mothers hopeless face then rang in his ears his mothers last bequest to him of that frail treasure let rose let honor let the whole world perish he must save frank see the negroes were up with her nowpast heraway for life and once more he dragged his brother down the hill and through the wicket only just in time for the whole gang of negroes were within ten yards of them in full pursuit  frank said he sharply if you ever hope to see your mother again rouse yourself man and fight and without waiting for an answer he turned and charged uphill upon his pursuers who saw the long bright blade and fled instantly  again he hurried frank down the hill the path wound in zigzags and he feared that the negroes would come straight over the cliff and so cut off his retreat but the prickly cactuses were too much for them and they were forced to follow by the path while the brothers frank having somewhat regained his senses turned every now and then to menace them but once on the rocky path stones began to fly fast small ones fortunately and wide and wild for want of lightbut when they reached the pebblebeach both were too proud to run but if ever amyas prayed in his life he prayed for the last twenty yards before he reached the watermark  now frank down to the boat as hard as you can run while i keep the curs back  amyas what do you take me for my madness brought you hither your devotion shall not bring me back without you  together then  and putting franks arm through his they hurried down shouting to their men  the boat was not fifty yards off but fast travelling over the pebbles was impossible and long ere half the distance was crossed the negroes were on the beach and the storm burst a volley of great quartz pebbles whistled round their heads  come on frank for lifes sake men to the rescue ah what was that  the dull crash of a pebble against franks fair head drooping like hyacinthus beneath the blow of the quoit he sank on amyass arm the giant threw him over his shoulder and plunged blindly onhimself struck again and again  fire men give it the black villains  the arquebuses crackled from the boat in front what were those dull thuds which answered from behind echoes no over his head the caliverballs went screeching the governors guard have turned out followed them to the beach fixed their calivers and are firing over the negroes heads as the savages rush down upon the hapless brothers  if as all say there are moments which are hours how many hours was amyas leigh in reaching that boats bow alas the negroes are there as soon as he and the guard having left their calivers are close behind them sword in hand amyas is up to his knees in waterbattered with stonesblinded with blood the boat is swaying off and on against the steep pebblebank he clutches at itmissesfalls headlongrises halfchoked with water but frank is still in his arms another heavy blowa confused roar of shouts shots cursesa confused mass of negroes and english foam and pebblesand he recollects no more                          he is lying in the sternsheets of the boat stiff weak half blind with blood he looks up the moon is still bright overhead but they are away from the shore now for the wavecrests are dancing white before the landbreeze high above the boats side the boat seems strangely empty two men are pulling instead of six and what is this lying heavy across his chest he pushes and is answered by a groan he puts his hand down to rise and is answered by another groan  whats this  all that are left of us says simon evans of clovelly  all the bottom of the boat seemed paved with human bodies oh god oh god moans amyas trying to rise and wherewhere is frank frank  mr frank cries evans there is no answer  dead shrieks amyas look for him for gods sake look and struggling from under his living load he peers into each pale and bleeding face  where is he why dont you speak forward there  because we have naught to say sir answers evans almost surlily  frank was not there  put the boat about to the shore roars amyas  look over the gunwale and judge for yourself sir  the waves are leaping fierce and high before a furious landbreeze return is impossible  cowards villains traitors hounds to have left him behind  listen you to me captain amyas leigh says simon evans resting on his oar and hang me for mutiny if you will when were aboard if we ever get there isnt it enough to bring us out to death as you knew yourself sir for youre prudent enough to please that poor young gentlemans fancy about a wench but you must call coward an honest man that have saved your life this night and not a one of us but has his wound to show  amyas was silent the rebuke was just  i tell you sir if weve hove a stone out of this boat since we got off weve hove two hundredweight and if the lord had not fought for us shed have been beat to nogginstaves there on the beach  how did i come here then  tom hart dragged you in out of five feet water and then thrust the boat off and had his brains beat out for reward all were knocked down but us two so help me god we thought that you had hove mr frank on board just as you were knocked down and saw william frost drag him in  but william frost was lying senseless in the bottom of the boat there was no explanation after all none was needed  and i have three wounds from stones and this man behind me as many more beside a shot through his shoulder now sir be we cowards  you have done your duty said amyas and sank down in the boat and cried as if his heart would break and then sprang up and wounded as he was took the oar from evanss hands with weary work they made the ship but so exhausted that another boat had to be lowered to get them alongside  the alarm being now given it was hardly safe to remain where they were and after a stormy and sad argument it was agreed to weigh anchor and stand off and on till morning for amyas refused to leave the spot till he was compelled though he had no hope how could he have that frank might still be alive and perhaps it was well for them as will appear in the next chapter that morning did not find them at anchor close to the town  however that may be so ended that fatal venture of mistaken chivalry    chapter xx  spanish bloodhounds and english mastiffs       full seven long hours in all mens sight        this fight endured sore      until our men so feeble grew        that they could fight no more      and then upon dead horses        full savorly they fed      and drank the puddle water        they could no better get       when they had fed so freely        they kneeled on the ground      and gave god thanks devoutly for        the favor they had found      then beating up their colors        the fight they did renew      and turning to the spaniards        a thousand more they slew         the brave lord willoughby  1586  when the sun leaped up the next morning and the tropic light flashed suddenly into the tropic day amyas was pacing the deck with dishevelled hair and torn clothes his eyes red with rage and weeping his heart fullhow can i describe it picture it to yourselves picture it to yourselves you who have ever lost a brother and you who have not thank god that you know nothing of his agony full of impossible projects he strode and staggered up and down as the ship thrashed closehauled through the rolling seas he would go back and burn the villa he would take guayra and have the life of every man in it in return for his brothers we can do it lads he shouted if drake took nombre de dios we can take la guayra and every voice shouted yes  we will have it amyas and have frank too yet cried cary but amyas shook his head he knew and knew not why he knew that all the ports in new spain would never restore to him that one beloved face  yes he shall be well avenged and look there there is the first crop of our vengeance and he pointed toward the shore where between them and the now distant peaks of the silla three sails appeared not five miles to windward  there are the spanish bloodhounds on our heels the same ships which we saw yesterday off guayra back lads and welcome them if they were a dozen  there was a murmur of applause from all around and if any young heart sank for a moment at the prospect of fighting three ships at once it was awed into silence by the cheer which rose from all the older men and by salvation yeos stentorian voice  if there were a dozen the lord is with us who has said one of you shall chase a thousand clear away lads and see the glory of the lord this day  amen cried cary and the ship was kept still closer to the wind  amyas had revived at the sight of battle he no longer felt his wounds or his great sorrow even franks last angels look grew dimmer every moment as he bustled about the deck and ere a quarter of an hour had passed his voice cried firmly and cheerfully as of old  now my masters let us serve god and then to breakfast and after that clear for action  jack brimblecombe read the daily prayers and the prayers before a fight at sea and his honest voice trembled as in the prayer for all conditions of men in spite of amyass despair he added and especially for our dear brother mr francis leigh perhaps captive among the idolaters and so they rose  now then said amyas to breakfast a frenchman fights best fasting a dutchman drunk an englishman full and a spaniard when the devil is in him and thats always  and good beef and the good cause are a match for the devil said cary come down captain you must eat too  amyas shook his head took the tiller from the steersman and bade him go below and fill himself will cary went down and returned in five minutes with a plate of bread and beef and a great jack of ale coaxed them down amyass throat as a nurse does with a child and then scuttled below again with tears hopping down his face  amyas stood still steering his face was grown seven years older in the last night a terrible set calm was on him woe to the man who came across him that day  there are three of them you see my masters said he as the crew came on deck again a big ship forward and two galleys astern of her the big ship may keep she is a race ship and if we can but recover the wind of her we will see whether our height is not a match for her length we must give her the slip and take the galleys first  i thank the lord said yeo who has given so wise a heart to so young a general a very david and daniel saving his presence lads and if any dare not follow him let him be as the men of meroz and of succoth amen silas staveley smite me that boy over the head the young monkey why is he not down at the powderroom door  and yeo went about his gunnery as one who knew how to do it and had the most terrible mind to do it thoroughly and the most terrible faith that it was gods work  so all fell to and though there was comparatively little to be done the ship having been kept as far as could be in fighting order all night yet there was clearing of decks lacing of nettings making of bulwarks fitting of waistcloths arming of tops tallowing of pikes slinging of yards doubling of sheets and tacks enough to satisfy even the pedantical soul of richard hawkins himself amyas took charge of the poop cary of the forecastle and yeo as gunner of the maindeck while drew as master settled himself in the waist and all was ready and more than ready before the great ship was within two miles of them  and now while the mastiffs of england and the bloodhounds of spain are nearing and nearing over the rolling surges thirsting for each others blood let us spend a few minutes at least in looking at them both and considering the causes which in those days enabled the english to face and conquer armaments immensely superior in size and number of ships and to boast that in the whole spanish war but one queens ship the revenge and if i recollect right but one private manofwar sir richard hawkinss dainty had ever struck their colors to the enemy  what was it which enabled sir richard grenvilles revenge in his last fearful fight off the azores to endure for twelve hours before she struck the attack of eight spanish armadas of which two three times her own burden sank at her side and after all her masts were gone and she had been boarded three times without success to defy to the last the whole fleet of fiftyfour sail which lay around her waiting for her to sink like dogs around the dying forest king  what enabled young richard hawkinss dainty though half her guns were useless through the carelessness or treachery of the gunner to maintain for three days a running fight with two spaniards of equal size with her double the weight of metal and ten times the number of men  what enabled sir george carys illustrious ship the content to fight singlehanded from seven in the morning till eleven at night with four great armadas and two galleys though her heaviest gun was but one ninepounder and for many hours she had but thirteen men fit for service  what enabled in the very year of which i write those two valiant turkey merchantmen of london the merchant royal and the tobie with their three small consorts to cripple off pantellaria in the mediterranean the whole fleet of spanish galleys sent to intercept them and return triumphant through the straits of gibraltar  and lastly what in the fight of 1588 whereof more hereafter enabled the english fleet to capture destroy and scatter that great armada with the loss but not the capture of one pinnace and one gentleman of note  there were more causes than one the first seems to have lain in the build of the english ships the second in their superior gunnery and weight of metal the third without which the first would have been useless in the hearts of the english men  the english ship was much shorter than the spanish and this with the rig of those days gave them an ease in manoeuvring which utterly confounded their spanish foes the english ships in the fight of 1588 says camden charged the enemy with marvellous agility and having discharged their broadsides flew forth presently into the deep and levelled their shot directly without missing at those great ships of the spaniards which were altogether heavy and unwieldy moreover the spanish fashion in the west indies at least though not in the ships of the great armada was for the sake of carrying merchandise to build their menofwar flushdecked or as it was called race razes which left those on deck exposed and open while the english fashion was to heighten the ship as much as possible at stem and stern both by the sweep of her lines and also by stockades close fights and cageworks on the poop and forecastle thus giving to the men a shelter which was further increased by strong bulkheads cobridgeheads across the maindeck below dividing the ship thus into a number of separate forts fitted with swivels bases fowlers and murderers and loopholed for musketry and arrows  but the great source of superiority was after all in the men themselves the english sailor was then as now a quite amphibious and allcunning animal capable of turning his hand to everything from needlework and carpentry to gunnery or handtohand blows and he was moreover one of a nation every citizen of which was not merely permitted to carry arms but compelled by law to practise from childhood the use of the bow and accustomed to consider swordplay and quarterstaff as a necessary part and parcel of education and the pastime of every leisure hour the fiercest nation upon earth as they were then called and the freest also each man of them fought for himself with the selfhelp and selfrespect of a yankee ranger and once bidden to do his work was trusted to carry it out by his own wit as best he could in one word he was a free man  the english officers too as now lived on terms of sympathy with their men unknown to the spaniards who raised between the commander and the commanded absurd barriers of rank and blood which forbade to his pride any labor but that of fighting the english officers on the other hand brought up to the same athletic sports the same martial exercises as their men were not ashamed to care for them to win their friendship even on emergency to consult their judgment and used their rank not to differ from their men but to outvie them not merely to command and be obeyed but like homers heroes or the old norse vikings to lead and be followed drake touched the true mainspring of english success when he once in his voyage round the world indignantly rebuked some coxcomb gentlemenadventurers withi should like to see the gentleman that will refuse to set his hand to a rope i must have the gentlemen to hale and draw with the mariners but those were days in which her majestys service was as little overridden by absurd rules of seniority as by that etiquette which is at once the counterfeit and the ruin of true discipline under elizabeth and her ministers a brave and a shrewd man was certain of promotion let his rank or his age be what they might the true honor of knighthood covered once and for all any lowliness of birth and the merchant service in which all the best seacaptains even those of noble blood were more or less engaged was then a nursery not only for seamen but for warriors in days when spanish and portuguese traders whenever they had a chance got rid of english competition by salvos of cannonshot  hence as i have said that strong fellowfeeling between officers and men and hence mutinies as sir richard hawkins tells us were all but unknown in the english ships while in the spanish they broke out on every slight occasion for the spaniards by some suicidal pedantry had allowed their navy to be crippled by the same despotism etiquette and official routine by which the whole nation was gradually frozen to death in the course of the next century or two forgetting that fifty years before cortez pizarro and the early conquistadores of america had achieved their miraculous triumphs on the exactly opposite method by that very fellowfeeling between commander and commanded by which the english were now conquering them in their turn  their navy was organized on a plan complete enough but on one which was as the event proved utterly fatal to their prowess and unanimity and which made even their courage and honor useless against the assaults of free men they do in their armadas at sea divide themselves into three bodies to wit soldiers mariners and gunners the soldiers and officers watch and ward as if on shore and this is the only duty they undergo except cleaning their arms wherein they are not over curious the gunners are exempted from all labor and care except about the artillery and these are either almaines flemings or strangers for the spaniards are but indifferently practised in this art the mariners are but as slaves to the rest to moil and to toil day and night and those but few and bad and not suffered to sleep or harbor under the decks for in fair or foul weather in storms sun or rain they must pass void of covert or succor  this is the account of one who was long prisoner on board their ships let it explain itself while i return to my tale for the great ship is now within two musketshots of the rose with the golden flag of spain floating at her poop and her trumpets are shouting defiance up the breeze from a dozen brazen throats which two or three answer lustily from the rose from whose poop flies the flag of england and from her fore the arms of leigh and cary side by side and over them the ship and bridge of the good town of bideford and then amyas calls  now silence trumpets waits play up fortune my foe and god and the queen be with us  whereon laugh not reader for it was the fashion of those musical as well as valiant days up rose that noble old favorite of good queen bess from cornet and sackbut fife and drum while parson jack who had taken his stand with the musicians on the poop worked away lustily at his violin and like volker of the nibelungen lied  well played jack thy elbow flies like a lambs tail said amyas forcing a jest  it shall fly to a better fiddlebow presently sir an i have the luck  steady helm said amyas what is he after now  the spaniard who had been coming upon them right down the wind under a press of sail took in his light canvas  he dont know what to make of our waiting for him so bold said the helmsman  he does though and means to fight us cried another see he is hauling up the foot of his mainsail but he wants to keep the wind of us  let him try then quoth amyas keep her closer still let no one fire till we are about man the starboard guns to starboard and wait all small arm men pass the order down to the gunner and bid all fire high and take the rigging  bang went one of the spaniards bow guns and the shot went wide then another and another while the men fidgeted about looking at the priming of their muskets and loosened their arrows in the sheaf  lie down men and sing a psalm when i want you ill call you closer still if you can helmsman and we will try a short ship against a long one we can sail two points nearer the wind than he  as amyas had calculated the spaniard would gladly enough have stood across the roses bows but knowing the english readiness dare not for fear of being raked so her only plan if she did not intend to shoot past her foe down to leeward was to put her head close to the wind and wait for her on the same tack  amyas laughed to himself hold on yet awhile more ways of killing a cat than choking her with cream drew there are your men ready  ay ay sir and on they went closing fast with the spaniard till within a pistolshot  ready about and about she went like an eel and ran upon the opposite tack right under the spaniards stern the spaniard astounded at the quickness of the manoeuvre hesitated a moment and then tried to get about also as his only chance but it was too late and while his lumbering length was still hanging in the winds eye amyass bowsprit had all but scraped his quarter and the rose passed slowly across his stern at ten yards distance  now then roared amyas fire and with a will have at her archers have at her muskets all and in an instant a storm of bar and chainshot round and canister swept the proud don from stem to stern while through the white cloud of smoke the musketballs and the still deadlier clothyard arrows whistled and rushed upon their venomous errand down went the steersman and every soul who manned the poop down went the mizzen topmast in went the sternwindows and quartergalleries and as the smoke cleared away the gorgeous painting of the madre dolorosa with her heart full of seven swords which in a gilded frame bedizened the spanish stern was shivered in splinters while most glorious of all the golden flag of spain which the last moment flaunted above their heads hung trailing in the water the ship her tiller shot away and her helmsman killed staggered helplessly a moment and then fell up into the wind  well done men of devon shouted amyas as cheers rent the welkin  she has struck cried some as the deafening hurrahs died away  not a bit said amyas hold on helmsman and leave her to patch her tackle while we settle the galleys  on they shot merrily and long ere the armada could get herself to rights again were two good miles to windward with the galleys sweeping down fast upon them  and two venomouslooking craft they were as they shot through the short chopping sea upon some forty oars apiece stretching their long swordfish snouts over the water as if snuffing for their prey behind this long snout a strong square forecastle was crammed with soldiers and the muzzles of cannon grinned out through portholes not only in the sides of the forecastle but forward in the line of the galleys course thus enabling her to keep up a continual fire on a ship right ahead  the long low waist was packed full of the slaves some five or six to each oar and down the centre between the two banks the english could see the slavedrivers walking up and down a long gangway whip in hand a raised quarterdeck at the stern held more soldiers the sunlight flashing merrily upon their armor and their gunbarrels as they neared the english could hear plainly the cracks of the whips and the yells as of wild beasts which answered them the roll and rattle of the oars and the loud ha of the slaves which accompanied every stroke and the oaths and curses of the drivers while a sickening musky smell as of a pack of kennelled hounds came down the wind from off those dens of misery no wonder if many a young heart shuddered as it faced for the first time the horrible reality of those floating hells the cruelties whereof had rung so often in english ears from the stories of their own countrymen who had passed them fought them and now and then passed years of misery on board of them who knew but what there might be english among those sunbrowned halfnaked masses of panting wretches  must we fire upon the slaves asked more than one as the thought crossed him  amyas sighed  spare them all you can in gods name but if they try to run us down rake them we must and god forgive us  the two galleys came on abreast of each other some forty yards apart to outmanoeuvre their oars as he had done the ships sails amyas knew was impossible to run from them was to be caught between them and the ship  he made up his mind as usual to the desperate game  lay her head up in the wind helmsman and we will wait for them  they were now within musketshot and opened fire from their bowguns but owing to the chopping sea their aim was wild amyas as usual withheld his fire  the men stood at quarters with compressed lips not knowing what was to come next amyas towering motionless on the quarterdeck gave his orders calmly and decisively the men saw that he trusted himself and trusted him accordingly  the spaniards seeing him wait for them gave a shout of joywas the englishman mad and the two galleys converged rapidly intending to strike him full one on each bow  they were within forty yardsanother minute and the shock would come the englishmans helm went up his yards creaked round and gathering way he plunged upon the larboard galley  a dozen gold nobles to him who brings down the steersman shouted cary who had his cue  and a flight of arrows from the forecastle rattled upon the galleys quarterdeck  hit or not hit the steersman lost his nerve and shrank from the coming shock the galleys helm went up to port and her beak slid all but harmless along amyass bow a long dull grind and then loud crack on crack as the rose sawed slowly through the bank of oars from stem to stern hurling the wretched slaves in heaps upon each other and ere her mate on the other side could swing round to strike him in his new position amyass whole broadside great and small had been poured into her at pistolshot answered by a yell which rent their ears and hearts  spare the slaves fire at the soldiers cried amyas but the work was too hot for much discrimination for the larboard galley crippled but not undaunted swung round across his stern and hooked herself venomously on to him  it was a move more brave than wise for it prevented the other galley from returning to the attack without exposing herself a second time to the english broadside and a desperate attempt of the spaniards to board at once through the sternports and up the quarter was met with such a demurrer of shot and steel that they found themselves in three minutes again upon the galleys poop accompanied to their intense disgust by amyas leigh and twenty english swords  five minutes hard cutting hand to hand and the poop was clear the soldiers in the forecastle had been able to give them no assistance open as they lay to the arrows and musketry from the roses lofty stern amyas rushed along the central gangway shouting in spanish freedom to the slaves death to the masters clambered into the forecastle followed close by his swarm of wasps and set them so good an example how to use their stings that in three minutes more there was not a spaniard on board who was not dead or dying  let the slaves free shouted he throw us a hammer down men hark theres an english voice  there is indeed from amid the wreck of broken oars and writhing limbs a voice is shrieking in broadest devon to the master who is looking over the side  oh robert drew robert drew come down and take me out of hell  who be you in the name of the lord  dont you mind william prust that captain hawkins left behind in the honduras years and years agone theres nine of us aboard if your shot hasnt put em out of their misery come down if youve a christian heart come down  utterly forgetful of all discipline drew leaps down hammer in hand and the two old comrades rush into each others arms  why make a long story of what took but five minutes to do the nine men luckily none of them wounded are freed and helped on board to be hugged and kissed by old comrades and young kinsmen while the remaining slaves furnished with a couple of hammers are told to free themselves and help the english the wretches answer by a shout and amyas once more safe on board again dashes after the other galley which has been hovering out of reach of his guns but there is no need to trouble himself about her sickened with what she has got she is struggling right up wind leaning over to one side and seemingly ready to sink  are there any english on board of her asks amyas loath to lose the chance of freeing a countryman  never a one sir thank god  so they set to work to repair damages while the liberated slaves having shifted some of the galleys oars pull away after their comrade and that with such a will that in ten minutes they have caught her up and careless of the spaniards fire boarded her en masse with yells as of a thousand wolves there will be fearful vengeance taken on those tyrants unless they play the man this day  and in the meanwhile half the crew are clothing feeding questioning caressing those nine poor fellows thus snatched from living death and yeo hearing the news has rushed up on deck to welcome his old comrades and  is michael heard my cousin here among you  yes michael heard is there whiteheaded rather from misery than age and the embracings and questionings begin afresh  where is my wife salvation yeo  with the lord  amen says the old man with a short shudder i thought so much and my two boys  with the lord  the old man catches yeo by the arm  how then it is yeos turn to shudder now  killed in panama fighting the spaniards sailing with mr oxenham and twas i led em into it may god and you forgive me  they couldnt die better cousin yeo wheres my girl grace  died in childbed  any childer  no  the old man covers his face with his hands for a while  well ive been alone with the lord these fifteen years so i must not whine at being alone a while longert wont be long  put this coat on your back uncle says some one  no no coats for me naked came i into the world and naked i go out of it this day if i have a chance youm better to go to your work lads or the big one will have the wind of you yet  so she will said amyas who has overheard but so great is the curiosity on all hands that he has some trouble in getting the men to quarters again indeed they only go on condition of parting among themselves with them the newcomers each to tell his sad and strange story how after captain hawkins constrained by famine had put them ashore they wandered in misery till the spaniards took them how instead of hanging them as they at first intended the dons fed and clothed them and allotted them as servants to various gentlemen about mexico where they throve turned their hands like true sailors to all manner of trades and made much money and some of them were married even to women of wealth so that all went well until the fatal year 1574 when much against the minds of many of the spaniards themselves that cruel and bloody inquisition was established for the first time in the indies and how from that moment their lives were one long tragedy how they were all imprisoned for a year and a half not for proselytizing but simply for not believing in transubstantiation racked again and again and at last adjudged to receive publicly on good friday 1575 some three hundred some one hundred stripes and to serve in the galleys for six or ten years each while as the crowning atrocity of the moloch sacrifice three of them were burnt alive in the marketplace of mexico a story no less hideous than true the details whereof whoso list may read in hakluyts third volume as told by philip miles one of that hapless crew as well as the adventures of job hortop a messmate of his who after being sent to spain and seeing two more of his companions burnt alive at seville was sentenced to row in the galleys ten years and after that to go to the everlasting prison remediless from which doom after twentythree years of slavery he was delivered by the galleon dudley and came safely home to redriff  the fate of hortop and his comrades was of course still unknown to the rescued men but the history even of their party was not likely to improve the good feeling of the crew toward the spanish ship which was two miles to leeward of them and which must be fought with or fled from before a quarter of an hour was past so kneeling down upon the deck as many a brave crew in those days did in like case they gave god thanks devoutly for the favor they had found and then with one accord at jacks leading sang one and all the ninetyfourth psalm       oh lord thou dost revenge all wrong        vengeance belongs to thee etc        the crew of the tobie cast away on the barbary coast a      few years after began with heavy hearts to sing the      twelfth psalm help lord for good and godly men etc      howbeit ere we had finished four verses the waves of the      sea had stopped the breaths of most  and then again to quarters for half the days work or more than half still remained to be done and hardly were the decks cleared afresh and the damage repaired as best it could be when she came ranging up to leeward as closehauled as she could  she was as i said a long flushdecked ship of full five hundred tons more than double the size in fact of the rose though not so lofty in proportion and many a bold heart beat loud and no shame to them as she began firing away merrily determined as all well knew to wipe out in english blood the disgrace of her late foil  never mind my merry masters said amyas she has quantity and we quality  thats true said one for one honest man is worth two rogues  and one culverin three of their footy little ordnance said another so when you will captain and have at her  let her come abreast of us and dont burn powder we have the wind and can do what we like with her serve the men out a horn of ale all round steward and all take your time  so they waited for five minutes more and then set to work quietly after the fashion of english mastiffs though like those mastiffs they waxed right mad before three rounds were fired and the white splinters sight beloved began to crackle and fly  amyas having as he had said the wind and being able to go nearer it than the spaniard kept his place at easy pointblank range for his two eighteenpounder culverins which yeo and his mate worked with terrible effect  we are lacking her through and through every shot said he leave the small ordnance alone yet awhile and we shall sink her without them  whing whing went the spaniards shot like so many hummingtops through the rigging far above their heads for the illconstructed ports of those days prevented the guns from hulling an enemy who was to windward unless close alongside  blow jolly breeze cried one and lay the don over all thou canstwhat the murrain is gone aloft there  alas a crack a flap a rattle and blank dismay an unlucky shot had cut the foremast already wounded in two and all forward was a mass of dangling wreck  forward and cut away the wreck said amyas unmoved small arm men be ready he will be aboard of us in five minutes  it was too true the rose unmanageable from the loss of her headsail lay at the mercy of the spaniard and the archers and musqueteers had hardly time to range themselves to leeward when the madre dolorosas chains were grinding against the roses and grapples tossed on board from stem to stern  dont cut them loose roared amyas let them stay and see the fun now dogs of devon show your teeth and hurrah for god and the queen  and then began a fight most fierce and fell the spaniards according to their fashion attempting to board the english amid fierce shouts of god and the queen god and st george for england sweeping them back by showers of arrows and musquet balls thrusting them down with pikes hurling grenades and stinkpots from the tops while the swivels on both sides poured their grape and bar and chain and the great maindeck guns thundering muzzle to muzzle made both ships quiver and recoil as they smashed the round shot through and through each other  so they roared and flashed fast clenched to each other in that devils wedlock under a cloud of smoke beneath the cloudless tropic sky while all around the dolphins gambolled and the flyingfish shot on from swell to swell and the rainbowhued jellies opened and shut their cups of living crystal to the sun as merrily as if man had never fallen and hell had never broken loose on earth  so it raged for an hour or more till all arms were weary and all tongues clove to the mouth and sick men rotting with scurvy scrambled up on deck and fought with the strength of madness and tiny powderboys handing up cartridges from the hold laughed and cheered as the shots ran past their ears and old salvation yeo a text upon his lips and a fury in his heart as of joshua or elijah in old time worked on calm and grim but with the energy of a boy at play and now and then an opening in the smoke showed the spanish captain in his suit of black steel armor standing cool and proud guiding and pointing careless of the iron hail but too lofty a gentleman to soil his glove with aught but a knightly swordhilt while amyas and will after the fashion of the english gentlemen had stripped themselves nearly as bare as their own sailors and were cheering thrusting hewing and hauling here there and everywhere like any common mariner and filling them with a spirit of selfrespect fellowfeeling and personal daring which the discipline of the spaniards more perfect mechanically but cold and tyrannous and crushing spiritually never could bestow the blackplumed senor was obeyed but the goldenlocked amyas was followed and would have been followed through the jaws of hell  the spaniards ere five minutes had passed poured en masse into the roses waist but only to their destruction between the poop and forecastle as was then the fashion the upperdeck beams were left open and unplanked with the exception of a narrow gangway on either side and off that fatal ledge the boarders thrust on by those behind fell headlong between the beams to the maindeck below to be slaughtered helpless in that pit of destruction by the double fire from the bulkheads fore and aft while the few who kept their footing on the gangway after vain attempts to force the stockades on poop and forecastle leaped overboard again amid a shower of shot and arrows the fire of the english was as steady as it was quick and though threefourths of the crew had never smelt powder before they proved well the truth of the old chroniclers saying since proved again more gloriously than ever at alma balaklava and inkerman that the english never fight better than in their first battle  thrice the spaniards clambered on board and thrice surged back before that deadly hail the decks on both sides were very shambles and jack brimblecombe who had fought as long as his conscience would allow him found when he turned to a more clerical occupation enough to do in carrying poor wretches to the surgeon without giving that spiritual consolation which he longed to give and they to receive at last there was a lull in that wild storm no shot was heard from the spaniards upperdeck  amyas leaped into the mizzen rigging and looked through the smoke dead men he could descry through the blinding veil rolled in heaps laid flat dead men and dying but no man upon his feet the last volley had swept the deck clear one by one had dropped below to escape that fiery shower and alone at the helm grinding his teeth with rage his mustachios curling up to his very eyes stood the spanish captain  now was the moment for a counterstroke amyas shouted for the boarders and in two minutes more he was over the side and clutching at the spaniards mizzen rigging  what was this the distance between him and the enemys side was widening was she sheering off yesand rising too growing bodily higher every moment as if by magic amyas looked up in astonishment and saw what it was the spaniard was heeling fast over to leeward away from him her masts were all sloping forward swifter and swifterthe end was come then  back in gods name back men she is sinking by the head and with much ado some were dragged back some leaped backall but old michael heard  with hair and beard floating in the wind the bronzed naked figure like some weird old indian fakir still climbed on steadfastly up the mizzenchains of the spaniard hatchet in hand  come back michael leap while you may shouted a dozen voices michael turned  and what should i come back for then to go home where no one knoweth me ill die like an englishman this day or ill know the rason why and turning he sprang in over the bulwarks as the huge ship rolled up more and more like a dying whale exposing all her long black hulk almost down to the keel and one of her lowerdeck guns as if in defiance exploded upright into the air hurling the ball to the very heavens  in an instant it was answered from the rose by a column of smoke and the eighteenpound ball crashed through the bottom of the defenceless spaniard  who fired shame to fire on a sinking ship  gunner yeo sir shouted a voice up from the maindeck hes like a madman down here  tell him if he fires again ill put him in irons if he were my own brother cut away the grapples aloft men dont you see how she drags us over cut away or we shall sink with her  they cut away and the rose released from the strain shook her feathers on the wavecrest like a freed seagull while all men held their breaths  suddenly the glorious creature righted herself and rose again as if in noble shame for one last struggle with her doom her bows were deep in the water but her afterdeck still dry righted but only for a moment long enough to let her crew come pouring wildly up on deck with cries and prayers and rush aft to the poop where under the flag of spain stood the tall captain his left hand on the standardstaff his sword pointed in his right  back men they heard him cry and die like valiant mariners  some of them ran to the bulwarks and shouted mercy we surrender and the english broke into a cheer and called to them to run her alongside  silence shouted amyas i take no surrender from mutineers senor cried he to the captain springing into the rigging and taking off his hat for the love of god and these men strike and surrender a buena querra  the spaniard lifted his hat and bowed courteously and answered impossible senor no querra is good which stains my honor  god have mercy on you then  amen said the spaniard crossing himself  she gave one awful lounge forward and dived under the coming swell hurling her crew into the eddies nothing but the point of her poop remained and there stood the stern and steadfast don capapie in his glistening black armor immovable as a man of iron while over him the flag which claimed the empire of both worlds flaunted its gold aloft and upwards in the glare of the tropic noon  he shall not carry that flag to the devil with him i will have it yet if i die for it said will cary and rushed to the side to leap overboard but amyas stopped him  let him die as he has lived with honor  a wild figure sprang out of the mass of sailors who struggled and shrieked amid the foam and rushed upward at the spaniard it was michael heard the don who stood above him plunged his sword into the old mans body but the hatchet gleamed nevertheless down went the blade through headpiece and through head and as heard sprang onward bleeding but alive the steelclad corpse rattled down the deck into the surge two more strokes struck with the fury of a dying man and the standardstaff was hewn through old michael collected all his strength hurled the flag far from the sinking ship and then stood erect one moment and shouted god save queen bess and the english answered with a hurrah which rent the welkin  another moment and the gulf had swallowed his victim and the poop and him and nothing remained of the madre dolorosa but a few floating spars and struggling wretches while a great awe fell upon all men and a solemn silence broken only by the cry       of some strong swimmer in his agony  and then suddenly collecting themselves as men awakened from a dream halfadozen desperate gallants reckless of sharks and eddies leaped overboard swam towards the flag and towed it alongside in triumph  ah said salvation yeo as he helped the trophy up over the side ah it was not for nothing that we found poor michael he was always a good comradenigh as good a one as william penberthy of marazion whom the lord grant i meet in bliss and now then my masters shall we inshore again and burn la guayra  art thou never glutted with spanish blood thou old wolf asked will cary  never sir answered yeo  to st jago be it said amyas if we can get there butgod help us  and he looked round sadly enough while no one needed that he should finish his sentence or explain his but  the foremast was gone the mainyard sprung the rigging hanging in elflocks the hull shot through and through in twenty places the deck strewn with the bodies of nine good men beside sixteen wounded down below while the pitiless sun right above their heads poured down a flood of fire upon a sea of glass  and it would have been well if faintness and weariness had been all that was the matter but now that the excitement was over the collapse came and the men sat down listlessly and sulkily by twos and threes upon the deck starting and wincing when they heard some poor fellow below cry out under the surgeons knife or murmuring to each other that all was lost drew tried in vain to rouse them telling them that all depended on rigging a jurymast forward as soon as possible they answered only by growls and at last broke into open reproaches even will carys volatile nature which had kept him up during the fight gave way when yeo and the carpenter came aft and told amyas in a low voice  we are hit somewhere forward below the waterline sir she leaks a terrible deal and the lord will not vouchsafe to us to lay our hands on the place for all our searching  what are we to do now amyas in the devils name asked cary peevishly  what are we to do in gods name rather answered amyas in a low voice will will what did god make you a gentleman for but to know better than those poor fickle fellows forward who blow hot and cold at every change of weather  i wish youd come forward and speak to them sir said yeo who had overheard the last words or we shall get naught done  amyas went forward instantly  now then my brave lads whats the matter here that you are all sitting on your tails like monkeys  ugh grunts one dont you think our days work has been long enough yet captain  you dont want us to go in to la guayra again sir there are enough of us thrown away already i reckon about that wench there  best sit here and sink quietly theres no getting home again thats plain  why were we brought out here to be killed  for shame men cries yeo youre no better than a set of stiffnecked hebrew jews murmuring against moses the very minute after the lord has delivered you from the egyptians  now i do not wish to set amyas up as a perfect man for he had his faults like every one else nor as better thank god than many and many a brave and virtuous captain in her majestys service at this very day but certainly he behaved admirably under that trial drake had trained him as he trained many another excellent officer to be as stout in discipline and as dogged of purpose as he himself was but he had trained him also to feel with and for his men to make allowances for them and to keep his temper with them as he did this day true he had seen drake in a rage he had seen him hang one man for a mutiny and that man his dearest friend and threaten to hang thirty more but amyas remembered well that that explosion took place when having as drake said publicly himself taken in hand that i know not in the world how to go through with it passeth my capacity it hath even bereaved me of my wits to think of it    and having now set together by the ears three mighty princes her majesty and the kings of spain and portugal he found his whole voyage ready to come to naught by mutinies and discords controversy between the sailors and gentlemen and stomaching between the gentlemen and sailors but my masters quoth the selftrained hero and amyas never forgot his words i must have it left for i must have the gentlemen to haul and draw with the mariner and the mariner with the gentlemen i would like to know him that would refuse to set his hand to a rope  and now amyass conscience smote him and his simple and pious soul took the loss of his brother as gods verdict on his conduct because he had set his own private affection even his own private revenge before the safety of his ships company and the good of his country  ah said he to himself as he listened to his mens reproaches if i had been thinking like a loyal soldier of serving my queen and crippling the spaniard i should have taken that great bark three days ago and in it the very man i sought  so choking down his old man as yeo used to say he made answer cheerfully  pooh pooh brave lads for shame for shame you were lions halfanhour ago you are not surely turned sheep already why but yesterday evening you were grumbling because i would not run in and fight those three ships under the batteries of la guayra and now you think it too much to have fought them fairly out at sea what has happened but the chances of war which might have happened anywhere nothing venture nothing win and nobody goes birdnesting without a fall at times if any one wants to be safe in this life hed best stay at home and keep his bed though even there who knows but the roof might fall through on him  ah its all very well for you captain said some grumbling younker with a vague notion that amyas must be better off than he because he was a gentleman amyass blood rose  yes sirrah it is very well for me as long as god is with me but he is with every man in this ship i would have you to know as much as he is with me do you fancy that i have nothing to lose i who have adventured in this voyage all i am worth and more who if i fail must return to beggary and scorn and if i have ventured rashly sinfully if you will the lives of any of you in my own private quarrel am i not punished have i not lost  his voice trembled and stopped there but he recovered himself in a moment  pish i cant stand here chattering carpenter an axe and help me to cast these spars loose get out of my way there lumbering the scuppers up like so many moulting fowls here all old friends lend a hand pelicans men stand by your captain did we sail round the world for nothing  this last appeal struck home and up leaped halfadozen of the old pelicans and set to work at his side manfully to rig the jurymast  come along cried cary to the malcontents were raw longshore fellows but we wont be outdone by any old seadog of them all and setting to work himself he was soon followed by one and another till order and work went on well enough  and where are we going when the masts up shouted some saucy hand from behind  where you darent follow us alone by yourself so you had better keep us company replied yeo  ill tell you where we are going lads said amyas rising from his work like it or leave it as you will i have no secrets from my crew we are going inshore there to find a harbor and careen the ship  there was a start and a murmur  inshore into the spaniards mouths  all in the inquisition in a weeks time  better stay here and be drowned  youre right in that last shouts cary thats the right death for blind puppies look you i dont know in the least where we are and i hardly know stem from stern aboard ship and the captain may be right or wrongthats nothing to me but this i know that i am a soldier and will obey orders and where he goes i go and whosoever hinders me must walk up my sword to do it  amyas pressed carys hand and then  and heres my broadside next men ill go nowhere and do nothing without the advice of salvation yeo and robert drew and if any man in the ship knows better than these two let him up and well give him a hearing eh pelicans  there was a grunt of approbation from the pelicans and amyas returned to the charge  we have five shot between wind and water and one somewhere below can we face a gale of wind in that state or can we not  silence  can we get home with a leak in our bottom  silence  then what can we do but run inshore and take our chance speak its a cowards trick to do nothing because what we must do is not pleasant will you be like children that would sooner die than take nasty physic or will you not  silence still  come along now heres the wind again round with the sun and up to the northwest in with her  sulkily enough but unable to deny the necessity the men set to work and the vessels head was put toward the land but when she began to slip through the water the leak increased so fast that they were kept hard at work at the pumps for the rest of the afternoon  the current had by this time brought them abreast of the bay of higuerote and luckily for them safe out of the short heavy swell which it causes round cape codera looking inland they had now to the southwest that noble headland backed by the caracas mountains range on range up to the silla and the neguater while right ahead of them to the south the shore sank suddenly into a low line of mangrovewood backed by primaeval forest as they ran inward all eyes were strained greedily to find some opening in the mangrove belt but none was to be seen for some time the lead was kept going and every fresh heave announced shallower water  we shall have very shoal work off those mangroves yeo said amyas i doubt whether we shall do aught now unless we find a rivers mouth  if the lord thinks a river good for us sir hell show us one so on they went keeping a southeast course and at last an opening in the mangrove belt was hailed with a cheer from the older hands though the majority shrugged their shoulders as men going openeyed to destruction  off the mouth they sent in drew and cary with a boat and watched anxiously for an hour the boat returned with a good report of two fathoms of water over the bar impenetrable forests for two miles up the river sixty yards broad and no sign of man the rivers banks were soft and sloping mud fit for careening  safe quarters sir said yeo privately as far as spaniards go i hope in god it may be as safe from calentures and fevers  beggars must not be choosers said amyas so in they went  they towed the ship up about halfamile to a point where she could not be seen from the seaward and there moored her to the mangrovestems amyas ordered a boat out and went up the river himself to reconnoitre he rowed some three miles till the river narrowed suddenly and was all but covered in by the interlacing boughs of mighty trees there was no sign that man had been there since the making of the world  he dropped down the stream again thoughtfully and sadly how many years ago was it that he passed this rivers mouth three days and yet how much had passed in them don guzman found and lostrose found and losta great victory gained and yet lostperhaps his ship lostabove all his brother lost  lost o god how should he find his brother  some strange bird out of the woods made mournful answernever never never  how should he face his mother  never never never wailed the bird again and amyas smiled bitterly and said never likewise  the night mist began to steam and wreathe upon the foul beercolored stream the loathy floor of liquid mud lay bare beneath the mangrove forest upon the endless web of interarching roots great purple crabs were crawling up and down they would have supped with pleasure upon amyass corpse perhaps they might sup on him after all for a heavy sickening graveyard smell made his heart sink within him and his stomach heave and his weary body and more weary soul gave themselves up helplessly to the depressing influence of that doleful place the black bank of dingy leathern leaves above his head the endless labyrinth of stems and withes for every bough had lowered its own living cord to take fresh hold of the foul soil below the web of roots which stretched away inland till it was lost in the shades of eveningall seemed one horrid complicated trap for him and his and even where here and there he passed the mouth of a lagoon there was no opening no reliefnothing but the dark ring of mangroves and here and there an isolated group of large and small parents and children breeding and spreading as if in hideous haste to choke out air and sky wailing sadly sadcolored mangrovehens ran off across the mud into the dreary dark the hoarse nightraven hid among the roots startled the voyagers with a sudden shout and then all was again silent as a grave the loathly alligators lounging in the slime lifted their horny eyelids lazily and leered upon him as he passed with stupid savageness lines of tall herons stood dimly in the growing gloom like white fantastic ghosts watching the passage of the doomed boat all was foul sullen weird as witches dream if amyas had seen a crew of skeletons glide down the stream behind him with satan standing at the helm he would have scarcely been surprised what fitter craft could haunt that stygian flood  that night every man of the boats crew save amyas was down with raging fever before ten the next morning five more men were taken and others sickening fast    chapter xxi  how they took the communion under the tree at higuerote       follow thee  follow thee  wha wad na follow thee  lang hast      thou looed and trusted us fairly  amyas would have certainly taken the yellow fever but for one reason which he himself gave to cary he had no time to be sick while his men were sick a valid and sufficient reason as many a noble soul in the crimea has known too well as long as the excitement of work is present but too apt to fail the hero and to let him sink into the pit which he has so often overleapt the moment that his work is done  he called a council of war or rather a sanitary commission the next morning for he was fairly at his wits end the men were panicstricken ready to mutiny amyas told them that he could not see any possible good which could accrue to them by killing him orfor there were two sides to every questionbeing killed by him and then went below to consult the doctor talked mere science or nonscience about humors complexions and animal spirits jack brimblecombe mere pulpit about its being the visitation of god cary mere despair though he jested over it with a smile yeo mere stoic fatalism though he quoted scripture to back the same drew the master had nothing to say his business was to sail the ship and not to cure calentures  whereon amyas clutched his locks according to custom and at last broke forthdoctor a fig for your humors and complexions can you cure a mans humors or change his complexion can an ethiopian change his skin or a leopard his spots dont shove off your ignorance on god sir i ask you whats the reason of this sickness and you dont know jack brimblecombe dont talk to me about gods visitation this looks much more like the devils visitation to my mind we are doing gods work sir john and he is not likely to hinder us so down with the devil say i cary laughing killed the cat but it wont cure a christian yeo when an angel tells me that its gods will that we should all die like dogs in a ditch ill call this gods will but not before drew you say your business is to sail the ship then sail her out of this infernal poisontrap this very morning if you can which you cant the mischiefs in the air and nowhere else i felt it run through me coming down last night and smelt it like any sewer and if it was not in the air why was my boats crew taken first tell me that  there was no answer  then ill tell you why they were taken first because the mist when we came through it only rose five or six feet above the stream and we were in it while you on board were above it and those that were taken on board this morning every one of them slept on the maindeck and every one of them too was in fear of the fever whereby i judge two thingskeep as high as you can and fear nothing but god and were all safe yet  but the fog was up to our roundtops at sunrise this morning said cary  i know it but we who were on the halfdeck were not in it so long as those below and that may have made the difference let alone our having free air beside i suspect the heat in the evening draws the poison out more and that when it gets cold toward morning the venom of it goes off somehow  how it went off amyas could not tell right in his facts as he was for nobody on earth knew i suppose at that day and it was not till nearly two centuries of fatal experience that the settlers in america discovered the simple laws of these epidemics which now every child knows or ought to know but common sense was on his side and yeo rose and spoke  as i have said before many a time the lord has sent us a very young daniel for judge i remember now to have heard the spaniards say how these calentures lay always in the low ground and never came more than a few hundred feet above the sea  let us go up those few hundred feet then  every man looked at amyas and then at his neighbor  gentlemen look the devil straight in the face if you would hit him in the right place we cannot get the ship to sea as she is and if we could we cannot go home emptyhanded and we surely cannot stay here to die of feverwe must leave the ship and go inland  inland answered every voice but yeos  up those hundred feet which yeo talks of up to the mountains stockade a camp and get our sick and provisions thither  and what next  and when we are recruited march over the mountains and surprise st jago de leon  cary swore a great oath amyas you are a daring fellow  not a bit its the plain path of prudence  so it is sir said old yeo and i follow you in it  and so do i squeaked jack brimblecombe  nay then jack thou shalt not outrun me so i say yes too quoth cary  mr drew  at your service sir to live or die i know naught about stockading but sir francis would have given the same counsel i verily believe if he had been in your place  then tell the men that we start in an hours time win over the pelicans yeo and drew and the rest must follow like sheep over a hedge  the pelicans and the liberated galleyslaves joined the project at once but the rest gave amyas a stormy hour the great question was where were the hills in that dense mangrove thicket they could not see fifty yards before them  the hills are not three miles to the southwest of you at this moment said amyas i marked every shoulder of them as we ran in  i suppose you meant to take us there  the question set a light to a trainand angry suspicions were blazing up one after another but amyas silenced them with a countermine  fools if i had not wit enow to look ahead a little farther than you do where would you be are you mad as well as reckless to rise against your own captain because he has two strings to his bow go my way i say or as i live ill blow up the ship and every soul on board and save you the pain of rotting here by inches  the men knew that amyas never said what he did not intend to do not that amyas intended to do this because he knew that the threat would be enough so they agreed to go and were reassured by seeing that the old pelicans men turned to the work heartily and cheerfully  there is no use keeping the reader for five or six weary hours under a broiling or rather stewing sun stumbling over mangrove roots hewing his way through thorny thickets dragging sick men and provisions up mountain steeps amid disappointment fatigue murmurs curses snakes mosquitoes false alarms of spaniards and every misery save cold which flesh is heir to suffice it that by sunset that evening they had gained a level spot a full thousand feet above the sea backed by an inaccessible cliff which formed the upper shoulder of a mighty mountain defended below by steep wooded slopes and needing but the felling of a few trees to make it impregnable  amyas settled the sick under the arched roots of an enormous cottonwood tree and made a second journey to the ship to bring up hammocks and blankets for them while yeos wisdom and courage were of inestimable value he as pioneer had found the little brook up which they forced their way he had encouraged them to climb the cliffs over which it fell arguing rightly that on its course they were sure to find some ground fit for encampment within the reach of water he had supported amyas when again and again the weary crew entreated to be dragged no farther and had gone back again a dozen times to cheer them upward while cary who brought up the rear bullied and cheered on the stragglers who sat down and refused to move drove back at the swords point more than one who was beating a retreat carried their burdens for them sang them songs on the halt in all things approving himself the gallant and hopeful soul which he had always been till amyas beside himself with joy at finding that the two men on whom he had counted most were utterly worthy of his trust went so far as to whisper to them both in confidence that very night  cortez burnt his ships when he landed why should not we  yeo leapt upright and then sat down again and whispered  do you say that captain tis from above then thats certain for its been hanging on my mind too all day  theres no hurry quoth amyas we must clear her out first you know while cary sat silent and musing amyas had evidently more schemes in his head than he chose to tell  the men were too tired that evening to do much but ere the sun rose next morning amyas had them hard at work fortifying their position it was as i said strong enough by nature for though it was commanded by high cliffs on three sides yet there was no chance of an enemy coming over the enormous mountainrange behind them and still less chance that if he came he would discover them through the dense mass of trees which crowned the cliff and clothed the hills for a thousand feet above the attack if it took place would come from below and against that amyas guarded by felling the smaller trees and laying them with their boughs outward over the crest of the slope thus forming an abatis as every one who has shot in thick cover knows to his cost warranted to bring up in two steps horse dog or man the trunks were sawn into logs laid lengthwise and steadied by stakes and mould and three or four hours hard work finished a stockade which would defy anything but artillery the work done amyas scrambled up into the boughs of the enormous ceibatree and there sat inspecting his own handiwork looking out far and wide over the forestcovered plains and the blue sea beyond and thinking in his simple straightforward way of what was to be done next  to stay there long was impossible to avenge himself upon la guayra was impossible to go until he had found out whether frank was alive or dead seemed at first equally impossible but were brimblecombe cary and those eighty men to be sacrificed a second time to his private interest amyas wept with rage and then wept again with earnest honest prayer before he could make up his mind but he made it up there were a hundred chances to one that frank was dead and if not he was equally past their help for he wasamyas knew that too wellby this time in the hands of the inquisition who could lift him from that pit not amyas at least and crying aloud in his agony god help him for i cannot amyas made up his mind to move but whither many an hour he thought and thought alone there in his airy nest and at last he went down calm and cheerful and drew cary and yeo aside they could not he said refit the ship without dying of fever during the process an assertion which neither of his hearers was bold enough to deny even if they refitted her they would be pretty certain to have to fight the spaniards again for it was impossible to doubt the indians story that they had been forewarned of the roses coming or to doubt either that eustace had been the traitor  let us try st jago then sack it come down on la guayra in the rear take a ship there and so get home  nay will if they have strengthened themselves against us at la guayra where they had little to lose surely they have done so at st jago where they have much i hear the town is large though new and besides how can we get over these mountains without a guide  or with one said cary with a sigh looking up at the vast walls of wood and rock which rose range on range for miles but it is strange to find you at least throwing cold water on a daring plot  what if i had a still more daring one did you ever hear of the golden city of manoa  yeo laughed a grim but joyful laugh i have sir and so have the old hands from the pelican and the jesus of lubec i doubt not  so much the better and amyas began to tell cary all which he had learned from the spaniard while yeo capped every word thereof with rumors and traditions of his own gathering cary sat half aghast as the huge phantasmagoria unfolded itself before his dazzled eyes and at last  so that was why you wanted to burn the ship well after all nobody needs me at home and one less at table wont be missed so you want to play cortez eh  we shall never need to play cortez who was not such a bad fellow after all will because we shall have no such cannibal fiends tyranny to rid the earth of as he had and i trust we shall fear god enough not to play pizarro  so the conversation dropped for the time but none of them forgot it  in that mountainnook the party spent some ten days and more several of the sick men died some from the fever superadded to their wounds some probably from having been bled by the surgeon the others mended steadily by the help of certain herbs which yeo administered much to the disgust of the doctor who of course wanted to bleed the poor fellows all round and was all but mutinous when amyas stayed his hand in the meanwhile by dint of daily trips to the ship provisions were plentiful enoughbeside the raccoons monkeys and other small animals which yeo and the veterans of hawkinss crew knew how to catch and the fruit and vegetables above all the delicious mountain cabbage of the areca palm and the fresh milk of the cowtree which they brought in daily paying well thereby for the hospitality they received  all day long a careful watch was kept among the branches of the mighty ceibatree and what a tree that was the hugest english oak would have seemed a stunted bush beside it borne up on roots or rather walls of twisted board some twelve feet high between which the whole crew their ammunitions and provisions were housed roomily rose the enormous trunk full forty feet in girth towering like some tall lighthouse smooth for a hundred feet then crowned with boughs each of which was a stately tree whose topmost twigs were full two hundred and fifty feet from the ground and yet it was easy for the sailors to ascend so many natural ropes had kind nature lowered for their use in the smooth lianes which hung to the very earth often without a knot or leaf once in the tree you were within a new world suspended between heaven and earth and as cary said no wonder if like jack when he climbed the magic beanstalk you had found a castle a giant and a few acres of wellstocked park packed away somewhere amid that labyrinth of timber flowergardens at least were there in plenty for every limb was covered with pendent cactuses gorgeous orchises and wild pines and while onehalf the tree was clothed in rich foliage the other half utterly leafless bore on every twig brilliant yellow flowers around which hummingbirds whirred all day long parrots peeped in and out of every cranny while within the airy woodland brilliant lizards basked like living gems upon the bark gaudy finches flitted and chirruped butterflies of every size and color hovered over the topmost twigs innumerable insects hummed from morn till eve and when the sun went down treetoads came out to snore and croak till dawn there was more life round that one tree than in a whole square mile of english soil  and amyas as he lounged among the branches felt at moments as if he would be content to stay there forever and feed his eyes and ears with all its wondersand then started sighing from his dream as he recollected that a few days must bring the foe upon them and force him to decide upon some scheme at which the bravest heart might falter without shame so there he sat for he often took the scouts place himself looking out over the fantastic tropic forest at his feet and the flat mangroveswamps below and the white sheet of foamflecked blue and yet no sail appeared and the men as their fear of fever subsided began to ask when they would go down and refit the ship and amyas put them off as best he could till one noon he saw slipping along the shore from the westward a large ship under easy sail and recognized in her or thought he did so the ship which they had passed upon their way  if it was she she must have run past them to la guayra in the night and have now returned perhaps to search for them along the coast  she crept along slowly he was in hopes that she might pass the rivers mouth but no she layto close to the shore and after a while amyas saw two boats pull in from her and vanish behind the mangroves  sliding down a liane he told what he had seen the men tired of inactivity received the news with a shout of joy and set to work to make all ready for their guests four brass swivels which they had brought up were mounted fixed in logs so as to command the path the musketeers and archers clustered round them with their tackle ready and halfadozen good marksmen volunteered into the cottontree with their arquebuses as a post whence a man might have very pretty shooting prayers followed as a matter of course and dinner as a matter of course also but two weary hours passed before there was any sign of the spaniards  presently a wreath of white smoke curled up from the swamp and then the report of a caliver then amid the growls of the english the spanish flag ran up above the trees and floatedhorrible to beholdat the masthead of the rose they were signalling the ship for more hands and in effect a third boat soon pushed off and vanished into the forest  another hour during which the men had thoroughly lost their temper but not their hearts by waiting and talked so loud and strode up and down so wildly that amyas had to warn them that there was no need to betray themselves that the spaniards might not find them after all that they might pass the stockade close without seeing it that unless they hit off the track at once they would probably return to their ship for the present and exacted a promise from them that they would be perfectly silent till he gave the word to fire  which wise commands had scarcely passed his lips when in the path below glanced the headpiece of a spanish soldier and then another and another  fools whispered amyas to cary they are coming up in single file rushing on their own death lie close men  the path was so narrow that two could seldom come up abreast and so steep that the enemy had much ado to struggle and stumble upwards the men seemed half unwilling to proceed and hung back more than once but amyas could hear an authoritative voice behind and presently there emerged to the front sword in hand a figure at which amyas and cary both started  is it he  surely i know those legs among a thousand though they are in armor  it is my turn for him now cary remember silence silence men  the spaniards seemed to feel that they were leading a forlorn hope don guzman for there was little doubt that it was he had much ado to get them on at all  the fellows have heard how gently we handled the guayra squadron whispers cary and have no wish to become fellowmartyrs with the captain of the madre dolorosa  at last the spaniards get up the steep slope to within forty yards of the stockade and pause suspecting a trap and puzzled by the complete silence amyas leaps on the top of it a white flag in his hand but his heart beats so fiercely at the sight of that hated figure that he can hardly get out the words  don guzman the quarrel is between you and me not between your men and mine i would have sent in a challenge to you at la guayra but you were away i challenge you now to single combat  lutheran dog i have a halter for you but no sword as you served us at smerwick we will serve you now pirate and ravisher you and yours shall share oxenhams fate as you have copied his crimes and learn what it is to set foot unbidden on the dominions of the king of spain  the devil take you and the king of spain together shouts amyas laughing loudly this ground belongs to him no more than it does to me but to the queen elizabeth in whose name i have taken as lawful possession of it as you ever did of caracas fire men and god defend the right  both parties obeyed the order amyas dropped down behind the stockade in time to let a caliver bullet whistle over his head and the spaniards recoiled as the narrow face of the stockade burst into one blaze of musketry and swivels raking their long array from front to rear  the front ranks fell over each other in heaps the rear ones turned and ran overtaken nevertheless by the english bullets and arrows which tumbled them headlong down the steep path  out men and charge them see the don is running like the rest and scrambling over the abattis amyas and about thirty followed them fast for he had hope of learning from some prisoner his brothers fate  amyas was unjust in his last words don guzman as if by miracle had been only slightly wounded and seeing his men run had rushed back and tried to rally them but was borne away by the fugitives  however the spaniards were out of sight among the thick bushes before the english could overtake them and amyas afraid lest they should rally and surround his small party withdrew sorely against his will and found in the pathway fourteen spaniards but all dead for one of the wounded with more courage than wisdom had fired on the english as he lay and amyass men whose blood was maddened both by their desperate situation and the frightful stories of the rescued galleyslaves had killed them all before their captain could stop them  are you mad cries amyas as he strikes up one fellows sword will you kill an indian  and he drags out of the bushes an indian lad of sixteen who slightly wounded is crawling away like a copper snake along the ground  the black vermin has sent an arrow through my leg and poisoned too most like  god grant not but an indian is worth his weight in gold to us now said amyas tucking his prize under his arm like a bundle the lad as soon as he saw there was no escape resigned himself to his fate with true indian stoicism was brought in and treated kindly enough but refused to eat for which after much questioning he gave as a reason that he would make them kill him at once for fat him they should not and gradually gave them to understand that the english always so at least the spaniards said fatted and ate their prisoners like the caribs and till he saw them go out and bury the bodies of the spaniards nothing would persuade him that the corpses were not to be cooked for supper  however kind words kind looks and the present of that inestimable treasurea knife brought him to reason and he told amyas that he belonged to a spaniard who had an encomienda of indians some fifteen miles to the southwest that he had fled from his master and lived by hunting for some months past and having seen the ship where she lay moored and boarded her in hope of plunder had been surprised therein by the spaniards and forced by threats to go with them as a guide in their search for the english but now came a part of his story which filled the soul of amyas with delight he was an indian of the llanos or great savannahs which lay to the southward beyond the mountains and had actually been upon the orinoco he had been stolen as a boy by some spaniards who had gone down as was the fashion of the jesuits even as late as 1790 for the pious purpose of converting the savages by the simple process of catching baptizing and making servants of those whom they could carry off and murdering those who resisted their gentle method of salvation did he know the way back again who could ask such a question of an indian and the lads black eyes flashed fire as amyas offered him liberty and iron enough for a dozen indians if he would lead them through the passes of the mountains and southward to the mighty river where lay their golden hopes hernando de serpa amyas knew had tried the same course which was supposed to be about one hundred and twenty leagues and failed being overthrown utterly by the wikiri indians but amyas knew enough of the spaniards brutal method of treating those indians to be pretty sure that they had brought that catastrophe upon themselves and that he might avoid it well enough by that common justice and mercy toward the savages which he had learned from his incomparable tutor francis drake  now was the time to speak and assembling his men around him amyas opened his whole heart simply and manfully this was their only hope of safety some of them had murmured that they should perish like john oxenhams crew this plan was rather the only way to avoid perishing like them don guzman would certainly return to seek them and not only he but landforces from st jago even if the stockade was not forced they would be soon starved out why not move at once ere the spaniards could return and begin a blockade as for taking st jago it was impossible the treasure would all be safely hidden and the town well prepared to meet them if they wanted gold and glory they must seek it elsewhere neither was there any use in marching along the coast and trying the ports ships could outstrip them and the country was already warned there was but this one chance and on it amyas the first and last time in his life waxed eloquent and set forth the glory of the enterprise the service to the queen the salvation of heathens and the certainty that if successful they should win honor and wealth and everlasting fame beyond that of cortez or pizarro till the men sulky at first warmed every moment and one old pelican broke out with  yes sir we didnt go round the world with you for naught and watched your works and ways which was always those of a gentleman as you arewho spoke a word for a poor fellow when he was in a scrape and saw all you ought to see and naught that you ought not and well follow you sir all alone to ourselves and let those that know you worse follow after when theyre come to their right mind  man after man capped this brave speech the minority who if they liked little to go liked still less to be left behind gave in their consent perforce and to make a long story short amyas conquered and the plan was accepted  this said amyas is indeed the proudest day of my life i have lost one brother but i have gained fourscore god do so to me and more also if i do not deal with you according to the trust which you have put in me this day  we i suppose are to believe that we have a right to laugh at amyass scheme as frantic and chimerical it is easy to amuse ourselves with the premises after the conclusion has been found for us we know now that he was mistaken but we have not discovered his mistake for ourselves and have no right to plume ourselves on other mens discoveries had we lived in amyass days we should have belonged either to the many wise men who believed as he did or to the many foolish men who not only sneered at the story of manoa but at a hundred other stories which we now know to be true columbus was laughed at but he found a new world nevertheless cortez was laughed at but he found mexico pizarro but he found peru i ask any fair reader of those two charming books mr prescotts conquest of mexico and his conquest of peru whether the true wonders in them described do not outdo all the false wonders of manoa  but what reason was there to think them false one quarter perhaps of america had been explored and yet in that quarter two empires had been already found in a state of mechanical military and agricultural civilization superior in many things to any nation of europe was it not most rational to suppose that in the remaining threequarters similar empires existed if a second mexico had been discovered in the mountains of parima and a second peru in those of brazil what right would any man have had to wonder as for the gold legends nothing was told of manoa which had not been seen in peru and mexico by the bodily eyes of men then living why should not the rocks of guiana have been as full of the precious metals we do not know yet that they are not as the rocks of peru and mexico were known to be even the details of the story its standing on a lake for instance bore a probability with them mexico actually stood in the centre of a lakewhy should not manoa the peruvian worship centred round a sacred lakewhy not that of manoa pizarro and cortez again were led on to their desperate enterprises by the sight of small quantities of gold among savages who told them of a civilized goldcountry near at hand and they found that those savages spoke truth why was the unanimous report of the carib tribes of the orinoco to be disbelieved when they told a similar tale sir richard schomburgks admirable preface to raleighs guiana proves surely that the indians themselves were deceived as well as deceivers it was known again that vast quantities of the peruvian treasure had been concealed by the priests and that members of the inca family had fled across the andes and held out against the spaniards barely fifty years had elapsed since thenwhat more probable than that this remnant of the peruvian dynasty and treasure still existed even the story of the amazons though it may serve hume as a point for his ungenerous and untruthful attempt to make raleigh out either fool or villain has come from spaniards who had with their own eyes seen the indian women fighting by their husbands sides and from indians who asserted the existence of an amazonian tribe what right had amyas or any man to disbelieve the story the existence of the amazons in ancient asia and of their intercourse with alexander the great was then an accredited part of history which it would have been gratuitous impertinence to deny and what if some stories connected these warlike women with the emperor of manoa and the capital itself this generation ought surely to be the last to laugh at such a story at least as long as the amazonian guards of the king of dahomey continue to outvie the men in that relentless ferocity with which they have subdued every neighboring tribe save the christians of abbeokuta in this case as in a hundred more fact not only outdoes but justifies imagination and amyas spoke common sense when he said to his men that day  let fools laugh and stay at home wise men dare and win saul went to look for his fathers asses and found a kingdom and columbus my men was called a madman for only going to seek china and never knew they say until his dying day that he had found a whole new world instead of it find manoa god only who made all things knows what we may find beside  so underneath that giant ceibatree those valiant men reduced by battle and sickness to some eighty swore a great oath and kept that oath like men to search for the golden city for two full years to come whatever might befall to stand to each other for weal or woe to obey their officers to the death to murmur privately against no man but bring all complaints to a council of war to use no profane oaths but serve god daily with prayer to take by violence from no man save from their natural enemies the spaniards to be civil and merciful to all savages and chaste and courteous to all women to bring all booty and all food into the common stock and observe to the utmost their faith with the adventurers who had fitted out the ship and finally to march at sunrise the next morning toward the south trusting in god to be their guide  it is a great oath and a hard one said brimblecombe but god will give us strength to keep it and they knelt all together and received the holy communion and then rose to pack provisions and ammunition and lay down again to sleep and to dream that they were sailing home up torridge streamas cavendish returning from round the world did actually sail home up thames but five years afterwardswith mariners and soldiers clothed in silk with sails of damask and topsails of cloth of gold and the richest prize which ever was brought at one time unto english shores                          the cross stands upright in the southern sky it is the middle of the night cary and yeo glide silently up the hill and into the camp and whisper to amyas that they have done the deed the sleepers are awakened and the train sets forth  upward and southward ever but whither who can tell they hardly think of the whither but go like sleepwalkers shaken out of one land of dreams only to find themselves in another and stranger one all around is fantastic and unearthly now each man starts as he sees the figures of his fellows clothed from head to foot in golden filigree looks up and sees the yellow moonlight through the fronds of the huge treeferns overhead as through a cloud of glittering lace now they are hewing their way through a thicket of enormous flags now through bamboos forty feet high now they are stumbling over boulders waistdeep in cushions of clubmoss now they are struggling through shrubberies of heaths and rhododendrons and woolly incensetrees where every leaf as they brush past dashes some fresh scent into their faces and       the winds with musky wing      about the cedarn alleys fling      nard and cassias balmy smells  now they open upon some craggy brow from whence they can see far below an ocean of soft cloud whose silver billows girdled by the mountain sides hide the lowland from their sight  and from beneath the cloud strange voices rise the screams of thousand nightbirds and wild howls which they used at first to fancy were the cries of ravenous beasts till they found them to proceed from nothing fiercer than an ape but what is that deeper note like a series of muffled explosionsarquebuses fired within some subterranean cavernthe heavy pulse of which rolls up through the depths of the unseen forest they hear it now for the first time but they will hear it many a time again and the indian lad is hushed and cowers close to them and then takes heart as he looks upon their swords and arquebuses for that is the roar of the jaguar seeking his meat from god  but what is that glare away to the northward the yellow moon is ringed with gay rainbows but that light is far too red to be the reflection of any beams of hers now through the cloud rises a column of black and lurid smoke the fog clears away right and left around it and shows beneath a mighty fire  the men look at each other with questioning eyes each half suspecting and yet not daring to confess their own suspicions and amyas whispers to yeo  you took care to flood the powder  ay ay sir and to unload the ordnance too no use in making a noise to tell the spaniards our whereabouts  yes that glare rises from the good ship rose amyas like cortez of old has burnt his ship and retreat is now impossible forward into the unknown abyss of the new world and god be with them as they go  the indian knows a cunning path it winds along the highest ridges of the mountains but the travelling is far more open and easy  they have passed the head of a valley which leads down to st jago beneath that long shining river of mist which ends at the foot of the great silla lies so says the indian lad the rich capital of venezuela and beyond the goldmines of los teques and baruta which first attracted the founder diego de losada and many a longing eye is turned towards it as they pass the saddle at the valley head but the attempt is hopeless they turn again to the left and so down towards the rancho taking care so the prudent amyas had commanded to break down after crossing the frail rope bridge which spans each torrent and ravine  they are at the rancho long before daybreak and have secured there not only fourteen mules but eight or nine indians stolen from off the llanos like their guide who are glad enough to escape from their tyrants by taking service with them and now southward and away with lightened shoulders and hearts for they are all but safe from pursuit the broken bridges prevent the news of their raid reaching st jago until nightfall and in the meanwhile don guzman returns to the river mouth the next day to find the ship a blackened wreck and the camp empty follows their trail over the hills till he is stopped by a broken bridge surmounts that difficulty and meets a second his men are worn out with heat and a little afraid of stumbling on the heretic desperadoes and he returns by land to st jago and when he arrives there has news from home which gives him other things to think of than following those mad englishmen who have vanished into the wilderness what need after all to follow them asked the spaniards of each other blinded by the devil whom they serve they rush on in search of certain death as many a larger company has before them and they will find it and will trouble la guayra no more forever lutheran dogs and enemies of god said don guzman to his soldiers they will leave their bones to whiten on the llanos as may every heretic who sets foot on spanish soil  will they do so don guzman or wilt thou and amyas meet again upon a mightier battlefield to learn a lesson which neither of you yet has learned    chapter xxii  the inquisition in the indies   my next chapter is perhaps too sad it shall be at least as short as i can make it but it was needful to be written that readers may judge fairly for themselves what sort of enemies the english nation had to face in those stern days  three weeks have passed and the scene is shifted to a long low range of cells in a dark corridor in the city of cartagena the door of one is open and within stand two cloaked figures one of whom we know it is eustace leigh the other is a familiar of the holy office  he holds in his hand a lamp from which the light falls on a bed of straw and on the sleeping figure of a man the high white brow the pale and delicate featuresthem too we know for they are those of frank saved halfdead from the fury of the savage negroes he has been reserved for the more delicate cruelty of civilized and christian men he underwent the question but this afternoon and now eustace his betrayer is come to persuade himor to entrap him eustace himself hardly knows whether of the two  and yet he would give his life to save his cousin  his life he has long since ceased to care for that he has done what he has done because it is his duty and now he is to do his duty once more and wake the sleeper and argue coax threaten him into recantation while his heart is still tender from the torture so eustaces employers phrase it  and yet how calmly he is sleeping is it but a freak of the lamplight or is there a smile upon his lips eustace takes the lamp and bends over him to see and as he bends he hears frank whispering in his dreams his mothers name and a name higher and holier still  eustace cannot find the heart to wake him  let him rest whispers he to his companion after all i fear my words will be of little use  i fear so too sir never did i behold a more obdurate heretic he did not scruple to scoff openly at their holinesses  ah said eustace great is the pravity of the human heart and the power of satan let us go for the present  where is she  the elder sorceress or the younger  the youngerthe  the senora de soto ah poor thing one could be sorry for her were she not a heretic and the man eyed eustace keenly and then quietly added she is at present with the notary to the benefit of her soul i trust  eustace half stopped shuddering he could hardly collect himself enough to gasp out an amen  within there said the man pointing carelessly to a door as they went down the corridor we can listen a moment if you like but dont betray me senor  eustace knows well enough that the fellow is probably on the watch to betray him if he shows any signs of compunction at least to report faithfully to his superiors the slightest expression of sympathy with a heretic but a horrible curiosity prevails over fear and he pauses close to the fatal door his face is all of a flame his knees knock together his ears are ringing his heart bursting through his ribs as he supports himself against the wall hiding his convulsed face as well as he can from his companion  a mans voice is plainly audible within low but distinct the notary is trying that old charge of witchcraft which the inquisitors whether to justify themselves to their own consciences or to whiten their villainy somewhat in the eyes of the mob so often brought against their victims and then eustaces heart sinks within him as he hears a womans voice reply sharpened by indignation and agony  witchcraft against don guzman what need of that oh god what need  you deny it then senora we are sorry for you but  a confused choking murmur from the victim mingled with words which might mean anything or nothing  she has confessed whispered eustace saints i thank youshe  a wail which rings through eustaces ears and brain and heart he would have torn at the door to open it but his companion forces him away another and another wail while the wretched man hurries off stopping his ears in vain against those piercing cries which follow him like avenging angels through the dreadful vaults  he escaped into the fragrant open air and the golden tropic moonlight and a garden which might have served as a model for eden but mans hell followed into gods heaven and still those wails seemed to ring through his ears  oh misery misery misery murmured he to himself through grinding teeth and i have brought her to this i have had to bring her to it what else could i who dare blame me and yet what devilish sin can i have committed that requires to be punished thus was there no one to be found but me no one and yet it may save her soul it may bring her to repentance  it may indeed for she is delicate and cannot endure much you ought to know as well as i senor the merciful disposition of the holy office  i know it i know it interrupted poor eustace trembling now for himself all in loveall in lovea paternal chastisement  and the proofs of heresy are patent beside the strong suspicion of enchantment and the known character of the elder sorceress you yourself you must remember senor told us that she had been a notorious witch in england before the senora brought her hither as her attendant  of course she was of course yes there was no other course open and though the flesh may be weak sir in my case yet none can have proved better to the holy office how willing is the spirit  and so eustace departed and ere another sun had set he had gone to the principal of the jesuits told him his whole heart or as much of it poor wretch as he dare tell to himself and entreated to be allowed to finish his novitiate and enter the order on the understanding that he was to be sent at once back to europe or anywhere else otherwise as he said frankly he should go mad even if he were not mad already the jesuit who was a kindly man enough went to the holy office and settled all with the inquisitors recounting to them to set him above all suspicion eustaces past valiant services to the church his testimony was no longer needed he left cartagena for nombre that very night and sailed the next week i know not whither  i say i know not whither eustace leigh vanishes henceforth from these pages he may have ended as general of his order he may have worn out his years in some tropic forest conquering the souls including of course the bodies of indians he may have gone back to his old work in england and been the very ballard who was hanged and quartered three years afterwards for his share in babingtons villainous conspiracy i know not this book is a history of menof mens virtues and sins victories and defeats and eustace is a man no longer he is become a thing a tool a jesuit which goes only where it is sent and does good or evil indifferently as it is bid which by an act of moral suicide has lost its soul in the hope of saving it without a will a conscience a responsibility as it fancies to god or man but only to the society in a word eustace as he says himself is dead twice dead i fear let the dead bury their dead we have no more concern with eustace leigh    chapter xxiii  the banks of the meta                                          my mariners      souls that have toild and wrought and thought with           medeath closes all but something ere the end      some work of noble note may yet be done      not unbecoming men that strove with gods                                           tennysons ulysses  nearly three years are past and gone since that little band had knelt at evensong beneath the giant tree of guayrayears of seeming blank through which they are to be tracked only by scattered notes and misspelt names through untrodden hills and forests over a space of some eight hundred miles in length by four hundred in breadth they had been seeking for the golden city and they had sought in vain they had sought it along the wooded banks of the orinoco and beyond the roaring foamworld of maypures and on the upper waters of the mighty amazon they had gone up the streams even into peru itself and had trodden the cinchona groves of loxa ignorant as all the world was then of their healing virtues they had seen the virgin snows of chimborazo towering white above the thundercloud and the giant cone of cotopaxi blackening in its sullen wrath before the fiery streams rolled down its sides foiled in their search at the back of the andes they had turned eastward once more and plunged from the alpine cliffs into the green and misty ocean of the montana slowly and painfully they had worked their way northward again along the eastern foot of the inland cordillera and now they were bivouacking as it seems upon one of the many feeders of the meta which flow down from the suma paz into the forestcovered plains there they sat their watchfires glittering on the stream beneath the shadow of enormous trees amyas and cary brimblecombe yeo and the indian lad who has followed them in all their wanderings alive and well but as far as ever from manoa and its fairy lake and golden palaces and all the wonders of the indians tale again and again in their wanderings they had heard faint rumors of its existence and started off in some fresh direction to meet only a fresh disappointment and hope deferred which maketh sick the heart  there they sit at lastfourandforty men out of the eightyfour who left the tree of guayrawhere are the rest       their bones are scatterd far and wide      by mount by stream and sea  drew the master lies on the banks of the rio negro and five brave fellows by him slain in fight by the poisoned arrows of the indians in a vain attempt to penetrate the mountaingorges of the parima two more lie amid the valleys of the andes frozen to death by the fierce slaty hail which sweeps down from the condors eyrie four more were drowned at one of the rapids of the orinoco five or six more wounded men are left behind at another rapid among friendly indians to be recovered when they can be perhaps never fever snakes jaguars alligators cannibal fish electric eels have thinned their ranks month by month and of their march through the primeval wilderness no track remains except those lonely graves  and there the survivors sit beside the silent stream beneath the tropic moon sundried and lean but strong and bold as ever with the quiet fire of english courage burning undimmed in every eye and the genial smile of english mirth fresh on every lip making a jest of danger and a sport of toil as cheerily as when they sailed over the bar of bideford in days which seem to belong to some antenatal life their beards have grown down upon their breasts their long hair is knotted on their heads like womens to keep off the burning sunshine their leggings are of the skin of the delicate guazuputi deer their shirts are patched with indian cotton web the spoils of jaguar puma and ape hang from their shoulders their ammunition is long since spent their muskets spoilt by the perpetual vaporbath of the steaming woods are left behind as useless in a cave by some cataract of the orinoco but their swords are bright and terrible as ever and they carry bows of a strength which no indian arm can bend and arrows pointed with the remnants of their armor many of them too are armed with the pocuna or blowgun of the indiansmore deadly because more silent than the firearms which they have left behind them so they have wandered and so they will wander still the lords of the forest and its beasts terrible to all hostile indians but kindly just and generous to all who will deal faithfully with them and many a smoothchinned carib and ature solimo and guahiba recounts with wonder and admiration the righteousness of the bearded heroes who proclaimed themselves the deadly foes of the faithless and murderous spaniard and spoke to them of the great and good queen beyond the seas who would send her warriors to deliver and avenge the oppressed indian  the men are sleeping among the trees some on the ground and some in grasshammocks slung between the stems all is silent save the heavy plunge of the tapir in the river as he tears up the waterweeds for his nights repast sometimes indeed the jaguar as he climbs from one treetop to another after his prey wakens the monkeys clustered on the boughs and they again arouse the birds and ten minutes of unearthly roars howls shrieks and cacklings make the forest ring as if all pandemonium had broke loose but that soon dies away again and even while it lasts it is too common a matter to awaken the sleepers much less to interrupt the council of war which is going on beside the watchfire between the three adventurers and the faithful yeo a hundred times have they held such a council and in vain and for aught they know this one will be as fruitless as those which have gone before it nevertheless it is a more solemn one than usual for the two years during which they had agreed to search for manoa are long past and some new place must be determined on unless they intend to spend the rest of their lives in that green wilderness  well says will cary taking his cigar out of his mouth at least we have got something out of those last indians it is a comfort to have a puff at tobacco once more after three weeks fasting  for me said jack brimblecombe heaven forgive me but when i get the magical leaf between my teeth again i feel tempted to sit as still as a chimney and smoke till my dying day without stirring hand or foot  then i shall forbid you tobacco master parson said amyas for we must be up and away again tomorrow we have been idling here three mortal days and nothing done  shall we ever do anything i think the gold of manoa is like the gold which lies where the rainbow touches the ground always a field beyond you  amyas was silent awhile and so were the rest there was no denying that their hopes were all but gone in the immense circuit which they had made they had met with nothing but disappointment  there is but one more chance said he at length and that is the mountains to the east of the orinoco where we failed the first time the incas may have moved on to them when they escaped  why not said cary they would so put all the forests beside the llanos and halfadozen great rivers between them and those dogs of spaniards  shall we try it once more said amyas this river ought to run into the orinoco and once there we are again at the very foot of the mountains what say you yeo  i cannot but mind your worship that when we came up the orinoco the indians told us terrible stories of those mountains how far they stretched and how difficult they were to cross by reason of the cliffs aloft and the thick forests in the valleys and have we not lost five good men there already  what care we no forests can be thicker than those we have bored through already why if one had had but a tail like a monkey for an extra warp one might have gone a hundred miles on end along the treetops and found it far pleasanter walking than tripping in withes and being eaten up with creeping things from morn till night  but remember too said jack how they told us to beware of the amazons  what jack afraid of a parcel of women  why not said jack i wouldnt run from a man as you know but a womanits not natural like they must be witches or devils see how the caribs feared them and there were men there without necks and with their eyes in their breasts they said now how could a christian tackle such customers as them  he couldnt cut off their heads thats certain but i suppose a poke in the ribs will do as much for them as for their neighbors  well said jack if i fight let me fight honest flesh and blood thats all and none of these outlandish monsters how do you know but that they are invulnerable by artmagic  how do you know that they are and as for the amazons said cary womans woman all the world over ill bet that you may wheedle them round with a compliment or two just as if they were so many burghers wives pity i have not a courtsuit and a spanish hat i would have taken an orange in one hand and a handkerchief in the other gone all alone to them as ambassador and been in a week as great with queen blackfacealinda as ever raleigh is at whitehall  gentlemen said yeo where you go i go and not only i but every man of us i doubt not but we have lost now half our company and spent our ammunition so we are no better men were it not for our swords than these naked heathens round us now it was as you all know by the wonder and noise of their ordnance let alone their horses which is a breakneck beast i put no faith in that both cortez and pizarro those imps of satan made their golden conquests with which if we could have astounded the people of manoa  having first found the said people laughed amyas it is like the old fable every craftsman thinks his own trade the one pillar of the commonweal  well your worship quoth yeo it may be that being a gunner i overprize guns but it dont need slate and pencil to do this sumare forty men without shot as good as eighty with  thou art right old fellow right enough and i was only jesting for very sorrow and must needs laugh about it lest i weep about it our chance is over i believe though i dare not confess as much to the men  sir said yeo i have a feeling on me that the lords hand is against us in this matter whether he means to keep this wealth for worthier men than us or whether it is his will to hide this great city in the secret place of his presence from the strife of tongues and so to spare them from sinful mans covetousness and england from that sin and luxury which i have seen gold beget among the spaniards i know not sir for who knoweth the counsels of the lord but i have long had a voice within which saith salvation yeo thou shalt never behold the golden city which is on earth where heathens worship sun and moon and the hosts of heaven be content therefore to see that golden city which is above where is neither sun nor moon but the lord god and the lamb are the light thereof  there was a simple majesty about old yeo when he broke forth in utterances like these which made his comrades and even amyas and cary look on him as mussulmans look on madmen as possessed of mysterious knowledge and flashes of inspiration and brimblecombe whose pious soul looked up to the old hero with a reverence which had overcome all his churchmans prejudices against anabaptists answered gently  amen amen my masters all and it has been on my mind too this long time that there is a providence against our going east for see how this two years past whenever we have pushed eastward we have fallen into trouble and lost good men and whenever we went westwardho we have prospered and do prosper to this day  and what is more gentlemen said yeo if as scripture says dreams are from the lord i verily believe mine last night came from him for as i lay by the fire sirs i heard my little maids voice calling of me as plain as ever i heard in my life and the very same words sirs which she learned from me and my good comrade william penberthy to say westwardho jolly mariners all a bit of an ungodly song my masters which we sang in our wild days but she stood and called it as plain as ever mortal ears heard and called again till i answered coming my maid coming and after that the dear chuck called no moregod grant i find her yetand so i woke  cary had long since given up laughing at yeo about the little maid and amyas answered  so let it be yeo if the rest agree but what shall we do to the westward  do said cary theres plenty to do for theres plenty of gold and plenty of spaniards too they say on the other side of these mountains so that our swords will not rust for lack of adventures my gay knightserrant all  so they chatted on and before night was half through a plan was matured desperate enoughbut what cared those brave hearts for that they would cross the cordillera to santa fe de bogota of the wealth whereof both yeo and amyas had often heard in the pacific try to seize either the town or some convoy of gold going from it make for the nearest river there was said to be a large one which ran northward thence build canoes and try to reach the northern sea once more and then if heaven prospered them they might seize a spanish ship and make their way home to england not indeed with the wealth of manoa but with a fair booty of spanish gold this was their new dream it was a wild one but hardly more wild than the one which drake had fulfilled and not as wild as the one which oxenham might have fulfilled but for his own fatal folly  amyas sat watching late that night sad of heart to give up the cherished dream of years was hard to face his mother harder still but it must be done for the mens sake so the new plan was proposed next day and accepted joyfully they would go up to the mountains and rest awhile if possible bring up the wounded whom they had left behind and then try a new venture with new hopes perhaps new dangers they were inured to the latter  they started next morning cheerfully enough and for three hours or more paddled easily up the glassy and windless reaches between two green flowerbespangled walls of forest gay with innumerable birds and insects while down from the branches which overhung the stream long trailers hung to the waters edge and seemed admiring in the clear mirror the images of their own gorgeous flowers river trees flowers birds insectsit was all a fairyland but it was a colossal one and yet the voyagers took little note of it it was now to them an everyday occurrence to see trees full two hundred feet high one mass of yellow or purple blossom to the highest twigs and every branch and stem one hanging garden of crimson and orange orchids or vanillas common to them were all the fantastic and enormous shapes with which nature bedecks her robes beneath the fierce suns and fattening rains of the tropic forest common were forms and colors of bird and fish and butterfly more strange and bright than ever opiumeater dreamed the long processions of monkeys who kept pace with them along the treetops and proclaimed their wonder in every imaginable whistle and grunt and howl had ceased to move their laughter as much as the roar of the jaguar and the rustle of the boa had ceased to move their fear and when a brilliant green and rosecolored fish flatbodied like a bream flabfinned like a salmon and sawtoothed like a shark leapt clean on board of the canoe to escape the rush of the huge alligator whose loathsome snout ere he could stop actually rattled against the canoe within a foot of jack brimblecombes hand jack instead of turning pale as he had done at the sharks upon a certain memorable occasion coolly picked up the fish and said hes four pound weight if you can catch pirai for us like that old fellow just keep in our wake and well give you the cleanings for wages  yes the mind of man is not so infinite in the vulgar sense of that word as people fancy and however greedy the appetite for wonder may be while it remains unsatisfied in everyday european life it is as easily satiated as any other appetite and then leaves the senses of its possessor as dull as those of a city gourmand after a lord mayors feast only the highest mindsour humboldts and bonplands and schomburgks and they only when quickened to an almost unhealthy activity by civilizationcan go on long appreciating where nature is insatiable imperious maddening in her demands on our admiration the very power of observing wears out under the rush of ever new objects and the dizzy spectator is fain at last to shut the eyes of his soul and take refuge as west indian spaniards do in tobacco and stupidity the man too who has not only eyes but utterancewhat shall he do where all words fail him superlatives are but inarticulate after all and give no pictures even of size any more than do numbers of feet and yards and yet what else can we do but heap superlative on superlative and cry wonderful wonderful and after that wonderful past all whooping what humboldts self cannot paint we will not try to daub the voyagers were in a south american forest readers fill up the meaning of those words each as your knowledge enables you for i cannot do it for you  certainly those adventurers could not the absence of any attempt at wordpainting even of admiration at the glorious things which they saw is most remarkable in all early voyagers both spanish and english the only two exceptions which i recollect are columbusbut then all was new and he was bound to tell what he had seenand raleigh the two most gifted men perhaps with the exception of humboldt who ever set foot in tropical america but even they dare nothing but a few feeble hints in passing their souls had been dazzled and stunned by a great glory coming out of our european nature into that tropic one they had felt like platos men bred in the twilight cavern and then suddenly turned round to the broad blaze of day they had seen things awful and unspeakable why talk of them except to say with the turks god is great  so it was with these men among the higherhearted of them the grandeur and the glory around had attuned their spirits to itself and kept up in them a lofty heroical reverent frame of mind but they knew as little about the trees and animals in an artistic or critical point of view as in a scientific one this tree the indians called one unpronounceable name and it made good bows that some other name and it made good canoes of that you could eat the fruit that produced the caoutchouc gum useful for a hundred matters that was what the indians and they likewise used to poison their arrows with from the ashes of those palmnuts you could make good salt that tree again was full of good milk if you bored the stem they drank it and gave god thanks and were not astonished god was great but that they had discovered long before they came into the tropics noble old childhearted heroes with just romance and superstition enough about them to keep them from that prurient hysterical wonder and enthusiasm which is simply one often fears a product of our scepticism we do not trust enough in god we do not really believe his power enough to be ready as they were as every one ought to be on a godmade earth for anything and everything being possible and then when a wonder is discovered we go into ecstasies and shrieks over it and take to ourselves credit for being susceptible of so lofty a feeling true index forsooth of a refined and cultivated mind  they paddled onward hour after hour sheltering themselves as best they could under the shadow of the southern bank while on their right hand the full sunglare lay upon the enormous wall of mimosas figs and laurels which formed the northern forest broken by the slender shafts of bamboo tufts and decked with a thousand gaudy parasites bank upon bank of gorgeous bloom piled upward to the sky till where its outline cut the blue flowers and leaves too lofty to be distinguished by the eye formed a broken rainbow of all hues quivering in the ascending streams of azure mist until they seemed to melt and mingle with the very heavens  and as the sun rose higher and higher a great stillness fell upon the forest the jaguars and the monkeys had hidden themselves in the darkest depths of the woods the birds notes died out one by one the very butterflies ceased their flitting over the treetops and slept with outspread wings upon the glossy leaves undistinguishable from the flowers around them now and then a colibri whirred downward toward the water hummed for a moment around some pendent flower and then the living gem was lost in the deep blackness of the inner wood among treetrunks as huge and dark as the pillars of some hindoo shrine or a parrot swung and screamed at them from an overhanging bough or a thirsty monkey slid lazily down a liana to the surface of the stream dipped up the water in his tiny hand and started chattering back as his eyes met those of some foul alligator peering upward through the clear depths below in shaded nooks beneath the boughs the capybaras rabbits as large as sheep went paddling sleepily round and round thrusting up their unwieldy heads among the blooms of the blue waterlilies while black and purple waterhens ran up and down upon the rafts of floating leaves the shining snout of a freshwater dolphin rose slowly to the surface a jet of spray whirred up a rainbow hung upon it for a moment and the black snout sank lazily again here and there too upon some shallow pebbly shore scarlet flamingoes stood dreaming kneedeep on one leg crested cranes pranced up and down admiring their own finery and ibises and egrets dipped their bills under water in search of prey but before noon even those had slipped away and there reigned a stillness which might be heardsuch a stillness to compare small things with great as broods beneath the rich shadows of amyass own devon woods or among the lonely sweeps of exmoor when the heather is in flowera stillness in which as humboldt says if beyond the silence we listen for the faintest undertones we detect a stifled continuous hum of insects which crowd the air close to the earth a confused swarming murmur which hangs round every bush in the cracked bark of trees in the soil undermined by lizards millepedes and bees a voice proclaiming to us that all nature breathes that under a thousand different forms life swarms in the gaping and dusty earth as much as in the bosom of the waters and the air which breathes around  at last a soft and distant murmur increasing gradually to a heavy roar announced that they were nearing some cataract till turning a point where the deep alluvial soil rose into a low cliff fringed with delicate ferns they came full in sight of a scene at which all paused not with astonishment but with something very like disgust  rapids again grumbled one i thought we had had enough of them on the orinoco  we shall have to get out and draw the canoes overland i suppose three hours will be lost and in the very hottest of the day too  theres worse behind dont you see the spray behind the palms  stop grumbling my masters and dont cry out before you are hurt paddle right up to the largest of those islands and let us look about us  in front of them was a snowwhite bar of raging foam some ten feet high along which were ranged three or four islands of black rock each was crested with a knot of lofty palms whose green tops stood out clear against the bright sky while the lower half of their stems loomed hazy through a luminous veil of rainbowed mist the banks right and left of the fall were so densely fringed with a low hedge of shrubs that landing seemed all but impossible and their indian guide suddenly looking round him and whispering bade them beware of savages and pointed to a canoe which lay swinging in the eddies under the largest island moored apparently to the root of some tree  silence all cried amyas and paddle up thither and seize the canoe if there be an indian on the island we will have speech of him but mind and treat him friendly and on your lives neither strike nor shoot even if he offers to fight  so choosing a line of smooth backwater just in the wake of the island they drove their canoes up by main force and fastened them safely by the side of the indians while amyas always the foremost sprang boldly on shore whispering to the indian boy to follow him  once on the island amyas felt sure enough that if its wild tenant had not seen them approach he certainly had not heard them so deafening was the noise which filled his brain and seemed to make the very leaves upon the bushes quiver and the solid stone beneath his feet to reel and ring for two hundred yards and more above the fall nothing met his eye but one white waste of raging foam with here and there a transverse dyke of rock which hurled columns of spray and surges of beaded water high into the airstrangely contrasting with the still and silent cliffs of green leaves which walled the river right and left and more strangely still with the knots of enormous palms upon the islets which reared their polished shafts a hundred feet into the air straight and upright as masts while their broad plumes and goldenclustered fruit slept in the sunshine far aloft the image of the stateliest repose amid the wildest wrath of nature  he looked round anxiously for the expected indian but he was nowhere to be seen and in the meanwhile as he stept cautiously along the island which was some fifty yards in length and breadth his senses accustomed as they were to such sights could not help dwelling on the exquisite beauty of the scene on the garden of gay flowers of every imaginable form and hue which fringed every boulder at his feet peeping out amid delicate fernfans and luxuriant cushions of moss on the chequered shade of the palms and the cool air which wafted down from the cataracts above the scents of a thousand flowers gradually his ear became accustomed to the roar and above its mighty undertone he could hear the whisper of the wind among the shrubs and the hum of myriad insects while the rock manakin with its saffron plumage flitted before him from stone to stone calling cheerily and seeming to lead him on suddenly scrambling over the rocky flowerbeds to the other side of the isle he came upon a little shady beach which beneath a bank of stone some six feet high fringed the edge of a perfectly still and glassy bay ten yards farther the cataract fell sheer in thunder but a high fernfringed rock turned its force away from that quiet nook in it the water swung slowly round and round in glassy darkgreen rings among which dimpled a hundred gaudy fish waiting for every fly and worm which spun and quivered on the eddy here if anywhere was the place to find the owner of the canoe he leapt down upon the pebbles and as he did so a figure rose from behind a neighboring rock and met him face to face  it was an indian girl and yet when he looked againwas it an indian girl amyas had seen hundreds of those delicate darkskinned daughters of the forest but never such a one as this her stature was taller her limbs were fuller and more rounded her complexion though tanned by light was fairer by far than his own sunburnt face her hair crowned with a garland of white flowers was not lank and straight and black like an indians but of a rich glossy brown and curling richly and crisply from her very temples to her knees her forehead though low was upright and ample her nose was straight and small her lips the lips of a european her whole face of the highest and richest type of spanish beauty a collar of gold mingled with green beads hung round her neck and golden bracelets were on her wrists all the strange and dim legends of white indians and of nations of a higher race than carib or arrowak or solimo which amyas had ever heard rose up in his memory she must be the daughter of some great cacique perhaps of the lost incas themselveswhy not and full of simple wonder he gazed upon that fairy vision while she unabashed in her free innocence gazed fearlessly in return as eve might have done in paradise upon the mighty stature and the strange garments and above all on the bushy beard and flowing yellow locks of the englishman  he spoke first in some indian tongue gently and smilingly and made a halfstep forward but quick as light she caught up from the ground a bow and held it fiercely toward him fitted with the long arrow with which as he could see she had been striking fish for a line of twisted grass hung from its barbed head amyas stopped laid down his own bow and sword and made another step in advance smiling still and making all indian signs of amity but the arrow was still pointed straight at his breast and he knew the mettle and strength of the forest nymphs well enough to stand still and call for the indian boy too proud to retreat but in the uncomfortable expectation of feeling every moment the shaft quivering between his ribs  the boy who had been peering from above leaped down to them in a moment and began as the safest method grovelling on his nose upon the pebbles while he tried two or three dialects one of which at last she seemed to understand and answered in a tone of evident suspicion and anger  what does she say  that you are a spaniard and a robber because you have a beard  tell her that we are no spaniards but that we hate them and are come across the great waters to help the indians to kill them  the boy translated his speech the nymph answered by a contemptuous shake of the head  tell her that if she will send her tribe to us we will do them no harm we are going over the mountains to fight the spaniards and we want them to show us the way  the boy had no sooner spoken than nimble as a deer the nymph had sprung up the rocks and darted between the palmstems to her canoe suddenly she caught sight of the english boat and stopped with a cry of fear and rage  let her pass shouted amyas who had followed her close push your boat off and let her pass boy tell her to go on they will not come near her  but she hesitated still and with arrow drawn to the head faced first on the boats crew and then on amyas till the englishmen had shoved off full twenty yards  then leaping into her tiny piragua she darted into the wildest whirl of the eddies shooting along with vigorous strokes while the english trembled as they saw the frail bark spinning and leaping amid the muzzles of the alligators and the huge dogtoothed trout but with the swiftness of an arrow she reached the northern bank drove her canoe among the bushes and leaping from it darted through some narrow opening in the bush and vanished like a dream  what fair virago have you unearthed cried cary as they toiled up again to the landingplace  beshrew me quoth jack but we are in the very land of the nymphs and i shall expect to see diana herself next with the moon on her forehead  take care then where you wander hereabouts sir john lest you end as actaeon did by turning into a stag and being eaten by a jaguar  actaeon was eaten by his own hounds mr cary so the parallel dont hold but surely she was a very wonder of beauty  why was it that amyas did not like this harmless talk there had come over him the strangest new feeling as if that fair vision was his property and the men had no right to talk about her no right to have even seen her and he spoke quite surlily as he said  you may leave the women to themselves my masters youll have to deal with the men ere long so get your canoes up on the rock and keep good watch  hillo shouted one in a few minutes heres fresh fish enough to feed us all round i suppose that young catamountain left it behind her in her hurry i wish she had left her golden chains and ouches into the bargain  well said another well take it as fair payment for having made us drop down the current again to let her ladyship pass  leave that fish alone said amyas it is none of yours  why sir quoth the finder in a tone of sulky deprecation  if we are to make good friends with the heathens we had better not begin by stealing their goods there are plenty more fish in the river go and catch them and let the indians have their own  the men were accustomed enough to strict and stern justice in their dealings with the savages but they could not help looking slyly at each other and hinting when out of sight that the captain seemed in a mighty fuss about his new acquaintance  however they were expert by this time in all the indians fishing methods and so abundant was the animal life which swarmed around every rock that in an hour fish enough lay on the beach to feed them all whose forms and colors names and families i must leave the reader to guess from the wondrous pages of sir richard schomburgk for i know too little of them to speak without the fear of making mistakes  a full hour passed before they saw anything more of their indian neighbors and then from under the bushes shot out a canoe on which all eyes were fixed in expectation  amyas who expected to find there some remnant of a higher race was disappointed enough at seeing on board only the usual halfdozen of lowbrowed dirty orsons painted red with arnotto but a grayheaded elder at the stern seemed by his feathers and gold ornaments to be some man of note in the little woodland community  the canoe came close up to the island amyas saw that they were unarmed and laying down his weapons advanced alone to the bank making all signs of amity they were returned with interest by the old man and amyass next care was to bring forward the fish which the fair nymph had left behind and through the medium of the indian lad to give the cacique for so he seemed to be to understand that he wished to render every one his own this offer was received as amyas expected with great applause and the canoe came alongside but the crew still seemed afraid to land amyas bade his men throw the fish one by one into the boat and then proclaimed by the boys mouth as was his custom with all indians that he and his were enemies of the spaniards and on their way to make war against themand that all which they desired was a peaceable and safe passage through the dominions of the mighty potentate and renowned warrior whom they beheld before them for amyas argued rightly enough that even if the old fellow aft was not the cacique he would be none the less pleased at being mistaken for him  whereon the ancient worthy rising in the canoe pointed to heaven earth and the things under and commenced a long sermon in tone manner and articulation very like one of those which the great blackbearded apes were in the habit of preaching every evening when they could get together a congregation of little monkeys to listen to the great scandal of jack who would have it that some evil spirit set them on to mimic him which sermon being partly interpreted by the indian lad seemed to signify that the valor and justice of the white men had already reached the ears of the speaker and that he was sent to welcome them into those regions by the daughter of the sun  the daughter of the sun quoth amyas then we have found the lost incas after all  we have found something said cary i only hope it may not be a mares nest like many another of our finding  or an adders said yeo we must beware of treachery  we must beware of no such thing said amyas pretty sharply have i not told you fifty times that if they see that we trust them they will trust us and if they see that we suspect them they will suspect us and when two parties are watching to see who strikes the first blow they are sure to come to fisticuffs from mere dirty fear of each other  amyas spoke truth for almost every atrocity against savages which had been committed by the spaniards and which was in later and worse times committed by the english was wont to be excused in that same base fear of treachery amyass plan like that of drake and cook and all great english voyagers had been all along to inspire at once awe and confidence by a frank and fearless carriage and he was not disappointed here he bade the men step boldly into their canoes and follow the old indian whither he would the simple children of the forest bowed themselves reverently before the mighty strangers and then led them smilingly across the stream and through a narrow passage in the covert to a hidden lagoon on the banks of which stood not manoa but a tiny indian village    chapter xxiv  how amyas was tempted of the devil       let us alone  what pleasure can we have         to war with evil  is there any peace      in always climbing up the climbing wave         all things have rest and ripen toward the grave      in silence ripen fall and cease         give us long rest or death dark death or dreamful ease                                                         tennyson  humboldt has somewhere a curious passage in which looking on some wretched group of indians squatting stupidly round their fires besmeared with grease and paint and devouring ants and clay he somewhat naively remarks that were it not for science which teaches us that such is the crude material of humanity and this the state from which we all have risen he should have been tempted rather to look upon those hapless beings as the last degraded remnants of some fallen and dying race one wishes that the great traveller had been bold enough to yield to that temptation which his own reason and common sense presented to him as the real explanation of the sad sight instead of following the dogmas of a socalled science which has not a fact whereon to base its wild notion and must ignore a thousand facts in asserting it his own good sense it seems coincided instinctively with the bible doctrine that man in a state of nature is a fallen being doomed to deatha view which may be a sad one but still one more honorable to poor humanity than the theory that we all began as some sort of twohanded apes it is surely more hopeful to believe that those poor otomacs or guahibas were not what they ought to be than to believe that they were it is certainly more complimentary to them to think that they had been somewhat nobler and more prudent in centuries gone by than that they were such blockheads as to have dragged on the son after the father for all the thousands of years which have elapsed since man was made without having had wit enough to discover any better food than ants and clay  our voyagers however like those of their time troubled their heads with no such questions taking the bible story as they found it they agreed with humboldts reason and not with his science or to speak correctly agreed with humboldts self and not with the shallow anthropologic theories which happened to be in vogue fifty years ago and their new hosts were in their eyes immortal souls like themselves captivated by the devil at his will lost there in the pathless forests likely to be lost hereafter  and certainly facts seemed to bear out their oldfashioned theories although these indians had sunk by no means so low as the guahibas whom they had met upon the lower waters of the same river  they beheld on landing a scattered village of palmleaf sheds under which as usual the hammocks were slung from tree to tree here and there in openings in the forest patches of cassava and indigo appeared and there was a look of neatness and comfort about the little settlement superior to the average  but now for the signs of the evil spirit certainly it was no good spirit who had inspired them with the art of music or else as cary said apollo and mercury if they ever visited america had played their forefathers a shabby trick and put them off with very poor instruments and still poorer taste for on either side of the landingplace were arranged four or five stout fellows each with a tall drum or long earthen trumpet swelling out in the course of its length into several hollow balls from which arose the moment the strangers set foot on shore so deafening a cacophony of howls and groans and thumps as fully to justify yeos remark they are calling upon their devil sir to which cary answered with some show of reason that they were the less likely to be disappointed for none but sir urian would ever come to listen to such a noise  and you mark sirs said yeo theres some feast or sacrifice toward im not overconfident of them yet  nonsense said amyas we could kill every soul of them in halfanhour and they know that as well as we  but some great demonstration was plainly toward for the children of the forest were arrayed in two lines right and left of the open space the men in front and the women behind and all bedizened to the best of their power with arnotto indigo and feathers  next with a hideous yell leapt into the centre of the space a personage who certainly could not have complained if any one had taken him for the devil for he had dressed himself up carefully for that very intent in a jaguarskin with a long tail grinning teeth a pair of horns a plume of black and yellow feathers and a huge rattle  heres the piache the rascal says amyas  ay says yeo in satans livery and ive no doubt his works are according trust him for it  dont be frightened jack says cary backing up brimblecombe from behind its your business to tackle him you know at him boldly and hell run  whereat all the men laughed and the piache who had intended to produce a very solemn impression hung fire a little however being accustomed to get his bread by his impudence he soon recovered himself advanced smote one of the musicians over the head with his rattle to procure silence and then began a harangue to which amyas listened patiently cigar in mouth  whats it all about boy  he wants to know whether you have seen amalivaca on the other shore of the great water  amyas was accustomed to this inquiry after the mythic civilizer of the forest indians who after carving the mysterious sculptures which appear upon so many inland cliffs of that region returned again whence he came beyond the ocean he answered as usual by setting forth the praises of queen elizabeth  to which the piache replied that she must be one of amalivacas seven daughters some of whom he took back with him while he broke the legs of the rest to prevent their running away and left them to people the forests  to which amyas replied that his queens legs were certainly not broken for she was a very model of grace and activity and the best dancer in all her dominions but that it was more important to him to know whether the tribe would give them cassava bread and let them stay peaceably on that island to rest a while before they went on to fight the clothed men the spaniards on the other side of the mountains  on which the piache after capering and turning head over heels with much howling beckoned amyas and his party to follow him they did so seeing that the indians were all unarmed and evidently in the highest good humor  the piache went toward the door of a carefully closed hut and crawling up to it on allfours in most abject fashion began whining to some one within  ask what he is about boy  the lad asked the old cacique who had accompanied them and received for answer that he was consulting the daughter of the sun  here is our mares nest at last quoth cary as the piache from whines rose to screams and gesticulations and then to violent convulsions foaming at the mouth and rolling of the eyeballs till he suddenly sank exhausted and lay for dead  as good as a stage play  the devil has played his part says jack and now by the rules of all plays vice should come on  and a very fair vice it will be i suspect a right sweet iniquity my jack listen  and from the interior of the hut rose a low sweet song at which all the simple indians bowed their heads in reverence and the english were hushed in astonishment for the voice was not shrill or guttural like that of an indian but round clear and rich like a europeans and as it swelled and rose louder and louder showed a compass and power which would have been extraordinary anywhere and many a man of the party as was usual in musical old england was a good judge enough of such a matter and could hold his part right well in glee and catch and roundelay and psalm and as it leaped and ran and sank again and rose once more to fall once more all but inarticulate yet perfect in melody like the voice of bird on bough the wild wanderers were rapt in new delight and did not wonder at the indians as they bowed their heads and welcomed the notes as messengers from some higher world at last one triumphant burst so shrill that all ears rang again and then dead silence the piache suddenly restored to life jumped upright and recommenced preaching at amyas  tell the howling villain to make short work of it lad his tune wont do after that last one  the lad grinning informed amyas that the piache signified their acceptance as friends by the daughter of the sun that her friends were theirs and her foes theirs whereon the indians set up a scream of delight and amyas rolling another tobacco leaf up in another strip of plantain answered  then let her give us some cassava and lighted a fresh cigar  whereon the door of the hut opened and the indians prostrated themselves to the earth as there came forth the same fair apparition which they had encountered upon the island but decked now in featherrobes and plumes of every imaginable hue  slowly and stately as one accustomed to command she walked up to amyas glancing proudly round on her prostrate adorers and pointing with graceful arms to the trees the gardens and the huts gave him to understand by signs so expressive were her looks that no words were needed that all was at his service after which taking his hand she lifted it gently to her forehead  at that sign of submission a shout of rapture rose from the crowd and as the mysterious maiden retired again to her hut they pressed round the english caressing and admiring pointing with equal surprise to their swords to their indian bows and blowguns and to the trophies of wild beasts with which they were clothed while women hastened off to bring fruit and flowers and cassava and to amyass great anxiety calabashes of intoxicating drink and to make a long story short the english sat down beneath the trees and feasted merrily while the drums and trumpets made hideous music and lithe young girls and lads danced uncouth dances which so scandalized both brimblecombe and yeo that they persuaded amyas to beat an early retreat he was willing enough to get back to the island while the men were still sober so there were many leavetakings and promises of return on the morrow and the party paddled back to their islandfortress racking their wits as to who or what the mysterious maid could be  amyas however had settled in his mind that she was one of the lost inca race perhaps a descendant of that very fair girl wife of the inca manco whom pizarro forty years before had merely to torture the fugitive kings heart as his body was safe from the tyrants reach stripped scourged and shot to death with arrows uncomplaining to the last  they all assembled for the evening service hardly a day had passed since they left england on which they had not done the same and after it was over they must needs sing a psalm and then a catch or two ere they went to sleep and till the moon was high in heaven twenty mellow voices rang out above the roar of the cataract in many a good old tune once or twice they thought they heard an echo to their song but they took no note of it till cary who had gone apart for a few minutes returned and whispered amyas away  the sweet iniquity is mimicking us lad  they went to the brink of the river and there for their ears were by this time dead to the noise of the torrent they could hear plainly the same voice which had so surprised them in the hut repeating clear and true snatches of the airs which they had sung strange and solemn enough was the effect of the mens deep voices on the island answered out of the dark forest by those sweet treble notes and the two young men stood a long while listening and looking out across the eddies which swirled down golden in the moonlight but they could see nothing beyond save the black wall of trees after a while the voice ceased and the two returned to dream of incas and nightingales  they visited the village again next day and every day for a week or more but the maiden appeared but rarely and when she did kept her distance as haughtily as a queen  amyas of course as soon as he could converse somewhat better with his new friends was not long before he questioned the cacique about her but the old man made an owls face at her name and intimated by mysterious shakes of the head that she was a very strange personage and the less said about her the better she was a child of the sun and that was enough  tell him boy quoth cary that we are the children of the sun by his first wife and have orders from him to inquire how the indians have behaved to our stepsister for he cannot see all their tricks down here the trees are so thick so let him tell us or all the cassava plants shall be blighted  will will dont play with lying said amyas but the threat was enough for the cacique and taking them in his canoe a full mile down the stream as if in fear that the wonderful maiden should overhear him he told them in a sort of rhythmic chant how many moons ago he could not tell how many his tribe was a mighty nation and dwelt in papamene till the spaniards drove them forth and how as they wandered northward far away upon the mountain spurs beneath the flaming cone of cotopaxi they had found this fair creature wandering in the forest about the bigness of a seven years child wondering at her white skin and her delicate beauty the simple indians worshipped her as a god and led her home with them and when they found that she was human like themselves their wonder scarcely lessened how could so tender a being have sustained life in those forests and escaped the jaguar and the snake she must be under some divine protection she must be a daughter of the sun one of that mighty inca race the news of whose fearful fall had reached even those lonely wildernesses who had many of them haunted for years as exiles the eastern slopes of the andes about the ucalayi and the maranon who would as all indians knew rise again some day to power when bearded white men should come across the seas to restore them to their ancient throne  so as the girl grew up among them she was tended with royal honors by command of the conjuror of the tribe that so her forefather the sun might be propitious to them and the incas might show favor to the poor ruined omaguas in the day of their coming glory and as she grew she had become it seemed somewhat of a prophetess among them as well as an object of fetishworship for she was more prudent in council valiant in war and cunning in the chase than all the elders of the tribe and those strange and sweet songs of hers which had so surprised the white men were full of mysterious wisdom about the birds and the animals and the flowers and the rivers which the sun and the good spirit taught her from above so she had lived among them unmarried still not only because she despised the addresses of all indian youths but because the conjuror had declared it to be profane in them to mingle with the race of the sun and had assigned her a cabin near his own where she was served in state and gave some sort of oracular responses as they had seen to the questions which he put to her  such was the caciques tale on which cary remarked probably not unjustly that he dared to say the conjuror made a very good thing of it but amyas was silent full of dreams if not about manoa still about the remnant of the inca race what if they were still to be found about the southern sources of the amazon he must have been very near them already in that case it was vexatious but at least he might be sure that they had formed no great kingdom in that direction or he should have heard of it long ago perhaps they had moved lately from thence eastward to escape some fresh encroachment of the spaniards and this girl had been left behind in their flight and then he recollected with a sigh how hopeless was any further search with his diminished band at least he might learn something of the truth from the maiden herself it might be useful to him in some future attempt for he had not yet given up manoa if he but got safe home there was many a gallant gentleman and raleigh came at once into his mind who would join him in a fresh search for the golden city of guiana not by the upper waters but by the mouth of the orinoco  so they paddled back while the simple cacique entreated them to tell the sun in their daily prayers how well the wild people had treated his descendant and besought them not to take her away with them lest the sun should forget the poor omaguas and ripen their manioc and their fruit no more  amyas had no wish to stay where he was longer than was absolutely necessary to bring up the sick men from the orinoco but this he well knew would be a journey probably of some months and attended with much danger  cary volunteered at once however to undertake the adventure if halfadozen men would join him and the indians would send a few young men to help in working the canoe but this latter item was not an easy one to obtain for the tribe with whom they now were stood in some fear of the fierce and brutal guahibas through whose country they must pass and every indian tribe as amyas knew well enough looks on each tribe of different language to itself as natural enemies hateful and made only to be destroyed wherever met this strange fact too amyas and his party attributed to delusion of the devil the divider and accuser and i am of opinion that they were perfectly right only let amyas take care that while he is discovering the devil in the indians he does not give place to him in himself and that in more ways than one but of that more hereafter  whether however it was pride or shyness which kept the maiden aloof she conquered it after a while perhaps through mere womans curiosity and perhaps too from mere longing for amusement in a place so unspeakably stupid as the forest she gave the english to understand however that though they all might be very important personages none of them was to be her companion but amyas and ere a month was past she was often hunting with him far and wide in the neighboring forest with a train of chosen nymphs whom she had persuaded to follow her example and spurn the dusky suitors around this fashion not uncommon perhaps among the indian tribes where women are continually escaping to the forest from the tyranny of the men and often perhaps forming temporary communities was to the english a plain proof that they were near the land of the famous amazons of whom they had heard so often from the indians while amyas had no doubt that as a descendant of the incas the maiden preserved the tradition of the virgins of the sun and of the austere monastic rule of the peruvian superstition had not that valiant german george of spires and jeronimo ortal too fifty years before found convents of the sun upon these very upper waters  so a harmless friendship sprang up between amyas and the girl which soon turned to good account for she no sooner heard that he needed a crew of indians than she consulted the piache assembled the tribe and having retired to her hut commenced a song which unless the piache lied was a command to furnish young men for carys expedition under penalty of the sovereign displeasure of an evil spirit with an unpronounceable namean argument which succeeded on the spot and the canoe departed on its perilous errand  john brimblecombe had great doubts whether a venture thus started by direct help and patronage of the fiend would succeed and amyas himself disliking the humbug told ayacanora that it would be better to have told the tribe that it was a good deed and pleasing to the good spirit  ah said she naively enough they know better than that the good spirit is big and lazy and he smiles and takes no trouble but the little bad spirit he is so busyhere and there and everywhere and she waved her pretty hands up and down he is the useful one to have for a friend which sentiment the piache much approved as became his occupation and once told brimblecombe pretty sharply that he was a meddlesome fellow for telling the indians that the good spirit cared for them for quoth he if they begin to ask the good spirit for what they want who will bring me cassava and coca for keeping the bad spirit quiet this argument however forcible the devils priests in all ages have felt it to be did not stop jacks preaching and very good and righteous preaching it was moreover and much less the morning and evening service in the island camp this last the indians attracted by the singing attended in such numbers that the piache found his occupation gone and vowed to put an end to jacks gospel with a poisoned arrow  which plan he blinded by his master satan so jack phrased it took into his head to impart to ayacanora as the partner of his tithes and offerings and was exceedingly astonished to receive in answer a box on the ear and a storm of abuse after which ayacanora went to amyas and telling him all proposed that the piache should be thrown to the alligators and jack installed in his place declaring that whatsoever the bearded men said must be true and whosoever plotted against them should die the death  jack however magnanimously forgave his foe and preached on of course with fresh zeal but not alas with much success for the conjuror though his main treasure was gone over to the camp of the enemy had a reserve in a certain holy trumpet which was hidden mysteriously in a cave on the neighboring hills not to be looked on by woman under pain of death and it was well known and had been known for generations that unless that trumpet after fastings flagellations and other solemn rites was blown by night throughout the woods the palmtrees would bear no fruit yea so great was the fame of that trumpet that neighboring tribes sent at the proper season to hire it and the blower thereof by payment of much precious trumpery that so they might be sharers in its fertilizing powers  so the piache announced one day in public that in consequence of the impiety of the omaguas he should retire to a neighboring tribe of more religious turn of mind and taking with him the precious instrument leave their palms to blight and themselves to the evil spirit  dire was the wailing and dire the wrath throughout the village jacks words were allowed to be good words but what was the gospel in comparison of the trumpet the rascal saw his advantage and began a fierce harangue against the heretic strangers as he maddened his hearers maddened the savage nature capricious as a childs flashed out in wild suspicion women yelled men scowled and ran hastily to their huts for bows and blowguns the case was grown critical there were not more than a dozen men with amyas at the time and they had only their swords while the indian men might muster nearly a hundred amyas forbade his men either to draw or to retreat but poisoned arrows were weapons before which the boldest might well quail and more than one cheek grew pale which had seldom been pale before  it is gods quarrel sirs all said jack brimblecombe let him defend the right  as he spoke from ayacanoras hut arose her magic song and quivered aloft among the green heights of the forest  the mob stood spellbound still growling fiercely but not daring to move another moment and she had rushed out like a very diana into the centre of the ring bow in hand and arrow on the string  the fallen children of wrath had found their match in her for her beautiful face was convulsed with fury almost foaming in her passion she burst forth with bitter revilings she pointed with admiration to the english and then with fiercest contempt to the indians and at last with fierce gestures seemed to cast off the very dust of her feet against them and springing to amyass side placed herself in the forefront of the english battle  the whole scene was so sudden that amyas had hardly discovered whether she came as friend or foe before her bow was raised he had just time to strike up her hand when the arrow flew past the ear of the offending piache and stuck quivering in a tree  let me kill the wretch said she stamping with rage but amyas held her arm firmly  fools cried she to the tribe while tears of anger rolled down her cheeks choose between me and your trumpet i am a daughter of the sun i am white i am a companion for englishmen but you your mothers were guahibas and ate mud and your fathersthey were howling apes let them sing to you i shall go to the white men and never sing you to sleep any more and when the little evil spirit misses my voice he will come and tumble you out of your hammocks and make you dream of ghosts every night till you grow as thin as blowguns and as stupid as ayeayes        twotoed sloths  this terrible counterthreat in spite of the slight bathos involved had its effect for it appealed to that dread of the sleep world which is common to all savages but the conjuror was ready to outbid the prophetess and had begun a fresh oration when amyas turned the tide of war bursting into a huge laugh at the whole matter he took the conjuror by his shoulders sent him with one crafty kick halfadozen yards off upon his nose and then walking out of the ranks shook hands round with all his indian acquaintances  whereon like grownup babies they all burst out laughing too shook hands with all the english and then with each other being after all as glad as any bishops to prorogue the convocation and let unpleasant questions stand over till the next session the piache relented like a prudent man ayacanora returned to her hut to sulk and amyas to his island to long for carys return for he felt himself on dangerous ground  at last will returned safe and sound and as merry as ever not having lost a man though he had had a smart brush with the guahibas he brought back three of the wounded men now pretty nigh cured the other two who had lost a leg apiece had refused to come they had indian wives more than they could eat and tobacco without end and if it were not for the gnats of which cary said that there were more mosquitoes than there was air they should be the happiest men alive amyas could hardly blame the poor fellows for the chance of their getting home through the forest with one leg each was very small and after all they were making the best of a bad matter and a very bad matter it seemed to him to be left in a heathen land and a still worse matter when he overheard some of the men talking about their comrades lonely fate as if after all they were not so much to be pitied he said nothing about it then for he made a rule never to take notice of any facts which he got at by eavesdropping however unintentional but he longed that one of them would say as much to him and he would give them a piece of his mind and a piece of his mind he had to give within the week for while he was on a hunting party two of his men were missing and were not heard of for some days at the end of which time the old cacique come to tell him that he believed they had taken to the forest each with an indian girl  amyas was very wroth at the news first because it had never happened before he could say with honest pride as raleigh did afterwards when he returned from his guiana voyage that no indian woman had ever been the worse for any man of his he had preached on this point month after month and practised what he preached and now his pride was sorely hurt  moreover he dreaded offence to the indians themselves but on this score the cacique soon comforted him telling him that the girls as far as he could find had gone off of their own free will intimating that he thought it somewhat an honor to the tribe that they had found favor in the eyes of the bearded men and moreover that late wars had so thinned the ranks of their men that they were glad enough to find husbands for their maidens and had been driven of late years to kill many of their female infants this sad story common perhaps to every american tribe and one of the chief causes of their extermination reassured amyas somewhat but he could not stomach either the loss of his men or their breach of discipline and look for them he would did any one know where they were if the tribe knew they did not care to tell but ayacanora the moment she found out his wishes vanished into the forest and returned in two days saying that she had found the fugitives but she would not show him where they were unless he promised not to kill them he of course had no mind for so rigorous a method he both needed the men and he had no malice against themfor the one ebsworthy was a plain honest happygolucky sailor and as good a hand as there was in the crew and the other was that same neerdoweel will parracombe his old schoolfellow who had been tempted by the gipsyjesuit at appledore and resisting that bait had made a very fair seaman  so forth amyas went with ayacanora as a guide some five miles upward along the forest slopes till the girl whispered there they are and amyas pushing himself gently through a thicket of bamboo beheld a scene which in spite of his wrath kept him silent and perhaps softened for a minute  on the farther side of a little lawn the stream leapt through a chasm beneath overarching vines sprinkling eternal freshness upon all around and then sank foaming into a clear rockbasin a bath for dians self on its farther side the crag rose some twenty feet in height bank upon bank of feathered ferns and cushioned moss over the rich green beds of which drooped a thousand orchids scarlet white and orange and made the still pool gorgeous with the reflection of their gorgeousness at its more quiet outfall it was halfhidden in huge fantastic leaves and tall flowering stems but near the waterfall the grassy bank sloped down toward the stream and there on palmleaves strewed upon the turf beneath the shadow of the crags lay the two men whom amyas sought and whom now he had found them he had hardly heart to wake from their delicious dream  for what a nest it was which they had found the air was heavy with the scent of flowers and quivering with the murmur of the stream the humming of the colibris and insects the cheerful song of birds the gentle cooing of a hundred doves while now and then from far away the musical wail of the sloth or the deep toll of the bellbird came softly to the ear what was not there which eye or ear could need and what which palate could need either for on the rock above some strange tree leaning forward dropped every now and then a luscious apple upon the grass below and huge wild plantains bent beneath their load of fruit  there on the stream bank lay the two renegades from civilized life they had cast away their clothes and painted themselves like the indians with arnotto and indigo one lay lazily picking up the fruit which fell close to his side the other sat his back against a cushion of soft moss his hands folded languidly upon his lap giving himself up to the soft influence of the narcotic cocajuice with halfshut dreamy eyes fixed on the everlasting sparkle of the waterfall       while beauty born of murmuring sound      did pass into his face  somewhat apart crouched their two dusky brides crowned with fragrant flowers but working busily like true women for the lords whom they delighted to honor one sat plaiting palm fibres into a basket the other was boring the stem of a huge milktree which rose like some mighty column on the right hand of the lawn its broad canopy of leaves unseen through the dense underwood of laurel and bamboo and betokened only by the rustle far aloft and by the mellow shade in which it bathed the whole delicious scene  amyas stood silent for awhile partly from noble shame at seeing two christian men thus fallen of their own selfwill partly becauseand he could not but confess thata solemn calm brooded above that glorious place to break through which seemed sacrilege even while he felt it a duty such he thought was paradise of old such our first parents bridal bower ah if man had not fallen he too might have dwelt forever in such a homewith whom he started and shaking off the spell advanced sword in hand  the women saw him and springing to their feet caught up their long pocunas and leapt like deer each in front of her beloved there they stood the deadly tubes pressed to their lips eyeing him like tigresses who protect their young while every slender limb quivered not with terror but with rage  amyas paused half in admiration half in prudence for one rash step was death but rushing through the canes ayacanora sprang to the front and shrieked to them in indian at the sight of the prophetess the women wavered and amyas putting on as gentle a face as he could stepped forward assuring them in his best indian that he would harm no one  ebsworthy parracombe are you grown such savages already that you have forgotten your captain stand up men and salute  ebsworthy sprang to his feet obeyed mechanically and then slipped behind his bride again as if in shame the dreamer turned his head languidly raised his hand to his forehead and then returned to his contemplation  amyas rested the point of his sword on the ground and his hands upon the hilt and looked sadly and solemnly upon the pair ebsworthy broke the silence half reproachfully half trying to bluster away the coming storm  well noble captain so youve hunted out us poor fellows and want to drag us back again in a halter i suppose  i came to look for christians and i find heathens for men and i find swine i shall leave the heathens to their wilderness and the swine to their trough parracombe  hes too happy to answer you sir and why not what do you want of us our two years vow is out and we are free men now  free to become like the beasts that perish you are the queens servants still and in her name i charge you  free to be happy interrupted the man with the best of wives the best of food a warmer bed than a dukes and a finer garden than an emperors as for clothes why the plague should a man wear them where he dont need them as for gold whats the use of it where heaven sends everything readymade to your hands hearken captain leigh youve been a good captain to me and ill repay you with a bit of sound advice give up your goldhunting and toiling and moiling after honor and glory and copy us take that fair maid behind you there to wife pitch here with us and see if you are not happier in one day than ever you were in all your life before  you are drunk sirrah william parracombe will you speak to me or shall i heave you into the stream to sober you  who calls william parracombe answered a sleepy voice  i foolyour captain  i am not william parracombe he is dead long ago of hunger and labor and heavy sorrow and will never see bideford town any more he is turned into an indian now and he is to sleep sleep sleep for a hundred years till he gets his strength again poor fellow  awake then thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light a christened englishman and living thus the life of a beast  christ shall give thee light answered the same unnatural abstracted voice yes so the parsons say and they say too that he is lord of heaven and earth i should have thought his light was as near us here as anywhere and nearer too by the look of the place look round said he waving a lazy hand and see the works of god and the place of paradise whither poor weary souls go home and rest after their masters in the wicked world have used them up with labor and sorrow and made them wade kneedeep in bloodim tired of blood and tired of gold ill march no more ill fight no more ill hunger no more after vanity and vexation of spirit what shall i get by it maybe i shall leave my bones in the wilderness i can but do that here maybe i shall get home with a few pezos to die an old cripple in some stinking hovel that a monkey would scorn to lodge in here you may go on itll pay you you may be a rich man and a knight and live in a fine house and drink good wine and go to court and torment your soul with trying to get more when youve got too much already plotting and planning to scramble upon your neighbors shoulders as they all didsir richard and mr raleigh and chichester and poor dear old sir warham and all of them that i used to watch when i lived before they were no happier than i was then ill warrant they are no happier now go your ways captain climb to glory upon some other backs than ours and leave us here in peace alone with god and gods woods and the good wives that god has given us to play a little like school children its long since ive had playhours and now ill be a little child once more with the flowers and the singing birds and the silver fishes in the stream that are at peace and think no harm and want neither clothes nor money nor knighthood nor peerage but just take what comes and their heavenly father feedeth them and solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of theseand will he not much more feed us that are of more value than many sparrows  and will you live here shut out from all christian ordinances  christian ordinances adam and eve had no parsons in paradise the lord was their priest and the lord was their shepherd and hell be ours too but go your ways sir and send up sir john brimblecombe and let him marry us here church fashion though we have sworn troth to each other before god already and let him give us the holy sacrament once and for all and then read the funeral service over us and go his ways and count us for dead sirfor dead we are to the wicked worthless world we came out of three years ago and when the lord chooses to call us the little birds will cover us with leaves as they did the babies in the wood and fresher flowers will grow out of our graves sir than out of yours in that bare northam churchyard there beyond the weary weary weary sea  his voice died away to a murmur and his head sank on his breast  amyas stood spellbound the effect of the narcotic was all but miraculous in his eyes the sustained eloquence the novel richness of diction in one seemingly drowned in sensual sloth were in his eyes the possession of some evil spirit and yet he could not answer the evil one his english heart full of the divine instinct of duty and public spirit told him that it must be a lie but how to prove it a lie and he stood for full ten minutes searching for an answer which seemed to fly farther and farther off the more he sought for it  his eye glanced upon ayacanora the two girls were whispering to her smilingly he saw one of them glance a look toward him and then say something which raised a beautiful blush in the maidens face with a playful blow at the speaker she turned away amyas knew instinctively that they were giving her the same advice as ebsworthy had given to him oh how beautiful she was might not the renegades have some reason on their side after all  he shuddered at the thought but he could not shake it off it glided in like some gaudy snake and wreathed its coils round all his heart and brain he drew back to the other side of the lawn and thought and thought  should he ever get home if he did might he not get home a beggar beggar or rich he would still have to face his mother to go through that meeting to tell that tale perhaps to hear those reproaches the forecast of which had weighed on him like a dark thundercloud for two weary years to wipe out which by some desperate deed of glory he had wandered the wilderness and wandered in vain  could he not settle here he need not be a savage he and his might christianize civilize teach equal law mercy in war chivalry to women found a community which might be hereafter as strong a barrier against the encroachments of the spaniard as manoa itself would have been who knew the wealth of the surrounding forests even if there were no gold there were boundless vegetable treasures what might he not export down the rivers this might be the nucleus of a great commercial settlement  and yet was even that worth while to settle here only to torment his soul with fresh schemes fresh ambitions not to rest but only to change one labor for another was not your dreamer right did they not all need rest what if they each sat down among the flowers beside an indian bride they might live like christians while they lived like the birds of heaven  what a dead silence he looked up and round the birds had ceased to chirp the parroquets were hiding behind the leaves the monkeys were clustered motionless upon the highest twigs only out of the far depths of the forest the campanero gave its solemn toll once twice thrice like a great deathknell rolling down from far cathedral towers was it an omen he looked up hastily at ayacanora she was watching him earnestly heavens was she waiting for his decision both dropped their eyes the decision was not to come from them  a rustle a roar a shriek and amyas lifted his eyes in time to see a huge dark bar shoot from the crag above the dreamers head among the group of girls  a dull crash as the group flew asunder and in the midst upon the ground the tawny limbs of one were writhing beneath the fangs of a black jaguar the rarest and most terrible of the forest kings of one but of which was it ayacanora and sword in hand amyas rushed madly forward before he reached the spot those tortured limbs were still  it was not ayacanora for with a shriek which rang through the woods the wretched dreamer wakened thus at last sprang up and felt for his sword fool he had left it in his hammock screaming the name of his dead bride he rushed on the jaguar as it crouched above its prey and seizing its head with teeth and nails worried it in the ferocity of his madness like a mastiffdog  the brute wrenched its head from his grasp and raised its dreadful paw another moment and the husbands corpse would have lain by the wifes  but high in air gleamed amyass blade down with all the weight of his huge body and strong arm fell that most trusty steel the head of the jaguar dropped grinning on its victims corpse       and all stood still who saw him fall      while men might count a score  o lord jesus said amyas to himself thou hast answered the devil for me and this is the selfish rest for which i would have bartered the rest which comes by working where thou hast put me  they bore away the lithe corpse into the forest and buried it under soft moss and virgin mould and so the fair clay was transfigured into fairer flowers and the poor gentle untaught spirit returned to god who gave it  and then amyas went sadly and silently back again and parracombe walked after him like one who walks in sleep  ebsworthy sobered by the shock entreated to come too but amyas forbade him gently  no lad you are forgiven god forbid that i should judge you or any man sir john shall come up and marry you and then if it still be your will to stay the lord forgive you if you be wrong in the meanwhile we will leave with you all that we can spare stay here and pray to god to make you and me too wiser men  and so amyas departed he had come out stern and proud but he came back again like a little child  three days after parracombe was dead once in camp he seemed unable to eat or move and having received absolution and communion from good sir john faded away without disease or pain babbling of green fields and murmuring the name of his lost indian bride  amyas too sought ghostly council of sir john and told him all which had passed through his mind  it was indeed a temptation of diabolus said that simple sage for he is by his very name the divider who sets man against man and tempts one to care only for oneself and forget kin and country and duty and queen but you have resisted him captain leigh like a trueborn englishman as you always are and he has fled from you but that is no reason why we should not flee from him too and so i think the sooner we are out of this place and at work again the better for all our souls  to which amyas most devoutly said amen if ayacanora were the daughter of ten thousand incas he must get out of her way as soon as possible  the next day he announced his intention to march once more and to his delight found the men ready enough to move towards the spanish settlements one thing they needed gunpowder for their muskets but that they must make as they went along that is if they could get the materials charcoal they could procure enough to set the world on fire but nitre they had not yet seen perhaps they should find it among the hills while as for sulphur any brave man could get that where there were volcanoes who had not heard how one of cortez spaniards in like need was lowered in a basket down the smoking crater of popocatepetl till he had gathered sulphur enough to conquer an empire and what a spaniard could do an englishman could do or they would know the reason why and if they found nonewhy clothyard arrows had done englishmens work many a time already and they could do it again not to mention those same blowguns and their arrows of curare poison which though they might be useless against spaniards armor were far more valuable than muskets for procuring food from the simple fact of their silence  one thing remained to invite their indian friends to join them and that was done in due form the next day  ayacanora was consulted of course and by the piache too who was glad enough to be rid of the rival preacher and his unpleasantly good news that men need not worship the devil because there was a good god above them the maiden sang most melodious assent the whole tribe echoed it and all went smoothly enough till the old cacique observed that before starting a compact should be made between the allies as to their share of the booty  nothing could be more reasonable and amyas asked him to name his terms  you take the gold and we will take the prisoners  and what will you do with them asked amyas who recollected poor john oxenhams hapless compact made in like case  eat them quoth the cacique innocently enough  amyas whistled  humph said cary the old proverb comes truethe more the merrier but the fewer the better fare i think we will do without our red friends for this time  ayacanora who had been preaching war like a very boadicea was much vexed  do you too want to dine off roast spaniards asked amyas  she shook her head and denied the imputation with much disgust  amyas was relieved he had shrunk from joining the thought of so fair a creature however degraded with the horrors of cannibalism  but the cacique was a man of business and held out stanchly  is it fair he asked the white man loves gold and he gets it the poor indian what use is gold to him he only wants something to eat and he must eat his enemies what else will pay him for going so far through the forests hungry and thirsty you will get all and the omaguas will get nothing  the argument was unanswerable and the next day they started without the indians while john brimblecombe heaved many an honest sigh at leaving them to darkness the devil and the holy trumpet  and ayacanora  when their departure was determined she shut herself up in her hut and appeared no more great was the weeping howling and leavetaking on the part of the simple indians and loud the entreaties to come again bring them a message from amalivacas daughter beyond the seas and help them to recover their lost land of papamene but ayacanora took no part in them and amyas left her wondering at her absence but joyful and lighthearted at having escaped the rocks of the sirens and being at work once more    chapter xxv  how they took the goldtrain       god will relent and quit thee all thy debt      who ever more approves and more accepts      him who imploring mercy sues for life      than who selfrigorous chooses death as due      which argues overjust and selfdispleased      for selfoffence more than for god offended                                 samson agonistes  a fortnight or more has passed in severe toil but not more severe than they have endured many a time before bidding farewell once and forever to the green ocean of the eastern plains they have crossed the cordillera they have taken a longing glance at the city of santa fe lying in the midst of rich gardens on its lofty mountain plateau and have seen as was to be expected that it was far too large a place for any attempt of theirs but they have not altogether thrown away their time their indian lad has discovered that a goldtrain is going down from santa fe toward the magdalena and they are waiting for it beside the miserable rut which serves for a road encamped in a forest of oaks which would make them almost fancy themselves back again in europe were it not for the treeferns which form the undergrowth and were it not too for the deep gorges opening at their very feet in which while their brows are swept by the cool breezes of a temperate zone they can see far below dim through their everlasting vaporbath of rank hot steam the mighty forms and gorgeous colors of the tropic forest  they have pitched their camp among the treeferns above a spot where the path winds along a steep hillside with a sheer cliff below of many a hundred feet there was a road there once perhaps when cundinamarca was a civilized and cultivated kingdom but all which spanish misrule has left of it are a few steps slipping from their places at the bottom of a narrow ditch of mud it has gone the way of the aqueducts and bridges and posthouses the gardens and the llamaflocks of that strange empire in the mad search for gold every art of civilization has fallen to decay save architecture alone and that survives only in the splendid cathedrals which have risen upon the ruins of the temples of the sun in honor of a milder pantheon if indeed that can be called a milder one which demands as we have seen already human sacrifices unknown to the gentle natureworship of the incas  and now the rapid tropic vegetation has reclaimed its old domains and amyas and his crew are as utterly alone within a few miles of an important spanish settlement as they would be in the solitudes of the orinoco or the amazon  in the meanwhile all their attempts to find sulphur and nitre have been unavailing and they have been forced to depend after all much to yeos disgust upon their swords and arrows be it so drake took nombre de dios and the goldtrain there with no better weapons and they may do as much  so having blocked up the road above by felling a large tree across it they sit there among the flowers chewing coca in default of food and drink and meditating among themselves the cause of a mysterious roar which has been heard nightly in their wake ever since they left the banks of the meta jaguar it is not nor monkey it is unlike any sound they know and why should it follow them however they are in the land of wonders and moreover the gold train is far more important than any noise  at last up from beneath there was a sharp crack and a loud cry the crack was neither the snapping of a branch nor the tapping of a woodpecker the cry was neither the scream of the parrot nor the howl of the monkey  that was a whips crack said yeo and a womans wail they are close here lads  a womans do they drive women in their gangs asked amyas  why not the brutes there they are sir did you see their basnets glitter  men said amyas in a low voice i trust you all not to shoot till i do then give them one arrow out swords and at them pass the word along  up they came slowly and all hearts beat loud at their coming  first about twenty soldiers only onehalf of whom were on foot the other half being borne incredible as it may seem each in a chair on the back of a single indian while those who marched had consigned their heaviest armor and their arquebuses into the hands of attendant slaves who were each pricked on at will by the pike of the soldier behind them  the men are mad to let their ordnance out of their hands  oh sir an indian will pray to an arquebus not to shoot him he sure their artillery is safe enough said yeo  look at the proud villains whispered another to make dumb beasts of human creatures like that  ten shot counted the businesslike amyas and ten pikes will can tackle them up above  last of this troop came some inferior officer also in his chair who as he went slowly up the hill with his face turned toward the gang which followed drew every other second the cigar from his lips to inspirit them with those pious ejaculations to the various objects of his worship divine human anatomic wooden and textile which earned for the pious spaniards of the sixteenth century the uncharitable imputation of being at once the most fetishridden idolaters and the most abominable swearers of all europeans  the blasphemous dog said yeo fumbling at his bowstring as if he longed to send an arrow through him but amyas had hardly laid his finger on the impatient veterans arm when another procession followed which made them forget all else  a sad and hideous sight it was yet one too common even then in those remoter districts where the humane edicts were disregarded which the prayers of dominican friars to their everlasting honor be it spoken had wrung from the spanish sovereigns and which the legislation of that most wise virtuous and heroic inquisitor paradoxical as the words may seem pedro de la gasca had carried into effect in perufutile and tardy alleviations of cruelties and miseries unexampled in the history of christendom or perhaps on earth save in the conquests of sennacherib and zingis khan but on the frontiers where negroes were imported to endure the toil which was found fatal to the indian and all indian tribes convicted or suspected of cannibalism were hunted down for the salvation of their souls and the enslavement of their bodies such scenes as these were still too common and indeed if we are to judge from humboldts impartial account were not very much amended even at the close of the last century in those muchboasted jesuit missions in which as many of them as existed anywhere but on paper military tyranny was superadded to monastic and the gospel preached with fire and sword almost as shamelessly as by the first conquistadores  a line of indians negroes and zambos naked emaciated scarred with whips and fetters and chained together by their left wrists toiled upwards panting and perspiring under the burden of a basket held up by a strap which passed across their foreheads yeos sneer was but too just there were not only old men and youths among them but women slender young girls mothers with children running at their knee and at the sight a low murmur of indignation rose from the ambushed englishmen worthy of the free and righteous hearts of those days when raleigh could appeal to man and god on the ground of a common humanity in behalf of the outraged heathens of the new world when englishmen still knew that man was man and that the instinct of freedom was the righteous voice of god ere the hapless seventeenth century had brutalized them also by bestowing on them amid a hundred other bad legacies the fatal gift of negroslaves  but the first forty so amyas counted bore on their backs a burden which made all perhaps but him and yeo forget even the wretches who bore it each basket contained a square package of carefully corded hide the look whereof friend amyas knew full well  whats in they captain  gold and at that magic word all eyes were strained greedily forward and such a rustle followed that amyas in the very face of detection had to whisper  be men be men or you will spoil all yet  the last twenty or so of the indians bore larger baskets but more lightly freighted seemingly with manioc and maizebread and other food for the party and after them came with their bearers and attendants just twenty soldiers more followed by the officer in charge who smiled away in his chair and twirled two huge mustachios thinking of nothing less than of the english arrows which were itching to be away and through his ribs the ambush was complete the only question how and when to begin  amyas had a shrinking which all will understand from drawing bow in cool blood on men so utterly unsuspicious and defenceless even though in the very act of devilish crueltyfor devilish cruelty it was as three or four drivers armed with whips lingered up and down the slowly staggering file of indians and avenged every moments lagging even every stumble by a blow of the cruel manatihide which cracked like a pistolshot against the naked limbs of the silent and uncomplaining victim  suddenly the casus belli as usually happens arose of its own accord  the last but one of the chained line was an old grayheaded man followed by a slender graceful girl of some eighteen years old and amyass heart yearned over them as they came up just as they passed the foremost of the file had rounded the corner above there was a bustle and a voice shouted halt senors there is a tree across the path  a tree across the path bellowed the officer with a variety of passionate addresses to the mother of heaven the fiends of hell saint jago of compostella and various other personages while the line of trembling indians told to halt above and driven on by blows below surged up and down upon the ruinous steps of the indian road until the poor old man fell grovelling on his face  the officer leaped down and hurried upward to see what had happened of course he came across the old man  sin peccado concebida grandfather of beelzebub is this a place to lie worshipping your fiends and he pricked the prostrate wretch with the point of his sword  the old man tried to rise but the weight on his head was too much for him he fell again and lay motionless  the driver applied the manatihide across his loins once twice with fearful force but even that specific was useless  gastado senor capitan said he with a shrug used up he has been failing these three months  what does the intendant mean by sending me out with wornout cattle like these forward there shouted he clear away the tree senors and ill soon clear the chain hold it up pedrillo  the driver held up the chain which was fastened to the old mans wrist the officer stepped back and flourished round his head a toledo blade whose beauty made amyas break the tenth commandment on the spot  the man was a tall handsome broadshouldered highbred man and amyas thought that he was going to display the strength of his arm and the temper of his blade in severing the chain at one stroke  even he was not prepared for the recondite fancies of a spanish adventurer worthy son or nephew of those first conquerors who used to try the keenness of their swords upon the living bodies of indians and regale themselves at meals with the odor of roasting caciques  the blade gleamed in the air once twice and fell not on the chain but on the wrist which it fettered there was a shrieka crimson flashand the chain and its prisoner were parted indeed  one moment more and amyass arrow would have been through the throat of the murderer who paused regarding his workmanship with a satisfied smile but vengeance was not to come from him  quick and fierce as a tigercat the girl sprang on the ruffian and with the intense strength of passion clasped him in her arms and leaped with him from the narrow ledge into the abyss below  there was a rush a shout all faces were bent over the precipice the girl hung by her chained wrist the officer was gone there was a moments awful silence and then amyas heard his body crashing through the treetops far below  haul her up hew her in pieces burn the witch and the driver seizing the chain pulled at it with all his might while all springing from their chairs stooped over the brink  now was the time for amyas heaven had delivered them into his hands swift and sure at ten yards off his arrow rushed through the body of the driver and then with a roar as of the leaping lion he sprang like an avenging angel into the midst of the astonished ruffians  his first thought was for the girl in a moment by sheer strength he had jerked her safely up into the road while the spaniards recoiled right and left fancying him for the moment some mountain giant or supernatural foe his hurrah undeceived them in an instant and a cry of english lutheran dogs arose but arose too late the men of devon had followed their captains lead a storm of arrows left five spaniards dead and a dozen more wounded and down leapt salvation yeo his white hair streaming behind him with twenty good swords more and the work of death began  the spaniards fought like lions but they had no time to fix their arquebuses on the crutches no room in that narrow path to use their pikes the english had the wall of them and to have the wall there was to have the foes life at their mercy five desperate minutes and not a living spaniard stood upon those steps and certainly no living one lay in the green abyss below two only who were behind the rest happening to be in full armor escaped without mortal wound and fled down the hill again  after them michael evans and simon heard and catch them if they run a league  the two long and lean clovelly men active as deer from forest training ran two feet for the spaniards one and in ten minutes returned having done their work while amyas and his men hurried past the indians to help cary and the party forward where shouts and musket shots announced a sharp affray  their arrival settled the matter all the spaniards fell but three or four who scrambled down the crannies of the cliff  let not one of them escape slay them as israel slew amalek cried yeo as he bent over and ere the wretches could reach a place of shelter an arrow was quivering in each body as it rolled lifeless down the rocks  now then loose the indians  they found armorers tools on one of the dead bodies and it was done  we are your friends said amyas all we ask is that you shall help us to carry this gold down to the magdalena and then you are free  some few of the younger grovelled at his knees and kissed his feet hailing him as the child of the sun but the most part kept a stolid indifference and when freed from their fetters sat quietly down where they stood staring into vacancy the iron had entered too deeply into their soul they seemed past hope enjoyment even understanding  but the young girl who was last of all in the line as soon as she was loosed sprang to her fathers body speaking no word lifted it in her thin arms laid it across her knees kissed the fallen lips stroked the furrowed cheeks murmured inarticulate sounds like the cooing of a woodland dove of which none knew the meaning but she and he who heard not for his soul had long since fled suddenly the truth flashed on her silent as ever she drew one long heaving breath and rose erect the body in her arms  another moment and she had leaped into the abyss  they watched her dark and slender limbs twined closely round the old mans corpse turn over and over and over till a crash among the leaves and a scream among the birds told that she had reached the trees and the green roof hid her from their view  brave lass shouted a sailor  the lord forgive her said yeo but your worship we must have these rascals ordnance  and their clothes too yeo if we wish to get down the magdalena unchallenged now listen my masters all we have won by gods good grace gold enough to serve us the rest of our lives and that without losing a single man and may yet win more if we be wise and he thinks good but oh my friends remember mr oxenham and his crew and do not make gods gift our ruin by faithlessness or greediness or any mutinous haste  you shall find none in us cried several men we know your worship we can trust our general  thank god said amyas now then it will be no shame or sin to make the indians carry it saving the women whom god forbid we should burden but we must pass through the very heart of the spanish settlements and by the town of saint martha itself so the clothes and weapons of these spaniards we must have let it cost us what labor it may how many lie in the road  thirteen here and about ten up above said cary  then there are near twenty missing who will volunteer to go down over cliff and bring up the spoil of them  i and i and i and a dozen stepped out as they did always when amyas wanted anything done for the simple reason that they knew that he meant to help at the doing of it himself  very well then follow me sir john take the indian lad for your interpreter and try and comfort the souls of these poor heathens tell them that they shall all be free  why who is that comes up the road  all eyes were turned in the direction of which he spoke and wonder of wonders up came none other than ayacanora herself blowgun in hand bow on back and bedecked in all her feather garments which last were rather the worse for a fortnights woodland travel  all stood mute with astonishment as seeing amyas she uttered a cry of joy quickened her pace into a run and at last fell panting and exhausted at his feet  i have found you she said you ran away from me but you could not escape me and she fawned round amyas like a dog who has found his master and then sat down on the bank and burst into wild sobs  god help us said amyas clutching his hair as he looked down upon the beautiful weeper what am i to do with her over and above all these poor heathens  but there was no time to be lost and over the cliff he scrambled while the girl seeing that the main body of the english remained sat down on a point of rock to watch him  after halfanhours hard work the weapons clothes and armor of the fallen spaniards were hauled up the cliff and distributed in bundles among the men the rest of the corpses were thrown over the precipice and they started again upon their road toward the magdalena while yeo snorted like a warhorse who smells the battle at the delight of once more handling powder and ball  we can face the world now sir why not go back and try santa fe after all  but amyas thought that enough was as good as a feast and they held on downwards while the slaves followed without a sign of gratitude but meekly obedient to their new masters and testifying now and then by a sign or a grunt their surprise at not being beaten or made to carry their captors some however caught sight of the little calabashes of coca which the english carried that woke them from their torpor and they began coaxing abjectly and not in vain for a taste of that miraculous herb which would not only make food unnecessary and enable their panting lungs to endure that keen mountain air but would rid them for awhile at least of the fallen indians most unpitying foe the malady of thought  as the cavalcade turned the corner of the mountain they paused for one last look at the scene of that fearful triumph lines of vultures were already streaming out of infinite space as if created suddenly for the occasion a few hours and there would be no trace of that fierce fray but a few white bones amid untrodden beds of flowers  and now amyas had time to ask ayacanora the meaning of this her strange appearance he wished her anywhere but where she was but now that she was here what heart could be so hard as not to take pity on the poor wild thing and amyas as he spoke to her had perhaps a tenderness in his tone from very fear of hurting her which he had never used before passionately she told him how she had followed on their track day and night and had every evening made sounds as loud as she dared in hopes of their hearing her and either waiting for her or coming back to see what caused the noise  amyas now recollected the strange roaring which had followed them  noises what did you make them with  ayacanora lifted her finger with an air of most selfsatisfied mystery and then drew cautiously from under her feather cloak an object at which amyas had hard work to keep his countenance  look whispered she as if half afraid that the thing itself should hear her i have itthe holy trumpet  there it was verily that mysterious bone of contention a handsome earthen tube some two feet long neatly glazed and painted with quaint grecques and figures of animals a relic evidently of some civilization now extinct  brimblecombe rubbed his little fat hands brave maid you have cheated satan this time quoth he while yeo advised that the idolatrous relic should be forthwith hove over cliff  let be said amyas what is the meaning of this ayacanora and why have you followed us  she told a long story from which amyas picked up as far as he could understand her that that trumpet had been for years the torment of her life the one thing in the tribe superior to her the one thing which she was not allowed to see because forsooth she was a woman so she determined to show them that a woman was as good as a man and hence her hatred of marriage and her amazonian exploits but still the piache would not show her that trumpet or tell her where it was and as for going to seek it even she feared the superstitious wrath of the tribe at such a profanation but the day after the english went the piache chose to express his joy at their departure whereon as was to be expected a fresh explosion between master and pupil which ended she confessed in her burning the old rogues hut over his head from which he escaped with loss of all his conjuringtackle and fled raging into the woods vowing that he would carry off the trumpet to the neighboring tribe whereon by a sudden impulse the young lady took plenty of coca her weapons and her feathers started on his trail and ran him to earth just as he was unveiling the precious mystery at which sight she confessed she was horribly afraid and half inclined to run but gathering courage from the thought that the white men used to laugh at the whole matter she rushed upon the hapless conjuror and bore off her prize in triumph and there it was  i hope you have not killed him said amyas  i did beat him a little but i thought you would not let me kill him  amyas was half amused with her confession of his authority over her but she went on  and then i dare not go back to the indians so i was forced to come after you  and is that then your only reason for coming after us asked stupid amyas  he had touched some secret chordthough what it was he was too busy to inquire the girl drew herself up proudly blushing scarlet and said  you never tell lies do you think that i would tell lies  on which she fell to the rear and followed them steadfastly speaking to no one but evidently determined to follow them to the worlds end  they soon left the highroad and for several days held on downwards hewing their path slowly and painfully through the thick underwood on the evening of the fourth day they had reached the margin of a river at a point where it seemed broad and still enough for navigation for those three days they had not seen a trace of human beings and the spot seemed lonely enough for them to encamp without fear of discovery and begin the making of their canoes they began to spread themselves along the stream in search of the softwooded trees proper for their purpose but hardly had their search begun when in the midst of a dense thicket they came upon a sight which filled them with astonishment beneath a honeycombed cliff which supported one enormous cottontree was a spot of some thirty yards square sloping down to the stream planted in rows with magnificent bananaplants full twelve feet high and bearing among their huge waxy leaves clusters of ripening fruit while under their mellow shade yams and cassava plants were flourishing luxuriantly the whole being surrounded by a hedge of orange and scarlet flowers there it lay streaked with long shadows from the setting sun while a cool southern air rustled in the cottontree and flapped to and fro the great bananaleaves a tiny paradise of art and care but where was its inhabitant  aroused by the noise of their approach a figure issued from a cave in the rocks and after gazing at them for a moment came down the garden towards them he was a tall and stately old man whose snowwhite beard and hair covered his chest and shoulders while his lower limbs were wrapt in indianweb slowly and solemnly he approached a staff in one hand a string of beads in the other the living likeness of some old hebrew prophet or anchorite of ancient legend he bowed courteously to amyas who of course returned his salute and was in act to speak when his eye fell upon the indians who were laying down their burdens in a heap under the trees his mild countenance assumed instantly an expression of the acutest sorrow and displeasure and striking his hands together he spoke in spanish  alas miserable me alas unhappy senors do my old eyes deceive me and is it one of those evil visions of the past which haunt my dreams by night or has the accursed thirst of gold the ruin of my race penetrated even into this my solitude oh senors senors know you not that you bear with you your own poison your own familiar fiend the root of every evil and is it not enough for you senors to load yourselves with the wedge of achan and partake his doom but you must make these hapless heathens the victims of your greed and cruelty and forestall for them on earth those torments which may await their unbaptized souls hereafter  we have preserved and not enslaved these indians ancient senor said amyas proudly and tomorrow will see them as free as the birds over our heads  free then you cannot be countrymen of mine but pardon an old man my son if he has spoken too hastily in the bitterness of his own experience but who and whence are you and why are you bringing into this lonely wilderness that goldfor i know too well the shape of those accursed packets which would god that i had never seen  what we are reverend sir matters little as long as we behave to you as the young should to the old as for our gold it will be a curse or a blessing to us i conceive just as we use it well or ill and so is a mans head or his hand or any other thing but that is no reason for cutting off his limbs for fear of doing harm with them neither is it for throwing away those packages which by your leave we shall deposit in one of these caves we must be your neighbors i fear for a day or two but i can promise you that your garden shall be respected on condition that you do not inform any human soul of our being here  god forbid senor that i should try to increase the number of my visitors much less to bring hither strife and blood of which i have seen too much already as you have come in peace in peace depart leave me alone with god and my penitence and may the lord have mercy on you  and he was about to withdraw when recollecting himself he turned suddenly to amyas again  pardon me senor if after forty years of utter solitude i shrink at first from the conversation of human beings and forget in the habitual shyness of a recluse the duties of a hospitable gentleman of spain my garden and all which it produces is at your service only let me entreat that these poor indians shall have their share for heathens though they be christ died for them and i cannot but cherish in my soul some secret hope that he did not die in vain  god forbid said brimblecombe they are no worse than we for aught i see whatsoever their fathers may have been and they have fared no worse than we since they have been with us nor will i promise you  the good fellow did not tell that he had been starving himself for the last three days to cram the children with his own rations and that the sailors and even amyas had been going out of their way every five minutes to get fruit for their new pets  a camp was soon formed and that evening the old hermit asked amyas cary and brimblecombe to come up into his cavern  they went and after the accustomed compliments had passed sat down on mats upon the ground while the old man stood leaning against a slab of stone surmounted by a rude wooden cross which evidently served him as a place of prayer he seemed restless and anxious as if he waited for them to begin the conversation while they in their turn waited for him at last when courtesy would not allow him to be silent any longer he began with a faltering voice  you may be equally surprised senors at my presence in such a spot and at my asking you to become my guests even for one evening while i have no better hospitality to offer you  it is superfluous senor to offer us food in your own habitation when you have already put all that you possess at our command  true senors and my motive for inviting you was perhaps somewhat of a selfish one i am possessed by a longing to unburthen my heart of a tale which i never yet told to man and which i fear can give to you nothing but pain and yet i will entreat you of your courtesy to hear of that which you cannot amend simply in mercy to a man who feels that he must confess to some one or die as miserable as he has lived and i believe my confidence will not be misplaced when it is bestowed upon you i have been a cavalier even as you are and strange as it may seem that which i have to tell i would sooner impart to the ears of a soldier than of a priest because it will then sink into souls which can at least sympathize though they cannot absolve and you cavaliers i perceive to be noble from your very looks to be valiant by your mere presence in this hostile land and to be gentle courteous and prudent by your conduct this day to me and to your captives will you then hear an old mans tale i am as you see full of words for speech from long disuse is difficult to me and i fear at every sentence lest my stiffened tongue should play the traitor to my wornout brain but if my request seems impertinent you have only to bid me talk as a host should of matters which concern his guests and not himself  the three young men equally surprised and interested by this exordium could only entreat their host to use their ears as those of his slaves on which after fresh apologies he began  know then victorious cavaliers that i whom you now see here as a poor hermit was formerly one of the foremost of that terrible band who went with pizarro to the conquest of peru eighty years old am i this day unless the calendar which i have carved upon yonder tree deceives me and twenty years old was i when i sailed with that fierce man from panama to do that deed with which all earth and heaven and hell itself i fear has rung how we endured suffered and triumphed how mad with success and glutted with blood we turned our swords against each other i need not tell to you for what gentleman of europe knows not our glory and our shame  his hearers bowed assent  yes you have heard of our prowess for glorious we were awhile in the sight of god and man but i will not speak of our glory for it is tarnished nor of our wealth for it was our poison nor of the sins of my comrades for they have expiated them but of my own sins senors which are more in number than the hairs of my head and a burden too great to bear miserere domine  and smiting on his breast the old warrior went on  as i said we were mad with blood and none more mad than i surely it is no fable that men are possessed even in this latter age by devils why else did i rejoice in slaying why else was i the son of a noble and truthful cavalier of castile among the foremost to urge upon my general the murder of the inca why did i rejoice over his dying agonies why when don ferdinando de soto returned and upbraided us with our villainy did i instead of confessing the sin which that noble cavalier set before us withstand him to his face ay and would have drawn the sword on him but that he refused to fight a liar as he said that i was  then don de soto was against the murder so his own grandson told me but i had heard of him only as a tyrant and a butcher  senor he was compact of good and evil as are other men he has paid dearly for his sin let us hope that he has been paid in turn for his righteousness  john brimblecombe shook his head at this doctrine but did not speak  so you know his grandson i trust he is a noble cavalier  amyas was silent the old gentleman saw that he had touched some sore point and continued  and why again senors did i after that day give myself up to cruelty as to a sport yea thought that i did god service by destroying the creatures whom he had made i who now dare not destroy a gnat lest i harm a being more righteous than myself was i mad if i was how then was i all that while as prudent as i am this day but i am not here to argue senors but to confess in a word there was no deed of blood done for the next few years in which i had not my share if it were but within my reach when challcuchima was burned i was consenting when that fair girl the wife of inca manco was tortured to death i smiled at the agonies at which she too smiled and taunted on the soldiers to try if i could wring one groan from her before she died you know what followed the pillage the violence the indignities offered to the virgins of the sun senors i will not pollute your chaste ears with what was done but senors i had a brother  and the old man paused awhile  a brotherwhether better or worse than me god knows before whom he has appeared ere now at least he did not as i did end as a rebel to his king there was a maiden in one of those convents senors more beautiful than day and i blush to tell it the two brothers of whom i spoke quarrelled for the possession of her they struck each other senors who struck first i know not but swords were drawn andthe cavaliers round parted them crying shame and one of those two brothersthe one who speaks to you nowcrying if i cannot have her no man shall turned the sword which was aimed at his brother against that hapless maidenandhear me out senors before you flee from my presence as from that of a monsterstabbed her to the heart and as she diedone moment more senors that i may confess allshe looked up in my face with a smile as of heaven and thanked me for having rid her once and for all from christians and their villainy  the old man paused  god forgive you senor said jack brimblecombe softly  you do not then turn from me do not curse me then i will try you farther still senors i will know from human lips whether man can do such deeds as i have done and yet be pitied by his kind that so i may have some hope that where man has mercy god may have mercy also do you think that i repented at those awful words nothing less senors all no more than i did when de soto on whose soul god have mercy called meme a liar i knew myself a sinner and for that very reason i was determined to sin i would go on that i might prove myself right to myself by showing that i could go on and not be struck dead from heaven out of mere pride senors and selfwill i would fill up the cup of my iniquity and i filled it  you know doubtless senors how after the death of old almagro his sons party conspired against pizarro now my brother remained faithful to his old commander and for that very reason if you will believe it did i join the opposite party and gave myself up body and soul to do almagros work it was enough for me that the brother who had struck me thought a man right for me to think that man a devil what almagros work was you know he slew pizarro murdered him senors like a dog or rather like an old lion  he deserved his doom said amyas  let god judge him senor not we and least of all of us i who drew the first blood and perhaps the last that day i senors it was who treacherously stabbed francisco de chanes on the staircase and so opened the door which else had foiled us all and ibut i am speaking to men of honor not to butchers suffice it that the old man died like a lion and that we pulled him down young as we were like curs  well i followed almagros fortunes i helped to slay alvarado call that my third murder if you will for if he was traitor to a traitor i was traitor to a true man then to the war you know how vaca de castro was sent from spain to bring order and justice where was naught but chaos and the dance of all devils we met him on the hills of chupas peter of candia the venetian villain pointed our guns false and almagro stabbed him to the heart we charged with our lances man against man horse against horse all fights i ever fought and the old mans eyes flashed out the ancient fire were childs play to that day our lances shivered like reeds and we fell on with battleaxe and mace none asked for quarter and none gave it friend to friend cousin to cousinno nor brother o god to brother we were the better armed but numbers were on their side fat carbajal charged our cannon like an elephant and took them but holguin was shot down i was with almagro and we swept all before us inch by inch but surely till the night fell then vaca de castro the licentiate the clerk the schoolman the man of books came down on us with his reserve like a whirlwind oh cavaliers did not god fight against us when he let us the men of iron us the heroes of cuzco and vilcaconga be foiled by a scholar in a black gown with a pen behind his ear we were beaten some ran some did not run senors and i did not geronimo de alvarado shouted to me we slew pizarro we killed the tyrant and we rushed upon the conquerors lances to die like cavaliers there was a gallant gentleman in front of me his lance struck me in the crest and bore me over my horses croup but mine senors struck him full in the vizor we both went to the ground together and the battle galloped over us  i know not how long i lay for i was stunned but after awhile i lifted myself my lance was still clenched in my hand broken but not parted the point of it was in my foemans brain i crawled to him weary and wounded and saw that he was a noble cavalier he lay on his back his arms spread wide i knew that he was dead but there came over me the strangest longing to see that dead mans face perhaps i knew him at least i could set my foot upon it and say vanquished as i am there lies a foe i caught hold of the rivets and tore his helmet off the moon shone bright senors as bright as she shines nowthe glaring ghastly telltale moon which shows man all the sins which he tries to hide and by that moonlight senors i beheld the dead mans face and it was the face of my brother                          did you ever guess most noble cavaliers what cains curse might be like look on me and know  i tore off my armor and fled as cain flednorthward ever till i should reach a land where the name of spaniard yea and the name of christian which the spaniard has caused to be blasphemed from east to west should never come i sank fainting and waked beneath this rock this tree fortyfour years ago and i have never left them since save once to obtain seeds from indians who knew not that i was a spanish conquistador and may god have mercy on my soul  the old man ceased and his young hearers deeply affected by his tale sat silent for a few minutes then john brimblecombe spoke  you are old sir and i am young and perhaps it is not my place to counsel you moreover sir in spite of this strange dress of mine i am neither more nor less than an english priest and i suppose you will not be willing to listen to a heretic  i have seen catholics senor commit too many abominations even with the name of god upon their lips to shrink from a heretic if he speak wisely and well at least you are a man and after all my heart yearns more and more the longer i sit among you for the speech of beings of my own race say what you will in gods name  i hold sir said jack modestly according to holy scripture that whosoever repents from his heart as god knows you seem to have done is forgiven there and then and though his sins be as scarlet they shall be white as snow for the sake of him who died for all  amen amen said the old man looking lovingly at his little crucifix i hope and prayhis name is love i know it now who better but sir even if he have forgiven me how can i forgive myself in honor sir i must be just and sternly just to myself even if god be indulgent as he has been to me who has left me here in peace for forty years instead of giving me a prey to the first puma or jaguar which howls round me every night he has given me time to work out my own salvation but have i done it that doubt maddens me at whiles when i look upon that crucifix i float on boundless hope but if i take my eyes from it for a moment faith fails and all is blank and dark and dreadful till the devil whispers me to plunge into yon stream and once and for ever wake to certainty even though it be in hell  what was jack to answer he himself knew not at first more was wanted than the mere repetition of free pardon  heretic as i am sir you will not believe me when i tell you as a priest that god accepts your penitence  my heart tells me so already at moments but how know i that it does not lie  senor said jack the best way to punish oneself for doing ill seems to me to go and do good and the best way to find out whether god means you well is to find out whether he will help you to do well if you have wronged indians in time past see whether you cannot right them now if you can you are safe for the lord will not send the devils servants to do his work  the old man held down his head  right the indians alas what is done is done  not altogether senor said amyas as long as an indian remains alive in new granada  senor shall i confess my weakness a voice within me has bid me a hundred times go forth and labor for those oppressed wretches but i dare not obey i dare not look them in the face i should fancy that they knew my story that the very birds upon the trees would reveal my crime and bid them turn from me with horror  senor said amyas these are but the sick fancies of a noble spirit feeding on itself in solitude you have but to try to conquer  and look now said jack if you dare not go forth to help the indians see now how god has brought the indians to your own door oh excellent sir  call me not excellent said the old man smiting his breast  i do and shall sir while i see in you an excellent repentance an excellent humility and an excellent justice said jack but oh sir look upon these forty souls whom we must leave behind like sheep which have no shepherd could you not teach them to fear god and to love each other to live like rational men perhaps to die like christians they would obey you as a dog obeys his master you might be their king their father yea their pope if you would  you do not speak like a lutheran  i am not a lutheran but an englishman but protestant as i am god knows i had sooner see these poor souls of your creed than of none  but i am no priest  when they are ready said jack the lord will send a priest if you begin the good work you may trust to him to finish it  god help me said the old warrior  the talk lasted long into the night but amyas was up long before daybreak felling the trees and as he and cary walked back to breakfast the first thing which they saw was the old man in his garden with four or five indian children round him talking smilingly to them  the old mans heart is sound still said will no man is lost who still is fond of little children  ah senors said the hermit as they came up you see that i have begun already to act upon your advice  and you have begun at the right end quoth amyas if you win the children you win the mothers  and if you win the mothers quoth will the poor fathers must needs obey their wives and follow in the wake  the old man only sighed the prattle of these little ones softens my hard heart senors with a new pleasure but it saddens me when i recollect that there may be children of mine now in the worldchildren who have never known a fathers lovenever known aught but a masters threats  god has taken care of these little ones trust that he has taken care of yours  that day amyas assembled the indians and told them that they must obey the hermit as their king and settle there as best they could for if they broke up and wandered away nothing was left for them but to fall one by one into the hands of the spaniards they heard him with their usual melancholy and stupid acquiescence and went and came as they were bid like animated machines but the negroes were of a different temper and four or five stout fellows gave amyas to understand that they had been warriors in their own country and that warriors they would be still and nothing should keep them from spaniardhunting amyas saw that the presence of these desperadoes in the new colony would both endanger the authority of the hermit and bring the spaniards down upon it in a few weeks so making a virtue of necessity he asked them whether they would go spaniardhunting with him  this was just what the bold coromantees wished for they grinned and shouted their delight at serving under so great a warrior and then set to work most gallantly getting through more in the day than any ten indians and indeed than any two englishmen  so went on several days during which the trees were felled and the process of digging them out began while ayacanora silent and moody wandered into the woods all day with her blowgun and brought home at evening a load of parrots monkeys and curassows two or three old hands were sent out to hunt likewise so that what with the game and the fish of the river which seemed inexhaustible and the fruit of the neighboring palmtrees there was no lack of food in the camp but what to do with ayacanora weighed heavily on the mind of amyas he opened his heart on the matter to the old hermit and asked him whether he would take charge of her the latter smiled and shook his head at the notion if your report of her be true i may as well take in hand to tame a jaguar however he promised to try and one evening as they were all standing together before the mouth of the cave ayacanora came up smiling with the fruit of her days sport and amyas thinking this a fit opportunity began a carefully prepared harangue to her which he intended to be altogether soothing and even patheticto the effect that the maiden having no parents was to look upon this good old man as her father that he would instruct her in the white mans religion at which promise yeo as a good protestant winced a good deal and teach her how to be happy and good and so forth and that in fine she was to remain there with the hermit  she heard him quietly her great dark eyes opening wider and wider her bosom swelling her stature seeming to grow taller every moment as she clenched her weapons firmly in both her hands beautiful as she always was she had never looked so beautiful before and as amyas spoke of parting with her it was like throwing away a lovely toy but it must be done for her sake for his perhaps for that of all the crew  the last words had hardly passed his lips when with a shriek of mingled scorn rage and fear she dashed through the astonished group  stop her were amyass first words but his next were let her go for springing like a deer through the little garden and over the flowerfence she turned menacing with her blowgun the sailors who had already started in her pursuit  let her alone for heavens sake shouted amyas who he scarce knew why shrank from the thought of seeing those graceful limbs struggling in the seamens grasp  she turned again and in another minute her gaudy plumes had vanished among the dark forest stems as swiftly as if she had been a passing bird  all stood thunderstruck at this unexpected end to the conference at last aymas spoke  theres no use in standing here idle gentlemen staring after her wont bring her back after all im glad shes gone  but the tone of his voice belied his words now he had lost her he wanted her back and perhaps every one present except he guessed why  but ayacanora did not return and ten days more went on in continual toil at the canoes without any news of her from the hunters amyas by the by had strictly bidden these last not to follow the girl not even to speak to her if they came across her in their wanderings he was shrewd enough to guess that the only way to cure her sulkiness was to outsulk her but there was no sign of her presence in any direction and the canoes being finished at last the gold and such provisions as they could collect were placed on board and one evening the party prepared for their fresh voyage they determined to travel as much as possible by night for fear of discovery especially in the neighborhood of the few spanish settlements which were then scattered along the banks of the main stream these however the negroes knew so that there was no fear of coming on them unawares and as for falling asleep in their night journeys nobody the negroes said ever slept on the magdalena the mosquitoes took too good care of that which fact amyas and his crew verified afterwards as thoroughly as wretched men could do  the sun had sunk the night had all but fallen the men were all on board amyas in command of one canoe cary of the other the indians were grouped on the bank watching the party with their listless stare and with them the young guide who preferred remaining among the indians and was made supremely happy by the present of spanish sword and an english axe while in the midst the old hermit with tears in his eyes prayed gods blessing on them  i owe to you noble cavaliers new peace new labor i may say new life may god be with you and teach you to use your gold and your swords better than i used mine  the adventurers waved their hands to him  give way men cried amyas and as he spoke the paddles dashed into the water to a right english hurrah which sent the birds fluttering from their roosts and was answered by the yell of a hundred monkeys and the distant roar of the jaguar  about twenty yards below a wooded rock some ten feet high hung over the stream the river was not there more than fifteen yards broad deep near the rock shallow on the farther side and amyass canoe led the way within ten feet of the stone  as he passed a dark figure leapt from the bushes on the edge and plunged heavily into the water close to the boat all started a jaguar no he would not have missed so short a spring what then a human being  a head rose panting to the surface and with a few strong strokes the swimmer had clutched the gunwale it was ayacanora  go back shouted amyas go back girl  she uttered the same wild cry with which she had fled into the forest  i will die then and she threw up her arms another moment and she had sunk  to see her perish before his eyes who could bear that her hands alone were above the surface amyas caught convulsively at her in the darkness and seized her wrist  a yell rose from the negroes a roar from the crew as from a cage of lions there was a rush and a swirl along the surface of the stream and caiman caiman shouted twenty voices  now or never for the strong arm to larboard men or over we go cried amyas and with one huge heave he lifted the slender body upon the gunwale her lower limbs were still in the water when within arms length rose above the stream a huge muzzle the lower jaw lay flat the upper reached as high as amyass head he could see the long fangs gleam white in the moonshine he could see for one moment full down the monstrous depths of that great gape which would have crushed a buffalo three inches and no more from that soft side the snout surged up  there was the gleam of an axe from above a sharp ringing blow and the jaws came together with a clash which rang from bank to bank he had missed her swerving beneath the blow his snout had passed beneath her body and smashed up against the side of the canoe as the striker overbalanced fell headlong overboard upon the monsters back  who is it  yeo shouted a dozen  man and beast went down together and where they sank the moonlight shone on a great swirling eddy while all held their breaths and ayacanora cowered down into the bottom of the canoe her proud spirit utterly broken for the first time by the terror of that great need and by a bitter loss for in the struggle the holy trumpet companion of all her wanderings had fallen from her bosom and her fond hope of bringing magic prosperity to her english friends had sunk with it to the bottom of the stream  none heeded her not even amyas round whose knees she clung fawning like a spaniel dog for where was yeo  another swirl a shout from the canoe abreast of them and yeo rose having dived clean under his own boat and risen between the two  safe as yet lads heave me a line or hell have me after all  but ere the brute reappeared the old man was safe on board  the lord has stood by me panted he as he shot the water from his ears we went down together i knew the indian trick and being uppermost had my thumbs in his eyes before he could turn but he carried me down to the very mud my breath was nigh gone so i left go and struck up but my toes tingled as i rose again ill warrant there the beggar is looking for me i declare  and true enough there was the huge brute swimming slowly round and round in search of his lost victim it was too dark to put an arrow into his eye so they paddled on while ayacanora crouched silently at amyass feet  yeo asked he in a low voice what shall we do with her  why ask me sir said the old man as he had a very good right to ask  because when one dont know oneself one had best inquire of ones elders besides you saved her life at the risk of your own and have a right to a voice in the matter if any one has old friend  then my dear young captain if the lord puts a precious soul under your care dont you refuse to bear the burden he lays on you  amyas was silent awhile while ayacanora who was evidently utterly exhausted by the nights adventure and probably by long wanderings watchings and weepings which had gone before it sank with her head against his knee fell fast asleep and breathed as gently as a child  at last he rose in the canoe and called cary alongside  listen to me gentlemen and sailors all you know that we have a maiden on board here by no choice of our own whether she will be a blessing to us god alone can tell but she may turn to the greatest curse which has befallen us ever since we came out over bar three years ago promise me one thing or i put her ashore the next beach and that is that you will treat her as if she were your own sister and make an agreement here and now that if the maid comes to harm among us the man that is guilty shall hang for it by the neck till hes dead even though he be i captain leigh who speak to you ill hang you as i am a christian and i give you free leave to hang me  a very fair bargain quoth cary and i for one will see it kept to lads well twine a double strong halter for the captain as we go down along  i am not jesting will  i know it good old lad said cary stretching out his own hand to him across the water through the darkness and giving him a hearty shake i know it and listen men so help me god but ill be the first to back the captain in being as good as his word as i trust he never will need to be  amen said brimblecombe amen said yeo and many an honest voice joined in that honest compact and kept it too like men    chapter xxvi  how they took the great galleon       when captains courageous whom death could not daunt      did march to the siege of the city of gaunt      they musterd their soldiers by two and by three      but the foremost in battle was mary ambree      when brave sir john major was slain in her sight      who was her true lover her joy and delight      because he was murtherd most treacherouslie      then vowd to avenge him fair mary ambree                                   old ballad a d 1584  one more glance at the golden tropic sea and the golden tropic evenings by the shore of new granada in the golden spanish main  the bay of santa marta is rippling before the landbreeze one sheet of living flame the mighty forests are sparkling with myriad fireflies the lazy mist which lounges round the inner hills shines golden in the sunset rays and nineteen thousand feet aloft the mighty peak of horqueta cleaves the abyss of air rosered against the darkblue vault of heaven the rosy cone fades to a dull leaden hue but only for awhile the stars flash out one by one and venus like another moon tinges the eastern snows with gold and sheds across the bay a long yellow line of rippling light everywhere is glory and richness what wonder if the earth in that enchanted land be as rich to her inmost depths as she is upon the surface the heaven the hills the sea are one sparkling garland of jewelswhat wonder if the soil be jewelled also if every watercourse and bank of earth be spangled with emeralds and rubies with grains of gold and feathered wreaths of native silver  so thought in a poetic mood the bishop of cartagena as he sat in the state cabin of that great galleon the city of the true cross and looked pensively out of the window towards the shore the good man was in a state of holy calm his stout figure rested on one easychair his stout ankles on another beside a table spread with oranges and limes guavas and pineapples and all the fruits of ind  an indian girl bedizened with scarfs and gold chains kept off the flies with a fan of feathers and by him in a pail of ice from the horqueta the gift of some pious spanish lady who had spent an indian or two in bringing down the precious offering stood more than one flask of virtuous wine of alicant but he was not so selfish good man as to enjoy either ice or wine alone don pedro colonel of the soldiers on board don alverez intendant of his catholic majestys customs at santa marta and don paul captain of mariners in the city of the true cross had by his especial request come to his assistance that evening and with two friars who sat at the lower end of the table were doing their best to prevent the good man from taking too bitterly to heart the present unsatisfactory state of his cathedral town which had just been sacked and burnt by an old friend of ours sir francis drake  we have been great sufferers senorsah great sufferers snuffled the bishop quoting scripture after the fashion of the day glibly enough but often much too irreverently for me to repeat so boldly were his texts travestied and so freely interlarded by grumblings at tita and the mosquitoes great sufferers truly but there shall be a remnantah a remnant like the shaking of the olive tree and the gleaning grapes when the vintage is doneah gold yes i trust our ladys mercies are not shut up nor her arms shortenedlook senorsand he pointed majestically out of the window it looks gold it smells of gold as i may say by a poetical license yea the very waves as they ripple past us sing of gold gold gold  it is a great privilege said the intendant to have comfort so gracefully administered at once by a churchman and a scholar  a poet too said don pedro you have no notion what sweet sonnets  hush don pedrohush if i a mateless bird have spent an idle hour in teaching lovers how to sing why what of that i am a churchman senors but i am a man and i can feel senors i can sympathize i can palliate i can excuse who knows better than i how much human nature lurks in us fallen sons of adam tita  um said the trembling girl with a true indian grunt  fill his excellency the intendants glass does much more treasure come down illustrious senor may the poor of mary hope for a few more crumbs from their mistresss table  not a pezo i fear the big white cow up thereand he pointed to the horquetahas been milked dry for this year  ah and he looked up at the magnificent snow peak only good to cool wine with eh and as safe for the time being as solomons birds  solomons birds explain your recondite allusion my lord  enlighten us your excellency enlighten us  ah thereby hangs a tale you know the holy birds who run up and down on the prado at seville among the ladies pretty feeteh with hooked noses and cinnamon crests of course hoopoesupupa as the classics have it well senors once on a time the story goes these hoopoes all had golden crowns on their heads and senors they took the consequenceseh but it befell on a day that all the birds and beasts came to do homage at the court of his most catholic majesty king solomon and among them came these same hoopoes and they had a little request to make the poor rogues and what do you think it was why that king solomon would pray for them that they might wear any sort of crowns but these same golden ones forlisten tita and see the snare of richesmankind so hunted and shot and trapped and snared them for the sake of these same golden crowns that life was a burden to bear so solomon prayed and instead of golden crowns they all received crowns of feathers and ever since senors they live as merrily as crickets in an oven and also have the honor of bearing the name of his most catholic majesty king solomon tita fill the senor commandants glass fray gerundio what are you whispering about down there sir  fray gerundio had merely commented to his brother on the bishops story of solomons birds with an  o si sic omniawould that all gold would turn to feathers in like wise  then friend replied the other a dominican like gerundio but of a darker and sterner complexion corrupt human nature would within a week discover some fresh bauble for which to kill and be killed in vain  what is that fray gerundio asked the bishop again  i merely remarked that it were well for the world if all mankind were to put up the same prayer as the hoopoes  world sir what do you know about the world convert your indians sir if you please and leave affairs of state to your superiors you will excuse him senors turning to the dons and speaking in a lower tone a very worthy and pious man but a poor peasants son and besideyou understand a little wrong here too much fasting and watching i fear good man and the bishop touched his forehead knowingly to signify that fray gerundios wits were in an unsatisfactory state  the fray heard and saw with a quiet smile he was one of those excellent men whom the cruelties of his countrymen had stirred up as the darkness by mere contrast makes the light more bright as they did las casas gasca and many another noble name which is written in the book of life to deeds of love and pious daring worthy of any creed or age true protestants they protested even before kings against the evil which lay nearest them the sin which really beset them true liberals they did not disdain to call the darkskinned heathen their brothers and asserted in terms which astonish us when we recollect the age in which they were spoken the inherent freedom of every being who wore the flesh and blood which their lord wore true martyrs they bore witness of christ and received too often the rewards of such in slander and contempt such an one was fray gerundio a poor mean clumsytongued peasants son who never could put three sentences together save when he waxed eloquent crucifix in hand amid some group of indians or negroes he was accustomed to such rebuffs as the bishops he took them for what they were worth and sipped his wine in silence while the talk went on  they say observed the commandant that a very small platefleet will go to spain this year  what else says the intendant what have we to send in the name of all saints since these accursed english lutherans have swept us out clean  and if we had anything to send says the seacaptain what have we to send it in that fiend incarnate drake  ah said his holiness spare my ears don pedro you will oblige my weakness by not mentioning that manhis name is tartarean unfit for polite lips dracoa dragonserpentthe emblem of diabolus himselfah and the guardian of the golden apples of the west who would fain devour our new hercules his most catholic majesty deceived eve too with one of those same applesa very evil name senorsa tartarean nametita  um  fill my glass  nay cried the colonel with a great oath this english fellow is of another breed of serpent from that i warrant  your reason senor your reason  because this one would have seen eve at the bottom of the sea before he let her or any one but himself taste aught which looked like gold  ah ahvery good butwe laugh valiant senors while the church weeps alas for my sheep  and alas for their sheepfold it will be four years before we can get cartagena rebuilt again and as for the blockhouse when we shall get that rebuilt heaven only knows while his majesty goes on draining the indies for his english armada the town is as naked now as an indians back  baptista antonio the surveyor has sent home by me a relation to the king setting forth our defenceless state but to read a relation and to act on it are two cocks of very different hackles bishop as all statesmen know heaven grant we may have orders by the next fleet to fortify or we shall be at the mercy of every english pirate  ah that blockhouse sighed the bishop that was indeed a villainous trick a hundred and ten thousand ducats for the ransom of the town after having burned and plundered the onehalfand having made me dine with them too ah and sit between thethe serpent and his lieutenantgeneraland drunk my health in my own private winewine that i had from xeres nine years ago senors and offered the shameless heretics to take me to england if i would turn lutheran and find me a wife and make an honest man of meah and then to demand fresh ransom for the priory and the fortperfidious  well said the colonel they had the law of us the cunning rascals for we forgot to mention anything but the town in the agreement who would have dreamed of such a fetch as that  so i told my good friend the prior when he came to me to borrow the thousand crowns it was heavens will unexpected like the thunderbolt and to be borne as such every man must bear his own burden how could i lend him aught  your holinesss money had been all carried off by them before said the intendant who knew and none better the exact contrary  just soall my scanty savings desolate in my lone old age ah senors had we not had warning of the coming of these wretches from my dear friend the marquess of santa cruz whom i remember daily in my prayers we had been like to them who go down quick into the pit i too might have saved a trifle had i been minded but in thinking too much of others i forgot myself alas  warning or none we had no right to be beaten by such a handful said the seacaptain and a shame it is and a shame it will be for many a day to come  do you mean to cast any slur sir upon the courage and conduct of his catholic majestys soldiers asked the colonel  ino but we were foully beaten and that behind our barricades too and theres the plain truth  beaten sir do you apply such a term to the fortunes of war what more could our governor have done had we not the ways filled with poisoned caltrops guarded by indian archers barred with butts full of earth raked with culverins and arquebuses what familiar spirit had we sir to tell us that these villains would come along the seabeach and not by the highroad like christian men  ah said the bishop it was by intuition diabolic i doubt not that they took that way satanas must need help those who serve him and for my part i can only attribute i would the captain here had piety enough to do so the misfortune which occurred to artmagic i believe these men to have been possessed by all fiends whatsoever  well your holiness said the colonel there may have been devilry in it how else would men have dared to run right into the mouths of our cannon fire their shot against our very noses and tumble harmless over those huge butts of earth  doubtless by force of the fiends which raged with them interposed the bishop  and then with their blasphemous cries leap upon us with sword and pike i myself saw that lieutenantgeneral carlisle hew down with one stroke that noble young gentleman the ensignbearer your excellencys sisters sons nephew though he was armed capapie was not artmagic here and that most furious and blaspheming lutheran captain young i saw how he caught our general by the head after the illustrious don alonzo had given him a grievous wound threw him to the earth and so took him was not artmagic here  well i say said the captain if you are looking for artmagic what say you to their marching through the flank fire of our galleys with eleven pieces of ordnance and two hundred shot playing on them as if it had been a mosquito swarm some said my men fired too high but that was the english rascals doing for they got down on the tide beach but senor commandant though satan may have taught them that trick was it he that taught them to carry pikes a foot longer than yours  ah well said the bishop sacked are we and san domingo as i hear in worse case than we are and st augustine in florida likewise and all that is left for a poor priest like me is to return to spain and see whether the pious clemency of his majesty and of the universal father may not be willing to grant some small relief or bounty to the poor of maryperhapsfor who knows to translate to a sphere of more peaceful labor one who is now old senors and weary with many toilstita fill our glasses i have saved somewhatas you may have done senors from the general wreck and for the flock when i am no more illustrious senors heavens mercies are infinite new cities will rise from the ashes of the old new mines pour forth their treasures into the sanctified laps of the faithful and new indians flock toward the lifegiving standard of the cross to put on the easy yoke and light burden of the church and  and where shall i be then ah where fain would i rest and fain depart tita sling my hammock senors you will excuse age and infirmities fray gerundio go to bed  and the dons rose to depart while the bishop went on maundering  farewell life is short ah we shall meet in heaven at last and there are really no more pearls  not a frail nor gold either said the intendant  ah well better a dinner of herbs where love is thantita  my breviaryah mans gratitude is shortlived i had hopedyou have seen nothing of the senora bovadilla  no  ah she promisedbut no mattera little trifle as a keepsakea gold cross or an emerald ring or what noti forget and what have i to do with worldly wealthah tita bring me the casket  and when his guests were gone the old man began mumbling prayers out of his breviary and fingering over jewels and gold with the dull greedy eyes of covetous old age  ahit may buy the red hat yetomnia romae venalia put it by tita and do not look at it too much child enter not into temptation the love of money is the root of all evil and heaven in love for the indian has made him poor in this world that he may be rich in faith ahughso  and the old miser clambered into his hammock tita drew the mosquito net over him wrapt another round her own head and slept or seemed to sleep for she coiled herself up upon the floor and master and slave soon snored a merry bass to the treble of the mosquitoes  it was long past midnight and the moon was down the sentinels who had tramped and challenged overhead till they thought their officers were sound asleep had slipped out of the unwholesome rays of the planet to seek that health and peace which they considered their right and slept as soundly as the bishops self  two long lines glided out from behind the isolated rocks of the morro grande which bounded the bay some five hundred yards astern of the galleon they were almost invisible on the glittering surface of the water being perfectly white and had a sentinel been looking out he could only have descried them by the phosphorescent flashes along their sides  now the bishop had awoke and turned himself over uneasily for the wine was dying out within him and his shoulders had slipped down and his heels up and his head ached so he sat upright in his hammock looked out upon the bay and called tita  put another pillow under my head child what is that a fish  tita looked she did not think it was a fish but she did not choose to say so for it might have produced an argument and she had her reasons for not keeping his holiness awake  the bishop looked again settled that it must be a white whale or shark or other monster of the deep crossed himself prayed for a safe voyage and snored once more  presently the cabindoor opened gently and the head of the senor intendant appeared  tita sat up and then began crawling like a snake along the floor among the chairs and tables by the light of the cabin lamp  is he asleep  yes but the casket is under his head  curse him how shall we take it  i brought him a fresh pillow halfanhour ago i hung his hammock wrong on purpose that he might want one i thought to slip the box away as i did it but the old ox nursed it in both hands all the while  what shall we do in the name of all the fiends she sails tomorrow morning and then all is lost  tita showed her white teeth and touched the dagger which hung by the intendants side  i dare not said the rascal with a shudder  i dare said she he whipt my mother because she would not give me up to him to be taught in his schools when she went to the mines and she went to the mines and died there in three months i saw her go with a chain round her neck but she never came back again yes i dare kill him i will kill him i will  the senor felt his mind much relieved he had no wish of course to commit the murder himself for he was a good catholic and feared the devil but tita was an indian and her being lost did not matter so much indians souls were cheap like their bodies so he answered but we shall be discovered  i will leap out of the window with the casket and swim ashore they will never suspect you and they will fancy i am drowned  the sharks may seize you tita you had better give me the casket  tita smiled you would not like to lose that eh though you care little about losing me and yet you told me that you loved me  and i do love you tita light of my eyes life of my heart i swear by all the saints i love you i will marry you i swear i willi will swear on the crucifix if you like  swear then or i do not give you the casket said she holding out the little crucifix round her neck and devouring him with the wild eyes of passionate unreasoning tropic love  he swore trembling and deadly pale  give me your dagger  no not mine it may be found i shall be suspected what if my sheath were seen to be empty  your knife will do his throat is soft enough  and she glided stealthily as a cat toward the hammock while her cowardly companion stood shivering at the other end of the cabin and turned his back to her that he might not see the deed  he stood waiting one minutetwofive was it an hour rather a cold sweat bathed his limbs the blood beat so fiercely within his temples that his head rang again was that a deathbell tolling no it was the pulses of his brain impossible surely a deathbell whence could it come  there was a struggleah she was about it now a stifled cryah he had dreaded that most of all to hear the old man cry would there be much blood he hoped not another struggle and titas voice apparently muffled called for help  i cannot help you mother of mercies i dare not help you hissed he shedevil you have begun it and you must finish it yourself  a heavy arm from behind clasped his throat the bishop had broken loose from her and seized him or was it his ghost or a fiend come to drag him down to the pit and forgetting all but mere wild terror he opened his lips for a scream which would have wakened every soul on board but a handkerchief was thrust into his mouth and in another minute he found himself bound hand and foot and laid upon the table by a gigantic enemy the cabin was full of armed men two of whom were lashing up the bishop in his hammock two more had seized tita and more were clambering up into the sterngallery beyond wild figures with bright blades and armor gleaming in the starlight  now will whispered the giant who had seized him forward and clap the forehatches on and shout fire with all your might girl murderess your life is in my hands tell me where the commander sleeps and i pardon you  tita looked up at the huge speaker and obeyed in silence the intendant heard him enter the colonels cabin and then a short scuffle and silence for a moment  but only for a moment for already the alarm had been given and mad confusion reigned through every deck amyas for it was none other had already gained the poop the sentinels were gagged and bound and every halfnaked wretch who came trembling up on deck in his shirt by the main hatchway calling one fire another wreck and another treason was hurled into the scuppers and there secured  lower away that boat shouted amyas in spanish to his first batch of prisoners  the men unarmed and naked could but obey  now then jump in here hand them to the gangway as they come up  it was done and as each appeared he was kicked to the scuppers and bundled down over the side  shes full cast loose now and off with you if you try to board again well sink you  fire fire shouted cary forward up the main hatchway for your lives  the ruse succeeded utterly and before halfanhour was over all the ships boats which could be lowered were filled with spaniards in their shirts getting ashore as best they could  here is a new sort of camisado quoth cary the last spanish one i saw was at the sortie from smerwick but this is somewhat more prosperous than that  get the main and foresail up will said amyas cut the cable and we will plume the quarry as we fly  spoken like a good falconer heaven grant that this big woodcock may carry a good trail inside  ill warrant her for that said jack brimblecombe she floats so low  much of your build too jack by the by where is the commander  alas don pedro forgotten in the bustle had been lying on the deck in his shirt helplessly bound exhausting that part of his vocabulary which related to the unseen world which most discourteous act seemed at first likely to be somewhat heavily avenged on amyas for as he spoke a couple of calivershots fired from under the poop passed ping ping by his ears and cary clapped his hand to his side  hurt will  a pinch old ladlook out or we are allen verloren after all as the flemings say  and as he spoke a rush forward on the poop drove two of their best men down the ladder into the waist where amyas stood  killed asked he as he picked one up who had fallen head over heels  sound as a bell sir but they gentiles has got hold of the firearms and set the captain free  and rubbing the back of his head for a minute he jumped up the ladder again shouting  have at ye idolatrous pagans have at ye satans spawn  amyas jumped up after him shouting to all hands to follow for there was no time to be lost  out of the windows of the poop which looked on the maindeck a galling fire had been opened and he could not afford to lose men for as far as he knew the spaniards left on board might still far outnumber the english so up he sprang on the poop followed by a dozen men and there began a very heavy fight between two parties of valiant warriors who easily knew each other apart by the peculiar fashion of their armor for the spaniards fought in their shirts and in no other garments but the english in all other manner of garments tag rag and bobtail and yet had never a shirt between them  the rest of the english made a rush of course to get upon the poop seeing that the spaniards could not shoot them through the deck but the fire from the windows was so hot that although they dodged behind masts spars and every possible shelter one or two dropped and jack brimblecombe and yeo took on themselves to call a retreat and with about a dozen men got back and held a council of war  what was to be done their arquebuses were of little use for the spaniards were behind a strong bulkhead there were cannon but where was powder or shot the boats encouraged by the clamor on deck were paddling alongside again yeo rushed round and round probing every gun with his sword  heres a patararo loaded now for a match lads  luckily one of the english had kept his match alight during the scuffle  thanks be help me to unship the gunthe masts in the way here  the patararo or brass swivel was unshipped  steady lads and keep it level or youll shake out the priming ship it here turn out that one and heave it into that boat if they come alongside steady nowso rummage about and find me a bolt or two a marlinspike anything quick or the captain will be overmastered yet  missiles were foundodds and endsand crammed into the swivel up to the muzzle and in another minute its cargo of notions was crashing into the poopwindows silencing the fire from thence effectually enough for the time  now then a rush forward and right in along the deck shouted yeo and the whole party charged through the cabindoors which their shot had burst open and hewed their way from room to room  in the meanwhile the spaniards above had fought fiercely but in spite of superior numbers they had gradually given back before the demoniacal possession of those blasphemous heretics who fought not like men but like furies from the pit and by the time that brimblecombe and yeo shouted from the sterngallery below that the quarterdeck was won few on either side but had their shrewd scratch to show  yield senor shouted amyas to the commander who had been fighting like a lion back to back with the captain of mariners  never you have bound me and insulted me your blood or mine must wipe out the stain  and he rushed on amyas there was a few moments heavy fence between them and then amyas cut right at his head but as he raised his arm the spaniards blade slipped along his ribs and snapped against the point of his shoulderblade an inch more to the left and it would have been through his heart the blow fell nevertheless and the commandant fell with it stunned by the flat of the sword but not wounded for amyass hand had turned as he winced from his wound but the seacaptain seeing amyas stagger sprang at him and seizing him by the wrist ere he could raise his sword again shortened his weapon to run him through amyas made a grasp at his wrist in return but between his faintness and the darkness missed itanother moment and all would have been over  a bright blade flashed close past amyass ear the seacaptains grasp loosened and he dropped a corpse while over him like an angry lioness above her prey stood ayacanora her long hair floating in the wind her dagger raised aloft as she looked round challenging all and every one to approach  are you hurt panted she  a scratch childwhat do you do here go back go back  ayacanora slipped back like a scolded child and vanished in the darkness  the battle was over the spaniards seeing their commanders fall laid down their arms and cried for quarter it was given the poor fellows were tied together two and two and seated in a row on the deck the commandant sorely bruised yielded himself perforce and the galleon was taken  amyas hurried forward to get the sails set as he went down the poopladder there was some one sitting on the lowest step  who is herewounded  i am not wounded said a womans voice low and stifled with sobs  it was ayacanora she rose and let him pass he saw that her face was bright with tears but he hurried on nevertheless  perhaps i did speak a little hastily to her considering she saved my life but what a brimstone it is mary ambree in a dark skin now then lads get the santa fe gold up out of the canoes and then we will put her head to the northeast and away for old england mr brimblecombe dont say that eastwardho dont bring luck this time  it was impossible till morning dawned either to get matters into any order or to overhaul the prize they had taken and many of the men were so much exhausted that they fell fast asleep on the deck ere the surgeon had time to dress their wounds however amyas contrived when once the ship was leaping merrily closehauled against a fresh landbreeze to count his little flock and found out of the fortyfour but six seriously wounded and none killed however their working numbers were now reduced to thirtyeight beside the four negroes a scanty crew enough to take home such a ship to england  after awhile up came jack brimblecombe on deck a bottle in his hand  lads a prize  well we know that already  nay butlook hither and laid in ice too as i live the luxurious dogs but i had to fight for it i had for when i went down into the state cabin after i had seen to the wounded whom should i find loose but that indian lass who had just unbound the fellow you caught  ah those two i believe were going to murder the old man in the hammock if we had not come in the nick of time what have you done with them  why the spaniard ran when he saw me and got into a cabin but the woman instead of running came at me with a knife and chased me round the table like a very catamountain so i ducked under the old mans hammock and out into the gallery and when i thought the coast was clear back again i came and stumbled over this so i just picked it up and ran on deck with my tail between my legs for i expected verily to have the black womans knife between my ribs out of some dark corner  well done jack lets have the wine nevertheless and then down to set a guard on the cabin doors for fear of plundering  better go down and see that nothing is thrown overboard by spaniards as for plundering i will settle that  and amyas walked forward among the men  muster the men boatswain and count them  all here sir but the six poor fellows who are laid forward  now my men said amyas for three years you and i have wandered on the face of the earth seeking our fortune and we have found it at last thanks be to god now what was our promise and vow which we made to god beneath the tree of guayra if he should grant us good fortune and bring us home again with a prize was it not that the dead should share with the living and that every mans portion if he fell should go to his widow or his orphans or if he had none to his parents  it was sir said yeo and i trust that the lord will give these men grace to keep their vow they have seen enough of his providences by this time to fear him  i doubt them not but i remind them of it the lord has put into our hands a rich prize and what with the gold which we have already we are well paid for all our labors let us thank him with fervent hearts as soon as the sun rises and in the meanwhile remember all that whosoever plunders on his private account robs not the adventurers merely but the orphan and the widow which is to rob god and makes himself partaker of achans curse who hid the wedge of gold and brought down gods anger on the whole army of israel for me lest you should think me covetous i could claim my brothers share but i hereby give it up freely into the common stock for the use of the whole ships crew who have stood by me through weal and woe as men never stood before as i believe by any captain so now to prayers lads and then to eat our breakfast  so to the spaniards surprise who most of them believed that the english were atheists to prayers they went  after which brimblecombe contrived to inspire the black cook and the portuguese steward with such energy that by seven oclock the latter worthy appeared on deck and with profound reverences announced to the most excellent and heroical senor adelantado captain englishman that breakfast was ready in the statecabin  you will do us the honor of accompanying us as our guest sir or our host if you prefer the title said amyas to the commandant who stood by  pardon senor but honor forbids me to eat with one who has offered to me the indelible insult of bonds  oh said amyas taking off his hat then pray accept on the spot my humble apologies for all which has passed and my assurances that the indignities which you have unfortunately endured were owing altogether to the necessities of war and not to any wish to hurt the feelings of so valiant a soldier and gentleman  it is enough senor said the commandant bowing and shrugging his shouldersfor indeed he too was very hungry while cary whispered to amyas  you will make a courtier yet old lad  i am not in jesting humor will my mind sadly misgives me that we shall hear black news and have perhaps to do a black deed yet on board here senor i follow you  so they went down and found the bishop who was by this time unbound seated in a corner of the cabin his hands fallen on his knees his eyes staring on vacancy while the two priests stood as close against the wall as they could squeeze themselves keeping up a ceaseless mutter of prayers  your holiness will breakfast with us of course and these two frocked gentlemen likewise i see no reason for refusing them all hospitality as yet  there was a marked emphasis on the last two words which made both monks wince  our chaplain will attend to you gentlemen his lordship the bishop will do me the honor of sitting next to me  the bishop seemed to revive slowly as he snuffed the savory steam and at last rising mechanically subsided into the chair which amyas offered him on his left while the commandant sat on his right  a little of this kid my lord noahfriday i recollect some of that turtlefin then will serve his lordship pass the cassavabread up jack senor commandant a glass of wine you need it after your valiant toils to the health of all brave soldiersand a toast from your own spanish proverb today to me tomorrow to thee  i drink it brave senor your courtesy shows you the worthy countryman of general drake and his brave lieutenant  drake did you know him senor asked all the englishmen at once  too well too well and he would have continued but the bishop burst out  ah senor commandant that name again have you no mercy to sit between another pair of and my own wine too ugh ugh  the old gentleman whose mouth had been full of turtle the whole time burst into a violent fit of coughing and was only saved from apoplexy by carys patting him on the back  ugh ugh the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel and their precious balms ah senor lieutenant englishman may i ask you to pass those limesah what is turtle without limeeven as a fat old man without money nudus intravi nudus exeoah  but what of drake  do you not know sir that he and his fleet only last year swept the whole of this coast and took with shame i confess it cartagena san domingo st augustine andi see you are too courteous senors to express before me what you have a right to feel but whence come you sir from the skies or the depth of the sea  artmagic artmagic moaned the bishop  your holiness it is scarcely prudent to speak thus here said the commandant who was nevertheless much of the same opinion  why you said so yourself last night senor about the taking of cartagena  the commandant blushed and stammered out somewhatthat it was excusable in him if he had said in jest that so prodigious and curious a valor had not sprung from mortal source  no more it did senor said jack brimblecombe stoutly but from him who taught our hands to war and our fingers to fight  the commandant bowed stiffly you will excuse me sir preacher but i am a catholic and hold the cause of my king to be alone the cause of heaven but senor captain how came you thither if i may ask that you needed no artmagic after you came on board i alas can testify but too well but what spiritwhether good or evil i ask notbrought you on board and whence where is your ship i thought that all drakes squadron had left six months ago  our ship senor has lain this three years rotting on the coast near cape codera  ah we heard of that bold adventurebut we thought you all lost in the interior  you did can you tell me then where the senor governor of la guayra may be now  the senor don guzman de soto said the commandant in a somewhat constrained tone is said to be at present in spain having thrown up his office in consequence of domestic matters of which i have not the honor of knowing anything  amyas longed to ask more but he knew that the wellbred spaniard would tell him nothing which concerned another mans wife and went on  what befell us after i tell you frankly  and amyas told his story from the landing at guayra to the passage down the magdalena the commandant lifted up his hands  were it not forbidden to me as a catholic most invincible senor i should say that the divine protection has indeed  ah said one of the friars that you could be brought senors to render thanks for your miraculous preservation to her to whom alone it is due mary the fount of mercies  we have done well enough without her as yet said amyas bluntly  the lord raised up nebuchadnezzar of old to punish the sins of the jewish church and he has raised up these men to punish ours said fray gerundio  but nebuchadnezzar fell and so may they growled the other to himself jack overheard him  i say my lord bishop called he from the other end of the table it is our english custom to let our guests be as rude as they like but perhaps your lordship will hint to these two friars that if they wish to keep whole skins they will keep civil tongues  be silent asses mules shouted the bishop whose spirits were improving over the wine who are you that you cannot eat dirt as well as your betters  well spoken my lord heres the health of our saintly and venerable guest said cary while the commandant whispered to amyas fat old tyrant i hope you have found his moneyfor i am sure he has some on board and i should be loath that you lost the advantage of it  i shall have to say a few words to you about that money this morning commandant by the by they had better be said now my lord bishop do you know that had we not taken this ship when we did you had lost not merely money as you have now but life itself  money i had none to lose lifewhat do you mean asked the bishop turning very pale  this sir that it ill befits one to lie whose throat has been saved from the assassins knife but four hours since when we entered the sterngallery we found two persons now on board this ship in the very act sir and article of cutting your sinful throat that they might rob you of the casket which lay beneath your pillow a moment more and you were dead we seized and bound them and so saved your life is that plain sir  the bishop looked steadfastly and stupidly into amyass face heaved a deep sigh and gradually sank back in his chair dropping the glass from his hand  he is in a fit call in the surgeon run and up jumped kindhearted jack and brought in the surgeon of the galleon  is this possible senor asked the commandant  it is true door there evans go and bring in that rascal whom we left bound in his cabin  evans went and the commandant continued  but the sterngallery how in the name of all witches and miracles came your valor thither  simply enough and owing neither to witch nor miracle the night before last we passed the mouth of the bay in our two canoes which we had lashed together after the fashion i had seen in the moluccas to keep them afloat in the surf we had scraped the canoes bright the day before and rubbed them with white clay that they might be invisible at night and so we got safely to the morro grande passing within half a mile of your ship  oh my scoundrels of sentinels  we landed at the back of the morro and lay there all day being purposed to do that which with your pardon we have done we took our sails of indian cloth whitened them likewise with clay which we had brought with us from the river expecting to find a spanish ship as we went along the coast and determined to attempt her or die with honor and laid them over us on the canoes paddling from underneath them so that had your sentinels been awake they would have hardly made us out till we were close on board we had provided ourselves instead of ladders with bamboos rigged with crosspieces and a hook of strong wood at the top of each they hang at your sterngallery now and the rest of the tale i need not tell you  the commandant rose in his courtly spanish way  your admirable story senor proves to me how truly your nation while it has yet and i trust will ever have to dispute the palm of valor with our own is famed throughout the world for ingenuity and for daring beyond that of mortal man you have succeeded valiant captain because you have deserved to succeed and it is no shame to me to succumb to enemies who have united the cunning of the serpent with the valor of the lion senor i feel as proud of becoming your guest as i should have been proud under a happier star of becoming your host  you are like your nation only too generous senor but what noise is that outside cary go and see  but ere cary could reach the door it was opened and evans presented himself with a terrified face  heres villainy sir the dons murdered and cold the indian lass fled and as we searched the ship for her we found an englishwoman as im a sinful manand a shocking sight she is to see  an englishwoman cried all three springing forward  bring her in said amyas turning very pale and as he spoke yeo and another led into the cabin a figure scarcely human  an elderly woman dressed in the yellow san benito of the inquisition with ragged gray locks hanging about a countenance distorted by suffering and shrunk by famine painfully as one unaccustomed to the light she peered and blinked round her her fallen lip gave her a halfidiotic expression and yet there was an uneasy twinkle in the eye as of boundless terror and suspicion she lifted up her fettered wrist to shade her face and as she did so disclosed a line of fearful scars upon her skinny arm  look there sirs said yeo pointing to them with a stern smile heres some of these popish gentrys handiwork i know well enough how those marks came and he pointed to the similar scars on his own wrist  the commandant as well as the englishmen recoiled with horror  holy virgin what wretch is this on board my ship bishop is this the prisoner whom you sent on board  the bishop who had been slowly recovering his senses looked at her a moment and then thrusting his chair back crossed himself and almost screamed malefica malefica who brought her here turn her away gentlemen turn her eye away she will bewitch fascinateand he began muttering prayers  amyas seized him by the shoulder and shook him on to his legs  swine who is this wake up coward and tell me or i will cut you piecemeal  but ere the bishop could answer the woman uttered a wild shriek and pointing to the taller of the two monks cowered behind yeo  he here cried she in broken spanish take me away i will tell you no more i have told you all and lies enough beside oh why is he come again did they not say that i should have no more torments  the monk turned pale but like a wild beast at bay glared firmly round on the whole company and then fixing his dark eyes full on the woman he bade her be silent so sternly that she shrank down like a beaten hound  silence dog said will cary whose blood was up and followed his words with a blow on the monks mouth which silenced him effectually  dont be afraid good woman but speak english we are all english here and protestants too tell us what they have done for you  another trap another trap cried she in a strong devonshire accent you be no english you want to make me lie again and then torment me oh wretched wretched that i am cried she bursting into tears whom should i trust not myself no nor god for i have denied him o lord o lord  amyas stood silent with fear and horror some instinct told him that he was on the point of hearing news for which he feared to ask but jack spoke  my dear soul my dear soul dont you be afraid and the lord will stand by you if you will but tell the truth we are all englishmen and men of devon as you seem to be by your speech and this ship is ours and the pope himself shant touch you  devon she said doubtingly devon whence then  bideford men this is mr will cary to clovelly if you are a devon woman youve heard tell of the carys to be sure  the woman made a rush forward and threw her fettered arms round wills neck  oh mr cary my dear life mr cary and so you be oh dear soul alive but youre burnt so brown and i be most blind with misery oh who ever sent you here my dear mr will then to save a poor wretch from the pit  who on earth are you  lucy passmore the white witch to welcombe dont you mind lucy passmore as charmed your warts for you when you was a boy  lucy passmore almost shrieked all three friends she that went off with  yes she that sold her own soul and persuaded that dear saint to sell hers she that did the devils work and has taken the devils wagesafter this fashion and she held up her scarred wrists wildly  where is dona derose salterne shouted will and jack  where is my brother frank shouted amyas  dead dead dead  i knew it said amyas sitting down again calmly  how did she die  the inquisitionhe pointing to the monk ask himhe betrayed her to her death and ask him pointing to the bishop he sat by her and saw her die  woman you rave said the bishop getting up with a terrified air and moving as far as possible from amyas  how did my brother die lucy asked amyas still calmly  who be you sir  a gleam of hope flashed across amyasshe had not answered his question  i am amyas leigh of burrough do you know aught of my brother frank who was lost at la guayra  mr amyas heaven forgive me that i did not know the bigness of you your brother sir died like a gentleman as he was  but how gasped amyas  burned with her sir  is this true sir said amyas turning to the bishop with a very quiet voice  i sir stammered he in panting haste i had nothing to doi was compelled in my office of bishop to be an unwilling spectatorthe secular arm sir i could not interfere with thatany more than i can with the holy office i do not belong to itask that gentlemansir saints and angels sir what are you going to do shrieked he as amyas laid a heavy hand upon his shoulder and began to lead him towards the door  hang you said amyas if i had been a spaniard and a priest like yourself i should have burnt you alive  hang me shrieked the wretched old balaam and burst into abject howls for mercy  take the dark monk yeo and hang him too lucy passmore do you know that fellow also  no sir said lucy  lucky for you fray gerundio said will cary while the good friar hid his face in his hands and burst into tears lucky it was for him indeed for he had been a pitying spectator of the tragedy ah thought he if life in this mad and sinful world be a reward perhaps this escape is vouchsafed to me for having pleaded the cause of the poor indian  but the bishop shrieked on  oh not yet an hour only an hour i am not fit to die  that is no concern of mine said amyas i only know that you are not fit to live  let us at least make our peace with god said the dark monk  hound if your saints can really smuggle you up the backstairs to heaven they will do it without five minutes more coaxing and flattering  fray gerundio and the condemned man alike stopped their ears at the blasphemy  oh fray gerundio screamed the bishop pray for me i have treated you like a beast oh fray fray  oh my lord my lord said the good man as with tears streaming down his face he followed his shrieking and struggling diocesan up the stairs who am i ask no pardon of me ask pardon of god for all your sins against the poor innocent savages when you saw your harmless sheep butchered year after year and yet never lifted up your voice to save the flock which god had committed to you oh confess that my lord confess it ere it be too late  i will confess all about the indians and the gold and tita too fray peccavi peccavionly five minutes senors five little minutes grace while i confess to the good frayand he grovelled on the deck  i will have no such mummery where i command said amyas sternly i will be no accomplice in cheating satan of his due  if you will confess said brimblecombe whose heart was melting fast confess to the lord and he will forgive you even at the last moment mercy is open is it not fray gerundio  it is senor it is my lord said gerundio but the bishop only clasped his hands over his head  then i am undone all my money is stolen not a farthing left to buy masses for my poor soul and no absolution no viaticum nor anything i die like a dog and am damned  clear away that running rigging said amyas while the dark dominican stood perfectly collected with something of a smile of pity at the miserable bishop a man accustomed to cruelty and firm in his fanaticism he was as ready to endure suffering as to inflict it repeating to himself the necessary prayers he called fray gerundio to witness that he died however unworthy a martyr in charity with all men and in the communion of the holy catholic church and then as he fitted the cord to his own neck gave fray gerundio various petty commissions about his sister and her children and a little vineyard far away upon the sunny slopes of castile and so died with a domine in manus tuas like a valiant man of spain  amyas stood long in solemn silence watching the two corpses dangling above his head at last he drew a long breath as if a load was taken off his heart  suddenly he looked round to his men who were watching eagerly to know what he would have done next  hearken to me my masters all and may god hearken too and do so to me and more also if as long as i have eyes to see a spaniard and hands to hew him down i do any other thing than hunt down that accursed nation day and night and avenge all the innocent blood which has been shed by them since the day in which king ferdinand drove out the moors  amen said salvation yeo i need not to swear that oath for i have sworn it long ago and kept it will your honor have us kill the rest of the idolaters  god forbid said cary you would not do that amyas  no we will spare them god has shown us a great mercy this day and we must be merciful in it we will land them at cabo velo but henceforth till i die no quarter to a spaniard  amen said yeo  amyass whole countenance had changed in the last halfhour he seemed to have grown years older his brow was wrinkled his lip compressed his eyes full of a terrible stony calm as of one who had formed a great and dreadful purpose and yet for that very reason could afford to be quiet under the burden of it even cheerful and when he returned to the cabin he bowed courteously to the commandant begged pardon of him for having played the host so ill and entreated him to finish his breakfast  but senoris it possible is his holiness dead  he is hanged and dead senor i would have hanged could i have caught them every living thing which was present at my brothers death even to the very flies upon the wall no more words senor your conscience tells you that i am just  senor said the commandantone wordi trust there are no listenersnone of my crew i mean but i must exculpate myself in your eyes  walk out then into the gallery with me  to tell you the truth senori trust in heaven no one overhearsyou are just this inquisition is the curse of us the weight which is crushing out the very life of spain no man dares speak no man dares trust his neighbor no not his child or the wife of his bosom it avails nothing to be a good catholic as i trust i am and he crossed himself when any villain whom you may offend any unnatural son or wife who wishes to be rid of you has but to hint heresy against you and you vanish into the holy officeand then god have mercy on you for man has none noble ladies of my family sir have vanished thither carried off by night we know not why we dare not ask why to expostulate even to inquire would have been to share their fate there is one now senorheaven alone knows whether she is alive or deadit was nine years since and we have never heard and we shall never hear  and the commandants face worked frightfully  she was my sister senor  heavens sir and have you not avenged her  on churchmen senor and i a catholic to be burned at the stake in this life and after that to all eternity beside even a spaniard dare not face that beside sir the mob like this inquisition and an autodafe is even better sport to them than a bullfight they would be the first to tear a man in pieces who dare touch an inquisitor sir may all the saints in heaven obtain me forgiveness for my blasphemy but when i saw you just now fearing those churchmen no more than you feared me i longed sinner that i am to be a heretic like you  it will not take long to make a brave and wise gentleman who has suffered such things as you have a heretic as you call ita free christian man as we call it  tempt me not sir said the poor man crossing himself fervently let us say no more obedience is my duty and for the rest the church must decide according to her infallible authorityfor i am a good catholic senor the best of catholics though a great sinneri trust no one has overheard us  amyas left him with a smile of pity and went to look for lucy passmore whom the sailors were nursing and feeding while ayacanora watched them with a puzzled face  i will talk to you when you are better lucy said he taking her hand now you must eat and drink and forget all among us lads of devon  oh dear blessed sir and you will send sir john to pray with me for i turned sir i turned but i could not help iti could not abear the torments but she bore them sweet angeland more than i did oh dear me  lucy i am not fit now to hear more you shall tell me all tomorrow and he turned away  why do you take her hand said ayacanora halfscornfully she is old and ugly and dirty  she is an englishwoman child and a martyr poor thing and i would nurse her as i would my own mother  why dont you make me an englishwoman and a martyr i could learn how to do anything that that old hag could do  instead of calling her names go and tend her that would be much fitter work for a woman than fighting among men  ayacanora darted from him thrust the sailors aside and took possession of lucy passmore  where shall i put her asked she of amyas without looking up  in the best cabin and let her be served like a queen lads  no one shall touch her but me and taking up the withered frame in her arms as if it were a doll ayacanora walked off with her in triumph telling the men to go and mind the ship  the girl is mad said one  mad or not she has an eye to our captain said another  and wheres the man that would behave to the poor wild thing as he does  sir francis drake would from whom he got his lesson do you mind his putting the negro lass ashore after he found out about  hush bygones be bygones and those that did it are in their graves long ago but it was too hard of him on the poor thing  if he had not got rid of her there would have been more throats than one cut about the lass thats all i know said another and so there would have been about this one before now if the captain wasnt a born angel out of heaven and the lieutenant no less  well i suppose we may get a whet by now i wonder if these dons have any beer aboard  naught but grape vinegar which fools call wine ill warrant  there was better than vinegar on the table in there just now  ah said one grumbler of true english breed but thats not for poor fellows like we  dont lie tom evans you never were given that way yet and i dont think the trade will suit a good fellow like you  the whole party stared for the speaker of these words was none other than amyas himself who had rejoined them a bottle in each hand  no tom evans it has been share and share alike for three years and bravely you have all held up and share alike it shall be now and heres the handsel of it well serve out the good wine fairly all round as long as it lasts and then take to the bad but mind you dont get drunk my sons for we are much too short of hands to have any stout fellows lying about the scuppers  but what was the story of the intendants being murdered brimblecombe had seen him run into a neighboring cabin and when the door of it was opened there was the culprit but dead and cold with a deep knifewound in his side who could have done the deed it must have been tita whom brimblecombe had seen loose and trying to free her lover  the ship was searched from stem to stern but no tita the mystery was never explained that she had leapt overboard and tried to swim ashore none doubted but whether she had reached it who could tell one thing was strange that not only had she carried off no treasure with her but that the gold ornaments which she had worn the night before lay together in a heap on the table close by the murdered man had she wished to rid herself of everything which had belonged to her tyrants  the commandant heard the whole story thoughtfully  wretched man said he and he has a wife and children in seville  a wife and children said amyas and i heard him promise marriage to the indian girl  that was the only hint which gave a reason for his death what if in the terror of discovery and capture the scoundrel had dropped any selfcondemning words about his marriage any prayer for those whom he had left behind and the indian had overheard them it might be so at least sin had brought its own punishment  and so that wild night and day subsided the prisoners were kindly used enough for the englishman free from any petty love of tormenting knows no mean between killing a foe outright and treating him as a brother and when two days afterwards they were sent ashore in the canoes off cabo velo captives and captors shook hands all round and amyas after returning the commandant his sword and presenting him with a case of the bishops wine bowed him courteously over the side  i trust that you will pay us another visit valiant senor capitan said the spaniard bowing and smiling  i should most gladly accept your invitation illustrious senor commandant but as i have vowed henceforth whenever i shall meet a spaniard neither to give nor take quarter i trust that our paths to glory may lie in different directions  the commandant shrugged his shoulders the ship was put again before the wind and as the shores of the main faded lower and dimmer behind her a mighty cheer broke from all on board and for once the cry from every mouth was eastwardho  scrap by scrap as weakness and confusion of intellect permitted her lucy passmore told her story it was a simple one after all and amyas might almost have guessed it for himself rose had not yielded to the spaniard without a struggle he had visited her two or three times at lucys house how he found out lucys existence she herself could never tell unless from the jesuits before she agreed to go with him he had gained lucy to his side by huge promises of indian gold and in fine they had gone to lundy where the lovers were married by a priest who was none other lucy would swear than the shorter and stouter of the two who had carried off her husband and his boatin a word father parsons  amyas gnashed his teeth at the thought that he had had parsons in his power at brenttor down and let him go it was a fresh proof to him that heavens vengeance was upon him for letting one of its enemies escape though what good to rose or frank the hanging of parsons would have been i for my part cannot see  but when had eustace been at lundy lucy could throw no light on that matter it was evidently some bythread in the huge spiders web of jesuit intrigue which was perhaps not worth knowing after all  they sailed from lundy in a portugal ship were at lisbon a few days during which rose and lucy remained on board and then away for the west indies while all went merry as a marriage bell sir he would have kissed the dust off her dear feet till that evil eye of mr eustaces came no one knew how or whence and from that time all went wrong eustace got power over don guzman whether by threatening that the marriage should be dissolved whether by working on his superstitious scruples about leaving his wife still a heretic or whether and this last lucy much suspected by insinuations that her heart was still at home in england and that she was longing for amyas and his ship to come and take her home again the house soon became a den of misery and eustace the presiding evil genius don guzman had even commanded him to leave itand he went but somehow within a week he was there again in greater favor than ever then came preparations to meet the english and high words about it between don guzman and rose till a few days before amyass arrival the don had dashed out of the house in a fury saying openly that she preferred these lutheran dogs to him and that he would have their hearts blood first and hers after  the rest was soon told amyas knew but too much of it already the very morning after he had gone up to the villa lucy and her mistress were taken they knew not by whom down to the quay in the name of the holy office and shipped off to cartagena  there they were examined and confronted on a charge of witchcraft which the wretched lucy could not well deny she was tortured to make her inculpate rose and what she said or did not say under the torture the poor wretch could never tell she recanted and became a romanist rose remained firm three weeks afterwards they were brought out to an autodafe and there for the first time lucy saw frank walking dressed in a san benito in that ghastly procession lucy was adjudged to receive publicly two hundred stripes and to be sent to the holy house at seville to perpetual prison frank and rose with a renegade jew and a negro who had been convicted of practising obi were sentenced to death as impenitent and delivered over to the secular arm with prayers that there might be no shedding of blood in compliance with which request the jew and the negro were burnt at one stake frank and rose at another she thought they did not feel it more than twenty minutes they were both very bold and steadfast and held each others hand that she would swear to to the very last  and so ended lucy passmores story and if amyas leigh after he had heard it vowed afresh to give no quarter to spaniards wherever he should find them who can wonder even if they blame    chapter xxvii  how salvation yeo found his little maid again       all precious things discoverd late         to them who seek them issue forth      for love in sequel works with fate         and draws the veil from hidden worth                           the sleeping beauty  and so ayacanora took up her abode in lucys cabin as a regularly accredited member of the crew  but a most troublesome member for now began in her that perilous crisis which seems to endanger the bodies and souls of all savages and savage tribes when they first mingle with the white man that crisis which a few years afterwards began to hasten the extermination of the north american tribes and had it not been for the admirable good sense and constancy of amyas ayacanora might have ended even more miserably than did the farfamed pocahontas daughter of the virginian king who after having been received at court by the old pedant james the first with the honors of a sister sovereign and having become the reputed ancestress of more than one ancient virginian family ended her days in wretchedness in some wapping garret  for the mind of the savage crushed by the sight of the white mans superior skill and wealth and wisdom loses at first its selfrespect while his body pampered with easily obtained luxuries instead of having to win the necessaries of life by heavy toil loses its selfhelpfulness and with selfrespect and selfhelp vanish all the savage virtues few and flimsy as they are and the downward road toward begging and stealing sottishness and idleness is easy if not sure  and down that road it really seemed at first that poor ayacanora was walking fast for the warriorprophetess of the omaguas soon became to all appearance nothing but a very naughty child and the diana of the meta after she had satisfied her simple wonder at the great floating house by rambling from deck to deck and peeping into every cupboard and cranny manifested a great propensity to steal and hide she was too proud or too shy to ask for every trumpery which smit her fancy and when amyas forbade her to take anything without leave threatened to drown herself and went off and sulked all day in her cabin nevertheless she obeyed him except in the matter of sweet things perhaps she craved naturally for the vegetable food of her native forests at all events the bishops stores of fruit and sweetmeats diminished rapidly and what was worse so did the sweet spanish wine which amyas had set apart for poor lucys daily cordial whereon another severe lecture in which amyas told her how mean it was to rob poor sick lucy whereat she as usual threatened to drown herself and was running upon deck to do it when amyas caught her and forgave her on which a violent fit of crying and great penitence and promises and a week after amyas found that she had cheated satan and her own conscience by tormenting the portuguese steward into giving her some other wine instead but luckily for her she found amyass warnings about wine making her mad so far fulfilled that she did several foolish things one evening and had a bad headache next morning so the murder was out and amyas ordered the steward up for a sound flogging but ayacanora honorably enough not only begged him off but offered to be whipped instead of him confessing that the poor fellow spoke truly when he swore that she had threatened to kill him and that he had given her the wine in bodily fear for his life  however her own headache and amyass cold looks were lesson enough and after another attempt to drown herself the wilful beauty settled down for awhile and what was better could hardly be persuaded thenceforth to her dying day to touch fermented liquors  but in the meanwhile poor amyas had many a brainsbeating as to how he was to tame a lady who on the least provocation took refuge in suicide punish her he dared not even if he had the heart and as for putting her ashore he had an instinct and surely not a superstitious one that her strange affection for the english was not unsent by heaven and that god had committed her into his charge and that he would require an account at his hands of the soul of that fair lost lamb  so almost at his wits end he prayed to god good simple fellow and that many a time to show him what he should do with her before she killed either herself or what was just as likely one of the crew and it seemed best to him to make parson jack teach her the rudiments of christianity that she might be baptized in due time when they got home to england  but here arose a fresh troublefor she roundly refused to learn of jack or of any one but amyas himself while he had many a good reason for refusing the office of schoolmaster so for a week or two more ayacanora remained untaught save in the english tongue which she picked up with marvellous rapidity  and next as if troubles would never end she took a violent dislike not only to john brimblecombe whose gait and voice she openly mimicked for the edification of the men but also to will cary whom she never allowed to speak to her or approach her perhaps she was jealous of his intimacy with amyas or perhaps with the subtle instinct of a woman she knew that he was the only other man on board who might dare to make love to her though will to do him justice was as guiltless of any such intention as amyas himself but when she was remonstrated with her only answer was that cary was a cacique as well as amyas and that there ought not to be two caciques and one day she actually proposed to amyas to kill his supposed rival and take the ship all to himself and sulked for several days at hearing amyas amid shouts of laughter retail her precious advice to its intended victim  moreover the negroes came in for their share being regarded all along by her with an unspeakable repugnance which showed itself at first in hiding from them whenever she could and afterwards in throwing at them everything she could lay hands on till the poor quashies in danger of their lives complained to amyas and got rest for awhile  over the rest of the sailors she lorded it like a very princess calling them from their work to run on her errands and make toys for her enforcing her commands now and then by a shrewd box on the ears while the good fellows especially old yeo like true sailors petted her obeyed her even jested with her much as they might have done with a tame leopard whose claws might be unsheathed and about their ears at any moment but she amused them and amused amyas too they must of course have a pet and what prettier one could they have and as for amyas the constant interest of her presence even the constant anxiety of her wilfulness kept his mind busy and drove out many a sad foreboding about that meeting with his mother and the tragedy which he had to tell her which would otherwise so heavily did they weigh on him have crushed his spirit with melancholy and made all his worldly success and marvellous deliverance worthless in his eyes  at last the matter as most things luckily do came to a climax and it came in this way  the ship had been slipping along now for many a day slowly but steadily before a favorable breeze she had passed the ring of the west india islands and was now crawling safe from all pursuit through the vast weedbeds of the sargasso sea there for the first time it was thought safe to relax the discipline which had been hitherto kept up and to rummage as was the word in those days their noble prize what they found of gold and silver jewels and merchandise will interest no readers suffice it to say that there was enough there with the other treasure to make amyas rich for life after all claims of carys and the crew not forgetting mr salternes third as owner of the ship had been paid off but in the captains cabin were found two chests one full of gorgeous mexican feather dresses and the other of spanish and east indian finery which having come by way of havana and cartagena was going on it seemed to some senora or other at the caracas which two chests were at carys proposal voted amid the acclamations of the crew to ayacanora as her due and fit share of the pillage in consideration of her amazonian prowess and valuable services  so the poor child took greedy possession of the trumpery had them carried into lucys cabin and there knelt gloating over them many an hour the mexican work she chose to despise as savage but the spanish dresses were a treasure and for two or three days she appeared on the quarterdeck sunning herself like a peacock before the eyes of amyas in seville mantillas madrid hats indian brocade farthingales and i know not how many other gewgaws and dare not say how put on  the crew tittered amyas felt much more inclined to cry there is nothing so pathetic as a childs vanity saving a grown person aping a childs vanity and saving too a childs agony of disappointment when it finds that it has been laughed at instead of being admired amyas would have spoken but he was afraid however the evil brought its own cure the pageant went on as its actor thought most successfully for three days or so but at last the dupe unable to contain herself longer appealed to amyasayacanora quite english girl now is she notheard a titter behind her looked round saw a dozen honest faces in broad grin comprehended all in a moment darted down the companionladder and vanished  amyas fully expecting her to jump overboard followed as fast as he could but she had locked herself in with lucy and he could hear her violent sobs and lucys faint voice entreating to know what was the matter  in vain he knocked she refused to come out all day and at even they were forced to break the door open to prevent lucy being starved  there sat ayacanora her finery half torn off and scattered about the floor in spite crying still as if her heart would break while poor lucy cried too half from fright and hunger and half for company  amyas tried to comfort the poor child assured her that the men should never laugh at her again but then added he you must not be soso what to say he hardly knew  so what asked she crying more bitterly than ever  so like a wild girl ayacanora  her hands dropped on her knees a strong spasm ran through her throat and bosom and she fell on her knees before him and looked up imploringly in his face  yes wild girlpoor bad wild girl    but i will be english girl now  fine clothes will never make you english my child said amyas  no not english clothesenglish heart good heart like yours yes i will be good and sir john shall teach me  theres my good maid said amyas sir john shall begin and teach you tomorrow  no now now ayacanora cannot wait she will drown herself if she is bad another day come now  and she made him fetch brimblecombe heard the honest fellow patiently for an hour or more and told lucy that very night all that he had said and from that day whenever jack went in to read and pray with the poor sufferer ayacanora instead of escaping on deck as before stood patiently trying to make it all out and knelt when he knelt and tried to pray toothat she might have an english heart and doubtless her prayers dumb as they were were not unheard  so went on a few days more hopefully enough without any outbreak till one morning just after they had passed the sargassobeds the ship was taking care of herself the men were all on deck under the awning tinkering and cobbling and chatting brimblecombe was catechising his fair pupil in the cabin amyas and cary cigar in mouth were chatting about all heaven and earth and above all of the best way of getting up a fresh adventure against the spaniards as soon as they returned while amyas was pouring out to will that dark hatred of the whole nation that dark purpose of revenge for his brother and for rose which had settled down like a murky cloud into every cranny of his heart and mind suddenly there was a noise below a scuffle and a shout which made them both leap to their feet and up on deck rushed jack brimblecombe holding his head on with both his hands  save me save me from that shefiend she is possessed with a legion she has broken my nosetorn out half my hairand im sure i have none to spare here she comes stand by me gentlemen both satanas i defy thee and jack ensconced himself behind the pair as ayacanora whirled upon deck like a very maenad and seeing amyas stopped short  if you had defied satan down below there said cary with a laugh i suspect he wouldnt have broken out on you so boldly master jack  i am innocentinnocent as the babe unborn oh mr cary this is too bad of you sir quoth jack indignantly while amyas asked what was the matter  he looked at me said she sturdily  well a cat may look at a king  but he shant look at ayacanora nobody shall but you or ill kill him  in vain jack protested his innocence of having even looked at her the fancy and i verily believe it was nothing more had taken possession of her she refused to return below to her lesson jack went off grumbling minus his hair and wore a black eye for a week after  at all events quoth cary relighting his cigar its a fault on the right side  god give me grace or it may be one on the wrong side for me  he will old heartofoak said cary laying his arm around amyass neck to the evident disgust of ayacanora who went off to the side got a fishingline and began amusing herself therewith while the ship slipped on quietly and silently as ever save when ayacanora laughed and clapped her hands at the flyingfish scudding from the bonitos at last tired of doing nothing she went forward to the pooprail to listen to john squire the armorer who sat tinkering a headpiece and humming a song mutato nomine concerning his native place       oh bideford is a pleasant place it shines where it stands      and the more i look upon it the more my heart it warms      for there are fair young lasses in rows upon the quay      to welcome gallant mariners when they come home from say  tis sunderland john squire to the song and not bidevor said his mate  well bidevors so good as sunderland any day for all theres no saycoals there blacking a place about and makes just so good harmonies tommy hamblyn       oh if i was a herring to swim the ocean oer      or if i was a saydove to fly unto the shoor      to fly unto my true love a waiting at the door      to wed her with a goold ring and plough the main no moor  here yeo broke in  arent you ashamed john squire to your years singing such carnal vanities after all the providences you have seen let the songs of zion be in your mouth man if you must needs keep a caterwauling all day like that  you sing em yourself then gunner  well says yeo and why not and out he pulled his psalmbook and began a scrap of the grand old psalm       such as in ships and brittle barks         into the seas descend      their merchandise through fearful floods         to compass and to end      there men are forced to behold         the lords works what they be      and in the dreadful deep the same         most marvellous they see  humph said john squire very good and godly but still i du like a merry catch now and then i du wouldnt you let a body sing rumbeloweven when hes heaving of the anchor  well i dont know said yeo but the lords people had better praise the lord then too and pray for a good voyage instead of howling about         a randy dandy dandy o         a whet of ale and brandy o      with a rumbelow and a westwardho         and heave my mariners all o  is that fit talk for immortal souls how does that childstrade sound beside the psalms john squire  now it befell that salvation yeo for the very purpose of holding up to ridicule that timehonored melody had put into it the true nasal twang and rung it out as merrily as he had done perhaps twelve years before when he got up john oxenhams anchor in plymouth sound and it befell also that ayacanora as she stood by amyass side watching the men and trying to make out their chat heard it and started and then half to herself took up the strain and sang it over again word for word in the very same tune and tone  salvation yeo started in his turn and turned deadly pale  who sung that he asked quickly  the little maid here shes coming on nicely in her english said amyas  the little maid said yeo turning paler still why do you go about to scare an old servant by talking of little maids captain amyas well he said aloud to himself as i am a sinful saint if i hadnt seen where the voice came from i could have sworn it was her just as we taught her to sing it by the river there i and william penberthy of marazion my good comrade the lord have mercy on me  all were silent as the grave whenever yeo made any allusion to that lost child ayacanora only pleased with amyass commendation went humming on to herself       and heave my mariners all o  yeo started up from the gun where he sat  i cant abear it as i live i cant you indian maiden where did you learn to sing that there  ayacanora looked up at him half frightened by his vehemence then at amyas to see if she had been doing anything wrong and then turned saucily away looked over the side and hummed on  ask her for mercys sakeask her captain leigh  my child said amyas speaking in indian how is it you sing that so much better than any other english did you ever hear it before  ayacanora looked up at him puzzled and shook her head and then  if you tell indian to ayacanora she dumb she must be english girl now like poor lucy  well then said amyas do you recollect ayacanorado you recollectwhat shall i say anything that happened when you were a little girl  she paused awhile and then moving her hands overhead  treesgreat trees like the magdalenaalways nothing but treeswild and bad everything ayacanora wont talk about that  do you mind anything that grew on those trees asked yeo eagerly  she laughed silly flowers and fruit and nutsgrow on all trees and monkeycups too ayacanora climbed up after themwhen she was wild i wont tell any more  but who taught you to call them monkeycups asked yeo trembling with excitement  monkeys drink mono drink  mono said yeo foiled on one cast and now trying another how did you know the beasts were called monos  she might have heard it coming down with us said cary who had joined the group  ay monos said she in a selfjustifying tone faces like little men and tails and one very dirty black one with a beard say amen in a tree to all the other monkeys just like sir john on sunday  this allusion to brimblecombe and the preaching apes upset all but old yeo  but dont you recollect any christianswhite people  she was silent  dont you mind a white lady  um  a woman a very pretty woman with hair like his pointing to amyas  no  what do you mind then beside those indians added yeo in despair  she turned her back on him peevishly as if tired with the efforts of her memory  do try to remember said amyas and she set to work again at once  ayacanora mind great monkeysblack oh so high and she held up her hand above her head and made a violent gesture of disgust  monkeys what with tails  no like man ah yesjust like cooky theredirty cooky  and that hapless son of ham who happened to be just crossing the maindeck heard a marlingspike which by ill luck was lying at hand flying past his ears  ayacanora if you heave any more things at cooky i must have you whipped said amyas without of course any such intention  ill kill you then answered she in the most matteroffact tone  she must mean negurs said yeo i wonder where she saw them now what if it were they cimaroons  but why should any one who had seen whites forget them and yet remember negroes asked cary  let us try again do you mind no great monkeys but those black ones asked amyas  yes she said after a whiledevil  devil asked all three who of course were by no means free from the belief that the fiend did actually appear to the indian conjurors such as had brought up the girl  ay him sir john tell about on sundays  save and help us said yeo and what was he like unto  she made various signs to intimate that he had a monkeys face and a gray beard like yeos so far so good but now came a series of manipulations about her pretty little neck which set all their fancies at fault  i know said cary at last bursting into a great laugh sir urian had a ruff on as i live trunkhose too my fair dame stopill make sure was his neck like the senor commandants the spaniard  ayacanora clapped her hands at finding herself understood and the questioning went on  the devil appeared like a monkey with a gray beard in a ruffhumph  ay said she in good enough spanish mono de panama viejo diablo de panama  yeo threw up his hands with a shriekoh lord of all mercies those were the last words of mr john oxenham ayand the devil is surely none other than the devil don francisco xararte oh dear oh dear oh dear my sweet young lady my pretty little maid and dont you know me dont you know salvation yeo that carried you over the mountains and used to climb for the monkeycups for you my dear young lady and william penberthy too that used to get you flowers and your poor dear father that was just like mr cary there only he had a black beard and black curls and swore terribly in his speech like a spaniard my dear young lady  and the honest fellow falling on his knees covered ayacanoras hands with kisses while all the crew fancying him gone suddenly mad crowded aft  steady men and dont vex him said amyas he thinks that he has found his little maid at last  and so do i amyas as i live said cary  steady steady my masters all if this turn out a wrong scent after all his wits will crack mr yeo cant you think of any other token  yeo stamped impatiently what need then its her i tell ye and thats enough what a beauty shes grown oh dear where were my eyes all this time to behold her and not to see her tis her very mortal self it is and dont you mind me my dear now dont you mind salvation yeo that taught you to sing heave my mariners all o asitting on a log by the boat upon the sand and there was a sight of red lilies grew on it in the moss dear now wasnt there and we made posies of them to put in your hair nowand the poor old man ran on in a supplicating suggestive tone as if he could persuade the girl into becoming the person whom he sought  ayacanora had watched him first angry then amused then attentive and at last with the most intense earnestness suddenly she grew crimson and snatching her hands from the old mans hid her face in them and stood  do you remember anything of all this my child asked amyas gently  she lifted up her eyes suddenly to his with a look of imploring agony as if beseeching him to spare her the death of a whole old life the birth of a whole new life was struggling in that beautiful face choking in that magnificent throat as she threw back her small head and drew in her breath and dashed her locks back from her temples as if seeking for fresh air she shuddered reeled then fell weeping on the bosom not of salvation yeo but of amyas leigh  he stood still a minute or two bearing that fair burden ere he could recollect himself then  ayacanora you are not yet mistress of yourself my child you were better to go down and see after poor lucy and we will talk about it all tomorrow  she gathered herself up instantly and with eyes fixed on the deck slid through the group and disappeared below  ah said yeo with a tone of exquisite sadness the young to the young over land and sea in the forests and in the galleys in battle and prison i have sought her and now  my good friend said amyas neither are you master of yourself yet when she comes round again whom will she love and thank but you  you sir she owes all to you and so do i let me go below sir my old wits are shaky bless you sir and thank you for ever and ever  and yeo grasped amyass hand and went down to his cabin from which he did not reappear for many hours  from that day ayacanora was a new creature the thought that she was an englishwoman that she the wild indian was really one of the great white people whom she had learned to worship carried in it some regenerating change she regained all her former stateliness and with it a selfrestraint a temperance a softness which she had never shown before her dislike to cary and jack vanished modest and distant as ever she now took delight in learning from them about england and english people and her knowledge of our customs gained much from the somewhat fantastic behaviour which amyas thought good for reasons of his own to assume toward her he assigned her a handsome cabin to herself always addressed her as madam and told cary brimblecombe and the whole crew that as she was a lady and a christian he expected them to behave to her as such so there was as much bowing and scraping on the poop as if it had been a princes court and ayacanora though sorely puzzled and chagrined at amyass new solemnity contrived to imitate it pretty well taking for granted that it was the right thing and having tolerable masters in the art of manners for both amyas and cary were thoroughly wellbred men profited much in all things except in intimacy with amyas who had cunning fellow hit on this parade of good manners as a fresh means of increasing the distance between him and her the crew of course though they were a little vexed at losing their pet consoled themselves with the thought that she was a real born lady and mr oxenhams daughter too and there was not a man on board who did not prick up his ears for a message if she approached him or one who would not have i verily believe jumped overboard to do her a pleasure  only yeo kept sorrowfully apart he never looked at her spoke to her met her even if he could his dream had vanished he had found her and after all she did not care for him why should she  but it was hard to have hunted a bubble for years and have it break in his hand at last set not your affections on things on the earth murmured yeo to himself as he pored over his bible in the vain hope of forgetting his little maid  but why did amyas wish to increase the distance between himself and ayacanora many reasons might be given i deny none of them but the main one fantastic as it may seem was simply that while she had discovered herself to be an englishwoman he had discovered her to be a spaniard if her father were seven times john oxenham and even that the perverse fellow was inclined to doubt her mother was a spaniardpah one of the accursed race kinswomanperhaps to his brothers murderers his jaundiced eyes could see nothing but the spanish element in her or indeed in anything else as cary said to him once using a cant phrase of sidneys which he had picked up from frank all heaven and earth were spaniolated to him he seemed to recollect nothing but that heaven had made spaniards to be killed and him to kill them if he had not been the most sensible of john bulls he would certainly have forestalled the monomania of that young frenchman of rank who some eighty years after him so maddened his brain by reading of the spanish cruelties that he threw up all his prospects and turned captain of filibusters in the west indies for the express purpose of ridding them of their tyrants and when a spanish ship was taken used to relinquish the whole booty to his crew and reserve for himself only the pleasure of witnessing his victims dying agonies  but what had become of that birdlike song of ayacanoras which had astonished them on the banks of the meta and cheered them many a time in their anxious voyage down the magdalena from the moment that she found out her english parentage it stopped she refused utterly to sing anything but the songs and psalms which she picked up from the english whether it was that she despised it as a relic of her barbarism or whether it was too maddening for one whose heart grew heavier and humbler day by day the nightingale notes were heard no more  so homeward they ran before a favoring southwest breeze but long ere they were within sight of land lucy passmore was gone to her rest beneath the atlantic waves    chapter xxviii  how amyas came home the third time       it fell about the martinmas          when nights were lang and mirk      that wifes twa sons cam hame again          and their hats were o the birk       it did na graw by bush or brae          nor yet in ony shough      but by the gates o paradise          that birk grew fair eneugh                  the wife of ushers well  it is the evening of the 15th of february 1587 and mrs leigh for we must return now to old scenes and old faces is pacing slowly up and down the terracewalk at burrough looking out over the winding river and the hazy sandhills and the wide western sea as she has done every evening be it fair weather or foul for three weary years three years and more are past and gone and yet no news of frank and amyas and the gallant ship and all the gallant souls therein and loving eyes in bideford and appledore clovelly and ilfracombe have grown hollow with watching and with weeping for those who have sailed away into the west as john oxenham sailed before them and have vanished like a dream as he did into the infinite unknown three weary years and yet no word once there was a flush of hope and good sir richard without mrs leighs knowledge had sent a horseman posting across to plymouth when the news arrived that drake frobisher and carlisle had returned with their squadron from the spanish main alas he brought back great news glorious news news of the sacking of cartagena san domingo saint augustine of the relief of raleighs virginian colony but no news of the rose and of those who had sailed in her and mrs leigh bowed her head and worshipped and said the lord gave and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord  her hair was now grown gray her cheeks were wan her step was feeble she seldom went from home save to the church and to the neighboring cottages she never mentioned her sons names never allowed a word to pass her lips which might betoken that she thought of them but every day when the tide was high and red flag on the sandhills showed that there was water over the bar she paced the terracewalk and devoured with greedy eyes the sea beyond in search of the sail which never came the stately ships went in and out as of yore and white sails hung off the bar for many an hour day after day month after month year after year but an instinct within told her that none of them were the sails she sought she knew that ship every line of her the cut of every cloth she could have picked it out miles away among a whole fleet but it never came and mrs leigh bowed her head and worshipped and went to and fro among the poor who looked on her as an awful being and one whom god had brought very near to himself in that mysterious heaven of sorrow which they too knew full well and lone women and bedridden men looked in her steadfast eyes and loved them and drank in strength from them for they knew though she never spoke of her own grief that she had gone down into the fiercest depths of the fiery furnace and was walking there unhurt by the side of one whose form was as of the son of god and all the while she was blaming herself for her earthly longings and confessing nightly to heaven that weakness which she could not shake off which drew her feet at each high tide to the terracewalk beneath the row of windclipt trees  but this evening northam is in a stir the pebble ridge is thundering far below as it thundered years ago but northam is noisy enough without the rolling of the surge the tower is rocking with the pealing bells the people are all in the streets shouting and singing round bonfires they are burning the pope in effigy drinking to the queens health and so perish all her enemies the hills are red with bonfires in every village and far away the bells of bideford are answering the bells of northam as they answered them seven years ago when amyas returned from sailing round the world for this day has come the news that mary queen of scots is beheaded in fotheringay and all england like a dreamer who shakes off some hideous nightmare has leapt up in one tremendous shout of jubilation as the terror and the danger of seventeen anxious years is lifted from its heart for ever  yes she is gone to answer at a higher tribunal than that of the estates of england for all the noble english blood which has been poured out for her for all the noble english hearts whom she has tempted into treachery rebellion and murder elizabeths own words have been fulfilled at last after years of longsuffering       the daughter of debate        that discord aye doth sow      hath reapd no gain where former rule        hath taught still peace to grow  and now she can do evil no more murder and adultery the heart which knew no forgiveness the tongue which could not speak truth even for its own interest have past and are perhaps atoned for and her fair face hangs a pitiful dream in the memory even of those who knew that either she or england must perish       nothing is left of her      now but pure womanly  and mrs leigh protestant as she is breathes a prayer that the lord may have mercy on that soul as clear as diamond and as hard as she said of herself that last scene too before the fatal blockit could not be altogether acting mrs leigh had learned many a priceless lesson in the last seven years might not mary stuart have learned something in seventeen and mrs leigh had been a courtier and knew as far as a chaste englishwoman could know which even in those coarser days was not very much of that godless style of french court profligacy in which poor mary had had her youthful training amid the medicis and the guises and cardinal lorraine and she shuddered and sighed to herselfto whom little is given of them shall little be required but still the bells pealed on and would not cease  what was that which answered them from afar out of the fast darkening twilight a flash and then the thunder of a gun at sea  mrs leigh stopped the flash was right outside the bar a ship in distress it could not be the wind was light and westerly it was a high springtide as evening floods are always there what could it be another flash another gun the noisy folks of northam were hushed at once and all hurried into the churchyard which looks down on the broad flats and the river  there was a gallant ship outside the bar she was running in too with all sails set a large ship nearly a thousand tons she might be but not of english rig what was the meaning of it a spanish cruiser about to make reprisals for drakes raid along the cadiz shore not that surely the don had no fancy for such unscientific and daredevil warfare if he came he would come with admiral rearadmiral and viceadmiral transports and avisos according to the bestapproved methods articles and science of war what could she be  easily on the flowing tide and fair western wind she has slipped up the channel between the two lines of sandhill she is almost off appledore now she is no enemy and if she be a foreigner she is a daring one for she has never veiled her topsailsand that all know every foreign ship must do within sight of an english port or stand the chance of war as the spanish admiral found who many a year since was sent in time of peace to fetch home from flanders anne of austria philip the seconds last wife  for in his pride he sailed into plymouth sound without veiling topsails or lowering the flag of spain whereon like lion from his den out rushed john hawkins the port admiral in his famous jesus of lubec afterwards lost in the san juan dulloa fight and without argument or parley sent a shot between the admirals masts which not producing the desired effect alongside ran bold captain john and with his next shot so says his son an eyewitness lackt the admiral through and through whereon down came the offending flag and due apologies were made but not accepted for a long time by the stout guardian of her majestys honor and if john hawkins did as much for a spanish fleet in time of peace there is more than one old seadog in appledore who will do as much for a single ship in time of war if he can find even an iron pot to burn powder withal  the strange sail passed out of sight behind the hill of appledore and then there rose into the quiet evening air a cheer as from a hundred throats mrs leigh stood still and listened another gun thundered among the hills and then another cheer  it might have been twenty minutes before the vessel hove in sight again round the dark rocks of the hubbastone as she turned up the bideford river mrs leigh had stood that whole time perfectly motionless a pale and scarcely breathing statue her eyes fixed upon the vikings rock  round the hubbastone she came at last there was music on board drums and fifes shawms and trumpets which wakened ringing echoes from every knoll of wood and slab of slate and as she opened full on burrough house another cheer burst from her crew and rolled up to the hills from off the silver waters far below full a mile away  mrs leigh walked quickly toward the house and called her maid  grace bring me my hood master amyas is come home  no surely o joyful sound praised and blessed be the lord then praised and blessed be the lord but madam however did you know that  i heard his voice on the river but i did not hear mr franks with him grace  oh be sure madam where the one is the other is theyd never part company both come home or neither ill warrant heres your hood madam  and mrs leigh with grace behind her started with rapid steps towards bideford  was it true was it a dream had the divine instinct of the mother enabled her to recognize her childs voice among all the rest and at that enormous distance or was her brain turning with the long effort of her supernatural calm  grace asked herself in her own way that same question many a time between burrough and bideford when they arrived on the quay the question answered itself  as they came down bridgeland street where afterwards the tobacco warehouses for the virginia trade used to stand but which then was but a row of ropewalks and sailmakers shops they could see the strange ship already at anchor in the river they had just reached the lower end of the street when round the corner swept a great mob sailors women prentices hurrahing questioning weeping laughing mrs leigh stopped and behold they stopped also  here she is shouted some one heres his mother  his mother not their mother said mrs leigh to herself and turned very pale but that heart was long past breaking  the next moment the giant head and shoulders of amyas far above the crowd swept round the corner  make a way make room for madam leighand amyas fell on his knees at her feet  she threw her arms round his neck and bent her fair head over his while sailors prentices and coarse harborwomen were hushed into holy silence and made a ring round the mother and the son  mrs leigh asked no question she saw that amyas was alone  at last he whispered i would have died to save him mother if i could  you need not tell me that amyas leigh my son  another silence  how did he die whispered mrs leigh  he is a martyr he died in the  amyas could say no more  the inquisition  yes  a strong shudder passed through mrs leighs frame and then she lifted up her head  come home amyas i little expected such an honorsuch an honorha ha and such a fair young martyr too a very st stephen god have mercy on me and let me not go mad before these folk when i ought to be thanking thee for thy great mercies amyas who is that  and she pointed to ayacanora who stood close behind amyas watching with keen eyes the whole  she is a poor wild indian girlmy daughter i call her i will tell you her story hereafter  your daughter my granddaughter then come hither maiden and be my granddaughter  ayacanora came obedient and knelt down because she had seen amyas kneel  god forbid child kneel not to me come home and let me know whether i am sane or mazed alive or dead  and drawing her hood over her face she turned to go back holding amyas tight by one hand and ayacanora by the other  the crowd let them depart some twenty yards in respectful silence and then burst into a cheer which made the old town ring  mrs leigh stopped suddenly  i had forgotten amyas you must not let me stand in the way of your duty where are your men  kissed to death by this time all of them that is who are left  left  we went out a hundred mother and we came home fortyfourif we are at home is it a dream mother is this you and this old bridgeland street again as i live there stands evans the smith at his door tankard in hand as he did when i was a boy  the brawny smith came across the street to them but stopped when he saw amyas but no frank  better one than neither madam said he trying a rough comfort amyas shook his hand as he passed him but mrs leigh neither heard nor saw him nor any one  mother said amyas when they were now past the causeway we are rich for life  yes a martyrs death was the fittest for him  i have brought home treasure untold  what my boy  treasure untold cary has promised to see to it tonight  very well i would that he had slept at our house he was a kindly lad and loved frank when did he  three years ago and more within two months of our sailing  ah yes he told me so  told you so  yes the dear lad has often come to see me in my sleep but you never came i guessed how it wasas it should be  but i loved you none the less mother  i know that too but you were busy with the men you know sweet so your spirit could not come roving home like his which was free yesall as it should be my maid and do you not find it cold here in england after those hot regions  ayacanoras heart is warm she does not think about cold  warm perhaps you will warm my heart for me then  would god i could do it mother said amyas half reproachfully  mrs leigh looked up in his face and burst into a violent flood of tears  sinful sinful that i am  blessed creature cried amyas if you speak so i shall go mad mother mother i have been dreading this meeting for months it has been a nightmare hanging over me like a horrible black thundercloud a great cliff miles high with its top hid in the clouds which i had to climb and dare not i have longed to leap overboard and flee from it like a coward into the depths of the seathe thought that you might ask me whether i was not my brothers keeperthat you might require his blood at my handsand now now when it comes to find you all love and trust and patiencemother mother its more than i can bear and he wept violently  mrs leigh knew enough of amyas to know that any burst of this kind from his quiet nature betokened some very fearful struggle and the loving creature forgot everything instantly in the one desire to soothe him  and soothe him she did and home the two went arm in arm together while ayacanora held fast like a child by the skirt of mrs leighs cloak the selfhelp and daring of the forest nymph had given place to the trembling modesty of the young girl suddenly cast on shore in a new world among strange faces strange hopes and strange fears also  will your mother love me whispered she to amyas as she went in  yes but you must do what she tells you  ayacanora pouted  she will laugh at me because i am wild  she never laughs at any one  humph said ayacanora well i shall not be afraid of her i thought she would have been tall like you but she is not even as big as me  this hardly sounded hopeful for the prospect of ayacanoras obedience but ere twentyfour hours had passed mrs leigh had won her over utterly and she explained her own speech by saying that she thought so great a man ought to have a great mother she had expected poor thing in her simplicity some awful princess with a frown like junos own and found instead a healing angel  her story was soon told to mrs leigh who of course womanlike would not allow a doubt as to her identity and the sweet mother never imprinted a prouder or fonder kiss upon her sons forehead than that with which she repaid his simple declaration that he had kept unspotted like a gentleman and a christian the soul which god had put into his charge  then you have forgiven me mother  years ago i said in this same room what should i render to the lord for having given me two such sons and in this room i say it once again tell me all about my other son that i may honor him as i honor you  and then with the iron nerve which good women have she made him give her every detail of lucy passmores story and of all which had happened from the day of their sailing to that luckless night at guayra and when it was done she led ayacanora out and began busying herself about the girls comforts as calmly as if frank and amyas had been sleeping in their cribs in the next room  but she had hardly gone upstairs when a loud knock at the door was followed by its opening hastily and into the hall burst regardless of etiquette the tall and stately figure of sir richard grenville  amyas dropped on his knees instinctively the stern warrior was quite unmanned and as he bent over his godson a tear dropped from that iron cheek upon the iron cheek of amyas leigh  my lad my glorious lad and where have you been get up and tell me all the sailors told me a little but i must hear every word i knew you would do something grand i told your mother you were too good a workman for god to throw away now let me have the whole story why i am out of breath to tell truth i ran threeparts of the way hither  and down the two sat and amyas talked long into the night while sir richard his usual stateliness recovered smiled stern approval at each deed of daring and when all was ended answered with something like a sigh  would god that i had been with you every step would god at least that i could show as good a threeyears logbook amyas my lad  you can show a better one i doubt not  humph with the exception of one paltry spanish prize i dont know that the queen is the better or her enemies the worse for me since we parted last in dublin city  you are too modest sir  would that i were but i got on in ireland i found no better than my neighbors and so came home again to find that while i had been wasting my time in that land of misrule raleigh had done a deed to which i can see no end for lad he has found or rather his two captains amadas and barlow have found for him between florida and newfoundland a country the like of which i believe there is not on the earth for climate and fertility whether there be gold there i know not and it matters little for there is all else on earth that man can want furs timber rivers game sugarcanes corn fruit and every commodity which france spain or italy can yield wild in abundance the savages civil enough for savages and in a word all which goes to the making of as noble a jewel as her majestys crown can wear the people call it wingandacoa but we after her majesty virginia  you have been there then  the year before last lad and left there ralf lane amadas and some twenty gentlemen and ninety men and moreover some money of my own and some of old will salternes which neither of us will ever see again for the colony i know not how quarrelled with the indians i fear i too was oversharp with some of them for stealingif i was god forgive me and could not forsooth keep themselves alive for twelve months so that drake coming back from his last west indian voyage after giving them all the help he could had to bring the whole party home and if you will believe it the fainthearted fellows had not been gone a fortnight before i was back again with three ships and all that they could want and never was i more wroth in my life when all i found was the ruins of their huts which so rich is the growth there were already full of great melons and wild deer feeding thereona pretty sight enough but not what i wanted just then so back i came and being in no overgood temper vented my humors on the portugals at the azores and had hard fights and small booty so there the matter stands but not for long for shame it were if such a paradise once found by britons should fall into the hands of any but her majesty and we will try again this spring if men and money can be found eh lad  but the prize  ah that was no small makeweight to our disasters after all i sighted her for six days sail from the american coast but ere we could lay her aboard it fell dead calm never a boat had i on boardthey were all lost in a gale of windand the other ships were becalmed two leagues astern of me there was no use lying there and pounding her till she sank so i called the carpenter got up all the old chests and with them and some spars we floated ourselves alongside and only just in time for the last of us had hardly scrambled up into the chains when our crazy noahs ark went all aboard and sank at the side so that if we had been minded to run away amyas we could not whereon judging valor to be the better part of discretion as i usually do we fell to with our swords and had her in five minutes and fifty thousand pounds worth in her which set up my purse again and raleighs too though i fear it has run out again since as fast as it ran in  and so ended sir richards story  amyas went the next day to salterne and told his tale the old man had heard the outlines of it already but he calmly bade him sit down and listened to all his chin upon his hand his elbows on his knees his cheek never blanched his lips never quivered throughout only when amyas came to roses marriage he heaved a long breath as if a weight was taken off his heart  say that again sir  amyas said it again and then went on faltering he hinted at the manner of her death  go on sir why are you afraid there is nothing to be ashamed of there is there  amyas told the whole with downcast eyes and then stole a look at his hearers face there was no sign of emotion only somewhat of a proud smile curled the corners of that iron mouth  and her husband asked he after a pause  i am ashamed to have to tell you sir that the man still lives  still lives sir  too true as far as i know that it was not my fault my story bears me witness  sir i never doubted your will to kill him still lives you say well so do rats and adders and now i suppose captain leigh your worship is minded to recruit yourself on shore a while with the fair lass whom you have brought home as i hear before having another dash at the devil and his kin  do not mention that young ladys name with mine sir she is no more to me than she is to you for she has spanish blood in her veins  salterne smiled grimly  but i am minded at least to do one thing mr salterne and that is to kill spaniards in fair fight by land and sea wheresoever i shall meet them and therefore i stay not long here whithersoever i may be bound next  well sir when you start come to me for a ship and the best i have is at your service and if she do not suit command her to be fitted as you like best and i william salterne will pay for all which you shall command to be done  my good sir i have accounts to square with you after a very different fashion as partadventurer in the rose i have to deliver to you your share of the treasure which i have brought home  my share sir if i understood you my ship was lost off the coast of the caracas three years agone and this treasure was all won since  true but you as an adventurer in the expedition have a just claim for your share and will receive it  captain leigh you are i see as your father was before you a just and upright christian man but sir this money is none of mine for it was won in no ship of minehear me sir and if it had been and that shiphe could not speak her namelay safe and sound now by bideford quay do you think sir that william salterne is the man to make money out of his daughters sin and sorrow and to handle the price of blood no sir you went like a gentleman to seek her and like a gentleman as all the world knows you have done your best and i thank you but our account ends there the treasure is yours sir i have enough and more than enough and none god help me to leave it to but greedy and needy kin who will be rather the worse than the better for it and if i have a claim in law for aughtwhich i know not neither shall ever askwhy if you are not too proud accept that claim as a plain burghers thankoffering to you sir for a great and a noble love which you and your brother have shown to one who though i say it to my shame was not worthy thereof  she was worthy of that and more sir for if she sinned like a woman she died like a saint  yes sir answered the old man with a proud smile she had the right english blood in her i doubt not and showed it at the last but now sir no more of this when you need a ship mine is at your service till then sir farewell and god be with you  and the old man rose and with an unmoved countenance bowed amyas to the door amyas went back and told cary bidding him take half of salternes gift but cary swore a great oath that he would have none of it  heir of clovelly amyas and want to rob you i who have lost nothingyou who have lost a brother god forbid that i should ever touch a farthing beyond my original share  that evening a messenger from bideford came running breathless up to burrough court the authorities wanted amyass immediate attendance for he was one of the last it seemed who had seen mr salterne alive  salterne had gone over as soon as amyas departed to an old acquaintance signed and sealed his will in their presence with a firm and cheerful countenance refusing all condolence and then gone home and locked himself into roses room suppertime came and he did not appear the apprentices could not make him answer and at last called in the neighbors and forced the door salterne was kneeling by his daughters bed his head was upon the coverlet his prayerbook was open before him at the burial service his hands were clasped in supplication but he was dead and cold  his will lay by him he had left all his property among his poor relations saving and excepting all money etc due to him as owner and partadventurer of the ship rose and his new bark of three hundred tons burden now lying eastthewater all which was bequeathed to captain amyas leigh on condition that he should rechristen that bark the vengeancefit her out with part of the treasure and with her sail once more against the spaniard before three years were past  and this was the end of william salterne merchant    chapter xxix  how the virginia fleet was stopped by the queens command       the daughter of debate         that discord still doth sow      shall reap no gain where former rule         hath taught still peace to grow      no foreign banishd wight         shall anker in this port      our realm it brooks no strangers force         let them elsewhere resort                          qu elizabeth 1569  and now amyas is settled quietly at home again and for the next twelve months little passes worthy of record in these pages yeo has installed himself as major domo with no very definite functions save those of walking about everywhere at amyass heels like a lank gray wolfhound and spending his evenings at the fireside as a true old sailor does with his bible on his knee and his hands busy in manufacturing numberless nicknacks useful and useless for every member of the family and above all for ayacanora whom he insults every week by humbly offering some toy only fit for a child at which she pouts and is reproved by mrs leigh and then takes the gift and puts it away never to look at it again for her whole soul is set upon being an english maid and she runs about all day long after mrs leigh insisting upon learning the mysteries of the kitchen and the stillroom and above all the art of making clothes for herself and at last for everybody in northam for first she will be a good housewife like mrs leigh and next a new idea has dawned on her that of helping others to the boundless hospitality of the savage she has been of course accustomed but to give to those who can give nothing in return is a new thought she sees mrs leigh spending every spare hour in working for the poor and visiting them in their cottages she sees amyas after public thanks in church for his safe return giving away money food what not in northam appledore and bideford buying cottages and making them almshouses for wornout mariners and she is told that this is his thankoffering to god she is puzzled her notion of a thankoffering was rather that of the indians and indeed of the spaniardssacrifices of human victims and the bedizenment of the great spirits sanctuary with their skulls and bones not that amyas as a plain oldfashioned churchman was unmindful of the good old instinctive rule that something should be given to the church itself for the vicar of northam was soon resplendent with a new surplice and what was more the altar with a splendid flagon and salver of plate lost i suppose in the civil wars which had been taken in the great galleon ayacanora could understand that but the almsgiving she could not till mrs leigh told her in her simple way that whosoever gave to the poor gave to the great spirit for the great spirit was in them and in ayacanora too if she would be quiet and listen to him instead of pouting and stamping and doing nothing but what she liked and the poor child took in that new thought like a child and worked her fingers to the bone for all the old dames in northam and went about with mrs leigh lovely and beloved and looked now and then out from under her long black eyelashes to see if she was winning a smile from amyas and on the day on which she won one she was good all day and on the day on which she did not she was thoroughly naughty and would have worn out the patience of any soul less chastened than mrs leighs but as for the pomp and glory of her dress there was no keeping it within bounds and she swept into church each sunday bedizened in spanish finery with such a blaze and rustle that the good vicar had to remonstrate humbly with mrs leigh on the disturbance which she caused to the eyes and thoughts of all his congregation to which ayacanora answered that she was not thinking about them and they need not think about her and that if the piache in plain english the conjuror as she supposed wanted a present he might have all her mexican featherdresses she would not wear themthey were wild indian things and she was an english maidbut they would just do for a piache and so darted upstairs brought them down and insisted so stoutly on arraying the vicar therein that the good man beat a swift retreat but he carried off with him nevertheless one of the handsomest mantles which instead of selling it he converted cleverly enough into an altarcloth and for several years afterwards the communion at northam was celebrated upon a blaze of emerald azure and crimson which had once adorned the sinful body of some aztec prince  so ayacanora flaunted on while amyas watched her half amused half in simple pride of her beauty and looked around at all gazers as much as to say see what a fine bird i have brought home  another great trouble which she gave mrs leigh was her conduct to the ladies of the neighborhood they came of course one and all not only to congratulate mrs leigh but to get a peep at the fair savage but the fair savage snubbed them all round from the vicars wife to lady grenville herself so effectually that few attempted a second visit  mrs leigh remonstrated and was answered by floods of tears they only come to stare at a poor wild indian girl and she would not be made a show of she was like a queen once and every one obeyed her but here every one looked down upon her but when mrs leigh asked her whether she would sooner go back to the forests the poor girl clung to her like a baby and entreated not to be sent away she would sooner be a slave in the kitchen here than go back to the bad people  and so on month after month of foolish storm and foolish sunshine but she was under the shadow of one in whom was neither storm nor sunshine but a perpetual genial calm of soft gray weather which tempered down to its own peacefulness all who entered its charmed influence and the outbursts grew more and more rare and ayacanora more and more rational though no more happy day by day  and one by one small hints came out which made her identity certain at least in the eyes of mrs leigh and yeo after she had become familiar with the sight of houses she gave them to understand that she had seen such things before the red cattle too seemed not unknown to her the sheep puzzled her for some time and at last she gave mrs leigh to understand that they were too small  ah madam quoth yeo who caught at every straw it is because she has been accustomed to those great camel sheep llamas they call them in peru  but ayacanoras delight was a horse the use of tame animals at all was a daily wonder to her but that a horse could be ridden was the crowning miracle of all and a horse she would ride and after plaguing amyas for one in vain for he did not want to break her pretty neck she proposed confidentially to yeo to steal one and foiled in that went to the vicar and offered to barter all her finery for his brokenkneed pony but the vicar was too honest to drive so good a bargain and the matter ended in amyas buying her a jennet which she learned in a fortnight to ride like a very gaucho  and now awoke another curious slumbering reminiscence for one day at lady grenvilles invitation the whole family went over to stow mrs leigh soberly on a pillion behind the groom ayacanora cantering round and round upon the moors like a hound let loose and trying to make amyas ride races with her but that night sleeping in the same room with mrs leigh she awoke shrieking and sobbed out a long story how the old ape of panama her especial abomination had come to her bedside and dragged her forth into the courtyard and how she had mounted a horse and ridden with an indian over great moors and high mountains down into a dark wood and there the indian and the horses vanished and she found herself suddenly changed once more into a little savage child so strong was the impression that she could not be persuaded that the thing had not happened if not that night at least some night or other so mrs leigh at last believed the same and told the company next morning in her pious way how the lord had revealed in a vision to the poor child who she was and how she had been exposed in the forests by her jealous stepfather and neither sir richard nor his wife could doubt but that hers was the true solution it was probable that don xararte though his home was panama had been often at quito for yeo had seen him come on board the lima ship at guayaquil one of the nearest ports this would explain her having been found by the indians beyond cotopaxi the nearest peak of the eastern andes if as was but too likely the old man believing her to be oxenhams child had conceived the fearful vengeance of exposing her in the forests  other little facts came to light one by one they were all connected as was natural in a savage with some animal or other natural object whatever impressions her morals or affections had received had been erased by the long spiritual death of that forest sojourn and mrs leigh could not elicit from her a trace of feeling about her mother or recollection of any early religious teaching this link however was supplied at last and in this way  sir richard had brought home an indian with him from virginia of his original name i am not sure but he was probably the wanchese whose name occurs with that of manteo  this man was to be baptized in the church at bideford by the name of raleigh his sponsors being most probably raleigh himself who may have been there on virginian business and sir richard grenville all the notabilities of bideford came of course to see the baptism of the first red man whose foot had ever trodden british soil and the mayor and corporationmen appeared in full robes with maces and tipstaffs to do honor to that firstfruits of the gospel in the west  mrs leigh went as a matter of course and ayacanora would needs go too she was very anxious to know what they were going to do with the carib  to make him a christian  why did they not make her one  because she was one already they were sure that she had been christened as soon as she was born but she was not sure and pouted a good deal at the chance of an ugly red carib being better off than she was however all assembled duly the stately son of the forest now transformed into a footman of sir richards was standing at the font the service was half performed when a heavy sigh or rather groan made all eyes turn and ayacanora sank fainting upon mrs leighs bosom  she was carried out and to a neighboring house and when she came to herself told a strange story how as she was standing there trying to recollect whether she too had ever been baptized the church seemed to grow larger the priests dress richer the walls were covered with pictures and above the altar in jewelled robes stood a lady and in her arms a babe soft music sounded in her ears the air was full on that she insisted much of fragrant odor which filled the church like mist and through it she saw not one but many indians standing by the font and a lady held her by the hand and she was a little girl again  and after many questionings so accurate was her recollection not only of the scene but of the building that yeo pronounced  a christened woman she is madam if popish christening is worth calling such and has seen indians christened too in the cathedral church at quito the inside whereof i know well enough and too well for i sat there three mortal hours in a san benito to hear a friar preach his false doctrines not knowing whether i was to be burnt or not next day  so ayacanora went home to burrough and raleigh the indian to sir richards house the entry of his baptism still stands crookedlettered in the old parchment register of the bideford baptisms for 15873       raleigh a winganditoian march 26  his name occurs once more a year and a month after       rawly a winganditoian april 1589  but it is not this time among the baptisms the free forest wanderer has pined in vain for his old deerhunts amid the fragrant cedar woods and lazy paddlings through the still lagoons where waterlilies sleep beneath the shade of great magnolias wreathed with clustered vines and now he is away to happier huntinggrounds and all that is left of him below sleeps in the narrow town churchyard blocked in with dingy houses whose tenants will never waste a sigh upon the indians grave there the two entries stand unto this day and most pathetic they have seemed to me a sort of emblem and firstfruits of the sad fate of that wornout red race to whom civilization came too late to save but not too late to hasten their decay  but though amyas lay idle england did not that spring saw another and a larger colony sent out by raleigh to virginia under the charge of one john white raleigh had written more than once entreating amyas to take the command which if he had done perhaps the united states had begun to exist twenty years sooner than they actually did but his mother had bound him by a solemn promise and who can wonder at her for asking or at him for giving it to wait at home with her twelve months at least so instead of himself he sent five hundred pounds which i suppose are in virginia virtually at least until this day for they never came back again to him  but soon came a sharper trial of amyass promise to his mother and one which made him for the first time in his life moody peevish and restless at the thought that others were fighting spaniards while he was sitting idle at home for his whole soul was filling fast with sullen malice against don guzman he was losing the single eye and his whole body was no longer full of light he had entered into the darkness in which every man walks who hates his brother and it lay upon him like a black shadow day and night no company too could be more fit to darken that shadow than salvation yeos the old man grew more stern in his fanaticism day by day and found a too willing listener in his master and mrs leigh was perhaps for the first and last time in her life seriously angry when she heard the two coolly debating whether they had not committed a grievous sin in not killing the spanish prisoners on board the galleon  it must be said however as the plain facts set down in this book testify that if such was the temper of englishmen at that day the spaniards had done a good deal to provoke it and were just then attempting to do still more  for now we are approaching the year 1588 which an astronomer of konigsberg above a hundred years before foretold would be an admirable year and the german chronologers presaged would be the climacterical year of the world  the prophecies may stand for what they are worth but they were at least fulfilled that year was indeed the climacterical year of the world and decided once and for all the fortunes of the european nations and of the whole continent of america  no wonder then if as has happened in each great crisis of the human race some awful instinct that the day of the lord was at hand some dim feeling that there was war in heaven and that the fiends of darkness and the angels of light were arrayed against each other in some mighty struggle for the possession of the souls of men should have tried to express itself in astrologic dreams and as was the fashion then attributed to the rulers of the planetary houses some sympathy with the coming worldtragedy  but for the wise there needed no conjunction of planets to tell them that the day was near at hand when the long desultory duel between spain and england would end once and for all in some great deathgrapple the war as yet had been confined to the netherlands to the west indies and the coasts and isles of africa to the quarters in fact where spain was held either to have no rights or to have forfeited them by tyranny but spain itself had been respected by england as england had by spain and trade to spanish ports went on as usual till in the year 1585 the spaniard without warning laid an embargo on all english ships coming to his european shores they were to be seized it seemed to form part of an enormous armament which was to attack and crush once and for allwhom the rebellious netherlanders said the spaniards but the queen the ministry and when it was just not too late the people of england thought otherwise england was the destined victim so instead of negotiating in order to avoid fighting they fought in order to produce negotiation drake frobisher and carlisle as we have seen swept the spanish main with fire and sword stopping the indian supplies while walsingham craftiest and yet most honest of mortals prevented by some mysterious financial operation the venetian merchants from repairing the spaniards loss by a loan and no armada came that year  in the meanwhile the jesuits here and abroad made no secret among their own dupes of the real objects of the spanish armament the impious hereticsthe drakes and raleighs grenvilles and cavendishes hawkinses and frobishers who had dared to violate that hidden sanctuary of just half the globe which the pope had bestowed on the defender of the true faitha shameful ruin a terrible death awaited them when their sacrilegious barks should sink beneath the thunder of spanish cannon blessed by the pope and sanctified with holy water and prayer to the service of god and his mother yes they would fall and england with them the proud islanders who had dared to rebel against st peter and to cast off the worship of mary should bow their necks once more under the yoke of the gospel their socalled queen illegitimate excommunicate contumacious the abettor of freetrade the defender of the netherlands the pillar of false doctrine throughout europe should be sent in chains across the alps to sue for her life at the feet of the injured and longsuffering father of mankind while his nominee took her place upon the throne which she had long since forfeited by her heresy  what nobler work how could the church of god be more gloriously propagated how could higher merit be obtained by faithful catholics it must succeed spain was invincible in valor inexhaustible in wealth heaven itself offered them an opportunity they had nothing now to fear from the turk for they had concluded a truce with him nothing from the french for they were embroiled in civil war the heavens themselves had called upon spain to fulfil her heavenly mission and restore to the churchs crown this brightest and richest of her lost jewels the heavens themselves called to a new crusade the saints whose altars the english had rifled and profaned called them to a new crusade the virgin queen of heaven whose boundless stores of grace the english spurned called them to a new crusade justly incensed at her own wrongs and indignities that evergracious virgin refuge of sinners and mother of fair love and holy hope adjured by their knightly honor all valiant cavaliers to do battle in her cause against the impious harlot who assumed her titles received from her idolatrous flatterers the homage due to mary alone and even for father parsons had asserted it therefore it must be true had caused her name to be substituted for that of mary in the litanies of the church let all who wore within a manly heart without a manly sword look on the woes of maryher shame her tears her blushes her heart pierced through with daily wounds from heretic tongues and choose between her and elizabeth  so said parsons allen and dozens more and said more than this too and much which one had rather not repeat and were somewhat surprised and mortified to find that their hearers though they granted the premises were too dull or carnal to arrive at the same conclusion the english lay romanists almost to a man had hearts sounder than their heads and howsoever illogically could not help holding to the strange superstition that being englishmen they were bound to fight for england so the hapless jesuits who had been boasting for years past that the persecuted faithful throughout the island would rise as one man to fight under the blessed banner of the pope and spain found that the faithful like demas of old forsook them and went after this present world having no objection of course to the restoration of popery but preferring some more comfortable method than an invasion which would inevitably rob them of their ancestral lands and would seat needy and greedy castilians in their old country houses to treat their tenants as they had treated the indians of hispaniola and them as they had treated the caciques  but though the hearts of men in that ungodly age were too hard to melt at the supposed woes of the mary who reigned above and too dull to turn rebels and traitors for the sake of those thrones and principalities in supralunar spheres which might be in her gift yet there was a mary who reigned or ought to reign below whose woes like her gifts were somewhat more palpable to the carnal sense a mary who having every comfort and luxury including hounds and horses found for her by the english government at an expense which would be now equal to some twenty thousand a year could afford to employ the whole of her jointure as queen dowager of france probably equal to fifty thousand a year more in plotting the destruction of the said government and the murder of its queen a mary who if she prospered as she ought might have dukedoms and earldoms fair lands and castles to bestow on her faithful servants a mary finally who contrived by means of an angel face a serpent tongue and a heart as she said herself as hard as a diamond to make every weak man fall in love with her and what was worse fancy more or less that she was in love with him  of her the jesuits were not unmindful and found it convenient indeed to forget awhile the sorrows of the queen of heaven in those of the queen of scots not that they cared much for those sorrows but they were an excellent stockintrade she was a romanist she was beautiful and unfortunate a virtue which like charity hides the multitude of sins and therefore she was a convenient card to play in the great game of rome against the queen and people of england and played the poor card was till it got torn up by overusing into her merits or demerits i do not enter deeply here let her rest in peace  to all which the people of england made a most practical and terrible answer from the highest noble to the lowest peasant arose one simultaneous plebiscitum we are tired of these seventeen years of chicanery and terror this woman must die or the commonweal of england perish we all know which of the two alternatives was chosen  all europe stood aghast but rather with astonishment at english audacity than with horror at english wickedness marys own french kinsfolk had openly given her up as too bad to be excused much less assisted her own son blustered a little to the english ambassador for the majesty of kings was invaded whereon walsingham said in open council that the queen should send him a couple of hounds and that would set all right which sage advice being acted on and some deer sent over and above was so successful that the pious mourner having run off randolph says like a baby to see the deer in their cart returned for answer that he would thereafter depend wholly upon her majesty and serve her fortune against all the world and that he only wanted now two of her majestys yeoman prickers and a couple of her grooms of the deer the spaniard was not sorry on the whole for the catastrophe for all that had kept him from conquering england long ago was the fear lest after it was done he might have had to put the crown thereof on marys head instead of his own but marys death was as convenient a stalkinghorse to him as to the pope and now the armada was coming in earnest  elizabeth began negotiating but fancy not that she does nothing more as the following letter testifies written about midsummer 1587   f drake to captain amyas leigh this with haste  dear lad  as i said to her most glorious majesty i say to you now there are two ways of facing an enemy the one to stand off and cry try that again and ill strike thee the other to strike him first and then try that at all and ill strike thee again of which latter counsel her majesty so far approves that i go forthwith tell it not in gath down the coast to singe the king of spains beard so i termed it to her majesty she laughing in which if i leave so much as a fishingboat afloat from the groyne unto cadiz it will not be with my good will who intend that if he come this year he shall come by swimming and not by sailing so if you are still the man i have known you bring a good ship round to plymouth within the month and away with me for hard blows and hard money the feel of both of which you know pretty well by now  thine lovingly  f drake   amyas clutched his locks over this letter and smoked more tobacco the day he got it than had ever before been consumed at once in england but he kept true to his promise and this was his reply    amyas leigh to the worshipful sir f drake admiral of her majestys fleet in plymouth  most honored sir  a magician keeps me here in bilboes for which you have no picklock namely a mother who forbids the loss is mine but antichrist i can fight any year for he will not die this bout nor the next while my motherbut i will not trouble your patience more than to ask from you to get me news if you can from any prisoners of one don guzman maria magdalena sotomayor de soto whether he is in spain or in the indies and what the villain does and where he is to be found this only i entreat of you and so remain behind with a heavy heart  yours to command in all else and i would to heaven in this also  amyas leigh   i am sorry to have to say that after having thus obeyed his mother master amyas as men are too apt to do revenged himself on her by being more and more cross and disagreeable but his temper amended much when a few months after drake returned triumphant having destroyed a hundred sail in cadiz alone taken three great galleons with immense wealth on board burnt the small craft all along the shore and offered battle to santa cruz at the mouth of the tagus after which it is unnecessary to say that the armada was put off for yet another year  this news indeed gave amyas little comfort for he merely observed grumbling that drake had gone and spoiled everybody elses sport but what cheered him was news from drake that don guzman had been heard of from the captain of one of the galleons that he was high in favor in spain and commandant of soldiers on board one of the largest of the marquiss ships  and when amyas heard that a terrible joy took possession of him when the armada came as come it would he should meet his enemy at last he could wait now patiently ifand he shuddered at himself as he found himself in the very act of breathing a prayer that don guzman might not die before that meeting  in the meanwhile rumor flew thousandtongued through the length and breadth of the land of vast preparations going on in spain and italy of timber felled long before for some such purpose brought down to the sea and sawn out for shipbuilding of casting of cannon and drilling of soldiers of ships in hundreds collecting at lisbon of a crusade preached by pope sixtus the fifth who had bestowed the kingdom of england on the spaniard to be enjoyed by him as vassal tributary to rome of a million of gold to be paid by the pope onehalf down at once the other half when london was taken of cardinal allen writing and printing busily in the netherlands calling on all good englishmen to carry out by rebelling against elizabeth the bull of sixtus the fifth said i blush to repeat it to have been dictated by the holy ghost of inquisitors getting ready fetters and devils engines of all sorts of princes and noblemen flocking from all quarters gentlemen selling their private estates to fit out ships how the prince of melito the marquess of burgrave vespasian gonzaga john medicis amadas of savoy in short the illegitimate sons of all the southern princes having no lands of their own were coming to find that necessary of life in this pleasant little wheatgarden nay the duke of medina sidonia had already engaged mountedgecombe for himself as the fairest jewel of the south which when good old sir richard edgecombe heard he observed quietly that in 1555 he had the pleasure of receiving at his table at one time the admirals of england spain and the netherlands and therefore had experience in entertaining dons and made preparations for the visit by filling his cellars with gunpowder with a view to a housewarming and feudejoie on the occasion but as old fuller says the bear was not yet killed and medina sidonia might have catched a great cold had he no other clothes to wear than the skin thereof  so flew rumor false and true till poor john bulls wits were wellnigh turned but to the very last after his lazy fashion he persuaded himself that it would all come right somehow that it was too great news to be true that if it was true the expedition was only meant for the netherlands and in short sat quietly over his beef and beer for many a day after the french king had sent him fair warning and the queen the ministry and the admirals had been assuring him again and again that he and not the dutchman was the destined prey of this great flight of ravenous birds  at last the spaniard in order that there should be no mistake about the matter kindly printed a complete bill of the play to be seen still in van meteran for the comfort of all true catholics and confusion of all pestilent heretics which document of course the seminary priests used to enforce the duty of helping the invaders and the certainty of their success and from their hands it soon passed into those of the devout ladies who were not very likely to keep it to themselves till john bull himself found his daughters buzzing over it with very pale faces as young ladies well might who had no wish to follow the fate of the damsels of antwerp and condescending to run his eye through it discovered what all the rest of europe had known for months past that he was in a very great scrape  well it was for england then that her tudor sovereigns had compelled every man though they kept up no standing army to be a trained soldier well it was that elizabeth even in those dangerous days of intrigue and rebellion had trusted her people enough not only to leave them their weapons but what we forsooth in these more free and liberal days dare not do to teach them how to use them well it was that by careful legislation for the comfort and employment of the masses term then thank god unknown she had both won their hearts and kept their bodies in fighting order well it was that acting as fully as napoleon did on la carriere ouverte aux talens she had raised to the highest posts in her councils her army and her navy men of business who had not been ashamed to buy and sell as merchants and adventurers well for england in a word that elizabeth had pursued for thirty years a very different course from that which we have been pursuing for the last thirty with one exception namely the leaving as much as possible to private enterprise  there we have copied her would to heaven that we had in some other matters it is the fashion now to call her a despot but unless every monarch is to be branded with that epithet whose power is not as circumscribed as queen victorias is now we ought rather to call her the most popular sovereign obeyed of their own free will by the freest subjects which england has ever seen confess the armada fight to have been as great a moral triumph as it was a political one and now that our late boasting is a little silenced by crimean disasters inquire whether we have not something to learn from those old tudor times as to how to choose officials how to train a people and how to defend a country  to return to the thread of my story  january 15878 had wellnigh run through before sir richard grenville made his appearance on the streets of bideford he had been appointed in november one of the council of war for providing for the safety of the nation and the west country had seen nothing of him since but one morning just before christmas his stately figure darkened the old baywindow at burrough and amyas rushed out to meet him and bring him in and ask what news from court  all good news dear lad and dearer madam the queen shows the spirit of a very boadicea or semiramis ay a very scythian tomyris and if she had the spaniard before her now would verily for aught i know feast him as the scythian queen did cyrus with satia te sanguine quod sitisti  i trust her most merciful spirit is not so changed already said mrs leigh  well if she would not do it i would and ask pardon afterwards as raleigh did about the rascals at smerwick whom amyas knows of mrs leigh these are times in which mercy is cruelty not england alone but the world the bible the gospel itself is at stake and we must do terrible things lest we suffer more terrible ones  god will take care of world and bible better than any cruelty of ours dear sir richard  nay but mrs leigh we must help him to take care of them if those smerwick spaniards had not been  the spaniard would not have been exasperated into invading us  and we should not have had this chance of crushing him once and for all but the quarrel is of older standing madam eh amyas amyas has raleigh written to you of late  not a word and i wonder why  well no wonder at that if you knew how he has been laboring the wonder is whence he got the knowledge wherewith to labor for he never saw seawork to my remembrance  never saw a shot fired by sea except ours at smerwick and that brush with the spaniards in 1579 when he sailed for virginia with sir humphrey and he was a mere crack then  so you consider him as your pupil eh but he learnt enough in the netherland wars and in ireland too if not of the strength of ships yet still of the weakness of land forces and would you believe it the man has twisted the whole council round his finger and made them give up the land defences to the naval ones  quite right he and wooden walls against stone ones for ever but as for twisting he would persuade satan if he got him alone for half an hour  i wish he would sail for spain then just now and try the powers of his tongue said mrs leigh  but are we to have the honor really  we are lad there were many in the council who were for disputing the landing on shore and saidwhich i do not denythat the prentice boys of london could face the bluest blood in spain but raleigh argued following my lord burleigh in that that we differed from the low countries and all other lands in that we had not a castle or town throughout which would stand a ten days siege and that our ramparts as he well said were after all only a body of men so he argued as long as the enemy has power to land where he will prevention rather than cure is our only hope and that belongs to the office not of an army but of a fleet so the fleet was agreed on and a fleet we shall have  then here is his health the health of a true friend to all bold mariners and myself in particular but where is he now  coming here tomorrow as i hopefor he left london with me and so down by us into cornwall to drill the trainbands as he is bound to do being seneschal of the duchies and lieutenantgeneral of the county  besides lord warden of the stanneries how the man thrives said mrs leigh  how the man deserves to thrive said amyas but what are we to do  that is the rub i would fain stay and fight the spaniards  so would i and will  but he has other plans in his head for us  we can make our own plans without his help  heyday amyas how long when did he ask you to do a thing yet and you refuse him  not often certainly but spaniards i must fight  well so must i boy but i have given a sort of promise to him nevertheless  not for me too i hope  no he will extract that himself when he comes you must come and sup tomorrow and talk it over  be talked over rather what chestnut does the cat want us monkeys to pull out of the fire for him now i wonder  sir richard grenville is hardly accustomed to be called a monkey said mrs leigh  i meant no harm and his worship knows it none better but where is raleigh going to send us with a murrain  to virginia the settlers must have help and as i trust in god we shall be back again long before this armament can bestir itself  so raleigh came saw and conquered mrs leigh consented to amyass going for his twelvemonth would be over ere the fleet could start upon so peaceful and useful an errand and the next five months were spent in continual labor on the part of amyas and grenville till seven ships were all but ready in bideford river the admiral whereof was amyas leigh  but that fleet was not destined ever to see the shores of the new world it had nobler work to do if americans will forgive the speech than even settling the united states  it was in the long june evenings in the year 1588 mrs leigh sat in the open window busy at her needlework ayacanora sat opposite to her on the seat of the bay trying diligently to read the history of the nine worthies and stealing a glance every now and then towards the garden where amyas stalked up and down as he had used to do in happier days gone by but his brow was contracted now his eyes fixed on the ground as he plodded backwards and forwards his hands behind his back and a huge cigar in his mouth the wonder of the little boys of northam who peeped in stealthily as they passed the ironwork gates to see the back of the famous firebreathing captain who had sailed round the world and been in the country of headless men and flying dragons and then popped back their heads suddenly as he turned toward them in his walk and ayacanora looked and looked with no less admiration than the urchins at the gate but she got no more of an answering look from amyas than they did for his head was full of calculations of tonnage and stowage of salt pork and alebarrels and the packing of tools and seeds for he had promised raleigh to do his best for the new colony and he was doing it with all his might so ayacanora looked back again to her book and heaved a deep sigh it was answered by one from mrs leigh  we are a melancholy pair sweet chuck said the fair widow what is my maid sighing about there  because i cannot make out the long words said ayacanora telling a very white fib  is that all come to me and i will tell you  ayacanora moved over to her and sat down at her feet  he he ro ro ical heroical said mrs leigh  but what does that mean  grand good and brave like  mrs leigh was about to have said the name of one who was lost to her on earth his fair angelic face hung opposite upon the wall she paused unable to pronounce his name and lifted up her eyes and gazed on the portrait and breathed a prayer between closed lips and drooped her head again  her pupil caught at the pause and filled it up for herself  like him and she turned her head quickly toward the window  yes like him too said mrs leigh with a halfsmile at the gesture now mind your book maidens must not look out of the window in school hours  shall i ever be an english girl asked ayacanora  you are one now sweet your father was an english gentleman  amyas looked in and saw the two sitting together  you seem quite merry there said he  come in then and be merry with us  he entered and sat down while ayacanora fixed her eyes most steadfastly on her book  well how goes on the reading said he and then without waiting for an answerwe shall be ready to clear out this day week mother i do believe that is if the hatchets are made in time to pack them  i hope they will be better than the last said mrs leigh it seems to me a shameful sin to palm off on poor ignorant savages goods which we should consider worthless for ourselves  well its not over fair but still they are a sight better than they ever had before an old hoop is better than a deers bone as ayacanora knowseh  i dont know anything about it said she who was always nettled at the least allusion to her past wild life i am an english girl now and all that is gonei forget it  forget it said he teasing her for want of something better to do should not you like to sail with us now and see the indians in the forests once again  sail with you and she looked up eagerly  there i knew it she would not be fourandtwenty hours ashore but she would be off into the woods again bow in hand like any runaway nymph and we should never see her more  it is false bad man and she burst into violent tears and hid her face in mrs leighs lap  amyas amyas why do you tease the poor fatherless thing  i was only jesting im sure said amyas like a repentant schoolboy dont cry now dont cry my child see here and he began fumbling in his pockets see what i bought of a chapman in town today for you my maid indeed i did  and out he pulled some smart kerchief or other which had taken his sailors fancy  look at it now blue and crimson and green like any parrot and he held it out  she looked round sharply snatched it out of his hand and tore it to shreds  i hate it and i hate you and she sprang up and darted out of the room  oh boy boy said mrs leigh will you kill that poor child it matters little for an old heart like mine which has but one or two chords left whole how soon it be broken altogether but a young heart is one of gods precious treasures amyas and suffers many a long pang in the breaking and woe to them who despise christs little ones  break your heart mother  never mind my heart dear son yet how can you break it more surely than by tormenting one whom i love because she loves you  tut play mother and maids tempers but how can i break your heart what have i done have i not given up going again to the west indies for your sake have i not given up going to virginia and now again settled to go after all just because you commanded was it not your will have i not obeyed you mother mother i will stay at home now if you will i would rather rust here on land i vow i would than grieve you and he threw himself at his mothers knees  have i asked you not to go to virginia no dear boy though every thought of a fresh parting seems to crack some new fibre within me you must go it is your calling yes you were not sent into the world to amuse me but to work i have had pleasure enough of you my darling for many a year and too much perhaps till i shrank from lending you to the lord but he must have you    it is enough for the poor old widow to know that her boy is what he is and to forget all her anguish day by day for joy that a man is born into the world but amyas amyas are you so blind as not to see that ayacanora  dont talk about her poor child talk about yourself  how long have i been worth talking about no amyas you must see it and if you will not see it now you will see it one day in some sad and fearful prodigy for she is not one to die tamely she loves you amyas as a woman only can love  loves me well of course i found her and brought her home and i dont deny she may think that she owes me somewhatthough it was no more than a christian mans duty but as for her caring much for me mother you measure every one elses tenderness by your own  think that she owes you somewhat silly boy this is not gratitude but a deeper affection which may be more heavenly than gratitude as it may too become a horrible cause of ruin it rests with you amyas which of the two it will be  you are in earnest  have i the heart or the time to jest  no no of course not but mother i thought it was not comely for women to fall in love with men  not comely at least to confess their love to men but she has never done that amyas not even by a look or a tone of voice though i have watched her for months  to be sure she is as demure as any cat when i am in the way i only wonder how you found it out  ah said she smiling sadly even in the saddest womans soul there linger snatches of old music odors of flowers long dead and turned to dustpleasant ghosts which still keep her mind attuned to that which may be in others though in her never more till she can hear her own weddinghymn reechoed in the tones of every girl who loves and sees her own weddingtorch relighted in the eyes of every bride  you would not have me marry her asked blunt practical amyas  god knows what i would havei know not i see neither your path nor my ownno not after weeks and months of prayer all things beyond are wrapped in mist and what will be i know not save that whatever else is wrong mercy at least is right  id sail tomorrow if i could as for marrying her motherher birth mind me  ah boy boy are you god to visit the sins of the parents upon the children  not that i dont mean that but i mean this that she is half a spaniard mother and i cannother blood may be as blue as king philips own but it is spanish still i cannot bear the thought that my children should have in their veins one drop of that poison  amyas amyas interrupted she is this not too visiting the parents sins on the children  not a whit it is common senseshe must have the taint of their bloodthirsty humor she has iti have seen it in her again and again i have told you have i not can i forget the look of her eyes as she stood over that galleons captain with the smoking knife in her handugh and she is not tamed yet as you can see and never will benot that i care except for her own sake poor thing  cruel boy to impute as a blame to the poor child not only the errors of her training but the very madness of her love  of her love  of what else blind buzzard from the moment that you told me the story of that captains death i knew what was in her heartand thus it is that you requite her for having saved your life  umph that is one word too much mother if you dont want to send me crazy dont put the thing on the score of gratitude or duty as it is i can hardly speak civilly to her god forgive me when i recollect that she belongs to the crew who murdered himand he pointed to the picture and mrs leigh shuddered as he did so  you feel it you know you feel it tenderhearted forgiving angel as you are and what do you think i must feel  oh my son my son cried she wringing her hands if i be wretch enough to give place to the devil for a moment does that give you a right to entertain and cherish him thus day by day  i should cherish him with a vengeance if i brought up a crew of children who could boast of a pedigree of idolaters and tyrants hunters of indians and torturers of women how pleasant to hear her telling master jack your illustrious granduncle the popes legate was the man who burned rose salterne at cartagena or miss grace your greatgrandfather of sixteen quarterings the marquis of this son of the grandequerry that and husband of the princess tother used to feed his bloodhounds when beef was scarce with indians babies eh mother these things are true and if you can forget them i cannot is it not enough to have made me forego for awhile my purpose my business the one thing i live for and that is hunting down the spaniards as i would adders or foxes but you must ask me over and above to take one to my bosom  oh my son my son i have not asked you to do that i have only commanded you in gods name to be merciful if you wish to obtain mercy oh if you will not pity this poor maiden pity yourself for god knows you stand in more need of it than she does  amyas was silent for a minute or two and then  if it were not for you mother would god that the armada would come  what and ruin england  no curse them not a foot will they ever set on english soil such a welcome would we give them if i were but in the midst of that fleet fighting like a manto forget it all with a galleon on board of me to larboard and another to starboardand then to put a linstock in the magazine and go aloft in good companyi dont care how soon it comes mother if it were not for you  if i am in your way amyas do not fear that i shall trouble you long  oh mother mother do not talk in that way i am halfmad i think already and dont know what i say yes i am mad mad at heart though not at head theres a fire burning me up night and day and nothing but spanish blood will put it out  or the grace of god my poor wilful child who comes to the doorso quickly too  there was a loud hurried knocking and in another minute a servingman hurried in with a letter  this to captain amyas leigh with haste haste  it was sir richards hand amyas tore it open and a loud laugh laughed he  the armada is coming my wish has come true mother  god help us it has show me the letter  it was a hurried scrawl   dr godsonwalsingham sends word that the ada sailed from lisbon to the groyne the 18 of may we know no more but have commandment to stay the ships come down dear lad and give us counsel and may the lord help his church in this great strait  your loving godfather  r g   forgive me mother mother once for all cried amyas throwing his arms round her neck  i have nothing to forgive my son my son and shall i lose thee also  if i be killed you will have two martyrs of your blood mother  mrs leigh bowed her head and was silent amyas caught up his hat and sword and darted forth toward bideford  amyas literally danced into sir richards hall where he stood talking earnestly with various merchants and captains  gloria gloria gentles all the devil is broke loose at last and now we know where to have him on the hip  why so merry captain leigh when all else are sad said a gentle voice by his side  because i have been sad a long time while all else were merry dear lady is the hawk doleful when his hood is pulled off and he sees the heron flapping right ahead of him  you seem to forget the danger and the woe of us weak women sir  i dont forget the danger and the woe of one weak woman madam and she the daughter of a man who once stood in this room said amyas suddenly collecting himself in a low stern voice and i dont forget the danger and the woe of one who was worth a thousand even of her i dont forget anything madam  nor forgive either it seems  it will be time to talk of forgiveness after the offender has repented and amended and does the sailing of the armada look like that  alas no god help us  he will help us madam said amyas  admiral leigh said sir richard we need you now if ever here are the queens orders to furnish as many ships as we can though from these gentlemens spirit i should say the orders were wellnigh needless  not a doubt sir for my part i will fit my ship at my own charges and fight her too as long as i have a leg or an arm left  or a tongue to say never surrender ill warrant said an old merchant you put life into us old fellows admiral leigh but it will be a heavy matter for those poor fellows in virginia and for my daughter too madam dare with her young babe as i hear just born  and a very heavy matter said some one else for those who have ventured their money in these cargoes which must lie idle you see now for a year maybeand then all the cost of unlading again  my good sir said grenville what have private interests to do with this day let us thank god if he only please to leave us the bare feesimple of this english soil the honor of our wives and daughters and bodies safe from rack and fagot to wield the swords of freemen in defence of a free land even though every town and homestead in england were wasted with fire and we left to rebuild over again all which our ancestors have wrought for us in now six hundred years  right sir said amyas for my part let my virginian goods rot on the quay if the worst comes to the worst i begin unloading the vengeance tomorrow and to sea as soon as i can fill up my crew to a good fighting number  and so the talk ran on and ere two days were past most of the neighboring gentlemen summoned by sir richard had come in and great was the bidding against each other as to who should do most cary and brimblecombe with thirty tall clovelly men came across the bay and without even asking leave of amyas took up their berths as a matter of course on board the vengeance in the meanwhile the matter was taken up by families the fortescues a numberless clan offered to furnish a ship the chichesters another the stukelys a third while the merchantmen were not backward the bucks the stranges the heards joyfully unloaded their virginian goods and replaced them with powder and shot and in a weeks time the whole seven were ready once more for sea and dropped down into appledore pool with amyas as their admiral for the time being for sir richard had gone by land to plymouth to join the deliberations there and waited for the first favorable wind to start for the rendezvous in the sound  at last upon the twentyfirst of june the clank of the capstans rang merrily across the flats and amid prayers and blessings forth sailed that gallant squadron over the bar to play their part in britains salamis while mrs leigh stood watching as she stood once before beside the churchyard wall but not alone this time for ayacanora stood by her side and gazed and gazed till her eyes seemed ready to burst from their sockets at last she turned away with a sob  and he never bade me goodbye mother  god forgive him come home and pray my child there is no other rest on earth than prayer for womans heart  they were calling each other mother and daughter then yes the sacred fire of sorrow was fast burning out all ayacanoras fallen savageness and like a phoenix the true woman was rising from those ashes fair noble and allenduring as god had made her    chapter xxx  how the admiral john hawkins testified against croakers       oh where be these gay spaniards      which make so great a boast o      oh they shall eat the graygoose feather        and we shall eat the roast o                                    cornish song  what if the spectators who last summer gazed with just pride upon the noble port of plymouth its vast breakwater spanning the sound its arsenals and docks its two estuaries filled with gallant ships and watched the great screwliners turning within their own length by force invisible or threading the crowded fleets with the ease of the tiniest boatwhat if by some magic turn the nineteenth century and all the magnificence of its wealth and science had vanishedas it may vanish hereafterand they had found themselves thrown back three hundred years into the pleasant summer days of 1588  mount edgecombe is still there beautiful as ever but where are the docks and where is devonport no vast drydock roofs rise at the waters edge drakes island carries but a paltry battery just raised by the man whose name it bears mount wise is a lone gentlemans house among fields the citadel is a popgun fort which a thirdclass steamer would shell into rubble for an afternoons amusement and the shipping where are they the floating castles of the hamoaze have dwindled to a few crawling limehoys and the catwater is packed not as now with merchant craft but with the ships who will tomorrow begin the greatest seafight which the world has ever seen  there they lie a paltry squadron enough in modern eyes the largest of them not equal in size to a sixandthirtygun frigate carrying less weight of metal than one of our new gunboats and able to employ even that at not more than a quarter of our modern range would our modern spectators just come down by rail for a few hours to see the cavalry embark and return tomorrow in time for dinner have looked down upon that petty port and petty fleet with a contemptuous smile and begun some flippant speech about the progress of intellect and the triumphs of science and our benighted ancestors they would have done so doubt it not if they belonged to the many who gaze on those very triumphs as on a rareeshow to feed their silly wonder or use and enjoy them without thankfulness or understanding as the ox eats the clover thrust into his rack without knowing or caring how it grew but if any of them were of the class by whom those very triumphs have been achieved the thinkers and the workers who instead of entering lazily into other mens labors as the mob does labor themselves who know by hard experience the struggles the selfrestraints the disappointments the slow and staggering steps by which the discoverer reaches to his prize then the smile of those men would not have been one of pity but rather of filial love for they would have seen in those outwardly paltry armaments the potential germ of that mightier one which now loads the black sea waves they would have been aware that to produce it with such materials and knowledge as then existed demanded an intellect an energy a spirit of progress and invention equal if not superior to those of which we now so loudly boast  but if again he had been a student of men rather than of machinery he would have found few nobler companies on whom to exercise his discernment than he might have seen in the little terrace bowlinggreen behind the pelican inn on the afternoon of the nineteenth of july chatting in groups or lounging over the low wall which commanded a view of the sound and the shipping far below were gathered almost every notable man of the plymouth fleet the whole posse comitatus of englands forgotten worthies the armada has been scattered by a storm lord howard has been out to look for it as far as the spanish coast but the wind has shifted to the south and fearing lest the dons should pass him he has returned to plymouth uncertain whether the armada will come after all or not slip on for a while like prince hal the drawers apron come in through the roseclad door which opens from the tavern with a tray of longnecked dutch glasses and a silver tankard of wine and look round you at the gallant captains who are waiting for the spanish armada as lions in their lair might wait for the passing herd of deer  see those five talking earnestly in the centre of a ring which longs to overhear and yet is too respectful to approach close those soft long eyes and pointed chin you recognize already they are walter raleighs the fair young man in the flamecolored doublet whose arm is round raleighs neck is lord sheffield opposite them stands by the side of sir richard grenville a man as stately even as he lord sheffields uncle the lord charles howard of effingham lord high admiral of england next to him is his soninlaw sir robert southwell captain of the elizabeth jonas but who is that short sturdy plainly dressed man who stands with legs a little apart and hands behind his back looking up with keen gray eyes into the face of each speaker his cap is in his hands so you can see the bullet head of crisp brown hair and the wrinkled forehead as well as the high cheek bones the short square face the broad temples the thick lips which are yet firm as granite a coarse plebeian stamp of man yet the whole figure and attitude are that of boundless determination selfpossession energy and when at last he speaks a few blunt words all eyes are turned respectfully upon himfor his name is francis drake  a burly grizzled elder in greasy seastained garments contrasting oddly with the huge gold chain about his neck waddles up as if he had been born and had lived ever since in a gale of wind at sea the upper half of his sharp dogged visage seems of brickred leather the lower of badgers fur and as he claps drake on the back and with a broad devon twang shouts be you a coming to drink your wine francis drake or be you notsaving your presence my lord the lord high admiral only laughs and bids drake go and drink his wine for john hawkins admiral of the port is the patriarch of plymouth seamen if drake be their hero and says and does pretty much what he likes in any company on earth not to mention that todays prospect of an armageddon fight has shaken him altogether out of his usual crabbed reserve and made him overflow with loquacious goodhumor even to his rival drake  so they push through the crowd wherein is many another man whom one would gladly have spoken with face to face on earth martin frobisher and john davis are sitting on that bench smoking tobacco from long silver pipes and by them are fenton and withrington who have both tried to follow drakes path round the world and failed though by no fault of their own the man who pledges them better luck next time is george fenner known to the seven portugals leicesters pet and captain of the galleon which elizabeth bought of him that short prim man in the huge yellow ruff with sharp chin minute imperial and selfsatisfied smile is richard hawkins the complete seaman admiral johns hereafter famous and hapless son the elder who is talking with him is his good uncle william whose monument still stands or should stand in deptford church for admiral john set it up there but one year after this time and on it record how he was a worshipper of the true religion an especial benefactor of poor sailors a most just arbiter in most difficult causes and of a singular faith piety and prudence that and the fact that he got creditably through some sharp work at porto rico is all i know of william hawkins but if you or i reader can have as much or half as much said of us when we have to follow him we shall have no reason to complain  there is john drake sir francis brother ancestor of the present stock of drakes and there is george his nephew a man not overwise who has been round the world with amyas and there is amyas himself talking to one who answers him with fierce curt sentences captain barker of bristol brother of the hapless andrew barker who found john oxenhams guns and owing to a mutiny among his men perished by the spaniards in honduras twelve years ago barker is now captain of the victory one of the queens best ships and he has his accounts to settle with the dons as amyas has so they are both growling together in a corner while all the rest are as merry as the flies upon the vine above their heads  but who is the aged man who sits upon a bench against the sunny south wall of the tavern his long white beard flowing almost to his waist his hands upon his knees his palsied head moving slowly from side to side to catch the scraps of discourse of the passing captains his greatgrandchild a little maid of six has laid her curly head upon his knees and his granddaughter a buxom blackeyed dame of thirty stands by him and tends him half as nurse and half too as showman for he seems an object of curiosity to all the captains and his fair nurse has to entreat again and again bless you sir please now dont give him no liquor poor old soul the doctor says it is old martin cockrem father of the ancient host aged himself beyond the years of man who can recollect the bells of plymouth ringing for the coronation of henry the eighth and who was the first englishman perhaps who ever set foot on the soil of the new world there he sits like an old druid tor of primeval granite amid the tall wheat and rich clover crops of a modern farm he has seen the death of old europe and the birththroes of the new go to him and question him for his senses are quick as ever and just now the old man seems uneasy he is peering with rheumy eyes through the groups and seems listening for a wellknown voice  there a be again why dont a come then  quiet gramfer and dont trouble his worship  here an hour and never speak to poor old martin i say sirand the old man feebly plucks amyass cloak as he passes i say captain do e tell young master old martins looking for him  marcy gramfer wheres your manners dont be vexed sir hem amost a babe and tejous at times mortal  young master who says amyas bending down to the old man and smiling to the dame to let him have his way  master hawkins hem never been anear me all day  off goes amyas and of course lays hold of the sleeve of young richard hawkins but as he is in act to speak the dame lays hold of his laughing and blushing  no sir not mr richard sir admiral john sir his father he always calls him young master poor old soul and she points to the grizzled beard and the face scarred and tanned with fifty years of fight and storm  amyas goes to the admiral and gives his message  mercy on me where be my wits iss im acoming says the old hero in his broadest devon waddles off to the old man and begins lugging at a pocket here martin ive got mun ive got mun man alive but his lordship keept me so lookee here then why i do get so lusty of late martin i cant get to my pockets  and out struggle a piece of tarred string a bundle of papers a thimble a piece of puddingtobacco and last of all a little paper of muscovado sugarthen as great a delicacy as any french bonbons would be nowwhich he thrusts into the old mans eager and trembling hand  old martin begins dipping his finger into it and rubbing it on his toothless gums smiling and nodding thanks to his young master while the little maid at his knee unrebuked takes her share also  there admiral leigh both ends meetgramfers and babies you and i shall be like to that one day young samson  we shall have slain a good many philistines first i hope  amen so be it but look to mun so fine a sailor as ever drank liquor and now greedy after a hit of sweet trade tis piteous like but i bring mun a hit whenever i come and he looks for it hes one of my own flesh like is old martin he sailed with my father captain will when they was both two little cracks aboard of a trawler and my father went up and here i amhe didnt and there he is wem up now we hawkinses we may be down again some day  never i trust said amyas  taint no use trusting young man you go and do i do hear too much of that there from my lad let they ministers preach till theym black in the face works is the trade with a nudge in amyass ribs faith cant save nor charity nether there you tell with him while i go play bowls with drake hell tell you a sight of stories you ask him about good king hal now just  and off waddled the port admiral  you have seen good king henry then father said amyas interested  the old mans eyes lighted at once and he stopped mumbling his sugar  seed mun iss i reckon i was with captain will when he went to meet the frenchman there to calaisat the field the field  the field of the cloth of gold gramfer suggested the dame  thats it seed mun iss fegs oh he was a king the face o mun like a rising sun and the back o mun so broad as that there and he held out his palsied arms and the voice of mun oh to hear mun swear if he was merry oh tas royalseed mun iss fegs and ive seed mun do what few has ive seed mun christle like any child  whatcry

hands on muns face and oh my gentlemen says he my gentlemen oh my gallant men them was his very words  but when  why captain will had just come to the hardthats to portsmouthto speak with mun and the barge royal lay again the hardso and our boot alongsideso and the king he standth as it might be there above my head on the quay edge and she come in near abreast of us looking most royal to behold poor dear and went to cast about and captain will saith he them lower ports is cruel near the water for she had not more than a sixteen inches to spare in the nether overloop as i heard after and saith he that wont do for going to windward in a say martin and as the words came out of muns mouth your worship there was a bit of a flaw from the westward sharp like and overboard goeth my cap and hitth against the wall and as i stooped to pick it up i heard a cry and it was all over  he is telling of the mary rose sir  i guessed so  all over and the cry of mun and the screech of mun oh sir up to the very heavens and the king he screeched right out like any maid oh my gentlemen oh my gallant men and as she lay on her beamends sir and just asettling the very last souls i seen was that mans father and that mans i knowed mun by their armor  and he pointed to sir george carew and sir richard grenville  iss iss drowned like rattens drowned like rattens  now you mustnt trouble his worship any more  trouble let him tell till midnight i shall be well pleased said amyas sitting down on the bench by him drawer aleand a parcel of tobacco  and amyas settled himself to listen while the old man purred to himself  iss they likes to hear old martin all the captains look upon old martin  hillo amyas said cary whos your friend heres a man been telling me wonders about the river plate we should go thither for luck there next time  river plate said old martin its i knows about the river plate none so well whod ever been there nor heard of it nether before captain will and me went and i lived among the savages a whole year and audacious civil i found em if they d had but shirts to their backs and so was the prince o mun that captain will brought home to king henry leastwise he died on the voyage but the wild folk took it cruel well for you see we was always as civil with them as christians and if we hadnt been i should not have been here now  what year was that  in the fifteen thirty but i was there afore and learnt the speech o mun and thats why captain will left me to a hostage when he tuked their prince  before that said cary why the country was hardly known before that  the old mans eyes flashed up in triumph  knowed iss and you may well say that look ye here look to mun and he waved his hand roundtheres captains and im the father of em all now now poor captain wills in gloory i martin cockrem    iss ive seen a change i mind when tavistock abbey was so full o friars and goolden idols and sich noxious trade as ever was a wheatrick of rats i mind the fight off brest in the french warsoh that was a fight surelywhen the regent and the french carack were burnt side by side being fast grappled you see because of sir thomas knivet and captain will gave him warning as he ran apast us saying says he  but said amyas seeing that the old man was wandering away what do you mind about america  america i should think so but i was agoing to tell you of the regentand seven hundred englishmen burnt and drowned in her and nine hundred french in the brest ship besides what we picked up oh dear but about america  yes about america how are you the father of all the captains  how you ask my young master why before the fifteen thirty i was up the plate with cabot and a cruel fractious ontrustful fellow he was like all they portingals and bid there a year and more and up the paraguaio with him diskivering no end whereby gentles i was the first englishman i hold that ever sot a foot on the new world i was  then heres your health and long life sir said amyas and cary  long life iss fegs i reckon long enough aready why i mind the beginning of it all i do i mind when there wasnt a master mariner to plymouth that thought there was aught west of the lands end except herrings why they held them pure wratches that if you sailed right west away far enough youd surely come to the edge and fall over cleve isstwas dark parts round here till captain will arose and the first of it i mind was inside the bar of san lucar and he and i were boys about a ten year old aboord of a dartmouth ship and went for wine and there come in over the bar he that was the beginning of it all  columbus  iss fegs he did not a pistolshot from us and i saw mun stand on the poop so plain as i see you no great shakes of a man to look to nether theres a sight better here to plase me and we was disappointed we lads for we surely expected to see mun with a goolden crown on and a sceptre to as hand we did and the ship o mun all over like solomons temple for gloory and i mind that same year too seeing vasco da gama as was going out over the bar when he found the bona speranza and sailed round it to the indies ah that was the making of they rascally portingals it was    and our crew told what they seen and heerd but nobody minded sich things twas dark parts and popish then and nobody knowed nothing nor got no schooling nor cared for nothing but scrattling up and down alongshore like to prawns in a pule iss sitting in darkness we was and the shadow of death till the dayspring from on high arose and shined upon us poor outotheway folkthe lord be praised and now look to mun and he waved his hand all roundlook to mun look to the works of the lord look to the captains oh blessed sight and ones been to the brazils and one to the indies and the spanish main and the northwest and the rooshias and the chinas and up the straits and round the cape and round the world of god too bless his holy name and i seed the beginning of it and ill see the end of it too i will i was born into the old times but ill see the wondrous works of the new yet i will ill see they bloody spaniards swept off the seas before i die if my old eyes can reach so far as outside the sound i shall i knows it i says my prayers for it every night dont i mary youll bate mun sure as judgment youll bate mun the lordll fight for ye nothingll stand against ye ive seed it all alongever since i was with young master to the honduras they cant bide the push of us youll bate mun off the face of the seas and be masters of the round world and all that therein is and then ill just turn my old face to the wall and depart in peace according to his word  deary me now while ive been telling with you hereve this little maid been and ate up all my sugar  ill bring you some more said amyas whom the childish bathos of the last sentence moved rather to sighs than laughter  will ye then theres a good soul and come and tell with old martin he likes to see the brave young gentlemen agoing to and fro in their ships like leviathan and taking of their pastime therein we had no such ships to our days ah tis grand times beautiful times surelyand youll bring me a bit sugar  you were up the plate with cabot said cary after a pause do you mind the fair lady miranda sebastian de hurtados wife  what her that was burnt by the indians mind her do you mind the sun in heaven oh the beauty oh the ways of her oh the speech of her never was nor never will be and she to die by they villains and all for the goodness of her mind her i minded naught else when she was on deck  who was she asked amyas of cary  a spanish angel amyas  humph said amyas so much the worse for her to be born into a nation of devils  theyem not all so bad as that yer honor her husband was a proper gallant gentleman and kind as a maid too and couldnt abide that de soliss murderous doings  his wife must have taught it him then said amyas rising where did you hear of these black swans cary  i have heard of them and thats enough answered he unwilling to stir sad recollections  and little enough said amyas will dont talk to me the devil is not grown white because he has trod in a limeheap  or an angel black because she came down a chimney said cary and so the talk ended or rather was cut short for the talk of all the groups was interrupted by an explosion from old john hawkins  fail fail what a murrain do you here to talk of failing who made you a prophet you scurvy hanginthewind croaking whitelivered son of a corbycrow  heaven help us admiral hawkins who has put fire to your culverins in this fashion said lord howard  who my lord croakers my lord heres a fellow calls himself the captain of a ship and her majestys servant and talks about failing as if he were a barbican loosekirtle trying to keep her applesquire ashore blurt for him sneakup say i  admiral john hawkins quoth the offender you shall answer this language with your sword  ill answer it with my foot and buy me a pair of horntips to my shoes like a wraxling man fight a croaker fight a frog an owl i fight those that dare fight sir  sir sir moderate yourself i am sure this gentleman will show himself as brave as any when it comes to blows but who can blame mortal man for trembling before so fearful a chance as this  let mortal man keep his tremblings to himself then my lord and not be like solomons madmen casting abroad fire and death and saying it is only in sport there is more than one of his kidney your lordship who have not been ashamed to play mother shipton before their own sailors and damp the poor fellows hearts with crying before theyre hurt and this is one of them ive heard him at it afore and ill present him with a vengeance though im no churchwarden  if this is really so admiral hawkins  it is so my lord i heard only last night down in a tavern below such unbelieving talk as made me mad my lord and if it had not been after supper and my hand was not oversteady i would have let out a pottle of alicant from some of their hoopings and sent them to dick surgeon to wrap them in swaddlingclouts like whining babies as they are marry come up what says scripture he that is fearful and fainthearted among you let him go andwhat son dick there thourt pious and readst thy bible whats that text a mortal fine one it is too  he that is fearful and fainthearted among you let him go back quoth the complete seaman captain merryweather as my fathers command as well as his years forbid his answering your challenge i shall repute it an honor to entertain his quarrel myselfplace time and weapons being at your choice  well spoken son dickand like a true courtier too ah thou hast the palabras and the knee and the cap and the quip and the innuendo and the true town fashion of it allno old tarrybreeks of a seadog like thy dad my lord youll let them fight  the spaniard sir but no one else but captains and gentlemen consider well my friend the port admirals advice and if any mans heart misgives him let him for the sake of his country and his queen have so much government of his tongue to hide his fears in his own bosom and leave open complaining to ribalds and women for if the sailor be not cheered by his commanders cheerfulness how will the ignorant man find comfort in himself and without faith and hope how can he fight worthily  there is no croaking aboard of us we will warrant said twenty voices and shall be none as long as we command on board our own ships  hawkins having blown off his steam went back to drake and the bowls  fill my pipe drawerthat croaking fellows made me let it out of course spoilsports the father of all manner of troubles on earth be they noxious trade of croakers better to meet a bear robbed of her whelps francis drake as solomon saith than a fule who cant keep his mouth shut what brought mr andrew barker to his death but croakers what stopped fentons china voyage in the 82 and lost your nephew john and my brother will glory and hard cash too but croakers what sent back my lord cumberlands armada in the 86 and that after theyd proved their strength too sixty o mun against six hundred portugals and indians and yet wernt ashamed to turn round and come home emptyhanded after all my lords expenses that he had been at what but these same beggarly croakers that be only fit to be turned into yellowhammers up to dartymoor and sit on a tor all day and cry very little bit of bread and no cheeeese marry sneakup say i again  and what said drake would have kept me if id let em from ever sailing round the world but these same croakers i hanged my best friend for croaking john hawkins may god forgive me if i was wrong and i threatened a week after to hang thirty more and id have done it too if they hadnt clapped tompions into their muzzles pretty fast  youm right frank my old father always told meand old king hal bless his memory would take his counsel among a thousandand my son says he to me whatever you do never you stand no croaking but hang mun son jack hang mun up for an ensign theres scripture for it says he he was a mighty man to his bible after bloody marys days leastwise and tis written says he its expedient that one man die for the crew and that the whole crew perish not so show you no mercy son jack or youll find none leastwise in they manner of cattle for if you fail they stamps on you and if you succeeds they takes the credit of it to themselves and goes to heaven in your shoes those were his words and ive found mun truewho comth here now  captain fleming as im a sinner  fleming is he tired of life that he comth here to look for a halter ive a warrant out against mun for robbing of two flushingers on the high seas now this very last year is the fellow mazed or drunk then or has he seen a ghost look to mun  i think so truly said drake his eyes are near out of his head  the man was a roughbearded old seadog who had just burst in from the tavern through the low hatch upsetting a drawer with all his glasses and now came panting and blowing straight up to the high admiral  my lord my lord theym coming i saw them off the lizard last night  who my good sir who seem to have left your manners behind you  the armada your worshipthe spaniard but as for my manners tis no fault of mine for i never had none to leave behind me  if he has not left his manners behind quoth hawkins look out for your purses gentlemen all hes manners enough and very bad ones they be when he comth across a quiet flushinger  if i stole flushingers wines i never stole negurs souls jack hawkins so theres your answer my lord hang me if you will lifes short and deaths easy specially to seamen but if i didnt see the spanish fleet last sundown coming along halfmoon wise and full seven mile from wing to wing within a four mile of me im a sinner  sirrah said lord howard is this no fetch to cheat us out of your pardon for these piracies of yours  youll find out for yourself before nightfall my lord high admiral all jack fleming says is that this is a poor sort of an answer to a man who has put his own neck into the halter for the sake of his country  perhaps it is said lord howard and after all gentlemen what can this man gain by a lie which must be discovered ere a day is over except a more certain hanging  very true your lordship said hawkins mollified come here jack flemingwhat wilt drain man hippocras or alicant sack or john barleycorn and a pledge to thy repentance and amendment of life  admiral hawkins admiral hawkins this is no time for drinking  why not then my lord good news should be welcomed with good wine frank send down to the sexton and set the bells aringing to cheer up all honest hearts why my lord if it were not for the gravity of my office i could dance a galliard for joy  well you may dance port admiral but i must go and plan but god give to all captains such a heart as yours this day  and god give all generals such a head as yours come frank drake well play the game out before we move it will be two good days before we shall be fit to tackle them so an odd halfhour dont matter  i must command the help of your counsel viceadmiral said lord charles turning to drake  and its this my good lord said drake looking up as he aimed his bowl theyll come soon enough for us to show them sport and yet slow enough for us to be ready so let no man hurry himself and as example is better than precept here goes  lord howard shrugged his shoulders and departed knowing two things first that to move drake was to move mountains and next that when the selftaught hero did bestir himself he would do more work in an hour than any one else in a day so he departed followed hastily by most of the captains and drake said in a low voice to hawkins  does he think we are going to knock about on a leeshore all the afternoon and run our noses at nightand dead upwind toointo the dons mouths no jack my friend let orlandofuriosopunctiliofire eaters go and get their knuckles rapped the following game is the game and not the meeting one the dog goes after the sheep and not afore them lad let them go by and go by and stick to them well to windward and pick up stragglers and pickings too jackthe

well they havent sailed round the world jack hawkins  or had to run home from san juan dulloa with half a crew  well if we havent to run out with half crews i saw a sight of our lads drunk about this morning  the more reason for waiting till they be sober besides if everybodys caranting about to once each after his own men nobodyll find nothing in such a scrimmage as that bye bye uncle martin wem going to blow the dons up now in earnest    chapter xxxi  the great armada       britannia needs no bulwarks         no towers along the steep      her march is oer the mountain wave         her home is on the deep          campbell ye mariners of england  and now began that great seafight which was to determine whether popery and despotism or protestantism and freedom were the law which god had appointed for the half of europe and the whole of future america it is a twelve days epic worthy as i said in the beginning of this book not of dull prose but of the thunderroll of homers verse but having to tell it i must do my best rather using where i can the words of contemporary authors than my own  the lord high admirall of england sending a pinnace before called the defiance denounced war by discharging her ordnance and presently approaching with in musquetshot with much thundering out of his own ship called the arkroyall alias the triumph first set upon the admiralls as he thought of the spaniards but it was alfonso de leons ship soon after drake hawkins and frobisher played stoutly with their ordnance on the hindmost squadron which was commanded by recalde the spaniards soon discover the superior nimbleness of the english ships and recaldes squadron finding that they are getting more than they give in spite of his endeavors hurry forward to join the rest of the fleet medina the admiral finding his ships scattering fast gathers them into a halfmoon and the armada tries to keep solemn way forward like a stately herd of buffaloes who march on across the prairie disdaining to notice the wolves which snarl around their track but in vain these are no wolves but cunning hunters swiftly horsed and keenly armed and who will shamefully shuffle to use drakes own expression that vast herd from the lizard to portland from portland to calais roads and who even in this short two hours fight have made many a spaniard question the boasted invincibleness of this armada  one of the four great galliasses is already riddled with shot to the great disarrangement of her pulpits chapels and friars therein assistant the fleet has to close round her or drake and hawkins will sink her in effecting which manoeuvre the principal galleon of seville in which are pedro de valdez and a host of blueblooded dons runs foul of her neighbor carries away her foremast and is in spite of spanish chivalry left to her fate this does not look like victory certainly but courage though valdez be left behind our lady and the saints and the bull caena domini dictated by one whom i dare not name here are with them still and it were blasphemous to doubt but in the meanwhile if they have fared no better than this against a third of the plymouth fleet how will they fare when those forty belated ships which are already whitening the blue between them and the mewstone enter the scene to play their part  so ends the first day not an english ship hardly a man is hurt it has destroyed for ever in english minds the prestige of boastful spain it has justified utterly the policy which the good lord howard had adopted by raleighs and drakes advice of keeping up a running fight instead of clapping ships together without consideration in which case says raleigh he had been lost if he had not been better advised than a great many malignant fools were who found fault with his demeanor  be that as it may so ends the first day in which amyas and the other bideford ships have been right busy for two hours knocking holes in a huge galleon which carries on her poop a maiden with a wheel and bears the name of sta catharina she had a coat of arms on the flag at her sprit probably those of the commandant of soldiers but they were shot away early in the fight so amyas cannot tell whether they were de sotos or not nevertheless there is plenty of time for private revenge and amyas called off at last by the admirals signal goes to bed and sleeps soundly  but ere he has been in his hammock an hour he is awakened by carys coming down to ask for orders  we were to follow drakes lantern amyas but where it is i cant see unless he has been taken up aloft there among the stars for a new drakium sidus  amyas turns out grumbling but no lantern is to be seen only a sudden explosion and a great fire on board some spaniard which is gradually got under while they have to lieto the whole night long with nearly the whole fleet  the next morning finds them off torbay and amyas is hailed by a pinnace bringing a letter from drake which saving the spelling which was somewhat arbitrary like most mens in those days ran somewhat thus   dear ladi have been woolgathering all night after five great hulks which the pixies transfigured overnight into galleons and this morning again into german merchantmen i let them go with my blessing and coming back fell in god be thanked with valdez great galleon and in it good booty which the dons his fellows had left behind like faithful and valiant comrades and the lord howard had let slip past him thinking her deserted by her crew i have sent to dartmouth a sight of noblemen and gentlemen maybe a halfhundred and valdez himself who when i sent my pinnace aboard must needs stand on his punctilios and propound conditions i answered him i had no time to tell with him if he would needs die then i was the very man for him if he would live then buena querra he sends again boasting that he was don pedro valdez and that it stood not with his honor and that of the dons in his company i replied that for my part i was francis drake and my matches burning whereon he finds in my name salve for the wounds of his own and comes aboard kissing my fist with spanish lies of holding himself fortunate that he had fallen into the hands of fortunate drake and much more which he might have kept to cool his porridge but i have much news from him for he is a leaky tub and among others this that your don guzman is aboard of the sta catharina commandant of her soldiery and has his arms flying at her sprit beside sta catharina at the poop which is a maiden with a wheel and is a lofty built ship of 3 tier of ordnance from which god preserve you and send you like luck with  your deare friend and admirall  f drake  she sails in this squadron of recalde the armada was minded to smoke us out of plymouth and gods grace it was they tried not but their orders from home are too strait and so the slaves fight like a bull in a tether no farther than their rope finding thus the devil a hard master as do most in the end they cannot compass our quick handling and tacking and take us for very witches so far so good and better to come you and i know the length of their foot of old time and light will kill any hare and they will find it a long way from start to dunkirk   the admiral is in a gracious humor leigh to have vouchsafed you so long a letter  st catherine why that was the galleon we hammered all yesterday said amyas stamping on the deck  of course it was well we shall find her again doubt not that cunning old drake how he has contrived to line his own pockets even though he had to keep the whole fleet waiting for him  he has given the lord high admiral the dor at all events  lord howard is too highhearted to stop and plunder papist though he is amyas  amyas answered by a growl for he worshipped drake and was not too just to papists  the fleet did not find lord howard till nightfall he and lord sheffield had been holding on steadfastly the whole night after the spanish lanterns with two ships only at least there was no doubt now of the loyalty of english roman catholics and indeed throughout the fight the howards showed as if to wipe out the slurs which had been cast on their loyalty by fanatics a desperate courage which might have thrust less prudent men into destruction but led them only to victory soon a large spaniard drifts by deserted and partly burnt some of the men are for leaving their place to board her but amyas stoutly refuses he has come out to fight and not to plunder so let the nearest ship to her have her luck without grudging they pass on and the men pull long faces when they see the galleon snapped up by their next neighbor and towed off to weymouth where she proves to be the ship of miguel doquenda the viceadmiral which they saw last night all but blown up by some desperate netherland gunner who being misused was minded to pay off old scores on his tyrants  and so ends the second day while the portland rises higher and clearer every hour the next morning finds them off the island will they try portsmouth though they have spared plymouth the wind has shifted to the north and blows clear and cool off the whitewalled downs of weymouth bay the spaniards turn and face the english they must mean to stand off and on until the wind shall change and then to try for the needles at least they shall have some work to do before they round purbeck isle  the english go to the westward again but it is only to return on the opposite tack and now begin a series of manoeuvres each fleet trying to get the wind of the other but the struggle does not last long and ere noon the english fleet have slipped closehauled between the armada and the land and are coming down upon them right before the wind  and now begins a fight most fierce and fell and fight they did confusedly and with variable fortunes while on the one hand the english manfully rescued the ships of london which were hemmed in by the spaniards and on the other side the spaniards as stoutly delivered recalde being in danger never was heard such thundering of ordnance on both sides which notwithstanding from the spaniards flew for the most part over the english without harm only cock an englishman whom prince claims i hope rightfully as a worthy of devon died with honor in the midst of the enemies in a small ship of his for the english ships being far the lesser charged the enemy with marvellous agility and having discharged their broadsides flew forth presently into the deep and levelled their shot directly without missing at those great and unwieldy spanish ships this was the most furious and bloody skirmish of all though ending only it seems in the capture of a great venetian and some small craft in which the lord admiral fighting amidst his enemies fleet and seeing one of his captains afar off fenner by name he who fought the seven portugals at the azores cried o george what doest thou wilt thou now frustrate my hope and opinion conceived of thee wilt thou forsake me now with which words he being enflamed approached and did the part of a most valiant captain as indeed did all the rest  night falls upon the floating volcano and morning finds them far past purbeck with the white peak of freshwater ahead and pouring out past the needles ship after ship to join the gallant chase for now from all havens in vessels fitted out at their own expense flock the chivalry of england the lords oxford northumberland and cumberland pallavicin brooke carew raleigh and blunt and many another honorable name as to a set field where immortal fame and honor was to be attained spain has staked her chivalry in that mighty cast not a noble house of arragon or castile but has lent a brother or a sonand shall mourn the loss of one and englands gentlemen will measure their strength once for all against the cavaliers of spain lord howard has sent forward light craft into portsmouth for ammunition but they will scarce return tonight for the wind falls dead and all the evening the two fleets drift helpless with the tide and shout idle defiance at each other with trumpet fife and drum  the sun goes down upon a glassy sea and rises on a glassy sea again but what day is this the twentyfifth st jamessday sacred to the patron saint of spain shall nothing be attempted in his honor by those whose forefathers have so often seen him with their bodily eyes charging in their van upon his snowwhite steed and scattering paynims with celestial lance he might have sent them certainly a favoring breeze perhaps he only means to try their faith at least the galleys shall attack and in their van three of the great galliasses the fourth lies halfcrippled among the fleet thrash the sea to foam with three hundred oars apiece and see not st james leading them to victory but lord howards triumph his brothers lion southwells elizabeth jonas lord sheffields bear barkers victory and george fenners leicester towed stoutly out to meet them with such salvoes of chainshot smashing oars and cutting rigging that had not the wind sprung up again toward noon and the spanish fleet come up to rescue them they had shared the fate of valdez and the biscayan and now the fight becomes general frobisher beats down the spanish admirals mainmast and attacked himself by mexia and recalde is rescued by lord howard who himself endangered in his turn is rescued in his turn while after that day so sickened were they of the english gunnery no galliasse would adventure to fight  and so with variable fortune the fight thunders on the livelong afternoon beneath the virgin cliffs of freshwater while myriad seafowl rise screaming up from every ledge and spot with their black wings the snowwhite wall of chalk and the lone shepherd hurries down the slopes above to peer over the dizzy edge and forgets the wheatear fluttering in his snare while he gazes trembling upon glimpses of tall masts and gorgeous flags piercing at times the leaguebroad veil of sulphursmoke which welters far below  so fares st jamessday as baals did on carmel in old time either he is talking or he is pursuing or he is on a journey or peradventure he sleepeth and must be awaked at least the only fire by which he has answered his votaries has been that of english cannon and the armada gathering itself into a roundel will fight no more but make the best of its way to calais where perhaps the guises faction may have a french force ready to assist them and then to dunkirk to join with parma and the great flotilla of the netherlands  so on before a fair etesian gale which follows clear and bright out of the southsouthwest glide forward the two great fleets past brighton cliffs and beachy head hastings and dungeness is it a battle or a triumph for by sea lord howard instead of fighting is rewarding and after lord thomas howard lord sheffield townsend and frobisher have received at his hands that knighthood which was then more honorable than a peerage old admiral hawkins kneels and rises up sir john and shaking his shoulders after the accolade observes to the representative of majesty that his old woman will hardly know herself again when folks call her my lady  and meanwhile the cliffs are lined with pikemen and musketeers and by every countryman and groom who can bear arms led by their squires and sheriffs marching eastward as fast as their weapons let them towards the dover shore and not with them alone from many a mile inland come down women and children and aged folk in wagons to join their feeble shouts and prayers which are not feeble to that great cry of mingled faith and fear which ascends to the throne of god from the spectators of britains salamis  let them pray on the danger is not over yet though lord howard has had news from newhaven that the guises will not stir against england and seymour and winter have left their post of observation on the flemish shores to make up the number of the fleet to an hundred and forty saillarger slightly than that of the spanish fleet but of not more than half the tonnage or one third the number of men the spaniards are dispirited and battered but unbroken still and as they slide to their anchorage in calais roads on the saturday evening of that most memorable week all prudent men know well that englands hour is come and that the bells which will call all christendom to church upon the morrow morn will be either the deathknell or the triumphal peal of the reformed faith throughout the world  a solemn day that sabbath must have been in country and in town and many a lighthearted coward doubtless who had scoffed as many did at the notion of the armadas coming because he dare not face the thought gave himself up to abject fear as he now plainly saw and heard that of which before he would not be persuaded and many a brave man too as he knelt beside his wife and daughters felt his heart sink to the very pavement at the thought of what those beloved ones might be enduring a few short days hence from a profligate and fanatical soldiery or from the more deliberate fiendishness of the inquisition the massacre of st bartholomew the fires of smithfield the immolation of the moors the extermination of the west indians the fantastic horrors of the piedmontese persecution which make unreadable the too truthful pages of morlandthese were the spectres which not as now dim and distant through the mist of centuries but recent bleeding from still gaping wounds flitted before the eyes of every englishman and filled his brain and heart with fire  he knew full well the fate in store for him and his one false step and the unspeakable doom which not two generations afterwards befell the lutherans of magdeburg would have befallen every town from london to carlisle all knew the hazard as they prayed that day and many a day before and after throughout england and the netherlands and none knew it better than she who was the guiding spirit of that devoted land and the especial mark of the invaders fury and who by some divine inspiration as men then not unwisely held devised herself the daring stroke which was to anticipate the coming blow  but where is amyas leigh all this while day after day he has been seeking the sta catharina in the thickest of the press and cannot come at her cannot even hear of her one moment he dreads that she has sunk by night and balked him of his prey the next that she has repaired her damages and will escape him after all he is moody discontented restless even for the first time in his life peevish with his men he can talk of nothing but don guzman he can find no better employment at every spare moment than taking his sword out of the sheath and handling it fondling it talking to it even bidding it not to fail him in the day of vengeance at last he has sent to squire the armorer for a whetstone and halfashamed of his own folly whets and polishes it in byecorners muttering to himself that one fixed thought of selfish vengeance has possessed his whole mind he forgets englands present need her past triumph his own safety everything but his brothers blood and yet this is the day for which he has been longing ever since he brought home that magic horn as a fifteen years boy the day when he should find himself face to face with an invader and that invader antichrist himself he has believed for years with drake hawkins grenville and raleigh that he was called and sent into the world only to fight the spaniard and he is fighting him now in such a cause for such a stake within such battlelists as he will never see again and yet he is not content and while throughout that gallant fleet whole crews are receiving the communion side by side and rising with cheerful faces to shake hands and to rejoice that they are sharers in britains salamis amyas turns away from the holy elements  i cannot communicate sir john charity with all men i hate if ever man hated on earth  you hate the lords foes only captain leigh  no jack i hate my own as well  but no one in the fleet sir  dont try to put me off with the same jesuits quibble which that false knave parson fletcher invented for one of doughtys men to drug his conscience withal when he was plotting against his own admiral no jack i hate one of whom you know and somehow that hatred of him keeps me from loving any human being i am in love and charity with no man sir john brimblecombenot even with you go your ways in gods name sir and leave me and the devil alone together or youll find my words are true  jack departed with a sigh and while the crew were receiving the communion on deck amyas sate below in the cabin sharpening his sword and after it called for a boat and went on board drakes ship to ask news of the sta catharina and listened scowling to the loud chants and tinkling bells which came across the water from the spanish fleet at last drake was summoned by the lord admiral and returned with a secret commission which ought to bear fruit that night and amyas who had gone with him helped him till nightfall and then returned to his own ship as sir amyas leigh knight to the joy and glory of every soul on board except his moody self  so there the livelong summer sabbathday before the little highwalled town and the long range of yellow sandhills lie those two mighty armaments scowling at each other hardly out of gunshot messenger after messenger is hurrying towards bruges to the duke of parma for light craft which can follow these nimble english somewhat better than their own floating castles and above all entreating him to put to sea at once with all his force the duke is not with his forces at dunkirk but on the future field of waterloo paying his devotions to st mary of halle in hainault in order to make all sure in his pantheon and already sees in visions of the night that gentlesouled and purelipped saint cardinal allen placing the crown of england on his head he returns for answer first that his victual is not ready next that his dutch sailors who have been kept at their post for many a week at the swords point have run away like water and thirdly that over and above all he cannot come so strangely provided of great ordnance and musketeers are those fiveandthirty dutch ships in which roundsterned and stubbornhearted heretics watch like terriers at a rats hole the entrance of nieuwport and dunkirk having ensured the private patronage of st mary of halle he will return tomorrow to make experience of its effects but only hear across the flats of dixmude the thunder of the fleets and at dunkirk the open curses of his officers for while he has been praying and nothing more the english have been praying and something more and all that is left for the prince of parma is to hang a few purveyors as peace offerings to his sulking army and then chafe as drake says of him like a bear robbed of her whelps  for lord henry seymour has brought lord howard a letter of command from elizabeths self and drake has been carrying it out so busily all that sunday long that by two oclock on the monday morning eight fireships besmeared with wildfire brimstone pitch and resin and all their ordnance charged with bullets and with stones are stealing down the wind straight for the spanish fleet guided by two valiant men of devon young and prowse let their names live long in the land the ships are fired the men of devon steal back and in a moment more the heaven is red with glare from dover cliffs to gravelines tower and wearyhearted belgian boors far away inland plundered and dragooned for many a hideous year leap from their beds and fancy and not so far wrongly either that the day of judgment is come at last to end their woes and hurl down vengeance on their tyrants  and then breaks forth one of those disgraceful panics which so often follow overweening presumption and shrieks oaths prayers and reproaches make night hideous there are those too on board who recollect well enough jenebellis fireships at antwerp three years before and the wreck which they made of parmas bridge across the scheldt if these should be like them and cutting all cables hoisting any sails the invincible armada goes lumbering wildly out to sea every ship foul of her neighbor  the largest of the four galliasses loses her rudder and drifts helpless to and fro hindering and confusing the duke having so the spaniards say weighed his anchor deliberately instead of leaving it behind him runs in again after awhile and fires a signal for return but his truant sheep are deaf to the shepherds pipe and swearing and praying by turns he runs up channel towards gravelines picking up stragglers on his way who are struggling as they best can among the flats and shallows but drake and fenner have arrived as soon as he when mondays sun rises on the quaint old castle and muddy dykes of gravelines town the thunder of the cannon recommences and is not hushed till night drake can hang coolly enough in the rear to plunder when he thinks fit but when the battle needs it none can fight more fiercely among the foremost and there is need now if ever that armada must never be allowed to reform if it does its left wing may yet keep the english at bay while its right drives off the blockading hollanders from dunkirk port and sets parma and his flotilla free to join them and to sail in doubled strength across to the mouth of thames  so drake has weighed anchor and away up channel with all his squadron the moment that he saw the spanish fleet come up and with him fenner burning to redeem the honor which indeed he had never lost and ere fenton beeston crosse ryman and lord southwell can join them the devon ships have been worrying the spaniards for two full hours into confusion worse confounded  but what is that heavy firing behind them alas for the great galliasse she lies like a huge stranded whale upon the sands where now stands calais pier and amyas preston the future hero of la guayra is pounding her into submission while a fleet of hoys and drumblers look on and help as jackals might the lion  soon on the southwest horizon loom up larger and larger two mighty ships and behind them sail on sail as they near a shout greets the triumph and the bear and on and in the lord high admiral glides stately into the thickest of the fight  true we have still but some threeandtwenty ships which can cope at all with some ninety of the spaniards but we have dash and daring and the inspiration of utter need now or never must the mighty struggle be ended we worried them off portland we must rend them in pieces now and in rushes ship after ship to smash her broadsides through and through the wooden castles sometimes not a pikes length asunder and then out again to reload and give place meanwhile to another the smaller are fighting with all sails set the few larger who once in are careless about coming out again fight with topsails loose and their main and foreyards close down on deck to prevent being boarded the duke oquenda and recalde having with much ado got clear of the shallows bear the brunt of the fight to seaward but in vain the day goes against them more and more as it runs on seymour and winter have battered the great san philip into a wreck her masts are gone by the board pimentelli in the san matthew comes up to take the mastiffs off the fainting bull and finds them fasten on him instead but the evangelist though smaller is stouter than the deacon and of all the shot poured into him not twenty lackt him thorough his masts are tottering but sink or strike he will not  go ahead and pound his tough hide leigh roars drake off the poop of his ship while he hammers away at one of the great galliasses what right has he to keep us all waiting  amyas slips in as best he can between drake and winter as he passes he shouts to his ancient enemy  we are with you sir all friends today and slipping round winters bows he pours his broadside into those of the san matthew and then glides on to reload but not to return for not a pistol shot to leeward worried by three or four small craft lies an immense galleon and on her poopcan he believe his eyes for joythe maiden and the wheel which he has sought so long  there he is shouts amyas springing to the starboard side of the ship the men too have already caught sight of that hated sign a cheer of fury bursts from every throat  steady men says amyas in a suppressed voice not a shot reload and be ready i must speak with him first and silent as the grave amid the infernal din the vengeance glides up to the spaniards quarter  don guzman maria magdalena sotomayor de soto shouts amyas from the mizzen rigging loud and clear amid the roar  he has not called in vain fearless and graceful as ever the tall mailclad figure of his foe leaps up upon the pooprailing twenty feet above amyass head and shouts through his vizor  at your service sir whosoever you may be  a dozen muskets and arrows are levelled at him but amyas frowns them down no man strikes him but i spare him if you kill every other soul on board don guzman i am captain sir amyas leigh i proclaim you a traitor and a ravisher and challenge you once more to single combat when and where you will  you are welcome to come on board me sir answers the spaniard in a clear quiet tone bringing with you this answer that you lie in your throat and lingering a moment out of bravado to arrange his scarf he steps slowly down again behind the bulwarks  coward shouts amyas at the top of his voice  the spaniard reappears instantly why that name senor of all others asks he in a cool stern voice  because we call men cowards in england who leave their wives to be burnt alive by priests  the moment the words had passed amyass lips he felt that they were cruel and unjust but it was too late to recall them the spaniard started clutched his swordhilt and then hissed back through his closed vizor  for that word sirrah you hang at my yardarm if saint mary gives me grace  see that your halter be a silken one then laughed amyas for i am just dubbed knight and he stepped down as a storm of bullets rang through the rigging round his head the spaniards are not as punctilious as he  fire his ordnance crash through the sternworks of the spaniard and then he sails onward while her balls go humming harmlessly through his rigging  halfanhour has passed of wild noise and fury three times has the vengeance as a dolphin might sailed clean round and round the sta catharina pouring in broadside after broadside till the guns are leaping to the deckbeams with their own heat and the spaniards sides are slit and spotted in a hundred places and yet so high has been his fire in return and so strong the deck defences of the vengeance that a few spars broken and two or three men wounded by musketry are all her loss but still the spaniard endures magnificent as ever it is the battle of the thresher and the whale the end is certain but the work is long  can i help you captain leigh asked lord henry seymour as he passes within oars length of him to attack a ship ahead the san matthew has had his dinner and is gone on to medina to ask for a digestive to it  i thank your lordship but this is my private quarrel of which i spoke but if your lordship could lend me powder  would that i could but so i fear says every other gentleman in the fleet  a puff of wind clears away the sulphurous veil for a moment the sea is clear of ships towards the land the spanish fleet are moving again up channel medina bringing up the rear only some two miles to their right hand the vast hull of the san philip is drifting up the shore with the tide and somewhat nearer the san matthew is hard at work at her pumps they can see the white stream of water pouring down her side  go in my lord and have the pair shouts amyas  no sir forward is a seymours cry we will leave them to pay the flushingers expenses and on went lord henry and on shore went the san philip at ostend to be plundered by the flushingers while the san matthew whose captain on a hault courage had refused to save himself and his gentlemen on board medinas ship went blundering miserably into the hungry mouths of captain peter vanderduess and four other valiant dutchmen who like prudent men of holland contrived to keep the galleon afloat till they had emptied her and then hung up her banner in the great church of leyden being of such a length that being fastened to the roof it reached unto the very ground  but in the meanwhile long ere the sun had set comes down the darkness of the thunderstorm attracted as to a volcanos mouth to that vast mass of sulphursmoke which cloaks the sea for many a mile and heavens artillery above makes answer to mans below but still through smoke and rain amyas clings to his prey she too has seen the northward movement of the spanish fleet and sets her topsails amyas calls to the men to fire high and cripple her rigging but in vain for three or four belated galleys having forced their way at last over the shallows come flashing and sputtering up to the combatants and take his fire off the galleon amyas grinds his teeth and would fain hustle into the thick of the press once more in spite of the galleys beaks  most heroical captain says cary pulling a long face if we do we are stove and sunk in five minutes not to mention that yeo says he has not twenty rounds of great cartridge left  so surely and silent the vengeance sheers off but keeps as near as she can to the little squadron all through the night of rain and thunder which follows next morning the sun rises on a clear sky with a strong westnorthwest breeze and all hearts are asking what the day will bring forth  they are long past dunkirk now the german ocean is opening before them the spaniards sorely battered and lessened in numbers have during the night regained some sort of order the english hang on their skirts a mile or two behind they have no ammunition and must wait for more to amyass great disgust the sta catharina has rejoined her fellows during the night  never mind says cary she can neither dive nor fly and as long as she is above water wewhat is the admiral about  he is signalling lord henry seymour and his squadron soon they tack and come down the wind for the coast of flanders parma must be blockaded still and the hollanders are likely to be too busy with their plunder to do it effectually suddenly there is a stir in the spanish fleet medina and the rearmost ships turn upon the english what can it mean will they offer battle once more if so it were best to get out of their way for we have nothing wherewith to fight them so the english lie close to the wind they will let them pass and return to their old tactic of following and harassing  goodbye to seymour says cary if he is caught between them and parmas flotilla they are going to dunkirk  impossible they will not have water enough to reach his light craft here comes a big ship right upon us give him all you have left lads and if he will fight us lay him alongside and die boarding  they gave him what they had and hulled him with every shot but his huge side stood silent as the grave he had not wherewithal to return the compliment  as i live he is cutting loose the foot of his mainsail the villain means to run  there go the rest of them victoria shouted cary as one after another every spaniard set all the sail he could  there was silence for a few minutes throughout the english fleet and then cheer upon cheer of triumph rent the skies it was over the spaniard had refused battle and thinking only of safety was pressing downward toward the straits again the invincible armada had cast away its name and england was saved  but he will never get there sir said old yeo who had come upon deck to murmur his nunc domine and gaze upon that sight beyond all human faith or hope never never will he weather the flanders shore against such a breeze as is coming up look to the eye of the wind sir and see how the lord is fighting for his people  yes down it came fresher and stiffer every minute out of the gray northwest as it does so often after a thunderstorm and the sea began to rise high and white under the claro aquilone till the spaniards were fain to take in all spare canvas and lieto as best they could while the english fleet lyingto also awaited an event which was in gods hands and not in theirs  they will be all ashore on zealand before the afternoon murmured amyas and i have lost my labor oh for powder powder powder to go in and finish it at once  oh sir said yeo dont murmur against the lord in the very day of his mercies it is hard to be sure but his will be done  could we not borrow powder from drake there  look at the sea sir  and indeed the sea was far too rough for any such attempt the spaniards neared and neared the fatal dunes which fringed the shore for many a dreary mile and amyas had to wait weary hours growling like a dog who has had the bone snatched out of his mouth till the day wore on when behold the wind began to fall as rapidly as it had risen a savage joy rose in amyass heart  they are safe safe for us who will go and beg us powder a cartridge here and a cartridge thereanything to set to work again  cary volunteered and returned in a couple of hours with some quantity but he was on board again only just in time for the southwester had recovered the mastery of the skies and spaniards and english were moving away but this time northward whither now to scotland amyas knew not and cared not provided he was in the company of don guzman de soto  the armada was defeated and england saved but such great undertakings seldom end in one grand melodramatic explosion of fireworks through which the devil arises in full roar to drag dr faustus forever into the flaming pit on the contrary the devil stands by his servants to the last and tries to bring off his shattered forces with drums beating and colors flying and if possible to lull his enemies into supposing that the fight is ended long before it really is half over all which the good lord howard of effingham knew well and knew too that medina had one last card to play and that was the filial affection of that dutiful and chivalrous son james of scotland true he had promised faith to elizabeth but that was no reason why he should keep it he had been hankering and dabbling after spain for years past for its absolution was dear to his inmost soul and queen elizabeth had had to warn him scold him call him a liar for so doing so the armada might still find shelter and provision in the firth of forth but whether lord howard knew or not medina did not know that elizabeth had played her card cunningly in the shape of one of those appeals to the purse which to jamess dying day overweighed all others save appeals to his vanity the title of a dukedom in england a yearly pension of 5000 pounds a guard at the queens charge and other matters probably more hounds and deer had steeled the heart of the king of scots and sealed the firth of forth nevertheless as i say lord howard like the rest of elizabeths heroes trusted james just as much as james trusted others and therefore thought good to escort the armada until it was safely past the domains of that most chivalrous and truthful solomon but on the 4th of august his fears such as they were were laid to rest the spaniards left the scottish coast and sailed away for norway and the game was played out and the end was come as the end of such matters generally comes by gradual decay petty disaster and mistake till the snowmountain instead of being blown tragically and heroically to atoms melts helplessly and pitiably away    chapter xxxii  how amyas threw his sword into the sea       full fathom deep thy father lies         of his bones are corals made      those are pearls which were his eyes         nothing of him that doth fade      but

great armada is vanquished it is lulled for awhile the everlasting war which is in heaven the battle of iran and turan of the children of light and of darkness of michael and his angels against satan and his fiends the battle which slowly and seldom once in the course of many centuries culminates and ripens into a day of judgment and becomes palpable and incarnate no longer a mere spiritual fight but one of flesh and blood wherein simple men may choose their sides without mistake and help gods cause not merely with prayer and pen but with sharp shot and cold steel a day of judgment has come which has divided the light from the darkness and the sheep from the goats and tried each mans work by the fire and behold the devils work like its maker is proved to have been as always a lie and a sham and a windy boast a bladder which collapses at the merest pinprick byzantine empires spanish armadas triplecrowned papacies russian despotisms this is the way of them and will be to the end of the world one brave blow at the big bullying phantom and it vanishes in sulphurstench while the children of israel as of old see the egyptians dead on the seashorethey scarce know how save that god has done it and sing the song of moses and of the lamb  and now from england and the netherlands from germany and geneva and those poor vaudois shepherdsaints whose bones for generations past       lie scattered on the alpine mountains cold  to be indeed the seed of the church and a germ of new life liberty and civilization even in these very days returning good for evil to that piedmont which has hunted them down like the partridges on the mountainsfrom all of europe from all of mankind i had almost said in which lay the seed of future virtue and greatness of the destinies of the newdiscovered world and the triumphs of the coming age of science arose a shout of holy joy such as the world had not heard for many a weary and bloody century a shout which was the prophetic birthpaean of north america australia new zealand the pacific islands of free commerce and free colonization over the whole earth  there was in england by the commandment of her majesty says van meteran and likewise in the united provinces by the direction of the states a solemn festival day publicly appointed wherein all persons were solemnly enjoined to resort unto ye church and there to render thanks and praises unto god and ye preachers were commanded to exhort ye people thereunto the aforesaid solemnity was observed upon the 29th of november which day was wholly spent in fasting prayer and giving of thanks  likewise the queens majesty herself imitating ye ancient romans rode into london in triumph in regard of her own and her subjects glorious deliverance for being attended upon very solemnly by all ye principal estates and officers of her realm she was carried through her said city of london in a triumphant chariot and in robes of triumph from her palace unto ye said cathedral church of st paul out of ye which ye ensigns and colours of ye vanquished spaniards hung displayed and all ye citizens of london in their liveries stood on either side ye street by their several companies with their ensigns and banners and the streets were hanged on both sides with blue cloth which together with ye foresaid banners yielded a very stately and gallant prospect her majestie being entered into ye church together with her clergy and nobles gave thanks unto god and caused a public sermon to be preached before her at pauls cross wherein none other argument was handled but that praise honour and glory might be rendered unto god and that gods name might be extolled by thanksgiving and with her own princely voice she most christianly exhorted ye people to do ye same whereunto ye people with a loud acclamation wished her a most long and happy life to ye confusion of her foes  yes as the medals struck on the occasion said it came it saw and it fled and whither away and northward like a herd of frightened deer past the orkneys and shetlands catching up a few hapless fishermen as guides past the coast of norway there too refused water and food by the brave descendants of the vikings and on northward ever towards the lonely faroes and the everlasting dawn which heralds round the pole the midnight sun  their water is failing the cattle must go overboard and the wild northern sea echoes to the shrieks of drowning horses they must homeward at least somehow each as best he can let them meet again at cape finisterre if indeed they ever meet medina sidonia with some fiveand twenty of the soundest and best victualled ships will lead the way and leave the rest to their fate he is soon out of sight and forty more the only remnant of that mighty host come wandering wearily behind hoping to make the southwest coast of ireland and have help or at least fresh water there from their fellow romanists alas for them       make thou their way dark and slippery      and follow them up ever with thy storm  for now comes up from the atlantic gale on gale and few of that hapless remnant reached the shores of spain  and where are amyas and the vengeance all this while  at the fiftyseventh degree of latitude the english fleet finding themselves growing short of provision and having been long since out of powder and ball turn southward toward home thinking it best to leave the spaniard to those uncouth and boisterous northern seas a few pinnaces are still sent onward to watch their course and the english fleet caught in the same storms which scattered the spaniards with great danger and industry reached harwich port and there provide themselves of victuals and ammunition in case the spaniards should return but there is no need for that caution parma indeed who cannot believe that the idol at halle after all his compliments to it will play him so scurvy a trick will watch for weeks on dunkirk dunes hoping against hope for the armadas return casting anchors and spinning rigging to repair their losses       but lang lang may his ladies sit      with their fans intill their hand      before they see sir patrick spens      come sailing to the land  the armada is away on the other side of scotland and amyas is following in its wake  for when the lord high admiral determined to return amyas asked leave to follow the spaniard and asked too of sir john hawkins who happened to be at hand such ammunition and provision as could be afforded him promising to repay the same like an honest man out of his plunder if he lived out of his estate if he died lodging for that purpose bills in the hands of sir john who as a man of business took them and put them in his pocket among the thimbles string and tobacco after which amyas calling his men together reminded them once more of the story of the rose of torridge and don guzman de soto and then asked  men of bideford will you follow me there will be plunder for those who love plunder revenge for those who love revenge and for all of us for we all love honor the honor of having never left the chase as long as there was a spanish flag in english seas  and every soul on board replied that they would follow sir amyas leigh around the world  there is no need for me to detail every incident of that long and weary chase how they found the sta catharina attacked her and had to sheer off she being rescued by the rest how when medinas squadron left the crippled ships behind they were all but taken or sunk by thrusting into the midst of the spanish fleet to prevent her escaping with medina how they crippled her so that she could not beat to windward out into the ocean but was fain to run south past the orkneys and down through the minch between cape wrath and lewis how the younger hands were ready to mutiny because amyas in his stubborn haste ran past two or three noble prizes which were all but disabled among others one of the great galliasses and the two great venetians la ratta and la belanzarawhich were afterwards with more than thirty other vessels wrecked on the west coast of ireland how he got fresh water in spite of certain hebridean scots of skye who after reviling him in an unknown tongue fought with him awhile and then embraced him and his men with howls of affection and were not much more decently clad nor more civilized than his old friends of california how he pacified his men by letting them pick the bones of a great venetian which was going on shore upon islay by which they got booty enough to repay them for the whole voyage and offended them again by refusing to land and plunder two great spanish wrecks on the mull of cantire whose crews by the by james tried to smuggle off secretly into spain in ships of his own wishing to play as usual both sides of the game at once but the spaniards were stopped at yarmouth till the councils pleasure was knownwhich was of course to let the poor wretches go on their way and be hanged elsewhere how they passed a strange island half black half white which the wild people called raghary but cary christened it the drowned magpie how the sta catharina was near lost on the isle of man and then put into castleton where the manxmen slew a whole boatscrew with their arrows and then put out again when amyas fought with her a whole day and shot away her mainyard how the spaniard blundered down the coast of wales not knowing whither he went how they were both nearly lost on holyhead and again on bardsey island how they got on a lee shore in cardigan bay before a heavy westerly gale and the sta catharina ran aground on sarn david one of those strange subaqueous pebbledykes which are said to be the remnants of the lost land of gwalior destroyed by the carelessness of prince seithenin the drunkard at whose name each loyal welshman spits how she got off again at the rising of the tide and fought with amyas a fourth time how the wind changed and she got round st davids headthese and many more moving incidents of this eventful voyage i must pass over without details and go on to the end for it is time that the end should come  it was now the sixteenth day of the chase they had seen the evening before st davids head and then the welsh coast round milford haven looming out black and sharp before the blaze of the inland thunderstorm and it had lightened all round them during the fore part of the night upon a light southwestern breeze  in vain they had strained their eyes through the darkness to catch by the fitful glare of the flashes the tall masts of the spaniard of one thing at least they were certain that with the wind as it was she could not have gone far to the westward and to attempt to pass them again and go northward was more than she dare do she was probably lyingto ahead of them perhaps between them and the land and when a little after midnight the wind chopped up to the west and blew stiffly till day break they felt sure that unless she had attempted the desperate expedient of running past them they had her safe in the mouth of the bristol channel slowly and wearily broke the dawn on such a day as often follows heavy thunder a sunless drizzly day roofed with low dingy cloud barred and netted and festooned with black a sign that the storm is only taking breath awhile before it bursts again while all the narrow horizon is dim and spongy with vapor drifting before a chilly breeze as the day went on the breeze died down and the sea fell to a long glassy foamflecked roll while overhead brooded the inky sky and round them the leaden mist shut out alike the shore and the chase  amyas paced the sloppy deck fretfully and fiercely he knew that the spaniard could not escape but he cursed every moment which lingered between him and that one great revenge which blackened all his soul the men sate sulkily about the deck and whistled for a wind the sails flapped idly against the masts and the ship rolled in the long troughs of the sea till her yardarms almost dipped right and left  take care of those guns you will have something loose next growled amyas  we will take care of the guns if the lord will take care of the wind said yeo  we shall have plenty before night said cary and thunder too  so much the better said amyas it may roar till it splits the heavens if it does but let me get my work done  hes not far off i warrant said cary one lift of the cloud and we should see him  to windward of us as likely as not said amyas the devil fights for him i believe to have been on his heels sixteen days and not sent this through him yet and he shook his sword impatiently  so the morning wore away without a sign of living thing not even a passing gull and the black melancholy of the heaven reflected itself in the black melancholy of amyas was he to lose his prey after all the thought made him shudder with rage and disappointment it was intolerable anything but that  no god he cried let me but once feel this in his accursed heart and thenstrike me dead if thou wilt  the lord have mercy on us cried john brimblecombe what have you said  what is that to you sir there they are piping to dinner go down i shall not come  and jack went down and talked in a halfterrified whisper of amyass ominous words  all thought that they portended some bad luck except old yeo  well sir john said he and why not what better can the lord do for a man than take him home when he has done his work our captain is wilful and spiteful and must needs kill his man himself while for me i dont care how the don goes provided he does go i owe him no grudge nor any man may the lord give him repentance and forgive him all his sins but if i could but see him once safe ashore as he may be ere nightfall on the mortestone or the back of lundy i would say lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace even if it were the lightning which was sent to fetch me  but master yeo a sudden death  and why not a sudden death sir john even fools long for a short life and a merry one and shall not the lords people pray for a short death and a merry one let it come as it will to old yeo hark theres the captains voice  here she is thundered amyas from the deck and in an instant all were scrambling up the hatchway as fast as the frantic rolling of the ship would let them  yes there she was the cloud had lifted suddenly and to the south a ragged bore of blue sky let a long stream of sunshine down on her tall masts and stately hull as she lay rolling some four or five miles to the eastward but as for land none was to be seen  there she is and here we are said cary but where is here and where is there how is the tide master  running up channel by this time sir  what matters the tide said amyas devouring the ship with terrible and cold blue eyes cant we get at her  not unless some one jumps out and shoves behind said cary i shall down again and finish that mackerel if this roll has not chucked it to the cockroaches under the table  dont jest will i cant stand it said amyas in a voice which quivered so much that cary looked at him his whole frame was trembling like an aspen cary took his arm and drew him aside  dear old lad said he as they leaned over the bulwarks what is this you are not yourself and have not been these four days  no i am not amyas leigh i am my brothers avenger do not reason with me will when it is over i shall be merry old amyas again and he passed his hand over his brow  do you believe said he after a moment that men can be possessed by devils  the bible says so  if my cause were not a just one i should fancy i had a devil in me my throat and heart are as hot as the pit would to god it were done for done it must be now go  cary went away with a shudder as he passed down the hatchway he looked back amyas had got the hone out of his pocket and was whetting away again at his swordedge as if there was some dreadful doom on him to whet and whet forever  the weary day wore on the strip of blue sky was curtained over again and all was dismal as before though it grew sultrier every moment and now and then a distant mutter shook the air to westward nothing could be done to lessen the distance between the ships for the vengeance had had all her boats carried away but one and that was much too small to tow her and while the men went down again to finish dinner amyas worked on at his sword looking up every now and then suddenly at the spaniard as if to satisfy himself that it was not a vision which had vanished  about two yeo came up to him  he is ours safely now sir the tide has been running to the eastward for this two hours  safe as a fox in a trap satan himself cannot take him from us  but god may said brimblecombe simply  who spoke to you sir if i thought that hethere comes the thunder at last  and as he spoke an angry growl from the westward heavens seemed to answer his wild words and rolled and loudened nearer and nearer till right over their heads it crashed against some cloudcliff far above and all was still  each man looked in the others face but amyas was unmoved  the storm is coming said he and the wind in it it will be eastwardho now for once my merry men all  eastwardho never brought us luck said jack in an undertone to cary but by this time all eyes were turned to the northwest where a black line along the horizon began to define the boundary of sea and air till now all dim in mist  there comes the breeze  and there the storm too  and with that strangely accelerating pace which some storms seem to possess the thunder which had been growling slow and seldom far away now rang peal on peal along the cloudy floor above their heads  here comes the breeze round with the yards or we shall be taken aback  the yards creaked round the sea grew crisp around them the hot air swept their cheeks tightened every rope filled every sail bent her over a cheer burst from the men as the helm went up and they staggered away before the wind right down upon the spaniard who lay still becalmed  there is more behind amyas said cary shall we not shorten sail a little  no hold on every stitch said amyas give me the helm man boatswain pipe away to clear for fight  it was done and in ten minutes the men were all at quarters while the thunder rolled louder and louder overhead and the breeze freshened fast  the dog has it now there he goes said cary  right before the wind he has no liking to face us  he is running into the jaws of destruction said yeo an hour more will send him either right up the channel or smack on shore somewhere  there he has put his helm down i wonder if he sees land  he is like a march hare beat out of his country said cary and dont know whither to run next  cary was right in ten minutes more the spaniard fell off again and went away dead down wind while the vengeance gained on him fast after two hours more the four miles had diminished to one while the lightning flashed nearer and nearer as the storm came up and from the vast mouth of a black cloudarch poured so fierce a breeze that amyas yielded unwillingly to hints which were growing into open murmurs and bade shorten sail  on they rushed with scarcely lessened speed the black arch following fast curtained by the flat gray sheet of pouring rain before which the water was boiling in a long white line while every moment behind the watery veil a keen blue spark leapt down into the sea or darted zigzag through the rain  we shall have it now and with a vengeance this will try your tackle master said cary  the functionary answered with a shrug and turned up the collar of his rough frock as the first drops flew stinging round his ears another minute and the squall burst full upon them in rain which cut like hailhail which lashed the sea into froth and wind which whirled off the heads of the surges and swept the waters into one white seething waste and above them and behind them and before them the lightning leapt and ran dazzling and blinding while the deep roar of the thunder was changed to sharp earpiercing cracks  get the arms and ammunition under cover and then below with you all shouted amyas from the helm  and heat the pokers in the galley fire said yeo to be ready if the rain puts our linstocks out i hope youll let me stay on deck sir in case  i must have some one and who better than you can you see the chase  no she was wrapped in the gray whirlwind she might be within half a mile of them for aught they could have seen of her  and now amyas and his old liegeman were alone neither spoke each knew the others thoughts and knew that they were his own the squall blew fiercer and fiercer the rain poured heavier and heavier where was the spaniard  if he has laidto we may overshoot him sir  if he has tried to layto he will not have a sail left in the boltropes or perhaps a mast on deck i know the stiffneckedness of those spanish tubs hurrah there he is right on our larboard bow  there she was indeed two musketshots off staggering away with canvas split and flying  he has been trying to hull sir and caught a buffet said yeo rubbing his hands what shall we do now  range alongside if it blow live imps and witches and try our luck once more pah how this lightning dazzles  on they swept gaining fast on the spaniard call the men up and to quarters the rain will be over in ten minutes  yeo ran forward to the gangway and sprang back again with a face white and wild  land right ahead port your helm sir for the love of god port your helm  amyas with the strength of a bull jammed the helm down while yeo shouted to the men below  she swung round the masts bent like whips crack went the foresail like a cannon what matter within two hundred yards of them was the spaniard in front of her and above her a huge dark bank rose through the dense hail and mingled with the clouds and at its foot plainer every moment pillars and spouts of leaping foam  what is it morte hartland  it might be anything for thirty miles  lundy said yeo the south end i see the head of the shutter in the breakers hard aport yet and get her closehauled as you can and the lord may have mercy on us still look at the spaniard  yes look at the spaniard  on their left hand as they broachedto the wall of granite sloped down from the clouds toward an isolated peak of rock some two hundred feet in height then a hundred yards of roaring breaker upon a sunken shelf across which the race of the tide poured like a cataract then amid a column of salt smoke the shutter like a huge black fang rose waiting for its prey and between the shutter and the land the great galleon loomed dimly through the storm  he too had seen his danger and tried to broachto but his clumsy mass refused to obey the helm he struggled a moment half hid in foam fell away again and rushed upon his doom  lost lost lost cried amyas madly and throwing up his hands let go the tiller yeo caught it just in time  sir sir what are you at we shall clear the rock yet  yes shouted amyas in his frenzy but he will not  another minute the galleon gave a sudden jar and stopped then one long heave and bound as if to free herself and then her bows lighted clean upon the shutter  an awful silence fell on every english soul they heard not the roaring of wind and surge they saw not the blinding flashes of the lightning but they heard one long earpiercing wail to every saint in heaven rise from five hundred human throats they saw the mighty ship heel over from the wind and sweep headlong down the cataract of the race plunging her yards into the foam and showing her whole black side even to her keel till she rolled clean over and vanished for ever and ever  shame cried amyas hurling his sword far into the sea to lose my right my right when it was in my very grasp unmerciful  a crack which rent the sky and made the granite ring and quiver a bright world of flame and then a blank of utter darkness against which stood out glowing redhot every mast and sail and rock and salvation yeo as he stood just in front of amyas the tiller in his hand all redhot transfigured into fire and behind the black black night                          a whisper a rustling close beside him and brimblecombes voice said softly  give him more wine will his eyes are opening  hey day said amyas faintly not past the shutter yet how long she hangs in the wind  we are long past the shutter sir amyas said brimblecombe  are you mad cannot i trust my own eyes  there was no answer for awhile  we are past the shutter indeed said cary very gently and lying in the cove at lundy  will you tell me that that is not the shutter and that the devilslimekiln and that the cliffthat villain spaniard only goneand that yeo is not standing here by me and cary there forward andwhy by the by where are you jack brimblecombe who were talking to me this minute  oh sir amyas leigh dear sir amyas leigh blubbered poor jack put out your hand and feel where you are and pray the lord to forgive you for your wilfulness  a great trembling fell upon amyas leigh half fearfully he put out his hand he felt that he was in his hammock with the deck beams close above his head the vision which had been left upon his eyeballs vanished like a dream  what is this i must be asleep what has happened where am i  in your cabin amyas said cary  what and where is yeo  yeo is gone where he longed to go and as he longed to go the same flash which struck you down struck him dead  dead lightning any more hurt i must go and see why what is this and amyas passed his hand across his eyes it is all darkdark as i live and he passed his hand over his eyes again  there was another dead silence amyas broke it  oh god shrieked the great proud seacaptain oh god i am blind blind blind and writhing in his great horror he called to cary to kill him and put him out of his misery and then wailed for his mother to come and help him as if he had been a boy once more while brimblecombe and cary and the sailors who crowded round the cabindoor wept as if they too had been boys once more  soon his fit of frenzy passed off and he sank back exhausted  they lifted him into their remaining boat rowed him ashore carried him painfully up the hill to the old castle and made a bed for him on the floor in the very room in which don guzman and rose salterne had plighted their troth to each other five wild years before  three miserable days were passed within that lonely tower amyas utterly unnerved by the horror of his misfortune and by the overexcitement of the last few weeks was incessantly delirious while cary and brimblecombe and the men nursed him by turns as sailors and wives only can nurse and listened with awe to his piteous selfreproaches and entreaties to heaven to remove that woe which as he shrieked again and again was a just judgment on him for his wilfulness and ferocity the surgeon talked of course learnedly about melancholic humors and his livers being adust by the overpungency of the animal spirits and then fell back on the universal panacea of bloodletting which he effected with fear and trembling during a short interval of prostration encouraged by which he attempted to administer a large bolus of aloes was knocked down for his pains and then thought it better to leave nature to her own work in the meanwhile cary had sent off one of the island skiffs to clovelly with letters to his father and to mrs leigh entreating the latter to come off to the island but the heavy westerly winds made that as impossible as it was to move amyas on board and the men had to do their best and did it well enough  on the fourth day his raving ceased but he was still too weak to be moved toward noon however he called for food ate a little and seemed revived  will he said after awhile this room is as stifling as it is dark i feel as if i should be a sound man once more if i could but get one snuff of the seabreeze  the surgeon shook his head at the notion of moving him but amyas was peremptory  i am captain still tom surgeon and will sail for the indies if i choose will cary jack brimblecombe will you obey a blind general  what you will in reason said they both at once  then lead me out my masters and over the down to the south end to the point at the south end i must go there is no other place will suit  and he rose firmly to his feet and held out his hands for theirs  let him have his humor whispered cary it may be the working off of his madness  this sudden strength is a note of fresh fever mr lieutenant said the surgeon and the rules of the art prescribe rather a fresh bloodletting  amyas overheard the last word and broke out  thou pigsticking philistine wilt thou make sport with blind samson come near me to let blood from my arm and see if i do not let blood from thy coxcomb catch him will and bring him me here  the surgeon vanished as the blind giant made a step forward and they set forth amyas walking slowly but firmly between his two friends  whither asked cary  to the south end the crag above the devilslimekiln no other place will suit  jack gave a murmur and halfstopped as a frightful suspicion crossed him  that is a dangerous place  what of that said amyas who caught his meaning in his tone dost think i am going to leap over cliff i have not heart enough for that on lads and set me safe among the rocks  so slowly and painfully they went on while amyas murmured to himself  no no other place will suit i can see all thence  so on they went to the point where the cyclopean wall of granite cliff which forms the western side of lundy ends sheer in a precipice of some three hundred feet topped by a pile of snowwhite rock bespangled with golden lichens as they approached a raven who sat upon the topmost stone black against the bright blue sky flapped lazily away and sank down the abysses of the cliff as if he scented the corpses underneath the surge below them from the gullrock rose a thousand birds and filled the air with sound the choughs cackled the hacklets wailed the great blackbacks laughed querulous defiance at the intruders and a single falcon with an angry bark dashed out from beneath their feet and hung poised high aloft watching the seafowl which swung slowly round and round below  it was a glorious sight upon a glorious day to the northward the glens rushed down toward the cliff crowned with gray crags and carpeted with purple heather and green fern and from their feet stretched away to the westward the sapphire rollers of the vast atlantic crowned with a thousand crests of flying foam on their left hand some ten miles to the south stood out against the sky the purple wall of hartland cliffs sinking lower and lower as they trended away to the southward along the lonely ironbound shores of cornwall until they faded dim and blue into the blue horizon forty miles away  the sky was flecked with clouds which rushed toward them fast upon the roaring southwest wind and the warm oceanbreeze swept up the cliffs and whistled through the heatherbells and howled in cranny and in crag       till the pillars and clefts of the granite         rang like a godswept lyre  while amyas a proud smile upon his lips stood breasting that genial stream of airy wine with swelling nostrils and fastheaving chest and seemed to drink in life from every gust all three were silent for awhile and jack and cary gazing downward with delight upon the glory and the grandeur of the sight forgot for awhile that their companion saw it not yet when they started sadly and looked into his face did he not see it so wide and eager were his eyes so bright and calm his face that they fancied for an instant that he was once more even as they  a deep sigh undeceived them i know it is all herethe dear old sea where i would live and die and my eyes feel for it feel for itand cannot find it never never will find it again forever gods will be done  do you say that asked brimblecombe eagerly  why should i not why have i been raving in hellfire for i know not how many days but to find out that john brimblecombe thou better man than i  not that last but amen amen and the lord has indeed had mercy upon thee said jack through his honest tears  amen said amyas now set me where i can rest among the rocks without fear of fallingfor life is sweet still even without eyes friendsand leave me to myself awhile  it was no easy matter to find a safe place for from the foot of the crag the heathery turf slopes down all but upright on one side to a cliff which overhangs a shoreless cove of deep dark sea and on the other to an abyss even more hideous where the solid rock has sunk away and opened inland in the hillside a smoothwalled pit some sixty feet square and some hundred and fifty in depth aptly known then as now as the devilslimekiln the mouth of which as old wives say was once closed by the shutterrock itself till the fiend in malice hurled it into the sea to be a pest to mariners a narrow and untrodden cavern at the bottom connects it with the outer sea they could even then hear the mysterious thunder and gurgle of the surge in the subterranean adit as it rolled huge boulders to and fro in darkness and forced before it gusts of pentup air it was a spot to curdle weak blood and to make weak heads reel but all the fitter on that account for amyas and his fancy  you can sit here as in an armchair said cary helping him down to one of those square natural seats so common in the granite tors  good now turn my face to the shutter be sure and exact so do i face it full  full said cary  then i need no eyes wherewith to see what is before me said he with a sad smile i know every stone and every headland and every wave too i may say far beyond aught that eye can reach now go and leave me alone with god and with the dead  they retired a little space and watched him he never stirred for many minutes then leaned his elbows on his knees and his head upon his hands and so was still again he remained so long thus that the pair became anxious and went towards him he was asleep and breathing quick and heavily  he will take a fever said brimblecombe if he sleeps much longer with his head down in the sunshine  we must wake him gently if we wake him at all and cary moved forward to him  as he did so amyas lifted his head and turning it to right and left felt round him with his sightless eyes  you have been asleep amyas  have i i have not slept back my eyes then take up this great useless carcase of mine and lead me home i shall buy me a dog when i get to burrough i think and make him tow me in a string eh so give me your hand now march  his guides heard with surprise this new cheerfulness  thank god sir that your heart is so light already said good jack it makes me feel quite upraised myself like  i have reason to be cheerful sir john i have left a heavy load behind me i have been wilful and proud and a blasphemer and swollen with cruelty and pride and god has brought me low for it and cut me off from my evil delight no more spaniardhunting for me now my masters god will send no such fools as i upon his errands  you do not repent of fighting the spaniards  not i but of hating even the worst of them listen to me will and jack if that man wronged me i wronged him likewise i have been a fiend when i thought myself the grandest of men yea a very avenging angel out of heaven but god has shown me my sin and we have made up our quarrel forever  made it up  made it up thank god but i am weary set me down awhile and i will tell you how it befell  wondering they set him down upon the heather while the bees hummed round them in the sun and amyas felt for a hand of each and clasped it in his own hand and began  when you left me there upon the rock lads i looked away and out to sea to get one last snuff of the merry seabreeze which will never sail me again and as i looked i tell you truth i could see the water and the sky as plain as ever i saw them till i thought my sight was come again but soon i knew it was not so for i saw more than man could see right over the ocean as i live and away to the spanish main and i saw barbados and grenada and all the isles that we ever sailed by and la guayra in caracas and the silla and the house beneath it where she lived and i saw him walking with her on the barbecue and he loved her then i saw what i saw and he loved her and i say he loves her still  then i saw the cliffs beneath me and the gullrock and the shutter and the ledge i saw them william cary and the weeds beneath the merry blue sea and i saw the grand old galleon will she has righted with the sweeping of the tide she lies in fifteen fathoms at the edge of the rocks upon the sand and her men are all lying around her asleep until the judgmentday  cary and jack looked at him and then at each other his eyes were clear and bright and full of meaning and yet they knew that he was blind his voice was shaping itself into a song was he inspired insane what was it and they listened with awestruck faces as the giant pointed down into the blue depths far below and went on  and i saw him sitting in his cabin like a valiant gentleman of spain and his officers were sitting round him with their swords upon the table at the wine and the prawns and the crayfish and the rockling they swam in and out above their heads but don guzman he never heeded but sat still and drank his wine then he took a locket from his bosom and i heard him speak will and he said heres the picture of my fair and true lady drink to her senors all then he spoke to me will and called me right up through the oarweed and the sea we have had a fair quarrel senor it is time to be friends once more my wife and your brother have forgiven me so your honor takes no stain and i answered we are friends don guzman god has judged our quarrel and not we then he said i sinned and i am punished and i said and senor so am i then he held out his hand to me cary and i stooped to take it and awoke  he ceased and they looked in his face again it was exhausted but clear and gentle like the face of a newborn babe gradually his head dropped upon his breast again he was either swooning or sleeping and they had much ado to get him home there he lay for eightandforty hours in a quiet doze then arose suddenly called for food ate heartily and seemed saving his eyesight as whole and sound as ever the surgeon bade them get him home to northam as soon as possible and he was willing enough to go so the next day the vengeance sailed leaving behind a dozen men to seize and keep in the queens name any goods which should be washed up from the wreck    chapter xxxiii  how amyas let the apple fall       would you hear a spanish lady        how she wood an englishman      garments gay and rich as may be         deckd with jewels had she on                     elizabethan ballad  it was the first of october the morning was bright and still the skies were dappled modestly from east to west with soft gray autumn cloud as if all heaven and earth were resting after those fearful summer months of battle and of storm silently as if ashamed and sad the vengeance slid over the bar and passed the sleeping sandhills and dropped her anchor off appledore with her flag floating halfmast high for the corpse of salvation yeo was on board  a boat pulled off from the ship and away to the western end of the strand and cary and brimblecombe helped out amyas leigh and led him slowly up the hill toward his home  the crowd clustered round him with cheers and blessings and sobs of pity from kindhearted women for all in appledore and bideford knew well by this time what had befallen him  spare me my good friends said amyas i have landed here that i might go quietly home without passing through the town and being made a gazingstock think not of me good folks nor talk of me but come behind me decently as christian men and follow to the grave the body of a better man than i  and as he spoke another boat came off and in it covered with the flag of england the body of salvation yeo  the people took amyas at his word and a man was sent on to burrough to tell mrs leigh that her son was coming when the coffin was landed and lifted amyas and his friends took their places behind it as chief mourners and the crew followed in order while the crowd fell in behind them and gathered every moment till ere they were halfway to northam town the funeral train might number full five hundred souls  they had sent over by a fishingskiff the day before to bid the sexton dig the grave and when they came into the churchyard the parson stood ready waiting at the gate  mrs leigh stayed quietly at home for she had no heart to face the crowd and though her heart yearned for her son yet she was well content when was she not content that he should do honor to his ancient and faithful servant so she sat down in the baywindow with ayacanora by her side and when the tolling of the bell ceased she opened her prayerbook and began to read the burialservice  ayacanora she said they are burying old master yeo who loved you and sought you over the wide wide world and saved you from the teeth of the crocodile are you not sorry for him child that you look so gay today  ayacanora blushed and hung down her head she was thinking of nothing poor child but amyas  the burialservice was done the blessing said the parson drew back but the people lingered and crowded round to look at the coffin while amyas stood still at the head of the grave it had been dug by his command at the west end of the church near by the foot of the tall gray windswept tower which watches for a beacon far and wide over land and sea perhaps the old man might like to look at the sea and see the ships come out and in across the bar and hear the wind on winter nights roar through the belfry far above his head why not it was but a fancy and yet amyas felt that he too should like to be buried in such a place so yeo might like it also  still the crowd lingered and looked first at the grave and then at the blind giant who stood over it as if they felt by instinct that something more ought to come and something more did come amyas drew himself up to his full height and waved his hand majestically as one about to speak while the eyes of all men were fastened on him  twice he essayed to begin and twice the words were choked upon his lips and then  good people all and seamen among whom i was bred and to whom i come home blind this day to dwell with you till deathhere lieth the flower and pattern of all bold mariners the truest of friends and the most terrible of foes unchangeable of purpose crafty of council and swift of execution in triumph most sober in failure as god knows i have found full many a day of endurance beyond mortal man who first of all britons helped to humble the pride of the spaniard at rio de la hacha and nombre and first of all sailed upon those south seas which shall be hereafter by gods grace as free to english keels as is the bay outside who having afterwards been purged from his youthful sins by strange afflictions and torments unspeakable suffered at the hands of the popish enemy learned therefrom my masters to fear god and to fear naught else and having acquitted himself worthily in his place and calling as a righteous scourge of the spaniard and a faithful soldier of the lord jesus christ is now exalted to his reward as elijah was of old in a chariot of fire unto heaven letting fall i trust and pray upon you who are left behind the mantle of his valor and his godliness that so these shores may never be without brave and pious mariners who will count their lives as worthless in the cause of their country their bible and their queen amen  and feeling for his companions hands he walked slowly from the churchyard and across the village street and up the lane to burrough gates while the crowd made way for him in solemn silence as for an awful being shut up alone with all his strength valor and fame in the dark prisonhouse of his mysterious doom  he seemed to know perfectly when they had reached the gates opened the lock with his own hands and went boldly forward along the gravel path while cary and brimblecombe followed him trembling for they expected some violent burst of emotion either from him or his mother and the two good fellows tender hearts were fluttering like a girls up to the door he went as if he had seen it felt for the entrance stood therein and called quietly mother  in a moment his mother was on his bosom  neither spoke for awhile she sobbing inwardly with tearless eyes he standing firm and cheerful with his great arms clasped around her  mother he said at last i am come home you see because i needs must come will you take me in and look after this useless carcase i shall not be so very troublesome mothershall i and he looked down and smiled upon her and kissed her brow  she answered not a word but passed her arm gently round his waist and led him in  take care of your head dear child the doors are low and they went in together  will jack called amyas turning round but the two good fellows had walked briskly off  im glad we are away said cary i should have made a baby of myself in another minute watching that angel of a woman how her face worked and how she kept it in  ah well said jack there goes a brave servant of the queens cut off before his work was a quarter done heigho i must home now and see my old father and then  and then home with me said cary you and i never part again we have pulled in the same boat too long jack and you must not go spending your prizemoney in riotous living i must see after you old jack ashore or we shall have you treating half the town in taverns for a week to come  oh mr cary said jack scandalized  come home with me and well poison the parson and my father shall give you the rectory  oh mr cary said jack  so the two went off to clovelly together that very day  and amyas was sitting all alone his mother had gone out for a few minutes to speak to the seamen who had brought up amyass luggage and set them down to eat and drink and amyas sat in the old baywindow where he had sat when he was a little tiny boy and read king arthur and foxs martyrs and the cruelties of the spaniards he put out his hand and felt for them there they lay side by side just as they had lain twenty years before the window was open and a cool air brought in as of old the scents of the fourseason roses and rosemary and autumn gilliflowers and there was a dish of apples on the table he knew it by their smell the very same old apples which he used to gather when he was a boy he put out his hand and took them and felt them over and played with them just as if the twenty years had never been and as he fingered them the whole of his past life rose up before him as in that strange dream which is said to flash across the imagination of a drowning man and he saw all the places which he had ever seen and heard all the words which had ever been spoken to himtill he came to that fairy island on the meta and he heard the roar of the cataract once more and saw the green tops of the palmtrees sleeping in the sunlight far above the spray and stept amid the smooth palmtrunks across the flowerfringed boulders and leaped down to the gravel beach beside the pool and then again rose from the ferngrown rocks the beautiful vision of ayacanorawhere was she he had not thought of her till now how he had wronged her let be he had been punished and the account was squared perhaps she did not care for him any longer who would care for a great blind ox like him who must be fed and tended like a baby for the rest of his lazy life tut how long his mother was away and he began playing again with his apples and thought about nothing but them and his climbs with frank in the orchard years ago  at last one of them slipt through his fingers and fell on the floor he stooped and felt for it but he could not find it vexatious he turned hastily to search in another direction and struck his head sharply against the table  was it the pain or the little disappointment or was it the sense of his blindness brought home to him in that ludicrous commonplace way and for that very reason all the more humiliating or was it the sudden revulsion of overstrained nerves produced by that slight shock or had he become indeed a child once more i know not but so it was that he stamped on the floor with pettishness and then checking himself burst into a violent flood of tears  a quick rustle passed him the apple was replaced in his hand and ayacanoras voice sobbed out  there there it is do not weep oh do not weep i cannot bear it i will get you all you want only let me fetch and carry for you tend you feed you lead you like your slave your dog say that i may be your slave and falling on her knees at his feet she seized both his hands and covered them with kisses  yes she cried i will be your slave i must be you cannot help it you cannot escape from me now you cannot go to sea you cannot turn your back upon wretched me i have you safe now safe and she clutched his hands triumphantly ah and what a wretch i am to rejoice in that to taunt him with his blindness oh forgive me i am but a poor wild girla wild indian savage you know butbut and she burst into tears  a great spasm shook the body and soul of amyas leigh he sat quite silent for a minute and then said solemnly  and is this still possible then god have mercy upon me a sinner  ayacanora looked up in his face inquiringly but before she could speak again he had bent down and lifting her as the lion lifts the lamb pressed her to his bosom and covered her face with kisses  the door opened there was the rustle of a gown ayacanora sprang from him with a little cry and stood halftrembling halfdefiant as if to say he is mine now no one dare part him from me  who is it asked amyas  your mother  you see that i am bringing forth fruits meet for repentance mother said he with a smile  he heard her approach then a kiss and a sob passed between the women and he felt ayacanora sink once more upon his bosom  amyas my son said the silver voice of mrs leigh low dreamy like the faroff chimes of angels bells from out the highest heaven fear not to take her to your heart again for it is your mother who has laid her there  it is true after all said amyas to himself what god has joined together man cannot put asunder                          from that hour ayacanoras power of song returned to her and day by day year after year her voice rose up within that happy home and soared as on a skylarks wings into the highest heaven bearing with it the peaceful thoughts of the blind giant back to the paradises of the west in the wake of the heroes who from that time forth sailed out to colonize another and a vaster england to the heavenprospered cry of westwardho
