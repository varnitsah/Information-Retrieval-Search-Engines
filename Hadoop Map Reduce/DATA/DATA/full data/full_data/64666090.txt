64666090	twice told tales                         the white old maid                       by nathaniel hawthorne    the moonbeams came through two deep and narrow windows and showed a spacious chamber richly furnished in an antique fashion  from one lattice the shadow of the diamond panes was thrown upon the floor the ghostly light through the other slept upon a bed falling between the heavy silken curtains and illuminating the face of a young man  but how quietly the slumberer lay how pale his features and how like a shroud the sheet was wound about his frame  yes it was a corpse in its burialclothes  suddenly the fixed features seemed to move with dark emotion strange fantasy  it was but the shadow of the fringed curtain waving betwixt the dead face and the moonlight as the door of the chamber opened and a girl stole softly to the bedside  was there delusion in the moonbeams or did her gesture and her eye betray a gleam of triumph as she bent over the pale corpsepale as itselfand pressed her living lips to the cold ones of the dead  as she drew back from that long kiss her features writhed as if a proud heart were fighting with its anguish again it seemed that the features of the corpse had moved responsive to her own  still an illusion  the silken curtain had waved a second time betwixt the dead face and the moonlight as another fair young girl unclosed the door and glided ghostlike to the bedside  there the two maidens stood both beautiful with the pale beauty of the dead between them but she who had first entered was proud and stately and the other a soft and fragile thing  away cried the lofty one   thou hadst him living  the dead is mine  thine returned the other shuddering   well hast thou spoken the dead is thine  the proud girl started and stared into her face with a ghastly look but a wild and mournful expression passed across the features of the gentle one and weak and helpless she sank down on the bed her head pillowed beside that of the corpse and her hair mingling with his dark locks  a creature of hope and joy the first draught of sorrow had bewildered her  edith cried her rival  edith groaned as with a sudden compression of the heart and removing her cheek from the dead youths pillow she stood upright fearfully encountering the eyes of the lofty girl  wilt thou betray me said the latter calmly  till the dead bid me speak i will be silent answered edith leave us alone together  go and live many years and then return and tell me of thy life  he too will be here  then if thou tellest of sufferings more than death we will both forgive thee  and what shall be the token asked the proud girl as if her heart acknowledged a meaning in these wild words  this lock of hair said edith lifting one of the dark clustering curls that lay heavily on the dead mans brow  the two maidens joined their hands over the bosom of the corpse and appointed a day and hour far far in time to come for their next meeting in that chamber  the statelier girl gave one deep look at the motionless countenance and departedyet turned again and trembled ere she closed the door almost believing that her dead lover frowned upon her  and edith too  was not her white form fading into the moonlight  scorning her own weakness she went forth and perceived that a negro slave was waiting in the passage with a wax light which he held between her face and his own and regarded her as she thought with an ugly expression of merriment  lifting his torch on high the slave lighted her down the staircase and undid the portal of the mansion  the young clergyman of the town had just ascended the steps and bowing to the lady passed in without a word   years many years rolled on the world seemed new again so much older was it grown since the night when those pale girls had clasped their hands across the bosom of the corpse  in the interval a lonely woman had passed from youth to extreme age and was known by all the town as the  old maid in the windingsheet  a taint of insanity had affected her whole life but so quiet sad and gentle so utterly free from violence that she was suffered to pursue her harmless fantasies unmolested by the world with whose business or pleasures she had naught to do  she dwelt alone and never came into the daylight except to follow funerals  whenever a corpse was borne along the street in sunshine rain or snow whether a pompous train of the rich and proud thronged after it or few and humble were the mourners behind them came the lonely woman in a long white garment which the people called her shroud  she took no place among the kindred or the friends but stood at the door to hear the funeral prayer and walked in the rear of the procession as one whose earthly charge it was to haunt the house of mourning and be the shadow of affliction and see that the dead were duly buried  so long had this been her custom that the inhabitants of the town deemed her a part of every funeral as much as the coffin pall or the very corpse itself and augured ill of the sinners destiny unless the  old maid in the windingsheet came gliding like a ghost behind  once it is said she affrighted a bridal party with her pale presence appearing suddenly in the illuminated hall just as the priest was uniting a false maid to a wealthy man before her lover had been dead a year evil was the omen to that marriage  sometimes she stole forth by moonlight and visited the graves of venerable integrity and wedded love and virgin innocence and every spot where the ashes of a kind and faithful heart were mouldering over the hillocks of those favored dead would she stretch out her arms with a gesture as if she were scattering seeds and many believed that she brought them from the garden of paradise for the graves which she had visited were green beneath the snow and covered with sweet flowers from april to november  her blessing was better than a holy verse upon the tombstone  thus wore away her long sad peaceful and fantastic life till few were so old as she and the people of later generations wondered how the dead had ever been buried or mourners had endured their grief without the  old maid in the winding sheet  still years went on and still she followed funerals and was not yet summoned to her own festival of death  one afternoon the great street of the town was all alive with business and bustle though the sun now gilded only the upper half of the churchspire having left the housetops and loftiest trees in shadow  the scene was cheerful and animated in spite of the sombre shade between the high brick buildings  here were pompous merchants in white wigs and laced velvet the bronzed faces of seacaptains the foreign garb and air of spanish creoles and the disdainful port of natives of old england all contrasted with the rough aspect of one or two hack settlers negotiating sales of timber from forests where axe had never sounded sometimes a lady passed swelling roundly forth in an embroidered petticoat balancing her steps in highheeled shoes and courtesying with lofty grace to the punctilious obeisances of the gentlemen  the life of the town seemed to have its very centre not far from an old mansion that stood somewhat back from the pavement surrounded by neglected grass with a strange air of loneliness rather deepened than dispelled by the throng so near it  its site would have been suitably occupied by a magnificent exchange or a brick block lettered all over with various signs or the large house itself might have made a noble tavern with the  kings arms swinging before it and guests in every chamber instead of the present solitude  but owing to some dispute about the right of inheritance the mansion had been long without a tenant decaying from year to year and throwing the stately gloom of its shadow over the busiest part of the town such was the scene and such the time when a figure unlike any that have been described was observed at a distance down the street  i espy a strange sail yonder remarked a liverpool captain that woman in the long white garment  the sailor seemed much struck by the object as were several others who at the same moment caught a glimpse of the figure that had attracted his notice  almost immediately the various topics of conversation gave place to speculations in an undertone on this unwonted occurrence  can there be a funeral so late this afternoon  inquired some  they looked for the signs of death at every doorthe sexton the hearse the assemblage of blackclad relativesall that makes up the woeful pomp of funerals  they raised their eyes also to the sungilt spire of the church and wondered that no clang proceeded from its bell which had always tolled till now when this figure appeared in the light of day  but none had heard that a corpse was to be borne to its home that afternoon nor was there any token of a funeral except the apparition of the old maid in the windingsheet  what may this portend asked each man of his neighbor  all smiled as they put the question yet with a certain trouble in their eyes as if pestilence or some other wide calamity were prognosticated by the untimely intrusion among the living of one whose presence had always been associated with death and woe  what a comet is to the earth was that sad woman to the town  still she moved on while the hum of surprise was hushed at her approach and the proud and the humble stood aside that her white garment might not wave against them  it was a long loose robe of spotless purity its wearer appeared very old pale emaciated and feeble yet glided onward without the unsteady pace of extreme age  at one point of her course a littly rosy boy burst forth from a door and ran with open arms towards the ghostly woman seeming to expect a kiss from her bloodless lips  she made a slight pause fixing her eye upon him with an expression of no earthly sweetness so that the child shivered and stood awestruck rather than affrighted while the old maid passed on  perhaps her garment might have been polluted even by an infants touch perhaps her kiss would have been death to the sweet boy within a year  she is but a shadow whispered the superstitious   the child put forth his arms and could not grasp her robe  the wonder was increased when the old maid passed beneath the porch of the deserted mansion ascended the mosscovered steps lifted the iron knocker and gave three raps  the people could only conjecture that some old remembrance troubling her bewildered brain had impelled the poor woman hither to visit the friends of her youth all gone from their home long since and forever unless their ghosts still haunted itfit company for the  old maid in the windingsheet  an elderly man approached the steps and reverently uncovering his gray locks essayed to explain the matter  none madam said he have dwelt in this house these fifteen years agoneno not since the death of old colonel fenwicke whose funeral you may remember to have followed  his heirs being illagreed among themselves have let the mansionhouse go to ruin  the old maid looked slowly round with a slight gesture of one hand and a finger of the other upon her lip appearing more shadowlike than ever in the obscurity of the porch  but again she lifted the hammer and gave this time a single rap  could it be that a footstep was now heard coming down the staircase of the old mansion which all conceived to have been so long untenanted  slowly feebly yet heavily like the pace of an aged and infirm person the step approached more distinct on every downward stair till it reached the portal  the bar fell on the inside the door was opened  one upward glance towards the churchspire whence the sunshine had just faded was the last that the people saw of the old maid in the windingsheet  who undid the door asked many  this question owing to the depth of shadow beneath the porch no one could satisfactorily answer  two or three aged men while protesting against an inference which might be drawn affirmed that the person within was a negro and bore a singular resemblance to old caesar formerly a slave in the house but freed by death some thirty years before  her summons has waked up a servant of the old family said one half seriously  let us wait here replied another   more guests will knock at the door anon  but the gate of the graveyard should be thrown open  twilight had overspread the town before the crowd began to separate or the comments on this incident were exhausted  one after another was wending his way homeward when a coachno common spectacle in those daysdrove slowly into the street  it was an oldfashioned equipage hanging close to the ground with arms on the panels a footman behind and a grave corpulent coachman seated high in frontthe whole giving an idea of solemn state and dignity  there was something awful in the heavy rumbling of the wheels  the coach rolled down the street till coming to the gateway of the deserted mansion it drew up and the footman sprang to the ground  whose grand coach is this asked a very inquisitive body  the footman made no reply but ascended the steps of the old house gave three raps with the iron hammer and returned to open the coachdoor  an old man possessed of the heraldic lore so common in that day examined the shield of arms on the panel  azure a lions head erased between three flowerdeluces said he then whispered the name of the family to whom these bearings belonged the last inheritor of its honors was recently dead after a long residence amid the splendor of the british court where his birth and wealth had given him no mean station  he left no child continued the herald and these arms being in a lozenge betoken that the coach appertains to his widow  further disclosures perhaps might have been made had not the speaker suddenly been struck dumb by the stern eye of an ancient lady who thrust forth her head from the coach preparing to descend as she emerged the people saw that her dress was magnificent and her figure dignified in spite of age and infirmitya stately ruin but with a look at once of pride and wretchedness  her strong and rigid features had an awe about them unlike that of the white old maid but as of something evil  she passed up the steps leaning on a goldheaded cane the door swung open as she ascendedand the light of a torch glittered on the embroidery of her dress and gleamed on the pillars of the porch  after a momentary pausea glance backwardsand then a desperate effortshe went in  the decipherer of the coat of arms had ventured up the lowest step and shrinking back immediately pale and tremulous affirmed that the torch was held by the very image of old caesar  but such a hideous grin added he was never seen on the face of mortal man black or white  it will haunt me till my dying day  meantime the coach had wheeled round with a prodigious clatter on the pavement and rumbled up the street disappearing in the twilight while the ear still tracked its course  scarcely was it gone when the people began to question whether the coach and attendants the ancient lady the spectre of old caesar and the old maid herself were not all a strangely combined delusion with some dark purport in its mystery  the whole town was astir so that instead of dispersing the crowd continually increased and stood gazing up at the windows of the mansion now silvered by the brightening moon  the elders glad to indulge the narrative propensity of age told of the longfaded splendor of the family the entertainments they had given and the guests the greatest of the land and even titled and noble ones from abroad who had passed beneath that portal  these graphic reminiscences seemed to call up the ghosts of those to whom they referred  so strong was the impression on some of the more imaginative hearers that two or three were seized with trembling fits at one and the same moment protesting that they had distinctly heard three other raps of the iron knocker  impossible exclaimed others   see  the moon shines beneath the porch and shows every part of it except in the narrow shade of that pillar  there is no one there  did not the door open  whispered one of these fanciful persons  didst thou see it too said his companion in a startled tone  but the general sentiment was opposed to the idea that a third visitant had made application at the door of the deserted house a few however adhered to this new marvel and even declared that a red gleam like that of a torch had shone through the great front window as if the negro were lighting a guest up the staircase  this too was pronounced a mere fantasy  but at once the whole multitude started and each man beheld his own terror painted in the faces of all the rest  what an awful thing is this cried they  a shriek too fearfully distinct for doubt had been heard within the mansion breaking forth suddenly and succeeded by a deep stillness as if a heart had burst in giving it utterance  the people knew not whether to fly from the very sight of the house or to rush trembling in and search out the strange mystery amid their confusion and affright they were somewhat reassured by the appearance of their clergyman a venerable patriarch and equally a saint who had taught them and their fathers the way to heaven for more than the space of an ordinary lifetime  he was a reverend figure with long white hair upon his shoulders a white beard upon his breast and a back so bent over his staff that he seemed to be looking downward continually as if to choose a proper grave for his weary frame  it was some time before the good old man being deaf and of impaired intellect could be made to comprehend such portions of the affair as were comprehensible at all  but when possessed of the facts his energies assumed unexpected vigor  verily said the old gentleman it will be fitting that i enter the mansionhouse of the worthy colonel fenwicke lest any harm should have befallen that true christian woman whom ye call the old maid in the windingsheet  behold then the venerable clergyman ascending the steps of the mansion with a torchbearer behind him  it was the elderly man who had spoken to the old maid and the same who had afterwards explained the shield of arms and recognized the features of the negro  like their predecessors they gave three raps with the iron hammer  old caesar cometh not observed the priest  well i wot he no longer doth service in this mansion  assuredly then it was something worse in old caesars likeness said the other adventurer  be it as god wills answered the clergyman  see my strength though it be much decayed hath sufficed to open this heavy door let us enter and pass up the staircase  here occurred a singular exemplification of the dreamy state of a very old mans mind  as they ascended the wide flight of stairs the aged clergyman appeared to move with caution occasionally standing aside and oftener bending his head as it were in salutation thus practising all the gestures of one who makes his way through a throng reaching the head of the staircase he looked around with sad and solemn benignity laid aside his staff bared his hoary locks and was evidently on the point of commencing a prayer  reverend sir said his attendant who conceived this a very suitable prelude to their further search would it not be well that the people join with us in prayer  welladay cried the old clergyman staring strangely around him art thou here with me and none other  verily past times were present to me and i deemed that i was to make a funeral prayer as many a time heretofore from the head of this staircase  of a truth i saw the shades of many that are gone  yea i have prayed at their burials one after another and the old maid in the windingsheet hath seen them to their graves  being now more thoroughly awake to their present purpose he took his staff and struck forcibly on the floor till there came an echo from each deserted chamber but no menial to answer their summons  they therefore walked along the passage and again paused opposite to the great front window through which was seen the crowd in the shadow and partial moonlight of the street beneath  on their right hand was the open door of a chamber and a closed one on their left  the clergyman pointed his cane to the carved oak panel of the latter  within that chamber observed he a whole lifetime since did i sit by the deathbed of a goodly young man who being now at the last gasp  apparently there was some powerful excitement in the ideas which had now flashed across his mind  he snatched the torch from his companions hand and threw open the door with such sudden violence that the flame was extinguished leaving them no other light than the moonbeams which fell through two windows into the spacious chamber it was sufficient to discover all that could be known  in a highbacked oaken armchair upright with her hands clasped across her breast and her head thrown back sat the  old maid in the windingsheet  the stately dame had fallen on her knees with her forehead on the holy knees of the old maid one hand upon the floor and the other pressed convulsively against her heart  it clutched a lock of hair once sable now discolored with a greenish mould  as the priest and layman advanced into the chamber the old maids features assumed such a resemblance of shifting expression that they trusted to hear the whole mystery explained by a single word  but it was only the shadow of a tattered curtain waving betwixt the dead face and the moonlight  both dead said the venerable man  then who shall divulge the secret  methinks it glimmers to and fro in my mind like the light and shadow across the old maids face  and nowt is gone
