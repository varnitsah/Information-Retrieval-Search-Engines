reflect itself that though we had come abroad in 1855 with an eye to the then supposedly supreme benefits of swiss schooling our most resolute attempt to tap that supply after twenty distractions waited over to the autumn of the fourth year later on when we in renewed good faith retraced our steps to geneva our parents began at that season a long sojourn at the old hôtel de lÉcu which now erects a somewhat diminished head on the edge of the rushing rhoneits only rival then was the hôtel des bergues opposite considerably larger and commanding more or less the view of that profiled crest of montblanc which used to be so oddly likened to the head and face of a singularly supine napoleon but on that side the shooting blue flood was less directly and familiarly under the windows in our position we lived with it and hung over it and its beauty just where we mainly congregated was i fear my own sole happy impression during several of those months it was of a sunday that we congregated most my two younger brothers had in general on that day their sortie from the pensionnat maquelin a couple of miles out of town where they were then established and w j following courses at the academy in its present enriched and amplified form the university mingled failing livelier recreation in the family circle at the hotel livelier recreation during the hours of completest ease consisted mostly as the period drew itself out of those courses along the lake and along the hills which offer to studentlife in whatever phase throughout that blest country the most romantic of all forms of a little change enjoyed too in some degree but much more restrictedly by myselfthis an effect as i remember feeling it of my considerably greater servitude i had been placed separately at still another institution that of m rochette who carried on an École préparatoire aux Écoles spéciales by which was meant in particular the polytechnic school at zurich with whatever other like curricula always scientific might elsewhere be aimed at and i had been so disposed of under a flattering misconception of my aptitudes that leaves me today even more wonderstruck than at that immediate season of my distress  i so feared and abhorred mathematics that the simplest arithmetical operation had always found and kept me helpless and blankthe dire discipline of the years bringing no relief whatever to my state and mathematics unmitigated were at the institution rochette the air we breathed building us up as they most officiously did for those other grim ordeals and pursuits those of the mining and the civil engineer those of the architectural aspirant and the technician in still other fields to which we were supposed to be addressed nothing of the sort was indeed supposed of mewhich is in particular my present mystification so that my assault of the preliminaries disclosed feeble as it strikingly remained was mere darkness waste and anguish i found myself able to bite as the phrase was into no subject there deemed savoury it was hard and bitter fruit all and turned to ashes in my mouth more extraordinary however than my good parents beliefeccentric on their part too in the light of their usual practice and disposition their habit for the most part of liking for us after a gasp or two whatever we seemed to likewas my own failure to protest with a frankness proportioned to my horror the stiffer intellectual discipline the discipline of physics and of algebra invoked for the benefit of an understanding undisputedly weak and shy had been accepted on my side as a blessing perhaps in disguise it had come to me by i know not what perversity that if i couldnt tackle the smallest problem in mechanics or face without dismay at the blackboard the simplest geometric challenge i ought somehow in decency to make myself over oughtnt really to be so inferior to almost everyone else that was the pang as it was also the marvelthat the meanest minds and the vulgarest types approached these matters without a sign of trepidation even when they approached them at the worst without positive appetite my attempt not therefore to remain abnormal wholly broke down however and when i at last withdrew from the scene it was not even as a conspicuous it was only as an obscure a deeply hushed failure i joined william after what had seemed to me an eternity of woe at the academy where i followed for too short a time but with a comparative recovery of confidence such literary cours as i might  i puzzle it out today that my parents had simply said to themselves in serious concern that i read too many novels or at least read them too attentivelythat was the vice as also that they had by the contagion of their good faith got me in a manner to agree with them since i could almost always enter to the gain of horizon but too often to the perversion of experience into any view of my real interests socalled that was presented to me with a dazzling assurance i didnt consider certainly that i was so forming my mind and was doubtless curious to see whether it mightnt by a process flourishing in other applications get to some extent formed it wasnt i think till i felt the rapture of that methods arrest that i knew how grotesquely little it had done for me and yet i bore it afterwards no maliceresorting again to that early fatalistic philosophy of which the general sense was that almost anything however disagreeable had been worth while so unable was i to claim that it hadnt involved impressions i positively felt the impressional harvest rather rich little as any item of it might have passed at the time for the sort of thing one exhibits as a trophy of learning my small exhibition was all for myself and consisted on the whole but of a dusty spotty ugly picturei took it for ugly wellnigh to the pitch of the sinister its being a picture at alland i clung to thatcame from the personal and material facts of the place where i was the only scholar of english speech since my companions with a genevese predominance were variously polyglot they wondered i couldnt doubt what i was doing among them and what lost lamb almost audibly bleating i had been charged to figure yet i remember no crude chaff no very free relation of any one with any one no high pitch still less any low descent of young pleasantry or irony our manners must have been remarkably formed and our general tone was that of a manoftheworld discretion or at the worst of a certain small bourgeois circumspection the dread in the genevese of having definitely to know strangers and thereby be at costs for any sort of hospitality to them comes back to me as written clear not less than their being of two sorts or societies sons of the townspeople pure and simple and sons of the local aristocracy perched in certain of the fine old houses of the cité and enjoying a background of sturdilyseated lakeside villas and deeply umbrageous campagnes i remember thinking the difference of type complexion and general allure between these groups more marked to all the senses than any social distinction i had yet encountered but the great thing was that i could so simplify our enclosing scene itself round it in and make it composethe dark the dreary institution squeezed into a tall dim stonyfaced and stonyhearted house at the very top of the cité and directly in the rear of the cathedral portions of the apse of which seem to me to have straggled above or protruded toward it with other odd extraneous masses than itself pressing still nearer this simplification quite luxuriously for my young mind was to mere mean blackness of an oldworld sordid order i recognised rich blackness in other connections but this was somehow of a harsh tradition and a tragic economy sordid and strong was what i had from the first felt the place though urging myself always to rub off history from its stones and suffering thus after a fashion by the fact that with history it ought to be interesting and that i ought to know just how and why it was for that i think was ever both the burden and the joythe complication i mean of interest and the sense in the midst of the ugly and the melancholy that queer crooked silent corners behind cathedrals wrought in their way for one did something while one haunted them to the imagination and the taste and that so once more since the generalisation had become a habit with me i couldnt seeing and feeling these things really believe i had picked up nothing  when i sat in a dusky upper chamber and read french literature with blighted m toeppfer son of a happier sire as i was sure the charming writer and caricaturist in spite of cumbrous cares must have been or when a couple of times a week and in the same eternal twilight we groped almost lampless through the winter days and our glimmering tapers when they sparsely appeared smelt of a past age i worried out virgil and titelive with m verchère or schiller and lessing with the ruddy noisy little professor of german who sat always the lesson long in a light brown talma the sides of which he caused violently to flap for emphasis like agitated wings i was almost conscious of the breath of culture as i modestly aspired to culture and was at any rate safe for the time from a summons to the blackboard at the hands of awful little m galopin that dispenser of the paralysing chalk who most affected me extremely diminutive and wearing for the most part a thin inscrutable smile the ghost of a tribute to awkwardness happily carried off he found in our barren interviews i believed a charm to curiosity bending afresh each time as over the handful of specimen dust unprecedented product at its finest extracted from the scratched soil of my intelligence with m toeppfer i was almost happy with each of these instructors my hour was unshared my exploits unwitnessed by others but m toeppfer became a friend shewed himself a causeur brightened our lesson with memories of his time in paris where if i am not mistaken he had made with great animation his baccalauréat and whence it was my possibly presumptuous impression he had brought back a state of health apparently much impaired which represented contrition for youthful spirits he had haunted the parterre of the théâtre français and when we read racine his vision of rachel whom he had seen there as often as possible revived he was able to say at moments how she had spoken and moved and i recall in particular his telling me that on her entrance as phèdre borne down in her languorous passion by the weight of her royal robesque ces vains ornemens que ces voiles me pèsentthe long lapse of time before she spoke and while she sank upon a seat filled itself extraordinarily with her visible woe but where he most gave me comfort was in bringing home to me that the house commemorated immortalised as we call it in the first of his fathers nouvelles genevoises la bibliothèque de mon oncle was none other than the structure facing us where we sat and which so impinged and leaned on the cathedral walls that he had but to indicate to me certain points from the window of our room to reconstitute thrillingly the scenery the drollery the whimsical action of the tale there was a demonstration i could feel important votary and victim of the scene the scene and the atmosphere only that i had been formed to be that i called interesting lorecalled it so at least to myself though feeling it at the same time of course so little directly producible that i could perhaps even then have fronted this actually remote circumstance of my never having produced it till this moment there abode in me i may add a sense that on any subject that did appeal and that so found me readysuch subjects being indeed as yet vague but immensely suggestive of numberi should have grasped the confident chalk welcomed the very biggest piece not in the least have feared the blackboard they were inscribed alas for me in no recognised course i put my hand straight on another of them none the less if not on a whole group of others in my ascent each morning of the spring or the early summer sémestre of the admirable old rue de la tour de boël pronounced boisl which dusky steep and tortuous formed a short cut to that part of the grand rue in which the academy was then seated  it was a foul and malodorous wayi sniff again during the tepid weeks its warm close air and that near presence of rank cheese which was in those days almost everywhere for the nostril the note of urban switzerland these things blessed me as i passed for i passed straight to freedom and away from m galopin they mixed with the benediction of the exquisite spring and the rapture constantly renewed though for too short a period of my now substituting literary or in other words romantic studies for the pursuits of the institution rochette i viewed them as literary these new branches of research though in truth they were loose enough and followed on loose terms my dear parents as if to make up to me characteristically for my recent absurd strain to no purpose allowed me now the happiest freedom left me to attend such lectures as i preferred only desiring that i should attend several a week and contentcherished memory that it makes of their forms with methat these should involve neither examinations nor reports the academic authorities goodnatured in the extreme and accustomed to the alien amateur appear to have been equally content and i was but too delighted on such lines to attend anything or everything my whole impression now with my selfrespect reestablished was of something exquisite i was put to the proof about nothing i deeply enjoyed the confidence shown in my taste not to say in my honour and i sat out lecture after lecture as i might have sat out drama alternate tragedy and comedy beautifully performedthe professor in each case figuring the hero and the undergraduates much more numerous though not in general maturer than those of the institution where i had been to my perception every ones junior partaking in an odd fashion of the nature at once of troupe and spectators the scientific subjects in a large suggestive way figured tragedy i seemed to feel and i pushed this form to the point of my following for conscience sake though not with the last regularity lurid demonstrations as they affected me on anatomy and physiology these in turn leading to my earnest view at the medical school of the dissection of a magnifique gendarmewhich ordeal brought me to a stand it was by the literary and even by the philosophic leçons that the office of bright comedy was discharged on the same liberal lines at the same time that i blush to remember with how base a blankness i must have several times listened to h f amiel admirable writer analyst moralist his name and the fact of his having been then a mild grave oracle of the shrine are all that remain with me i was fit to be coupled with my cousin anne king named in another place who on the same genevese scene had had early lessons from the young victor cherbuliez then with all his music in him and was to live to mention to me that he had been for her like any one else the shrine not to say the temple itself shining for me truly all that season with a mere confounding blur of light was it an effect of my intensity of reaction from what i had hated was it to a great extent the beguiling beauty of a wonderful swiss spring into which all things else soothingly melted becoming together a harmony without partswhatever the cause i owed it to some accident only to be described i think as happy that i moved those three months in an acutely enjoying and yet as would at present appear a but scantly comparing or distinguishing maze of the senses and the fancy so at least to cover this so thin report of my intelligence and my sum of acquisition and retention i am reduced to supposing  what essentially most operated i make out however was that force of a renewed sense of williams major activity which always made the presumption of any degree of importance or success fall with a sort of ecstasy of resignation from my own so minor whatever he might happen to be doing made him so interesting about it and indeed with the quickest concomitance about everything else that what i probably most did all the while was but to pick up and to the effect not a bit of starving but quite of filling myself the crumbs of his feast and the echoes of his life his life all this geneva period had been more of a feast than mine and i recall the sense of this that i had got on the occasion of my accompanying him by his invitation toward the end of our stay to a students celebration or carouse which was held at such a distance from the town at a village or small bourg up in the vaud backcountry that we had after a considerable journey by boat and in heterogeneous and primitive conveyances tightly packed to spend two nights there the genevese section of the société de zoffingue the great swiss students organisation for brotherhood and beer as it might summarily be defined of which my brother had become a member was to meet there certain other sections now vague to me but predominantly from the germanspeaking cantons and holding a commerce to toast their reunion in brimming bowls it had been thought the impression might amuse might even interest mefor it was not denied that there were directions after all in which i could perhaps take notice and this was doubtless what after a fashion happened though i felt out in the cold and all the more that the cold at the moment happened to be cruel as the only participant in view not crowned with the charming white cap of the society becoming to most young heads and still less girt with the particoloured ribbon or complementary scarf which set off even the shabbyfor shabbiness considerably figured i participated vaguely but not too excludedly i suffered from cold from hunger and from scant sleepingspace i found the bernese and the bâlois strange representatives of the joy of life some of them the finest gothic grotesquesbut the time none the less very long all of which however was in the days work if i might live by the imagination in williams so adaptive skin to see that he was adaptive was initiated and to what a happy and fruitful effect that i recollect was my measure of content which was filled again to overflowing as i have hinted on my finding him so launched at the academy after our stretch of virtual separation and just fancying with a freedom of fancy even if with a great reserve of expression how much he might be living and learning enjoying and feeling amid work that was the right work for him and comrades consecrated comrades that at the worst werent the wrong what was not indeed i always asked myself the right work for him or the right thing of any kind that he took up or looked at or played withfailing as i did more than ever at the time i speak of of the least glimpse of his being below an occasion whatever he played with or worked at entered at once into his intelligence his talk his humour as with the action of colouringmatter dropped into water or that of the turningon of a light within a window occasions waited on him had always done so to my view and there he was that springtime on a level with them all the effect of which recognition had much had more than aught else to say to the charming silver haze just then wrapped about everything of which i was conscious he had formed two or three young friendships that were to continue and to which even the correspondence of his later years testifies with which it may have had something to do that the swiss jeunesse of the day was thanks to the political temperature then prevailing in a highly inflamed and exalted state and particularly sensitive to foreign sympathy however platonic with the national fever it was the hour at which the french emperor was to be paid by victor emmanuel the price of the liberation of lombardy the cession of nice and savoie were in the airwith the consequence in the genevese breast of the new immediate neighbourhood thus constituted for its territory small savoie was to be replaced close against it by enormous and triumphant france whose power to absorb great mouthfuls was being so strikingly exhibited hence came much hurrying to and fro much springing to arms in the way of exercise and much flocking to the standarddemonstrations in other words of the liveliest one of which i recall as a huge tented banquet largely of the white caps where i was present under my brothers wing and out of a sea of agitated and vociferous young heads sprang passionate protests and toasts and vows and declaimed verses a storm of local patriotism though a flurry happily shortlived  all this was thrilling but the term of it by our consecrated custom already in view we were transferred at a bound for the rest of that summer of 1860 to the care respectively of a pair of kindly pedagogues at bonnamrhein as to which rapid phase i find remembrance again lively with a letter or two of williams to reinforce it yet i first pick up as i pass several young lines from geneva and would fain pick up too the drawing that accompanied themthis by reason of the interest of everything of the sort without exception that remains to us from his hand he at a given moment which came quite early as completely ceased to ply his pencil as he had in his younger time earnestly and curiously exercised it and this constitutes exactly the interest of his case no stroke of it that i have recovered but illustrates his aptitude for drawing his possible real mastery of the art that was yet in the light of other interests so utterly to drop from him and the example is rare of being so finely capable only to become so indifferent it was thanks to his later indifference that he made no point of preserving what he had donea neglect that still more lucklessly communicated itself to his circle so that we also let things go let them again and again stray into the desert and that what might be reproducible is but the handful of scraps that have happened not to perish mother he writes to his father in absence does nothing but sit and cry for you she refuses to associate with us and has one side of the room to herself she and the aunt are now in the aunts room wilky and bobby at home for the day are at church it is a hard grey day h is telling a story to louis osborne and i will try to make a sketch of them there has been a terrible bise the two cornhill magazines have come mrs thomas has been too sick to be at dinner and we have seen something of some most extraordinary english people mrs thomas of new york was a handsome american widow with handsome children all from the avenue gabriel in paris and with the boys enjoying life among many little compatriots at the admired establishment of m haccius even as our small brothers were doing at that of m maquelin yet with their destiny of ultimate europeanisation of finally complete absorption into the french system already rather written for themas a like history for like foredoomed young subjects was in those years beginning to be prefigured through marriages of daughters and other such beguilements almost wherever one looked the extraordinary english people were perhaps an amiable family of whom i retain an image as conversing with our parents at the season when the latter were in their prompt flush of admiration for george eliots first novel adam bede then just given to the world and their copy of which they had rejoicingly lent to their fellow anglosaxons i catch again the echo of their consternation on receiving it back with the remark that all attempt at an interest in such people village carpenters and methodists had proved vainfor that style of anglosaxon together with that of my own excited wonder about such other people those of the style in question those somehow prodigiously presented by so rare a delicacy so proud a taste and made thus to irradiate a strange historic light it referred them and to a social order making life more interesting and more various even while our clear democratic air that of our little family circle quivered as with the monstrosity it might this note that made us in the parlance of today sit up fairly have opened to me that great and up to then unsuspected door of the world from which the general collection of monstrosities its existence suddenly brought home to us would doubtless stretch grandly away the story i told louis osborne has quite passed from me but not little louis himself an american child of the most charming and appealing intelligence marked by some malady that was more or less permanently to cripple or was even cruelly to destroy him and whom it was a constant joy to aspire to amuse his mother was schooling her elder son in the company of our own brothers his father having established them all at geneva that he might go for a tour in the east vivid to me still is the glimpse i happened to get one sunday betimes of the good maquelin couple husband and wife in deep mourninga touch of the highest decencywho had come with faces a yard long to announce to mrs osborne the death of her husband in the holy land communicated to them by slow letter in the first instance with little louis on ones knee one didnt at all envy m and madame maquelin and than this small faint phantom of sociable helpless little listening louis none more exquisite hovers before me  illustration most eternal love from every one  from louis osborne  louis osborne sketch from a letter of william james page 18  with which mild memories thus stands out for me too the lively importance that winter of the arrival from the first number of the orangecovered earlier cornhillthe thrill of each composing item of that first number especially recoverable in its intensity is anything like that thrill possible todayfor a submerged and blinded and deafened generation a generation so smothered in quantity and number that discrimination under the gasp has neither air to breathe nor room to turn round has any like circumstance now conceivably the value to the charmed attention so far as anything worth naming attention or any charm for it is anywhere left of the fact that trollopes framley parsonage there beganlet alone the still other fact that the roundabout papers did and that thackeray thus appeared to us to guarantee personally intimately with a present audibility that was as the accent of good company the new relation with him and with others of company not much worse as they then seemed that such a medium could establish to speak of these things in truth however is to feel the advantage of being able to live back into the time of the more sovereign periodical appearances much of a compensation for any reduced prospect of living forward for these appearances these strong timemarks in such stretches of production as that of dickens that of thackeray that of george eliot had in the first place simply a genial weight and force a direct importance and in the second a command of the permeable air and the collective sensibility with which nothing since has begun to deserve comparison they were enrichments of life they were large arrivals these particular renewals of supplyto which frankly i am moved to add the early cornhill giving me a pretext even the frequent examples of anthony trollopes fine middle period looked at in the light of old affection and that of his great heavy shovelfuls of testimony to constituted english matters a testimony of course looser and thinner than balzacs to his range of facts but charged with something of the big balzac authority these various let alone numerous deepertoned strokes of the great victorian clock were so many steps in the march of our age besides being so many notes full and farreverberating of our having high company to keephigh i mean to cover all the ground in the sense of the genial pitch of it so it was i remember too that our parents spoke of their memory of the successive surpassing attestations of the contemporary presence of scott to which we might have replied and doubtless after no great space began to reply that our state and even their later one allowing for a certain gap had nothing to envy any other i witnessed for that matter with all my senses young as i was the nevertobeequalled degree of difference made for what may really be called the worldconsciousness happily exposed to it by the prolonged comingout of the newcomes yellow number by number and could take the general civilised participation in the process for a sort of basking in the light of distinction the process repeated itself for some years under other forms and stimuli but the merciless change was to comeso that through whatever bristling mazes we may now pick our way it is not to find them open into any such vales of arcady my claim for our old privilege is that we did then with our pace of dignity proceed from vale to vale     ii   my point at any rate such as it is would be that even at the age i had reached in 1860 something of the happier time still lingeredthe time in which a given product of the press might have a situation and an aspect a considerability so to speak a circumscription and an aura room to breathe and to show in margin for the casting of its nets the occasion at large was doubtless shrinking one could noteshrinking like the unlet house on a night of grandest opera but standing room only was not yet everywhere the sign and the fine deliberate thing could here and there find its seat i really indeed might have held it the golden age of letters still and of their fond sister leisure with that quiet swim into our ken on its appointed day during our bonn summer of the charming once a week of the prime the prime of george meredith and charles reade and j e millais and george du maurier which our father to bridge our separation from him sent us from paris and elsewhere in prompt and characteristic relief of our plotted our determined strict servitude to german and to the embrace of the sweet slim essence of which the strain of ones muscles round a circular ton of advertisement was not a condition attached i should like to say that i rioted all that season on the supreme german classics and on evan harrington with charles reades a good fight the assured little prelude to the cloister and the hearth thrown in and i should indeed be ready to say it were not the expression gross for the really hushed piety of my attitude during those weeks it was perhaps not quite till then that i fully emerged from the black shadow of the École préparatoire aux Écoles spéciales not quite till we had got off beyond the blest rhine at basle that i ceased to hear and feel all but just behind me portentous perhaps of another spring the cold breath of the monster the guttery bonngasse was during those weeks of the year close and stale and the house of our good herr doctor humpert professor at the bonn gymnasium in which i shared a room with my brother wilky contracted and dim as well as fragrant through a range of assaults that differed only in kind and not at all in number from those of the street itself and yet i held the period and the whole situation idyllicthe slightly odd sense of which was ones being to that extent attuned to the life of letters and of oh the great thing impressions gone in for to feel a unity a character and a tone in ones impressions to feel them related and all harmoniously coloured that was positively to face the æsthetic the creative even quite wondrously the critical life and almost on the spot to commence author they had begun the impressionsthat was what was the matter with themto scratch quite audibly at the door of liberation of extension of projection what they were of one more or less knew but what they were for was the question that began to stir though one was still to be a long time at a loss directly to answer it  there for the present was the rub the dark difficulty at which one could but secretly staresecretly because one was somehow ashamed of its being there and would have quickly removed ones eyes or tried to clear them if caught in the act of watching impressions were not merely all right but were the dearest things in the world only one would have gone to the stake rather than in the first place confessed to some of them or in the second announced that one really lived by them and built on them this failure then to take ones stand in the connection could but come from the troubled view that they were naught without a backing a stout stiff hardgrained underside that would hold them together and of which the terrible name was simply science otherwise learning and learning exclusively by books which were at once the most beautiful and the most dreadful things in the world some of them right strikingly showily right some of them disgracefully and almost unmentionably wrong that is grossly irrelevant as for instance a bound volume of once a week would be but remarkable above all for overwhelming number and in general for defiance of comprehension it was true that one had from time to time the rare adventure of ones surprise at understanding parts of them none the lessunderstanding more than a very little more than much too little but there was no practical support to speak of in that even the most one could ever hope to understand being a mere drop in the bucket never did i quite strike it off i think that impressions might themselves be scienceand this probably because i didnt then know them when it came to the point as anything but life i knew them but by that collective and unpracticalmany persons would have said that frivolousname which saw me little further i was under the impressionthis in fact the very liveliest of what might have been called the lotthat life and knowledge were simply mutual opposites one inconsistent with the other though hovered about together at the same time by the anomaly that when knowledge impinged upon life pushed against her as it were and drove her to the wall it was all right and such was knowledges way and title whereas when life played the like tricks with knowledge nothing but shame for the ruder even if lighter party could accrue there was to come to me of course in time the due perception that neither was of the least useuse to myselfwithout the other but meanwhile and even for much after the extreme embarrassment continued to whichever of the opposites one gave ones self it was with a sense of all but basely sacrificing the other however the conflict and the drama involved in the question at large was doubtless what was to make consciousnessunder whichever of the two names one preferred to entertain itsupremely intense and interesting  this then is by way of saying that the idyll as i have called it of the happy juncture i glanced at a moment back came from the fact that i didnt at all know how much i was living and meanwhile quite supposed i was considerably learning when rising at some extraordinary hour of the morning i went forth through the unawakened town and the germans at that time heaven knows were early afoot too and made for the open country and the hill in particular of the neighbouring venusberg long low and bosky where the dews were still fresh and ancient mummies of an old cloister as i remember it somewhere perched and exposed i was doing to my sense an attuned thing attuned that is to my coming home to bend double over schillers thirty years war in the strenuous spirit that would keep me at it or that would vary it with goethes wahlverwandtschaften till late in the warm afternoon i found german prose much tougher than the verse and thereby more opposed to life as to which i of course couldnt really shake off the sense that it might be worked as infinitely comprehensive comprehensive even of the finest discriminations against it the felicity present but naturally unanalysed was that the whole thing our current episode was exactly comprehensive of life presenting it in particular as characteristically german and therein freshly vividwith the great vividness that by our parents vague wish we were all three after or out for in spite of our comparatively restricted use in those days of these verbal graces such therefore was the bright unity of our experience or at least of my own share in itthis luck that through the intensity of my wanting it to all consciousness all my own immediate tasted german to the great and delightful quickening of my imagination the quickening was of course no such matter as i was to know nearly ten years later on plunging for the first time over the alps into italy but letting alone that i was then so much older i had wondered about italy to put it embracingly far more than i was constitutionally capable of wondering about germany it was enough for me at bonn that i felt no lack of appetitehad for the time all the illusion of being on the way to something to something i mean with which the taste of german might somehow directly mix itself every aspect and object round about was a part at all events of the actual mixture and when on drowsy afternoons not a little interspaced indeed i attempted the articulate perusal of hermann und dorothea with our good professor it was like dreaming to the hum of bees if not to the aftertaste of good old rhenish in some homely fruity eighteenthcentury garden  the good old rhenish is no such false note in this reconstitution i seem to see the frau doctorin and her ancient mildlyscowling sister fräulein stamm who reminded me of hepzibah pyncheon in the house of the seven gables perpetually wiping green hockglasses and holding them up to our meagre light as well as setting out longnecked bottles with rather chalky cakes in that forward section of our general eatingandlivingroom which formed our precinct of reception and conversation the unbroken space was lighted at either end from street and court and its various effects of tempered shade or frankly speaking of rather greasy gloom amid which the light touch of elegance gleamed but from the polish of the glasses and the sloping shoulders of their bottle comes back to me as the view of an intensely internal interior i recall how oppressively in that apartment how congestedly as in some cage of which the wires had been papered over i felt housed and disconnected i scarce then i think knew what the matter was but it could only have been that in all those summer weeks to the best of my belief no window was ever once opened still there was the scene the thick the muchmixed chiaroscuro through which the two ladies of the family emerged from an exiguous retreat just off the back end of the place with ample platters of food the almost impenetrable dusk of the middle zone where the four or five of us seated with our nutcrackerfaced pastor conveyed the food to our mouths with a confidence mainly borrowed from the play of his own deepplunging knife and then the forward the festal extension the privilege of occasionally lingering in which or of returning to it for renewed refreshment was a recognition both of our general minding of our business upstairsleft as we were to thumb our flügels dictionary by the hour so long as we invoked no other oracle our drowsy doctor invited no such approach he smiled upon us as if unseen forefingers of great force had been inserted for the widening of his mouth at the corners and i had the sense of his not quite knowing what to make of our being so very gently barbaric or rather so informally civilised he safely housed and quite rankly fed us guided us to country walks and to the swimmingbaths by the rhineside introduced us to fruitgardens where on payment of the scantest tribute we were suffered to consume offhand bushels of cherries plums and pears suffered us to ascend the drachenfels and to partake of coffee at rolandseck and in other friendly openair situations but flung his gothic shadow as little as possible over my so passive page at least and took our rate of acquisition savingly for granted  this in the optimism of the hour i have no memory of resenting the page though slow managed at the same time to be stirring and i asked no more of any one or anything but that they should be with all due gothicism whatever they most easily might the long vistas of the beeches and poplars on the other side of the rhine after we had crossed by the funicular ferry gothically rustled and murmured i fancied their saying perpetually we are german woods we are german woodswhich makes us very wonderful do you know and unlike any others dont you feel the spell of the very sound of us and of the beautiful words old german woods old german woods even if you cant tell why i couldnt altogether tell why but took everything on trust as mystically and valuably gothicvaluably because ministering with peculiar directness as i gathered to culture i was in or again i was out in my small way for culture which seemed quite to come come from everywhere at once with the most absurd conciliatory rush pitifully small as would have been any list of the sources i tapped the beauty was in truth that everything was a source giving me by the charmingest breach of logic more than it at all appeared to hold which was exactly what had not been the case at the institution rochette where things had appeared or at least had pretended to hold so much more than they gave the oddity was that about us now everythingeverything but the murmur of the german woods and the great flow and magic name of the rhinewas more ugly than beautiful tended in fact to say at every turn you shall suffer yes indeed you are doing so stick up for your right to in your sense of form which however is quite compatible with culture is really one of the finest parts of it and may decidedly prove to you that youre getting it i hadnt in rubbing with whatever weakness against french and so far as might be against france and in sinking very sensibly more and more into them particularly felt that i was getting it as such what i was getting as such was decidedly rather my famous life and without so much as thinking of the degree with it all of the valuable and the helpful  life meanwhile i had a good deal of at my side in the person of my brother wilky who as i have had occasion elsewhere to say contrived in those years to live or to have every appearance of so doing with an immediacy that left me far in the lurch i was always still wondering how while he had solved the question simply ambulando which was for him but by the merest sociable stroll this represented to me successsuccess of a kind but such an assured kindin a degree that was my despair and i have never forgotten how that summer when the herr doctor did look in did settle down a little to have the bristling page out with us wilkys share of the hour took on the spot the form of his turning at once upon our visitor the tables of earnest inquiry he delighted after this tribute of eagerness to meet the doctors interrogative advance but the communication so made was of anything and everything except the fruit of his reading the act of reading was inhuman and repugnant to him and i amazedly noted while i nursed my small hoard that anything he offered did in the event quite as well he could talk with such charm such drollery of candour such unexpectedness of figure about what he had done and what he hadntor talk at least before it behind it and beside it we had three or four housecompanions youths from other places attending the gymnasium and committed to our professors care as to whom i could somehow but infer that they were each in his personal way inordinately gothicwhich they had to be to supply to my mind a relation or a substitute for a relation with them whereas my younger brother without a scrap of a view of them a grain of theory or formula tumbled straight into their confidence all round our air for him was by just so much life as it couldnt have dreamed of being culture and he was so far right that when the son of the house and its only child the slim and ardent theodor who figured to me but as a case of such classic sensibility of the lieder or the werther sort as might have made with the toss of a yellow lock or the gleam of a green blouse the image for an uhland or a heine stanza had imparted to him an intention of instant suicide under some resentment of parental misconception he had been able to use dissuasion or otherwise the instinct of then most freely fraternising with a success to which my relish for so romantic a stroke as charmingly in theodors character and setting mightnt at all have attained there is a small something of each of us in a passage of an ingenuous letter addressed by him from the midst of these conditions to his parents i fondly catch i confess at any of these recoverable lights finding them at the best too scant for my commemorative purpose       willy got his photograph this morning after three hours hard work      from the postoffice he was sent to the customhouse and there was      obliged to sign his name and to go to some neighbouring bookstore      to buy a seal on returning to the customhouse he was sent back to      the postoffice to get some document or other after obtaining this      article he turned his steps once more to the customhouse where an      insolent officer told him he must wait an hour w informed him      that he would return at the end of the hour and accordingly for      the third time went to the ch and was conducted by the clerk to      a cellar where the packages were kept and there told to take off      his hat he obeyed raging and then was a fourth time sent to the      pothis time to pay money happily he is now in possession of      his property h and he took a walk this afternoon to a      fruitgarden where plums cherries gooseberries and currants were      abundant after half an hours good work h left w finishing      merely the plumsthe cherry and gooseberry course to come later      he was so enchanted that he thought h a great fool to leave so      soon how does paris now strike you it cant be as nice as bonn      you had better write to bob  bob our youngest brother had been left at geneva with excellent m maquelin and was at that time en course over the alps with this gentleman and their young companions a most desirable delicious excursion which i remember following in envious fancy as it included a descent to the italian lakes and a push on as far as genoa in reference to which excursion i cull a line or two from a faded scrap of a letter addressed a little later by this youngest of us to his beloved brother william this is about our grande course we started at 5 oclock in the morning with our faces and hands all nicely washed and our nails clean the morning was superb and as we waited in the court the soft balmy air of the mountains came in bringing with it the melodious sound of the rappel for breakfast this finished we bade adieu and i could see the emotions of the kind and everwatchful madame maquelin as a few silent drops trickled down her fair cheeks we at last arrived at the boat where we met mr peters a portly gentleman from the city of philadelphia with his two sweet sons one twelve the other seven years old the eldest coming from mr es school with no very good opinion of the principalsaying he had seen him in a state of tightness several times during his stay there mr peters appears to have been something of a pessimist for when at a later stage it began to rain hard and half the road was a foot deep in water and the cocher had stopped somewhere to get lanterns and had at the same time indulged in certain potations which didnt make him drive any the straighter this gentleman insinuated that we had all better have been with our mothers the letter records at some length the early phases of the affair but under the weight of the vision of italy it rather breaks down and artlessly simplifies genoa is a most lively town and there is a continual swarm of sailors in the street we visited several palaces among others that of victor emanuel which is very fine and the fruit is very cheap we stayed there several days but at last started for turin where we spent a sundaya place i didnt much like i suppose because of that reason we left turin the next day on foot but lost our road and had to come back i recover even in presence of these light accents my shade of wonder at this odd chance that made the least developed of us the subject of what seemed to me even then a privilege of the highest intensity and there again keeps it company my sense through all the after years that this early glimpse of the blest old italy almost too early though it appears to have but just missed being might have done something towards preparing or enriching for bob the one little plot of consciousness in which his deeply troubled life was to find rest he was in the event also fondly to aim at painting like two of his brothers but whereas they were to fumble with the lock in their very differing degree only in those young years he was to keep at it most as he grew older though always with a perfect intelligence of the inevitable limits of the relation the same intelligence that was so sharp and sad so extraordinarily free and fine and detached in fact as play of mind play of independent talk and of pen for the limits of his relation to many other matters singularly intelligent all round yet with faculties that had early declined any consummation of acquaintance with such training as under a different sort of pressure he might have enjoyed he had an admirable hand and eye and i have known no other such capacity for absorbing or storing up the minutest truths and shades of landscape fact and giving them out afterward in separation from the scene with full assurance and felicity he could do this still better even than he cared to do i for my part cared much more that he should than he ever did himself and then it was i dare say that i made the reflection he took in the picture of italy with his firm hard gift having the chance while william and i were still comparatively small untouched and gaping barbarians and it should always be in him to do at some odd fine moment a certain honour to that i held to it that that sensibility had played in him more than by any outward measure at the time which was perhaps indeed one of the signs within me of the wasteful habit or trick of a greater feeling for peoples potential propriety or felicity or full expression than they seemed able to have themselves at all events i was absolutely never to cease to remember for bob through everythingand there was much and of the most agitated and agitatingthat he had been dipped as a boy into the sacred stream to some effect which thanks to two or three of his most saving and often so amusing sensibilities the turbid sea of his life might never quite wash away  william had meanwhile come to bonn with us but was domiciled with another tutor younger and fairer and more of the world above all more ventilated and ventilating herr stromberg whose defect might in fact have seemed that with his constant exhibition of the stamp received by him from the writings of lord macaulay passages of which he could recite by heart and the circumstance that his other pupil williams comrade for a time was of unmitigatedly english that is of quasibyronic association he didnt quite rise to the full gothic standard otherwise indeed our brother moved on the higher plane of light and air and ease and above all of enjoyed society that we felt he naturally must present to me yet is the thrill of learning from him that his english fellowpupil was the grandson if i remember rightly the degree of descent of mary chaworth byrons first love and my sense afterwards in gaping at young mr musters himself that this independently romantic contact would have been more to my own private purpose at least than the most emphasised gothicism none the less do i regain it as a part of my current vision that frau stromberg who was young and fair wrote tragedies as well as made pancakeswhich were served to each consumer double a thick confiture within being the reason of this luxuriance and being also a note beyond our experience in the bonngasse and that with the printed five acts of a certain cleopatra before me read aloud in the first instance to her young inmates and by my brother passed on to me i lost myself in the view of i scarce knew what oldworld germanic grace positively or little courtcity practice of the theatre these things so lived in the small thick pamphlet grey paper with blunt type and bristling to my discomfiture with descriptive stage directions vast dense bracketed tracts gothic enough in all conscience as to which i could already begin to wonder whether such reinforcements of presentation proved more for or against the true expressional essence of the matter for or against that is there being nothing at all so dramatic so chargeable with meaning and picture as speech of whatever sort made perfect such speculations i may parenthesise might well have been fostered and doubtless were by an impression that i find commemorated in a few lines of a letter of my fathers to a friend in americahe having brought us on to bonn introduced us to our respective caretakers and remained long enough to have had an evening at the theatre to which we accompanied him we had ristori to play mary stuart for us last nightwhich was the vulture counterfeiting jenny wren every little while the hoarse exulting voice the sanguinary beak the lurid leer of menace and the relentless talons looked forth from the feathery mass and sickened you with disgust she would do elizabeth better i recall the performance in every feature as well as my absence of such reserves though quite also the point to which i was impressed by the utterance of them not that it didnt leave me at the same time free to feel that the heroine of history represented could scarce have been at all a dovelike much less a wrenlike person she had indeed on madame ristoris showing prodigious resources of militant mobilityof what in fact would be called today mobilisation several years later on i was to see the actress play the same part in america and then if i am not mistaken was to note scarce more than one point the awful effect on any histrionic case even on one so guardedly artful as hers of having been dragged round the globe and forced home so far as might be to imperfect comprehensions the big brush had come fairly to daub the canvas let the above however serve in particular to lead in as many examples of my fathers singularly striking and personal habit of expression and weight of thought as these pages may find room for  the one difficulty is that to open that general door into the limbo of old letters charged with their exquisite ghostly appeal is almost to sink into depths of concession i yield here for instance to the claim of a page or two from william just contemporary and addressed to our parents in parisand yield perhaps but for no better reason than that of the small historic value or recoverable charm that i am moved to find in its illustrative items the reference of its later lines is to a contemporary cousin young and blooming by whom i have already ever so lightly brushed2 and who figured quite with the grand air on our young horizon the only daughter of the brightest of the albany uncles by that time lost and mourned now on the tour of europe with a pair of protective elders for her entrance upon life and at that hour surrounding our parents her uncle and aunt with a notably voluminous rustle of fresh paris clothes the farspreading drapery of the more and more draped and flounced and sloped second empire this friendly froufrou almost reached our ears so sociable for us was every sound of her in our faroff rhineland she was with her stature and shape the finest possible person to carry clothes and i thought of her with a revival of the old yearning envy as now quite transcendently orphaned and bereft dowered directed and equipped       your hearts i know would have been melted if you had had a view      of us this sunday morning i went directly after breakfast for the      boys and though h had an iron stomachache as he called it we      went off together to that low wooded hill which the aunt could see      from her window when you were here and walked about till      dinnertime h being all the while in great pain in one part we      found a platform with a stone bench commanding a view of the whole      valley and as we were rather tired sat down on it h and wilky      each with a once a week while i tried to draw the view in my      pocketbook we wondered what our beloved parents were doing at      that moment 1130 and thought you must all have been in your      salon alice at the window with her eyes fixed on her novel but      eating some rich fruit that father has just brought in for her from      the palais royal and the lovely mother and aunt in armchairs      their hands crossed in front of them listening to father who      walks up and down talking of the superiority of america to these      countries after all and how much better it is we should have done      with them we wished oh we wished we could have been with you to      join in the conversation and partake of the fruit we got up from      the seat and went on with a heavy sigh but in a way so fraternal      presenting such a sweet picture of brotherly unitedness and      affection that it would have done you good to see us       and so it is every day that we meet for our shorter walks and      talks the german gets on slowly but i notice a very marked      improvement in talking i have not kept at it so hard this last      week as before and i prevent h from working his eyes out which      he seems on the whole rather less inclined to do i am going to      read as much as i can the rest of the time we are here it seems a      mere process of soaking requiring no mental effort but only time      and steady patience my room is very comfortable now ive got used      to it and i have a pair of slippers of green plush heavy and      strong enough to last all my life and then be worn by my children      the photograph of our zoffingen group has come which gives me a      moustache big enough for three lifeguardsmen tell us something      more about mary helen how long does she expect to stay in europe      and who is this dr adamsthe man she is engaged to she directs      me to write to her in his careso that i wish you would ask her      as she says she hopes to meet me whether i shall still address her      as miss james of course it would be painful but i think i could      do it if adams werent there let the delicious little greyeyed      alice be locked up alone on the day after the receipt of this with      paper and envelopes to write a letter unassisted uncorrected and      unpunctuated to her loving brothers who would send her novels and      peaches if they could what a blessing it is to have such parents      such a perfect mother and magnificent father and dear good aunt and      splendid little sister  i may mention that mary helen was not engaged to the gentleman abovementioned and was eventually to marry the late alfred grymes originally of louisiana also that a letter subsequent to this apparently of the first days in september sounds to his father the first note of my brothers definite personal preference as he seemed lately and increasingly though not in conditions markedly propitious to have become aware of it for an adoption of the artistic career it was an odd enough circumstance in respect to the attested blood in our veins that no less than three of our fathers children with two of his grandsons to add to these and with a collateral addendum representing seven in all of our grandfathers william jamess descendants in three generations should have found the artistic career in general and the painters trade in particular irresistibly solicit them       i wish you would as you promised set down as clearly as you can on      paper what your idea of the nature of art is because i do not      probably understand it fully and should like to have it presented      in a form that i might think over at my leisure i wish you would      do so as fully as you conveniently can so that i may ruminate      itand i wont say more about it till i have heard from you again      as for what your last letter did contain what can i do but thank      you for every word of it and assure you that they went to the right      spot having such a father with us how can we be other than in      some measure worthy of himif not perhaps as eminently so as the      distance leads his fond heart to imagine i never value him so much      as when i am away from him at home i see only his striking      defects but here he seems all perfection and i wonder as i write      why i didnt cherish him more when he was beside me i beg darling      old mothers forgiveness too for the rude and dastardly way in      which i snub her and the aunt for the impatience and violence i      have always shown her i shall be a perfect sherrycobbler to both      of them and to the small alice too young as she may be for such      treats       i have just got home from dining with the boys and their humperts      where i found the doctor as genial as ever and the two old ladies      perfect characters for dickens they have been so shut out from the      world and melting together so long by the kitchen fire that the      minds of both have become fused into one and then seem to      constitute a sort of twobodied individual i never saw anything      more curious than the way they sit mumbling together at the end of      the table each using simultaneously the same comment if anything      said at our end strikes their ear h pegs away pretty stoutly but      i dont think you need worry about him he and wilky appear to get      on in great harmony and enliven themselves occasionally by      brotherly trials of strength quite goodnatured in their room      when excess of labour has made them sleepy or heavy in these      sometimes one sometimes the other is victorious they often pay me      a visit here while i am dressing which of course is highly      convenientand i have more than once been with them early enough      to be present at wilkys tumble out of bed and consequent      awakening with the call on the alreadyatwork h why the      mischief didnt you stop me wilky and i walked to rolandseck      yesterday afternoon and after a furious race back to the station      found ourselves too late for the train by a second so we took a      boat and rowed down here which was delightful we are going to put      h through a splashing good walk daily a thousand thanks to the      cherrylipped apricotnosed doublechinned little sister for her      strongly dashedoff letter which inflamed the hearts of her lonely      brothers with an intense longing to smack her celestial cheeks     iii   i have before me another communication of about the same moment a letter addressed to his father in paris within that month from which in spite of its lively interest as i hold i cull nothingand precisely because of that interest which prescribes for it a later appearance in conditions in which it may be given entire william is from this season on to my sense so livingly and admirably reflected in his letters which were happily through much of his career both numerous and highly characteristic that i feel them particularly plead in those cases in which they most testify to his personal history for the separate gathered presentation that happily awaits them there best may figure the serious and reasoned reply drawn from him by some assuredly characteristic enough communication of our parents own in respect to his declared preference for a painters life over any other lost is this original and in the light of later matters sufficiently quaint declaration and lost the paternal protest answered by my brother from bonn and anything but infelicitous on its side so far as the truer apprehension went under the showing of the time to come the only thing was that our father had a wonderful way of being essentially right without being practically or as it were vulgarly determinant and that this relegation of his grounds of contention to the sphere of the nonimmediate the but indirectly urgent from the point of view of the thing really to do couldnt but often cause impatience in young breasts conscious of gifts or desires or ideals of which the very sign and warrant the truth they were known by was that they were susceptible of application it was in no world of close application that our wondrous parent moved and his indifference at the first blush to the manifestation of special and marketable talents and faculties restlessly outward purposes of whatever wouldbe successful sort was apt to be surpassable only by his delight subsequently taken in our attested and visible results the very fruits of application as to which the possibility perhaps even the virtual guarantee hadnt so much left him cold in advance as made him adversely and spiritually hot the sense of that word was the most living thing in the world for himto the point that the spiritual simply meant to him the practical and the successful so far as he could get into touch with such denominations or so far that is as he could face them or care for them a priori fortunately as he had observational powers of the happiest perceptionsperceptions of character and value perceptions of relation and effect perceptions in short of the wholeturned to the ground sensibly beneath our feet as well as a splendid an extraordinarily animated and so far as he himself at least was concerned guiding and governing soul justice and generosity always eventually played up the case worked itself happily out and before we knew it he had found it quite the rightest of all cases while we on our side had had the liveliest and certainly the most amusing and civilising moral or as he would have insisted spiritual recreation by the way  my brother challenges him with a beautiful deference on the imputed damage to what might be best in a man by the professional pursuit of artwhich he appears to have set forth with characteristic emphasis and i take the example for probably one of the rarest in all the so copious annals of parental opposition to the æsthetic as distinguished from some other more respectable course what was marked in our fathers prime uneasiness in presence of any particular form of success we might according to our lights as then glimmering propose to invoke was that it bravely or with such inward assurance dispensed with any suggestion of an alternative what we were to do instead was just to be something something unconnected with specific doing something free and uncommitted something finer in short than being that whatever it was might consist of the career of art has again and again been deprecated and denounced on the lips of anxiety or authority as a departure from the career of business of industry and respectability the socalled regular life but it was perhaps never elsewhere to know dissuasion on the very ground of its failing to uplift the spirit in the ways it most pretends to i must in fairness add however that if the uneasiness i here refer to continued and quite by exception as compared with the development of other like episodes during the whole of my brothers fortunately but little prolonged studio season it was really because more alternatives swarmed before our parents eyes in the cause than he could bring himself to simplify it by naming he apprehended ever so deeply and tenderly his eldest sons other geniusas to which he was to be so justified though this indeed was not to alter the fact that when afterwards that subject went in by a wondrous reaction for the pursuit of science first of chemistry and then of anatomy and physiology and medicine with psychology and philosophy at last piling up the record the rich malaise at every turn characteristically betrayed itself each of these surrenders being by the measure of them in the parental imagination so comparatively narrowing that was the nearest approach to any plea for some other application of the spiritthat they were narrowing when i myself later on began to write it was breathed upon me with the finest bewildering eloquence with a power of suggestion in truth which i fairly now count it a gain to have felt play over me that this too was narrowing on the subsequent history of which high paradox no better comment could occur to me than my find of a passage in a letter long subsequently addressed to mr james t fields then proprietor and editor of the atlantic monthly magazinea letter under date of may 1868 and referring clearly to some published remarks on a certain young writer which did violence to the blessedly quick paternal prejudice       i had no sooner left your sanctum yesterday than i was afflicted to      remember how i had profaned it by my unmeasured talk about poor h      please forget it utterly i dont know how it is with better men      but the parental sentiment is so fiendish a thing with me that if      anyone attempt to slay my young especially in a clandestine way      or out of a pious regard eg to the welfare of the souls      comprised in the diocese of the atlantic i cant help devoting him      bag and baggage to the infernal gods i am not aware of my animus      until i catch as yesterday a courteous ear then the unholy fire      flames forth at such a rate as to leave me no doubt on reflection      where it was originally lighted  almost all my dear father is there making the faded page today inexpressibly touching to me his passionate tenderness his infinite capacity for reaction on reaction a force in him fruitful in so many more directions than any high smoothness of partipris could be and his beautiful fresh individual utterance always so stamped with the very whole of him the few lines make for me after all the years a sort of silver key so exquisitely fitting to the treasure of living intercourse of a domestic air quickened and infinitely coloured comprised in all our younger time the renewed sense of which however has carried me for the moment too far from the straighter line of my narrative  the author of the young letter of which i have deferred presentation met in paris shortly after that date the other party to the discussion and the impression of the endless day of our journey my elder and my younger brothers and mine from bonn to that city has scarcely faded from me the railway service was so little then what it has become that i even marvel at our having made our connections between our early rise in the bonngasse and our midnight tumble into bed at the hôtel des trois empereurs in the place du palais royal a stillfelt rapture a revelation of the parisian idea of bed after the rude german conception our sore discipline for so many weeks i remember cologne and its cathedral almost in the bland dawn and our fresh start thence for strasbourg now clearly recognised alas as a start back to america to which it had been of a sudden settled that we were still with a fine inconsequence to return we had seen cologne cathedral by excursion from bonn but we saw strasbourg to my sorrow until a far later occasion soothed it only as a mild monster behind bars that is above chimneys housetops and fortifications a loss not made up to me by other impressions or particulars vivid and significant as i found myself none the less supposing several of these those were the september days in which french society so far as it was of the empire at least moved more or less in its mass upon homburg and badenbaden and we met it in expressive samples and in advance and retreat during our incessant stops those longtime old stops unknown to the modern age when everyone appeared to alight and walk about with the animation of prisoners suddenly pardoned and ask for conveniences and clamour for food and get mixed with the always apparently still dustier people of opposite trains drawn up for the same purposes we appeared to be concerned with none but firstclass carriages as an effect of which our own was partly occupied the livelong day by the gens of a noble french house as to which we thus had frequent revelationsa pair of footmen and a ladys maid types of servile impudence taking its ease who chattered by the hour for our wonderstruck ears treating them to their first echo of the strange underworld the sustaining vulgarity of existences classified as great they opened vistas and i remember how when much later i came to consider the designed picture first in edmond about and then in alphonse daudet of fifty features symptomatic of the social pace at which the glittering régime hurried to its end there came back to me the breath of this sidewind of the frenzied dance that we had caught during those numerous and so far from edifying hours in our fine old deepseated compartment the impression i now at any rate perfectly recover was one that could feed full enough any optimism of the appointedly modest condition it was true that madame la marquise who was young and goodnatured and pretty without beauty and unmistakably great exhaling from afar as i encouraged myself to imagine the scented air of the tuileries came on occasion and looked in on us and smiled and even pouted through her elegant patience so that she at least i recollect caused to swim before me somehow such a view of happy privilege at the highest pitch as made me sigh the more sharply even if the less professedly for our turning our backs on the complex order the european fresh to me still in which contrasts flared and flourished and through which discrimination could unexhaustedly riotpointing so many more morals withal if that was the benefit it was supposed to be than we should find pretexts for on the other side we were to fall as soon as we were at home again to reading the revue des deux mondesthough doubtless again i should speak here with any emphasis but for myself my chin in europe had scarce risen to the level of that publication but at newport in rhode island our next following place of sojourn i speedily shot up so as quite to bend down to it it took its place therewith as the very headspring of culture a mainstay in exile and as opening wide in especial the doors of that fictive portrayal of a society which put a price for the brooding young reader on cases on cadres in the revue parlance already constituted and propitiously lighted then it was that the special tension of the draggedout day from cologne to paris proved on the absurdest scale a preparation justified itself as a vivid point of reference i was to know what the high periodical meant when i encountered in its études de moeurs the bluechinned corruptible not to say corrupt larbin and the smart soubrette it was above all a blessing to feel myself in the perusal of m octave feuillet an education as i supposed of the taste not at a marked disadvantage since who but the petite comtesse herself had swung her crinoline in and out of my prospect or to put it better of my preserved past on one of my occasions of acutest receptivity  the truth was that acute that quite desperate receptivity set in for me under a law of its ownmay really be described as having quite raged for mefrom the moment our general face by the restless parental decree born not a little of parental homesickness and reinforced by a theory of that complaint on our own part we having somehow in europe no companions none but mere parents themselves had been turned again to the quarter in which there would assuredly be welcomes and freedoms and unchecked appropriations not to say also cousins of both sexes and of a more and more engaging time of life cousins kept and tended and adorned for us in our absence together with the solicitation for our favour of possible though oh so just barely possible habitats before which the range of europe paled but which nevertheless to my aching fancy meant premature abdication sacrifice and in one dreadful word failure i had had cousins naturally in the countries we were quitting but to a limited degree yet i think i already knew i had had companions in as full a measure as any i was still to knowinasmuch as my imagination made out one in the complex order and the coloured air almost wherever i turned and inasmuch as further to live by the imagination was to live almost only in that way so to foresee the comparative not to say the absolute absence of tonic accent in the appearances complacently awaiting me as well as to forecast in these appearances at the best a greater paucity was really to enjoy a sharp prevision of dearth certain it is that those supreme moments of paris those afterdays at the trois empereurs were to flush for me as they ebbed with images and visions judged by any achieved act of possession i hadnt assuredly much to give up but intensity of sentiment resting on a good disposition makes for its own sake the most of opportunity and i buried my associations which had been in a manner till lately my hopes as well with all decent dignity and tenderness these more or less secret obsequies lent to our further brief delay a quality of suppressed excitement the oldworld hours were numbered too dreadfullyhad shrunk but to a handful i had waked up to that as with a passionate even if private need for gathering in and saving on the morrow of our reaching our final stickingplace i had slipped from my so cushioned sleep my canopied couch to hang from the balcony of our quatrième my brothers and mine over that place du palais royal and up against that sculptured and storied façade of the new louvre which seemed to me then to represent in its strength the capacity and chiselled rim of some such potent vivifying cup as it might have been given us under a happier arrangement to taste now in its fulness and with a braver sense for it over against us on the great palace wall as i make outif not for that occasion then for some otherwere statues of heroes napoleons young generals hoche marceau desaix or whoever such a galaxy as never was or should ever be again for splendid monumental reference and what it somehow came to was that here massed itself the shining second empire over which they stood straight aloft and on guard like archangels of the sword and that the whole thing was a highpitched wonder and splendour which we had already in our small gaping way got into a sort of relation with and which would have ever so much more ever so thrillingly to give us what it would give us loomed but vaguely enough out of the great hum and the great toned perspective and withal the great noble expense of which we had constant reminder but that we were present at something it would be always after accounted a privilege to have been concerned with and that we were perversely and inconsiderately dropping out of it and for a reason so far as there might be a reason that was scarcely less than strangeall this loomed large to me as our interval shrank and i even ask myself before the memory of it whether i was ever again in the later and more encompassing and accommodating years to have in those places so rich a weight of consciousness to carry or so grand a presumption of joy the presumption so boldly entertained was if you please of what the whole thing meant it meant immensely the glittering régime and that meant in turn prodigiously something that would probably never be meant quite to any such tune again so much one positively and however absurdly said to ones self as one stood up on the high balcony to the great insolence of the louvre and to all the history all the glory again and all the imposed applause not to say worship and not to speak of the implied inferiority on the part of everything else that it represented and the sense was of course not less while one haunted at odd hours the arcades and glass galleries of the palais royal close at handas if to store up for all the world treasures of impression that might be gnawed in seasons or places of want like winter pears or a squirrels hoard of nuts and so perhaps keep one alive as to ones most vital faculty abovementioned till one should somehow or other be able to scramble back  the particular ground for our defection which i obscurely pronounced mistaken was that since william was to embrace the artistic careerand freedom for this experiment had been after all as i repeat that it was always in like cases to be not in the least grudgingly granted himour return to america would place him in prompt and happy relation to william hunt then the most distinguished of our painters as well as one of the most original and delightful of men and who had cordially assured us that he would welcome such a pupil this was judged among us at large other considerations aiding a sound basis for action but never surely had so odd a motive operated for a break with the spell of paris we named the motive generally i think and to the credit of our earnest good faith with confidenceand i am of course not sure how often our dear father may not explicatively have mentioned the shy fact that he himself in any case had gradually ceased to like europe this affects me at present as in the highest degree natural it was to be his fortune for the rest of his life to find himself as a worker in his own field and as to what he held most dear scantly enough heeded reported or assimilated even in his own air no brisk conductor at any time of his remarkable voice but in europe his isolation had been utterhe had there had the sense of playing his mature and ardent thought over great dense constituted presences and opaque surfaces that could by their very nature scarce give back so much as a shudder no more admirable case of apostolic energy combined with philosophic patience of constancy of conviction and solitary singleness of production unperturbed can i well conceive and i certainly came later on to rejoice in his having had after a certain date to walk if there was a preference rather in the thin wilderness than in the thick i dare say that when we returned to america toward the end of 1860 some five years and a half after our departure it may have been with illusions not a few for him about the nature of the desert or in other words about the degree of sensibility of the public there awaiting him but the pretext given him by his so prized and admired eldest son was at the worst and however eccentric our action inspiring i alone of the family perhaps made bold not to say quite directly or literally that we went home to learn to paint people stared or laughed when we said it and i disliked their thinking us so simplethough dreaming too a little perhaps that they might have been struck with our patriotism this however conveyed but a chill the moresince we didnt in the least go to our friend who had been coutures and frères pupil who had spent years in france and of whom it was the common belief that you couldnt for the life of you tell him from a french painter because he was patriotic but because he was distinguished and accomplished charming and kind and above all known to us and thereby in a manner guaranteed he looked as people get to look under such enjoyed or even suffered exposures extremely like a frenchman and what was noteworthy still more like a sculptor of the race than a painter which doubtless had to do with my personally though i hope in present cultivated anxiety not too officiously sighing at all the explanation the whole thing took i am bound to add none the less that later on repatriated and as to my few contacts reassured i found this amount the apprehension of which had haunted me no great charge and seem even to make out that for the first six months of our newport phase at least we might have passed for strikingly wise for here was beyond doubt a genial an admirable master and here alsoat such a rate did sparse individuals scattered notches in the long plain stick countwas john la farge here moreoverhere and everywhere about me before we could quite turn roundwas the war with its infinite its truly quite humiliating correction of my as i now can but so far call it fatuous little confidence that appearances on the native scene would run short they were in the event taking one thing with another never to hold out for me as they held during those four years wondrous this force in them as i at present look backwondrous i mean in view of that indirectness of its play which my conditions confined me with such private though i must add alas such helplessly unapplied resentment to knowing it by if the force was great the attenuation of its reach was none the less preappointed and constant so that the case must have come back again but to the degreecall it too frankly the forceof ones sensibility or in other words the blest resource the supremely breatheable and thereby nourishing and favouring air of ones imaginative life there were of a truth during that time probably more appearances at ones command in the way of felt aspects images apprehended living relations and impressions of the stress of life than during any other season one was to know only doubtless with more of the work of their figuring to their utmost their giving all they could to do by ones self and in the last resort deep within ones breast the point to be made just here in any case is that if we had not recrossed the sea by way rather of such an anticlimax to william hunt we should certainly with brief delay have found ourselves doing it on the first alarm of war for the experience i thus too summarily glance at and which i dont pretend to speak of as all my own     iv   newport with repatriation accepted would have been on many grounds inevitable i thinkas it was to remain inevitable for several years and this quite apart from williams having to paint since if i spoke just now of the sweep of our view from over the water of a continent or wellnigh waiting to receive us the eligibility of its innumerable sites was a matter much more of our simplified our almost distressfully uninvolved and unconnected state than of the inherent virtue of this that or the other particular group of local conditions our parents had for us no definite project but to be liberally goodin other words so good that the presumption of our being so would literally operate anywhere and anyhow would really amount in itself to a sort of situated state a sufficient prime position and leave other circumstances comparatively irrelevant what would infallibly have occurred at the best however was what did punctually happenits having to be definitely gathered that though we might apparently be good as i say almost on any ground there was but one place in which we should even at a restricted pitch be well newport imposed itself at that period to so remarkable a degree as the one right residence in all our great country for those tainted under whatever attenuations with the quality and the effect of detachment the effect of detachment was the fact of the experience of europe detachment might of course have come from many causes but it truly came in most cases but from one though that a fairly merciless it came from the experience of europe and i think was on the whole regarded aswhat it could only have been in the sphere of intimacy and secrecy felt to bewithout an absolute remedy as comparatively remedial newport none the less figured and this for sundry reasons into the detail of which i neednt go its rare distinction and precious attribute was that being a wateringplace a refuge from summer heats it had also were the measure considerably stretched possibilities of hibernation we could under stress brave there the period from november to june and it was to be under stress not to know what else to do that was the pinch to which europe reduced you insidiously fatally disconnected you could but make the best as a penalty of the one marked point of reattachment the philosophy of all of which was that to confess to disconnection was to confess by the same stroke to leisurewhich involved also an admission however rueful at once and deprecatory of what might still at that time pass in our unregenerate country for something in the nature of means you had had the means that is to become so awkwardly detachedfor you might then do that cheaply but the whole basis of the winter life there of that spare semblance of the brighton life the folkestone life the bath or the cheltenham or the leamington life was that your occupation or avocation should be vague enough or that you shouldnt in other words be like everyone you might know save a dozen or so at the most in business i remember well how when we were all young together we had under pressure of the american ideal in that matter then so rigid felt it tasteless and even humiliating that the head of our little family was not in business and that even among our relatives on each side we couldnt so much as name proudly anyone who waswith the sole exception of our maternal uncle robertson walsh who looked ever so benevolently after our fathers affairs happily for us such had never been the case with the father of any boy of our acquaintance the business in which the boys father gloriously was stood forth inveterately as the very first note of our comrades impressiveness we had no note of that sort to produce and i perfectly recover the effect of my own repeated appeal to our parent for some presentable account of him that would prove us respectable business alone was respectableif one meant by it that is the calling of a lawyer a doctor or a minister we never spoke of clergymen as well i think that if we had had the pope among us we should have supposed the pope in business just as i remember my friend simpsons telling me crushingly at one of our new york schools on my hanging back with the fatal truth about our credentials that the author of his being we spoke no more of governors than we did of parsons was in the business of a stevedore that struck me as a great card to playthe word was fine and mysterious so that what shall we tell them you are dont you see could but become on our lips at home a more constant appeal it seemed wantonly to be prompted for our father and indeed greatly to amuse him that he should put us off with strange unheardof attributions such as would have made us ridiculous in our special circles his say im a philosopher say im a seeker for truth say im a lover of my kind say im an author of books if you like or best of all just say im a student saw us so very little further abject it certainly appeared to be reduced to the student plea and i must have lacked even the confidence of my brother bob who challenged in my hearing and the usual way was ready not only with the fact that our parent wrote but with the further fact that he had written lectures and miscellanies james i think that when we settled awhile at newport there was no one there who had written but mr henry t tuckerman a genial and graceful poet of the artless age as it might still be called in spite of poe and hawthorne and longfellow and lowell the most characteristic works of the first and the two last of whom had already appeared especially as those most characteristic of mr tuckerman referred themselves to a past sufficiently ample to have left that gentleman with a certain deafness and a glossy wig and a portly presence and the reputation positively of the most practised and desired of dinersout he was to be recognised at once as a social value on a scene not under that rubric densely peopled he constituted indeed such a note as would help to keep others of the vague definability in countenance clearly indeed it might happen that an association of vaguenesses would arrive in time by fondly cleaving together at the semblance of a common identity the nature of the case then demanding however that they should be methodically vague take their stand on it and work it for all it was worth that in truth was made easy by the fact that what i have called our common disconnectedness positively projected and proclaimed a void disconnected from business we could only be connected with the negation of it which had as yet no affirmative no figurative side this probably would come figures in the void would one by one spring up but what would be thus required for them was that the void should be ample and as it were established not to be afraid of it they would have to feel it clear of everything and everyone they knew in the air actually peopled  william hunt for that matter was already a figure unmmistakable superficially speaking unsurpassable just as john la farge already mentioned was so soon to prove to be they were only two indeed but they argued the possibility and so the great thing as i say was that to stand out they should have margin and light we couldnt all be figureson a mere margin the margin of business and in the light of the general wonder of our being anything anything there but we could at least understand the situation and cultivate the possibilities watch and protect the germs this consciousness this aim or ideal had after all its own intensityit burned with a pure flame there is a special joy clearly in the hopeful conversion of the desert into the garden of thinness into thickness a joy to which the conversion of the thick into the mere dense of the free into the rank or the close perhaps gives no clue the great need that newport met was that of a basis of reconciliation to america when the habit the taking for granted of america had been broken or intermitted it would be hard to say of what subtle secret or magic the place was possessed toward this end and by a common instinct i think we didnt attempt to formulate itwe let it alone only looking at each other hard only moving gently on the brave hypothesis only in fine deprecating too rude and impatient too precipitate a doubt of the spell that perhaps might work if we waited and prayed we did wait and pray accordingly scantlyserved though the board we might often have felt we had sat down to and there was a fair company of us to do so friendliest among whom to our particular effort was my fathers excellent friend of many years edmund tweedy already named in pages preparatory to these and who with his admirable wife presented himself as our main introducer and initiator he had married while we were all young in new york together a manner of albany cousin mary temple the elder aunt of the younger3 and had by this time been through more than anything more than everything of which there could be question for ourselves the pair had on their marriage gone at once to europe to live had put in several years of italy and yet had at last particular reasons operating returned to their native that is to sterner realities those as to which it was our general theory of so touching a candour as i look back to it that they offered themselves at newport in a muffling mitigating air the air material moral social was in fact clear and clean to a degree that might well have left us but dazed at the circumjacent blankness yet as to that i hasten to add too that the blowing out of our bubble the planting of our garden the correction of our thinness the discovery under stress of such scraps of colour and conversation such saving echoes and redeeming references as might lurk for us in each other all formed in themselves an active and might at last even grow to suggest an absolutely bustling process  i come back with a real tenderness of memory for instance to that felicity of the personal the social the literary and artistic almost really the romantic identity responding after a fashion quite to bring tears to the eyes in proportion as it might have seemed to feel by some divine insufflation what it practically could stand for what should one call this but the brave triumph of values conscious of having to be almost missionary there were many such that in europe hadnt had to be missionary at all in europe as it were one hadntcomparativelyseen if not the forest for the trees then the trees for the forest whereas on this other great vacuous level every single stem seemed to enjoy for its distinction quite the totality of the daylight and to rise into the air with a gladness that was itself a grace of some of the personal importances that acted in that way i should with easier occasion have more to sayi shall as it is have something but there could perhaps be no better sample of the effect of sharpness with which the forces of culture might emerge than say the fairly golden glow of romance investing the mere act of perusal of the revue des deux mondes there was the charmthough i grant of course that i speak here all for myself constitutionally and face to face with myself quite shamelessly an inquirer a hunter for charmthat whereas the spell cast had more or less inevitable limits in the world to which such a quality as the best things of the revue such a performance of the intellectual and expressional engagement as these suggested was native and was thereby relative to other generally like phenomena so it represented among us where it had to take upon itself what i have already alluded to as all the work far more than its face value few of the forces about us reached as yet the level of representation even if here and there some might have been felt as trying for it and this made all the difference anything suggestive or significant anything promising or interesting anything in the least finely charming above all immensely counted claimed tendance and protection almost claimed or at any rate enjoyed worship as for that matter anything finely charming does quite rightly anywhere but our care our privilege on occasion our felt felicity was to foster every symptom and breathe encouragement to every success to hang over the tenderest shoots that betrayed the principle of growthor in other words to read devoutly into everything and as straight as possible the very fullest meaning we might hope it would learn to have so at least quite at firstand so again very considerably after the large interval and grim intermission represented by the war during which interest and quality to say nothing of quantity at the highest pitch ceased in any degree to fail us and what might be read into almost any aspect without exception paled in the light of what was inevitably read out from it it must be added at the same time that with its long duration the war fell into its place as part of life at large and that when it was over various other things still than the love of peace were found to have grown  immediately at any rate the albany cousins or a particular group of them began again to be intensely in question for us coloured in due course with reflections of the war as their lives not less than our own were to becomeand coloured as well too for all sorts of notation and appreciation from irrepressible private founts mrs edmund tweedy bereft of her own young children had at the time i speak of opened her existence with the amplest hospitality to her four orphaned nieces who were also our fathers and among whom the second in age mary temple the younger about in her seventeenth year when she thus renewed her appearance to our view shone with vividest lustre an essence that preserves her still more than half a century from the date of her death in a memory or two where many a relic once sacred has comparatively yielded to time most of those who knew and loved i was going to say adored her have also yieldedwhich is a reason the more why thus much of her faint echo from too far off though it prove should be tenderly saved if i have spoken of the elements and presences round about us that counted mary temple was to count and in more lives than can now be named to an extraordinary degree count as a young and shining apparition a creature who owed to the charm of her every aspect her aspects were so many and the originality vivacity audacity generosity of her spirit an indescribable grace and weightif one might impute weight to a being so imponderable in common scales whatever other values on our scene might as i have hinted appear to fail she was one of the first order in the sense of the immediacy of the impression she produced and produced altogether as by the play of her own light spontaneity and curiositynot that is as through a sense of such a pressure and such a motive or through a care for them in others natural to an effect of perfect felicity that we were never to see surpassed is what i have already praised all the albany cousinage of those years for being but in none of the company was the note so clear as in this rarest though at the same tune symptomatically or ominously palest flower of the stem who was natural at more points and about more things with a greater range of freedom and ease and reach of horizon than any of the others dreamed of they had that way delightfully with the small after all and the common matterswhile she had it with those too but with the great and rare ones over and above so that she was to remain for us the very figure and image of a felt interest in life an interest as magnanimously farspread or as familiarly and exquisitely fixed as her splendid shifting sensibility moral personal nervous and having at once such noble flights and such touchingly discouraged drops such graces of indifference and inconsequence might at any moment determine she was really to remain for our appreciation the supreme case of a taste for life as life as personal living of an endlessly active and yet somehow a careless an illusionless a sublimely forewarned curiosity about it something that made her slim and fair and quick all straightness and charming tossed head with long light and yet almost sliding steps and a large light postponing renouncing laugh the very muse or amateur priestess of rash speculation to express her in the mere terms of her restless young mind one felt from the first was to place her by a perversion of the truth under the shadow of female earnestnessfor which she was much too unliteral and too ironic so that superlatively personal and yet as independent as off into higher spaces at a touch as all the breadth of her sympathy and her courage could send her she made it impossible to say whether she was just the most moving of maidens or a disengaged and dancing flame of thought no one to come after her could easily seem to show either a quick inward life or a brave or even a bright outward either a consistent contempt for social squalors or a very marked genius for moral reactions she had in her brief passage the enthusiasm of humanitymore assuredly than any charming girl who ever circled and would fain have continued to circle round a ballroom this kept her indeed for a time more interested in the individual the immediate human than in the race or the social order at large but that on the other hand made her ever so restlessly or quite inappeasably psychologic the psychology of others in her shadowi mean their general resort to itcould only for a long time seem weak and flat and dim above all not at all amusing she burned herself out she died at twentyfour  at the risk perhaps of appearing to make my own scant adventure the pivot of that early newport phase i find my reference to william hunt and his truly fertilising action on our common life much conditioned by the fact that since w j for the first six months or so after our return daily and devotedly haunted his studio i myself did no less for a shorter stretch under the irresistible contagion the clearness of the whole passage for me the clearest impression above all of the vivid and whimsical master an inspirer during a period that began a little later on of numberless devotions and loyalties is what this fond memory of my permitted contact and endeavour still has to give me pupils at that time didnt flock to his gatesthough they were to do so in boston during years later on an earnest lady or two boston precursors hovered and flitted but i remember for the rest and i speak of a short period no thoroughgoing élèves save john la farge and my brother i remember for that matter sitting quite in solitude in one of the grey cool rooms of the studio which thus comes back to me as having several and thinking that i really might get to copy casts rather well and might in particular see myself congratulated on my sympathetic rendering of the sublime uplifted face of michael angelos captive in the louvre i sat over this effort and a few others for long quiet hours and seem to feel myself again aware just to that tune of how happy i ought to be no one disturbed me the earnest workers were elsewhere i had a chamber of the temple all to myself with immortal forms and curves with shadows beautiful and right waiting there on blankeyed faces for me to prove myself not helpless and with two or three of hunts own fine things examples of his work in france transporting me at once and defying i believed them great productionsthought in especial endless good of the large canvas of the girl with her back presented while she fills her bucket at the spout in the wall against which she leans with a tension of young muscle a general expression of back beneath her dress and with the pressure of her raised and extended bare arm and flattened hand this to my imagination could only become the prize of some famous collection the light of some museum for all the odd circumstance that it was company just then for muddled me and for the queer figures projected by my crayon frankly intenselythat was the great thingthese were hours of art art definitely named looking me full in the face and accepting my stare in returnno longer a tacit implication or a shy subterfuge but a flagrant unattenuated aim i had somehow come into the temple by the back door the porte dhonneur opened on another side and i could never have believed much at best in the length of my stay but i was there day by day as much as any one had ever been and with a sense of what it meant to be there that the most accredited of pupils couldnt have surpassed so that the situation to this extent really hummed with promise i fail i confess to reconstitute the relation borne by my privilege to that of tuition in the higher branches to which it was quite time i should have mounted enjoyed at the hands of the reverend william c leverett curate to the then rector doctor mercer of that fine old highspired trinity church in which had throbbed from long before the revolution as they used to say the proud episcopal heart of newport and feel indeed that i must pretty well have shaken off as a proved absurd predicament all submission to my dilemma all submission of the mind that is for if my share of mr leveretts attention was less stinted than my share of william hunts and neither had much duration it failed to give me the impression that anything worth naming had opened out to me whereas in the studio i was at the threshold of a world  it became itself indeed on the spot a rounded satisfying world the place did enclosed within the grounds as we then regarded them of the masters house circled about with numerous trees as we then counted them and representing a more direct exclusion of vulgar sounds false notes and harsh reminders than i had ever known i fail in the least to make out where the real work of the studio went forward it took somewhere else its earnest course and our separationmine from the real workers my indulged yet ignored statekept me somehow the safer as if i had taken some mild and quite harmless drug through which external rubs would reach me from a distance but which left my own rubbing power not to say my own smearing or smutching quite free into the world so beautifully valid the master would occasionally walk inquiring as to what i had done or would do but bearing on the question with an easy lightness a friendliness of tact a neglect of conclusion which it touches me still to remember it was impossible to me at that time not so to admire him that his just being to such an extent as from top to toe and in every accent and motion the living and communicating artist made the issue with his presence quite cease to be of how one got on or fell short and become instead a mere selfsacrificing vision of the picturesque itself the constituted picturesque or treated subject in efficient figure personal form vivid human style i then felt the man the great mystery could mark with its stamp when wishing the mark unmistakable teach me just in himself the most and best about any art that i should come to find benignantly concerned with me for moments however smilingly scant william hunt all muscular spareness and brownness and absence of waste all flagrant physiognomy brave bony arch of handsome nose upwardness of strong eyebrow and glare almost of eyes that both recognised and wondered strained eyes that played over questions as if they were objects and objects as if they were questions might have stood to the life for don quixote if we could associate with that hero a farspreading beard already a little grizzled a manner and range of gesture and broken form of discourse that was like a restless reference to a palette and that seemed to take for granted all about canvases and models and charming amusing things the tremendously interesting in the seen bit or caught moment and the general unsayability in comparison of anything else he never would have perched it must be added on rosinantehe was fonder of horses even than of the method of couture and though with a shade of resemblance as all simple and imaginative men have to the knight of la mancha he least suggested that analogy as he passed in a spinning buggy his beard flying behind a favourite trotter but what he perhaps most puts before me today is the grim truth of the merciless manner in which a living and hurrying public educates itself making and devouring in a day reputations and values which represent something of the belief in it that it has had in them but at the memory of which we wince almost to horror as at the legend of victims who have been buried alive oh the cold grey luminaries hung about in odd corners and back passages and that we have known shining and warm they serve at the most now as beacons warning any step not to come that way whatever it does the various attested ways it may not with felicity come growing thus all the while in number  john la farge became at once in breaking on our view quite the most interesting person we knew and for a time remained so he became a great many other things besidea character above all if there ever was one but he opened up to us though perhaps to me in particular who could absorb all that was given me on those suggestive lines prospects and possibilities that made the future flush and swarm his foreignness which seemed great at that time had gained a sharper accent from a long stay made in france where both on his fathers and his mothers side he had relations and had found to our hovering envy all sorts of charming occasions he had spent much time in brittany among kindred the most romantically interesting people and places whose very names the de nanteuils of saintpoldeléon i seem to remember for instance cast a spell across comparatively blank newport sands he had brought home with him innumerable watercolour sketches breton peasants costumes interiors bits of villages and landscape and i supposed him to have had on such ground the most delightful adventure in the world how was one not to suppose it at a time when the best of ones education such as that was had begun to proceed almost altogether by the aid of the revue des deux mondes a periodical that supplied to us then and for several years after or again i can but speak for myself all that was finest in the furniture and the fittings of romance those beginnings of newport were our first contact with new englanda new england already comparatively subdued and sophisticated a samson shorn of his strength by the shears of the southern and more particularly of the new york delilah the result of which still speaking for myself was a prompt yearning and reaching out on the part of the spirit for some corrective or antidote to whatever it was that might be going in the season to come least charmingly or informingly or inspiringly to press upon us i well recall my small anxious foresight as to a required an indispensable provision against either assault or dearth as if the question might be of standing an indefinite siege and how a certain particular capacious closet in a house we were presently to occupy took on to my fond fancy the likeness at once of a store of edibles both substantial and succulent and of a hoard of ammunition for the defence of any breachthe revue accumulating on its shelves at last in serried rows and really building up beneath us with its slender firm salmoncoloured blocks an alternative sphere of habitation there will be more to say of this bristling or rather flowering with precious particulars if i stray so far but the point for the moment was that one would have pushed into that world of the closet one would have wandered or stumbled about in it quite alone if it hadnt been that la farge was somehow always in it with us that was in those years his admirable function and touchthat he affected me as knowing his way there as absolutely no one else did and even as having risen of a sudden before us to bear us this quickening company nobody else not another creature was free of it to that tune the whole midcentury new englandas a rough expression of what the general consciousness most signifiedwas utterly out of it which made you see a most unequal division of our little working or our totally cogitative universe into the wondrous esoteric quarter peopled just by us and our friend and our common references and the vast remainder of the public at large the public of the innumerably uninitiated even when apparently of the most associated  all of which is but a manner of expressing the intensity as i felt it of our francoamerican our most completely accomplished friends presence among us out of the safe rich home of the revue which opened away into the vastness of visions he practically stepped and into it with all his ease he mysteriously returned again he came nearer to being what might have been meant concretely throughout it allthough meant most of course in its fullcharged stream of fictionthan any other visiting figure the stream of fiction was so constant an appeal to the charmed by which i mean of course the predisposed mind that it fairly seemed at moments to overflow its banks and take to its bosom any recognised any congruous creature or thing that might happen to be within reach la farge was of the typethe european and this gave him an authority for me that it verily took the length of years to undermine so that as the sense of those first of them in especial comes back to me i find it difficult even under the appeal to me of the attempt to tell how he was to count in my earliest culture if culture as i hold is a matter of attitude quite as much as of opportunity and of the form and substance of the vessel carried to the fountain no less than of the watersupply itself there couldnt have been better conditions for its operating drop by drop it operates ever much more i think by ones getting whatever there may happen to be out for ones use than by its conforming to any abstract standard of quantity or lustre it may work as between dispenser and subject in so incalculably personal a manner that no chemical analysis shall recover it no common estimate of forces or amounts find itself in the least apply the case was that la farge swam into our ingenuous ken as the figure of figures and that such an agent on a stage so unpeopled and before a scene so unpainted became salient and vivid almost in spite of itself the figure was at a premium and fit for any glass case that its vivacity should allow to enclose itwherein it might be surrounded by wondering admiring and often quite inevitably misconceiving observers it was not that these too werent agents in their way agents in some especial good cause without the furtherance of which we never should have done at all but they were by that very fact specialised and stiffened committed to their one attitude the immediately profitable and incapable of that play of gesture in which we recognise representation a representative a rounded figure however is as to none of its relations definable or announceable beforehand we only know it for good or for ill but with something of the throb of elation always when we see it and then it in general sufficiently accounts for itself we often for that matter insist on its being a figure we positively make it one in proportion as we seem to need itor as in other words we too acutely miss the active virtue of representation it takes some extraordinary set of circumstances or time of life i think either to beguile or to hustle us into indifference to some larger felt extension roundabout us of the worlda sphere the confines of which move on even as we ourselves move and which is always there just beyond us to twit us with the more it should have to show if we were a little more of it sufficiency shuts us in but till the man of the worldnever prefigured as i say only welcomed on the spotappears when we see at once how much we have wanted him when we fail of that acknowledgment that sense as of a tension an anxiety or an indigence relieved it is of course but that the extraordinary set of circumstances or above all the extraordinary time of life i speak of has indeed intervened  it was as a man of the world that for all his youth la farge rose or still better bowed before us his inclinations of obeisance his considerations of address being such as we had never seen and now almost publicly celebrated this was what most immediately and most iridescently showed the truth being all the while that the character took on in him particular values without which it often enough though then much more grossly flourishes it was by these enrichments of curiosity of taste and genius that he became the personality as we nowadays say that i have notedthe full freshness of all of which was to play but through his younger time or at least through our younger apprehension he was so intellectualthat was the flower it crowned his being personally so finished and launched the wealth of his cultivation the variety of his initiations the inveteracy of his forms the degree of his empressement this in itself i repeat a revelation made him with those elements of the dandy and the cavalier to which he struck us as so picturesquely sacrificing a cluster of bright promises a rare original and though not at all a direct model for simpler folk as we then could but feel ourselves an embodiment of the gospel of esthetics those more resounding forms that our age was to see this gospel take on were then still to come but i was to owe them in the later time not half the thrill that the la farge of the prime could set in motion he was really an artistic an esthetic nature of wondrous homogeneity one was to have known in the future many an unfolding that went with a larger ease and a shrewder economy but never to have seen a subtler mind or a more generously wasteful passion in other words a sincerer one addressed to the problems of the designer and painter of his long later history full of flights and drops advances and retreats experiment and performance of the endless complications of curiosity and perversity i say nothing here save that if it was to contradict none of our first impressions it was to qualify them all by others still more lively these things belonging quite to some other record yet i may just note that they were to represent in some degree an eclipse of the so essentially harmonious person round whom a positive grace of legend had originally formed itself i see him at this hour again as that bright apparition see him jacketed in black velvet or clad from top to toe in oldtime elegances of cool white and leaning much forward with his protuberant and overglazed his doubting yet allseizing vision dandle along the shining newport sands in faraway summer sunsets on a charming chestnut mare whose light legs and fine head and great sweep of tail showed the arab strainquite as if what would have been characteristic of him he had borrowed his mount from the adorable fromentin whom we already knew as a painter but whose acquaintance as a writer we were of course so promptly to owe him that when dominique broke upon us out of the revue as one of the most exquisite literary events of our time it found us doubly responsive  so at any rate he was there and there to stayintensely among us but somehow not withal of us his being a catholic and apparently a real one in spite of so many other omnisciences making perhaps by itself the greatest difference he had been through a catholic college in maryland the name of which though i am not assured of it now exhaled a sort of educational elegance but where and when he had so miraculously laid up his stores of reading and achieved his universal saturation was what we longest kept asking ourselves many of these depths i couldnt pretend to sound but it was immediate and appreciable that he revealed to us browning for instance and this oddly enough long after men and women had begun from our paris time on if i remember to lie upon our parents booktable they had not divined in us as yet an aptitude for that author whose appeal indeed john reinforced to our eyes by the reproduction of a beautiful series of illustrative drawings two or three of which he was never to surpassany more than he was to complete his highly distinguished plan for the full set not the least faded of his hundred dreams most of all he revealed to us balzac having so much to tell me of what was within that formidablyplated door in which he all expertly and insidiously played the key that to reread even after long years the introductory pages of eugénie grandet breathlessly seized and earnestly absorbed under his instruction is to see my initiators youthful face so irregular but so refined look out at me between the lines as through blurred prison bars in mérimée after the same fashion i meet his expository ghosthovering to remind me of how he started me on la vénus dille so that nothing would do but that i should translate it try to render it as lovingly as if it were a classic and old both of which things it now indeed is and send it off to the new york weekly periodical of that age of crudest categories which was to do me the honour neither of acknowledging nor printing nor clearly since translations did savingly appear there in the least understanding it these again are mild memoriesthough not differing in that respect from most of their associates yet i cherish them as ineffaceable dates sudden milestones the first distinctly noted on the road of so much inward or apprehensive life our guesti call him our guest because he was so lingeringly so abidingly and supersedingly presentbegan meanwhile to paint under our eyes with devotion with exquisite perception and above all as with the implication a hundred times beneficent and fertilising that if one didnt in these connections consistently take ones stand on supersubtlety of taste one was a helpless outsider and at the best the basest of vulgarians or flattest of fraudsa doctrine more salutary at that time in our world at large than any other that might be sounded of all of which ingenuous intensity and activity i should have been a much scanter witness than his then close condisciple my brother had not his personal kindness that of the goodnatured and amused elder youth to the enslaved the yearningly gullible younger charmed me often into a degree of participation occasions and accidents come back to me under their wash of that distilled old newport light as to which we more and more agreed that it made altogether exceptionally on our side of the world for possibility of the nuance or in other words for picture and story such for example as my felt sense of how unutterably it was the real thing the gage of a great future when i one morning found my companions of the larger the serious studio inspired to splendid performance by the beautiful young manly form of our cousin gus barker then on a vivid little dash of a visit to us and who perched on a pedestal and divested of every garment was the gayest as well as the neatest of models this was my first personal vision of the life on a pedestal and in a pose that had half gleamed and half gloomed through the chiaroscuro of our old friend haydon and i well recall the crash at the sight of all my inward emulationso forced was i to recognise on the spot that i might niggle for months over plaster casts and not come within miles of any such point of attack the bravery of my brothers own in especial dazzled me out of every presumption since nothing less than that meant drawing they were not using colour and since our genial kinsmans perfect gymnastic figure meant living truth i should certainly best testify to the whole mystery by pocketing my pencil  i secured and preserved for long williams finished rendering of the happy figurewhich was to speak for the original after his gallant death in sharper and finer accents perhaps than aught else that remained of him and it wanted but another occasion somewhat later on that of the sitting to the pair of pupils under hunts direction of a subject presented as a still larger challenge to feel that i had irrecoverably renounced very handsome were the head and shoulders of katherine temple the eldest of those albany cousins then gathered at newport under their and derivatively our aunt marys wing who afterwards was to become mrs richard emmetthe temples and the emmets being so much addicted to alliances that a still later generation was to bristle for us with a delightful emmetry each member of it a different blessing she sat with endless patience the serenest of models and w js portrait of her in oils survives as well as la farges dealing with her in another view as a really mature an almost masterly piece of painting having as has been happily suggested to me much the air of a characteristic manet such demonstrations would throw one back on regret so far as my brother was concerned if subsequent counterdemonstrations hadnt had it in them so much to check the train for myself at the hour in any case the beautiful success with kitty temple did nothing but hurry on the future just as the sight of the charming thing today not less than that of la farges profil perdu or presented ear and neck and gathered braids of hair quite as charming and quite as painted touchingly reanimates the past i say touchingly because of the remembered pang of my acceptance of an admonition so sharply conveyed therefore if somewhat later on i could still so fondly hang about in that air of productionso far at least as it enveloped our friend and particularly after his marriage and his setting up of his house at newport vivid proofs alike as seemed to us all of his consummate his raffiné taste even if we hadnt yet i think that epithet for thisit was altogether in the form of mere helpless admirer and inhaler led captive in part by the dawning perception that the arts were after all essentially one and that even with canvas and brush whisked out of my grasp i still neednt feel disinherited that was the luxury of the friend and senior with a literary sidethat if there were futilities that he didnt bring home to me he nevertheless opened more windows than he closed since he couldnt have meant nothing by causing my eyes to plunge so straight into the square and dense little formal garden of mérimée i might occasionally serve for an abundantly idle young outofdoors modelas in fact i frequently did the best perhaps of his early exhibitions of a rare coloursense even now attesting it but mightnt it become possible that mérimée would meanwhile serve for me didnt i already see as i fumbled with a pen of what the small dense formal garden might be inspiringly symbolic it was above all wonderful in the la farge of those years that even as he painted and painted very slowly and intently and belatedlyhis habit of putting back the clock and ignoring every timescheme but his own was matched only by his view of the constant timeliness of talk talk as talk for which no moment no suspended step was too odd or too fleetinghe remained as referentially and unexhaustedly bookish he turned his back by the act as little on our theory of his omniscience as he ceased to disown his job whatever it might be while endlessly burying his salient and reinforced eyes and his visibly active organ of scent in some minutest rarity of print some precious ancientry of binding mechanically plucked by the hazard of a touch from one of the shelves of a stored collection that easily passed with us for unapproached  illustration portrait in oils of miss katherine temple 1861  he lost himself on these occasions both by a natural ease and by his early adoption and application of the principle of the imperturbable which promised even from those days to govern his conduct wellnigh to the exclusion of every other we were to know surely as time went on no comparable case of consistency of attitudeno other such prompt grasp by a nature essentially entire a settled sovereign self of the truth of what would work for it most favourably should it but succeed in never yielding the first inch of any ground immense every ground thus became by its covering itself from edge to edge with the defence of his serenity which whatever his fathomless private dealings with it was never consentingly i mean publicly to suffer a grain of abatement the artists serenity by this conception was an intellectual and spiritual capital that must never brook defeatwhich it so easily might incur by a single act of abdication that was at any rate the case for the particular artist and the particular nature he felt himself armourproof as they became against the appeal of sacrifice sacrifice was fallibility and one could only of course be consistent if one inveterately had hold of the truth there was no safety or otherwise no inward serenity or even outwardthough the outward came secondlyunless there was no deflection none into the question that is of what might make for the serenity of others which was their own affair and which above all seemed not urgent in comparison with the supreme artistic it wasnt that the artist hadnt to pay to pay for the general stupidity perversity and perfidy from the moment he might have to deal with these things that was the inevitable suffering and it was always there but it could be more or less borne if one was systematically or rather if one was naturally or even better still preternaturally in the right since this meant the larger the largest serenity that account of so fine a case of inward confidence would indeed during those very first years have sinned somewhat by anticipation yet something of the beautythat is of the unmatched virtuosityof the attitude finally achieved did even at the early time colour the air of intercourse with him for those who had either few enough or many enough of their own reserves the second of these conditions sprang from a due anxiety for ones own interests more or less defined in advance and therefore as might be more or less menaced the other proviso easily went with vaguenessvagueness as to what things were ones interests seeing that the exhibited working of an esthetic and a moral confidence conjoined on that scale and at play together unhampered would perhaps prove for the time an attraction beyond any other this reflection must verily in our relation have brought about my own quietusso far as that mild ecstasy could be divorced from agitation i recall at all events less of the agitation than of the ecstasy the primary months certain aspects even of the few following years look out at me as from fine accommodations acceptances submissions emotions all melted together that one must have taken for joys of the mind and gains of the imagination so clear as to cost one practically nothing they are what i see and are all i want to see as i look back there hangs about them a charm of thrilled good faith the flush and throb of crowding apprehensions that has scarce faded and of which i can only wish to give the whole picture the benefit i bottle this imponderable extract of the loitering summers of youth when every occasion really seemed to stay to be gathered and tasted just for the sake of its faint sweetness  some time since in boston i spent an hour before a commemorative cluster of la farges earlier productions gathered in on the occasion of his death with the effect as of a plummet suddenly dropped into obscure depths long unstirred that of a remembered participation it didnt seem too much to say in the faraway difficult business of their getting themselves born these things almost all finished studies of landscape small and fond celebrations of the modest little newport harmonies the spare felicities and delicacies of a range of aspects that have ceased to appeal or to count called back into life a hundred memories laid bare the very footsteps of time light and uncertain though so often the imprint i seemed so to have been there by the projection of curiosity and sympathy if not by having literally looked in when the greater number of such effects worked themselves out that they spoke to me of my own historythrough the felt intensity of my commission as it were to speak for my old friend the terms on which he was ever ready to draw out for us the interesting hours terms of patience as they essentially were for the edified party lived again in this record but with the old supposition of profit or in other words the old sense of pleasure of precious acquisition and intenser experience more vivid than anything else there recurs to me for instance one of the smallest of adventures as tiny a thing as could incur the name and which was of the early stage of our acquaintance when he proposed to me that we should drive out to the glen some six miles off to breakfast and should afterwards paintwe paintin the bosky open air it looks at this distance a mythic time that of felt inducements to travel so far at such an hour and in a backless buggy on the supposition of rustic fare but different ages have different measures and i quite remember how ours that morning at the neat hostel in the umbrageous valley overflowed with coffee and griddlecakes that were not as other earthly refreshment and how a spell of romance rested for several hours on our invocation of the genius of the scene of such material with the help of the attuned spirit may great events consent to be composed my companion his easel and canvas his palette and stool and other accessories happily placed settled to his subject while i at a respectful distance settled to mine and to the preparation of this strange fruit of time my having kept the impression as if it really mattered it did indeed matter it was to continue to have done so and when i ask myself the reason i find this in something as rare and deep and beautiful as a passage of old poetry a scrap of old legend in the vagueness of rustling murmuring green and plashing water and woodland voices and images flitting hovering possibilities the most retained of these last of course being the chance that ones small daub for i too had my easel and panel and palette might incur appreciation by the eye of friendship this indeed was the true source of the spell that it was in the eye of friendship friendship full of character and colour and full of amusement of its own that i lived on any such occasion and that i had come forth in the morning cool and had found our breakfast at the inn a thing of ineffable savour and that i now sat and flurriedly and fearfully aspired yes the interesting ineffectual and exquisite array of the boston show smote for me most the chord of the prime questions the admirations and expectations at first so confident even that of those refinements of loyalty out of which the last and highest tribute was to spring the consideration i mean of whether our extraordinary associate neither promptly understood nor inveterately accepted might not eventually be judged such a colourist and such a poet that owners of his first felicities those very ones over which he was actually bending and with a touch so inscrutable such tonalities of his own would find themselves envied and rich i remember positively liking to see most people stupid about him and to make them out i dare say more numerously stupid than they really were this perhaps in some degree as a bright communication of his own spiritwhich discerned from so far off that of the bitterestsweet cup it was abundantly to taste and partly because the case would after that fashion only have its highest interest the highest interest the very highest it certainly couldnt fail to have and the beauty of a final poetic justice with exquisite delays the whole romance of conscious delicacy and heroic patience intervening was just what we seemed to see meanwhile stow itself expectantly away  this view of the inevitable fate of distinguished work was thus on my part as it comes before me again of early development and i admit that i should appear to antedate it hadnt i in renewed presence of each of the particular predestined objects of sacrifice i have glanced at caught myself in the very act of that invidious apprehension that fondest contemporaneity there were the charming individual things round the production of which i had so at once elatedly and resignedly circled and nothing remained at the end of time but to test the historic question was the quiet chamber of the boston museum a constitution of poetic justice long awaited and at last fully cognisantor did the event perhaps fail to give out after all the essence of our faraway forecast i think that what showed clearest or what i at any rate most sharply felt was the very difficulty of saying which fact meant of course i recognise that the story fell a little short alas of rounding itself off poetic justice when it comes i gather comes ever with a great shining so that if there is any doubt about it the source of the doubt is in the very depths of the case and has been from the first at work there it literally seems to me besides that there was more history and thereby more interest recoverable as the matter stood than if every answer to every question about it hadnt had a fine ambiguity i like ambiguities and detest great glares preferring thus for my critical no less than for my pedestrian progress the cool and the shade to the sun and dust of the way there was an exquisite effort of which i had been peculiarly sure the large canvas of the view of the paradise rocks over against newport but within the island and beyond the second beachsuch were our thin designations on the high style and the grand manner of this thing even though a little uneasy before the absence from it of a certain crânerie of touch i would have staked every grain of my grounded sensibilityin spite of which on second thoughts i shall let that faded fact and no other contention at all be my last word about it for the prevailing force within the boston walls the supreme magic anything was to distil just melted into another connection which flung a soft mantle as over the whole show it became from the question of how even a man of perceptive genius had painted what we then locally regarded as our scenery a question of how we ourselves had felt and cherished that scenery which latter of these two memories swept for me everything before it the scenery we cherishedby which i really mean i fear but four or five of ushas now been grossly and utterly sacrificed in the sense that its range was all for the pedestrian measure that to overwalk it was to love it and to love it to overwalk it and that no such relation with it as either of these appears possible or thinkable today we had the four or five of us the instinctthe very finest this must have beenof its scale and constitution the adorable wise economy with which nature had handled it and in the light of which the whole seaward and insular extension of the comparatively futile town untrodden unsuspected practically all inviolate offered a course for the long afternoon ramble more in harmony with the invocations or for that matter the evocations of youth than we most of us with appreciation so rooted were perhaps ever to know we knew already we knew then that no such range of airs would ever again be played for us on but two or three silver strings they were but two or threethe sea so often as of the isles of greece the mildly but perpetually embayed promontories of mossy rock and wasted thankless pasture bathed in a refinement of radiance and a sweetness of solitude which amounted in themselves to the highest finish and little more than the feeling with all this or rather with no more than this that possession discrimination far frequentation were ours alone and that a grassy rocky tidewashed just a bare though ever so finegrained toned and tinted breast of nature and field of fancy stretched for us to the low horizons furthest rim the vast regionit struck us then as vastwas practically roadless but this far from making it a desert made it a kind of boundless empty carpeted saloon it comes back to me that nobody in those days walked nobody but the three or four of usor indeed i should say if pushed the single pair in particular of whom i was one and the other thomas sargeant perry superexcellent and allreading allengulfing friend of those days and still sole survivor of these i thus found deeply consecrated that love of the long again and again of the very longest possible walk which was to see me year after year through so many of the twists and past so many of the threatened blocks of lifes road and which during the early and american period was to make me lone and perverse even in my own sight so little was it ever given me then wherever i scanned the view to descry a fellowpedestrian the pedestrians came to succumb altogether at newport to this virtual challenge of their strange agitationby the circumstance that is of their being offered at last to importunity the vulgar road under the invasion of which the old rich alternative miserably dwindled     v   nothing meanwhile could have been less logical yet at the same time more natural than that williams interest in the practice of painting should have suddenly and abruptly ceased a turn of our affair attended however with no shade of commotion no repining at proved waste with as little of any confessed ruefulness of mistake on one side as of any elation of wisdom any resonance of the ready i told you so on the other the one side would have been with a different tone about the matter and a different domestic habit than ours that of my brothers awkwardness accompanying whatever intelligence of disavowal and the other been our fathers not unemphatic return to the point that his doubts those originally and confidently intimated had been justified by the fact tempting doubtless in a heavier household air the opportunity on the latters part to recall that if he had perfectly recognised his sons probable progress to a pitch of excellence he had exactly not granted that an attainment of this pitch was likely in the least however uncontested to satisfy the nature concerned the foregone conclusion having all the while been that such a spirit was competent to something larger and less superficially calculable something more expressive of its true inwardness this was not the way in which things happened among us for i really think the committed mistake was ever discriminated againstcertainly by the head of the familyonly to the extent of its acquiring even if but speedily again to fade an interest greater than was obtainable by the too obvious success i am not sure indeed that the kind of personal history most appealing to my father would not have been some kind that should fairly proceed by mistakes mistakes more human more associational less angular less hard for others that is less exemplary for them since righteousness as mostly understood was in our parents view i think the cruellest thing in the world than straight and smug and declared felicities the qualification here i allow would be in his scant measure of the difference after all for the life of the soul between the marked achievement and the marked shortcoming he had a manner of his own of appreciating failure or of not at least piously rejoicing in displayed moral intellectual or even material economies which had it not been that his humanity his generosity and for the most part his gaiety were always at the worst consistent might sometimes have left us with our small savings our little exhibitions and complacencies rather on our hands as the case stood i find myself thinking of our life in those years as profiting greatly for animation and curiosity by the interest he shed for us on the whole side of the human scene usually held least interestingthe element the appearance of waste which plays there such a part and into which he could read under provocation so much character and colour and charm so many implications of the fine and the worthy that since the art of missing or of failing or of otherwise going astray did after all in his hands escape becoming either a matter of real example or of absolute precept enlarged not a little our field and our categories of appreciation and perception i recover as i look back on all this the sense as of an extraordinary young confidence our common support in our coming round together through the immense lubrication of his expressed thought often perhaps extravagantly working and playing to plenty of unbewildered rightness a state of comfort that would always servewhether after strange openings into a sphere where nothing practical mattered or after even still quainter closings in upon us of unexpected importances and values which means to my memory that we breathed somehow an air in which waste for us at least couldnt and didnt live so certain were aberrations and discussions adventures excursions and alarms of whatever sort to wind up in a transformation scene or if the term be not profane happy harlequinade a figuration of each involved issue and item before the footlights of a familiar idealism the most socialised and ironised the most amusedly generalised that possibly could be  such an atmosphere was taking one of its elements with another doubtless delightful yet if it was friendly to the suggested or imagined thing it promoted among us much less directly as i have already hinted the act of choicechoice as to the career for example with a view of the usual proceedings thereupon consequent i marvel at the manner in which the door appears to have been held or at least left open to us for experiment though with a tendency to close the oddest yet most inveterately perceptible movement in that sense before any very earnest proposition in particular i have no remembrance at all of marked prejudices on our fathers part but i recall repeated cases in his attitude to our young affairs of a disparagement suggested as by stirred memories of his own the instance most present to me being his extreme tepidity in the matter of williams or in fact of my going on our then american basis to college i make out in him and at the time made out a great revulsion of spirit from that incurred experience in his own history a revulsion i think moreover quite independent of any particular or instrinsic attributes of the seat of learning involved in it union college schenectady new york the scene of his personal experiment and the natural resort in his youth of comparatively adjacent albanians might easily have offered at that time no very rare opportunitiesfew were the american country colleges that then had such to offer but when after years the question arose for his sons he saw it in i scarce know what light of associational or subjective dislike he had the disadvantageunless indeed it was much more we who had itof his having after many changes and detachments ceased to believe in the schenectady resource or to revert to it sentimentally without his forming on the other hand with his boys to place any fonder presumption or preference there comes out to me much bedimmed but recognisable the image of a day of extreme youth on which during a stay with our grandmother at albany we achieved william and i with some confused and heated railway effort a pious pilgrimage to the small scholastic citypious by reason i clearly remember of a lively persuasion on my brothers part that to union college at some indefinite future time we should both most naturally and delightedly repair we invoked i gather among its scattered shades fairly vague to me now the loyalty that our parent appeared to have dropped by the wayeven though our attitude about it can scarce have been prematurely contentious the whole vision is at any rate today bathed and blurred for me in the air of some charmed and beguiled dream that of the flushed good faith of an hour of crude castlebuilding we were helped to build on the spot by an older friend much older as i remember him even than my brother already a member of the college and as it seemed greatly enjoying his life and those society badges and trinkets with which he reappears to me as bristling and twinkling quite to the extinction of his particular identity this is lost like everything else in the mere golden haze of the little oldtime autumn adventure wondrous to our sensibility may well have been the october glamourif october it was and if it was not it ought to have beenof that big brave region of the great state over which the shade of fenimore coopers mohawks and mohicans if this be not a pleonasm might still have been felt to hang the castle we had built however crumbledthere were plenty of others awaiting erection these too successively had their hour but i neednt at this time stoop to pick up their pieces i see moreover vividly enough how it might have been that at this stage our parents were left cold by the various appeal in our interest of columbia harvard and yale hard by at providence in the newport time was also brown but i recover no connection in which that mystic syllable swept our sky as a name to conjure with our largest licence somehow didnt stray toward brown it was to the same tune not conceivable that we should have been restored for educational purposes to the swollen city the new york of our childhood where we had then so tumbled in and out of school as to exhaust the measure or as at least greatly to deflower the image of our teachability on that ground yale off our beat from every point of view was as little to be thought of and there was moreover in our fathers imagination no grain of susceptibility to what might have been on the general ground socially expected even harvard clearlyand it was perhaps a trifle oddmoved him in our interest as little as schenectady could do so that for authority the voice of social expectation would have had to sound with an art or an accent of which it had by no means up to that time learned roundabout us the trick this indeed it comes to saying is something that so far as our parents were concerned it would never have learned they were from other preoccupations unaware of any such pressure and to become aware would i think primarily have been for them to find it out of all proportion to the general pitch of prescription we were not at that time when it came to such claims in presence of persuasive much less of impressive social forms and precedentsat least those of us of the liberated mind and the really more curious culture were not the more curious culture only to be known by the positive taste of it was nowhere in the air nowhere seated or embodied  which reflections as i perhaps too loosely gather them in refresh at any rate my sense of how we in particular of our fathers house actually profited more than we lost if the more curious culture was in question by the degree to which we were afloat and disconnected since there were at least luxuries of the spirit in this quite as much as drawbacksgiven a social order so far as it was an order that found its main ideal in a strict attention to business that is to buying and selling over a counter or a desk and in such an intensity of the traffic as made on the part of all involved for close localisation to attend strictly to business was to be invariably there on a certain spot in a certain place just as to be nowhere in particular to have to be nowhere told the queer tale of a lack or of a forfeiture or possibly even of a state of intrinsic unworthiness i have already expressed how few of these elements of the background we ourselves had ever had either to add to or to subtract from and how this of itself did after a fashion place us in the small newport colony of the despoiled and disillusioned the mildly the reminiscentially desperate as easy as might be for the time i have also noted was our footing there but i have not for myself forgotten or even now outlived the particular shade of satisfaction to be taken in ones thus being in new england without being of it to have originally been of it or still to have had to be affected me i recall as a case i should have regrettedunless it be more exact to say that i thought of the condition as a danger after all escaped long would it take to tell why it figured as a danger and why that impression was during the several following years much more to gain than to lose intensity the question was to fall into the rear indeed with ever so many such secondary others during the war and for reasons effective enough but it was afterwards to know a luxury of emergencethis i mean while one still cared in general as one was sooner or later to stop caring infinitely interesting to recover in the history of a mind for those concerned these movements of the spirit these tides and currents of growththough under the inconvenience for the historian of such ramifications of research that here at any rate i feel myself warned off there appeared to us at newport the most interesting much of the albany male cousins william james templecoming oddly enough first from yale and then from harvard so that by contact and example the practicability of a like experience might have been and doubtless was put well before us will temple as we were in his short life too scantly to know him had made so luckless even if so lively a start under one alma mater that the appeal to a fresh parentship altogether appears to have been judged the best remedy for his case he entered harvard jumping if i mistake not a couple of years of the undergraduate curriculum and my personal memory of these reappearances is a mere recapture of admiration of prostration before him the dazzled state under his striking good looks and his manly charm was the common state so that i disengage from it no presumption of a particular plea playing in our own domestic air for his temporary cambridge setting he was so much too radiant and gallant and personal too much a character and a figure a splendid importance in himself to owe the least glamour to settings an advantage that might have seemed rather to be shed on whatever scene by himself in consenting to light it up he made all life for the hour a foreground and one that we none of us would have quitted for a moment while he was there  in that form at least i see him and no revival of those years so puts to me the interesting question so often aimlessly returned upon in later life of the amount of truth in this or that case of young confidence in a glory to comefor another than ones self of the likelihood of the wonders so flatteringly forecast many of our estimates were monstrous magnificationsthough doing us even at that more good than harm so that one isnt even sure that the happiest histories were to have been those of the least liberal mistakes i like at any rate to think of our easy overstrainingsthe possible flaw in many of which was not indeed to be put to the proof that was the case for the general and for every particular impression of will temple thanks to his early death in battleat chancellorsville 1863 he having among the quickened forces of the time and his fathers record helping him leaped to a captaincy in the regular army but i cling to the idea that the siftings and sortings of life had he remained subject to them would still have left him the lustre that blinds and subdues i even do more at this hour i ask myself while his appearance and my personal feeling about it live for me again what possible aftertime could have kept up the pitch of my sentimentaftertime either of his or of mine blest beyond others i think as we look back the admirations even the fondest and which indeed were not of their nature fond that were not to know to their cost the inevitable test or strain they are almost the only ones of the true high pitch that without broken edges or other tatters to show fold themselves away entire and secure even as rare lengths of precious old stuff in the scented chest of our savings so great misadventure have too often known at all events certain of those that were to come to trial the others are the residual those we must keep when we can so to be sure at least of a few sacrificing as many possible mistakes and misproportions as need be to pay but for two or three of them there could be no mistake about gus barker who threw himself into the fray that is into the cavalry saddle as he might into a match at baseball football being then undreamt of and my last reminiscence of whom is the sight of him on a brief leave for a farewell to his harvard classmates after he had got his commission crossing with two or three companions the expanse of harvard square that faced the old law school of which i found myself for that year 186263 a singularly alien member i was afterwards sharply to regret the accident by which i on that occasion missed speech of him but my present vision of his charming latent agility which any motion showed of his brightcoloured wagging head and of the large gaiety of the young smile that made his handsome teeth shine out is after all the years but the more happily uneffaced the point of all which connections however is that they somehow managed to make in the parental view no straight links for us with the matterofcourse of college there were accidents too by the aid of which they failed of this the more easily it comes to me that for my own part i thought of william at the time as having or rather as so much more than having already graduated the effect of contact with his mind and talk with the free play of his spirit and the irrepressible brush of his humour couldnt have been greater had he carried off fifty honours i felt in him such authority so perpetually quickened a state of intellect and character that the detail or the literal side of the question never so much as came up for me i must have made out that to plenty of graduates or of the graduating nothing in the nature of such appearances attached i think of our father moreover as no less affected by a like impression so extremely so immensely disposed do i see him to generalise his eldest sons gifts as by the largest fondest synthesis and not so much proceed upon them in any one direction as proceed from them as it were in all  little as such a view might have lent itself to application my brothers searching discovery during the summer of 1861 that his vocation was not after all in the least satisfyingly for art took on as a prompt sequel the recognition that it was quite positively and before everything for science physical science strenuous science in all its exactitude with the opportunity again forthcoming to put his freshness of faith to the test i had presumed to rejoice before at his adoption of the studio life that offering as well possible contacts for myself and yet i recall no pang for his tergiversation there being nothing he mightnt have done at this or at any other moment that i shouldnt have felt as inevitable and found in my sense of his previous age some happy and striking symptom or pledge of as certain as that he had been all the while artistic did it thus appear that he had been at the same time quite otherwise inquiring tooaddicted to experiments and the consumption of chemicals the transfusion of mysterious liquids from glass to glass under exposure to lambent flame the cultivation of stained fingers the establishment and the transport in our wanderings of galvanic batteries the administration to all he could persuade of electric shocks the maintenance of marine animals in splashy aquaria the practice of photography in the room i for a while shared with him at boulogne with every stern reality of big cumbrous camera prolonged exposure exposure mostly of myself darkened development also interminable and ubiquitous brown blot then there had been also the constant as i fearfully felt it the finely speculative and boldly disinterested absorption of curious drugs no livelier remembrance have i of our early years together than this inveteracy often appalling to a nature so incurious as mine in that direction of his interest in the queer or the incalculable effects of things there was apparently for him no possible effect whatever that mightnt be more or less rejoiced in as suchall exclusive of its relation to other things than merely knowing there recurs to me withal the shamelessness of my own indifferenceat which i also none the less i think wondered a little as if by so much as it hadnt been given me to care for visibly provoked or engineered phenomena by that same amount was i open to those of the mysteriously or insidiously aggressive the ambushed or suffered sort vivid to me in any case is still the sense of how quite shiningly light as an activity and an appeal he had seemed to make everything he gave himself to so that at first until the freshness of it failed he flung this iridescent mantle of interest over the then so grey and scant little scene of the harvard the lawrence scientific school where in the course of the months i had had a glimpse or two of him at work early in the autumn of 1861 he went up from newport to cambridge to enter that institution in which thin current rather than in the ostensibly more ample began to flow his long connection with harvard gathering in time so many affluents his letters from cambridge during the next couple of years many of them before me now breathe i think all the experience the conditions could have begotten at the best they mark the beginning of those vivacities and varieties of intellectual and moral reaction which were for the rest of his life to be the more immeasurably candid and vivid the more numerous above all and the more interesting and amusing the closer view one had of him that of a certainty yet these familiar pages of youth testify most of all for me perhaps to the forces of amenity and spontaneity the happy working of all relations in our family life in such parts of them as i may cite this will shine sufficiently throughand i shall take for granted thus the interest of small matters that have perhaps but that reflected light to show it is in a letter to myself of that september dated drear and chill abode that he appears to have celebrated the first steps of his initiation  sweet was your letter and grateful to my eyes i had gone in a mechanical way to the po not hoping for anything though on espère alors quon désespère toujours and finding nothing was turning heavily away when a youth modestly tapped me and holding out an envelope inscribed in your wellknown character said mr j this was in our box twas the young pascoe the joy of his motherbut the graphic account i read in the letter he gave me of the sorrow of my mother almost made me shed tears on the floor of the po not that on reflection i should dream for reflection shows me a future in which she shall regard my vacation visits as on the whole rather troublesome than otherwise or at least when she shall feel herself as blest in the trouble i spare her when absent as in the glow of pride and happiness she feels at the sight of me when present but she neednt fear i can ever think of her when absent with such equanimity i oughtnt to joke on such a serious subject as bobby would say though for i have had several pangs since being here at the thought of all i have left behind at newportespecially gushes of feeling about the place i havent for one minute had the feeling of being at home here something in my quarters precludes the possibility of it though what this is i dont suppose i can describe to you  as i write now even writing itself being a cosy cheerfullooking amusement and an argand gasburner with a neat green shade merrily singing beside me i still feel unsettled i write on a round table in the middle of the room with a fearful red and black cloth before me i see another suchcovered table of oblong shape against the wall capped by a cheap lookingglass and flanked by two windows curtainless and bleak whose shades of linen flout the air as the sportive wind impels them to the left are two other such windows with a horsehair sofa between them and at my back a fifth window and a vast wooden mantelpiece with nothing to relieve its nakedness but a large cast much plumbagod of a bust of franklin on my right the bookcase imposing and respectable with its empty drawers and with my little array of printed wisdom covering nearly one of the shelves i hear the people breathe as they go past in the street and the roll and jar of the horsecars is terrific i have accordingly engaged the other room from mrs pascoe with the little sleepingroom upstairs it looks infinitely more cheerful than this and if i dont find the grate sufficient i can easily have a franklin stove put up but she says the grate will make an oven of it john ropes i met the other day at harry quincys room and was very much pleased with him dont fail to send on will temples letters to him and to herbert mason which i left in one of the librarys mantelpiece jars to use the portuguese idiom storrow higginson has been very kind to me making enquiries about tables etc we went together this morning to the house of the curator of the gray collection of engravings which is solemnly to unfold its glories to me tomorrow he is a most serious stately german gentleman mr thies by name fully sensible of the deep vital importance of his treasures and evidently thinking a visit to them a great affairto me had i known how great how tremendous and formal i hardly think i should have ventured to call tom ward pays me a visit almost every evening poor tom seems acold too his deafness keeps him from making acquaintances professor eliot at the school is a fine fellow i suspect a man who if he resolves to do a thing wont be prevented i find analysis very interesting so far the library has a readingroom where they take all the magazines so i shant want for the rev des 2 m i remain with unalterable sentiments of devotion ever my dear h your big brother bill  this record of further impressions closely and copiously followed       your

agassiz lecture 12 lectures on methods in nat hist so that i      will only tell you that i am very well and my spirits just getting      good miss uphams table is much pleasanter than the other

till      you get tired and get all the rest of them to kiss you till you      cry hold enough       this morning as i was busy over the 10th page of a letter to wilky      in he popped and made my labour of no account i had intended to go      and see him yesterday but found edward emerson and tom ward were      going and so thought he would have too much of a good thing but      he walked over this morning with or rather without them for he      went astray and arrived very hot and dusty i gave him a bath and      took him to dinner and he is now gone to see andrew robeson and e      e his plump corpusculus looks as always i write in my new parlour      whither i moved yesterday you have no idea what an improvement it      is on the old affairworth double the cost and the little bedroom

monotonous but plain and wellarranged and nourris      eliot i have not seen much more of i dont believe he is a very      accomplished chemist but cant tell yet we are only about 12 in      the laboratory so that we have a very cosy time i expect to have      a winter of crowded life i can be as independent as i please      and want to live regardless of the good or bad opinion of every      one i shall have a splendid chance to try i know and i know too      that the native hue of resolution has never been of very great      shade in me hitherto i am sure that that feeling is a right one      and i mean to live according to it if i can if i do so i think i      shall turn out all right       i stopped this letter before tea when wilky the rosygilled and      frank higginson came in i now resume it by the light of a taper      and that of the moon wilky read hs letter and amused me metch      by his naive interpretation of mothers most rational request that      i should keep a memorandum of all moneys i receive from father      he thought it was that she might know exactly what sums her      prodigal philosopher really gives out and that mistrust of his      generosity caused it the phrase has a little sound that way as h      subtly framed it i confess       the first few days the first week here i really didnt know what      to do with myself or how to fill my time i felt as if turned out      of doors i then received hs and mothers letters never before      did i know what mystic depths of rapture lay concealed within that      familiar word never did the same being look so like two different      ones as i going in and out of the po if i bring a letter with me      gloomily with despair written on my leaden brow i stalk the street      along towards the po women children and students involuntarily      shrinking against the wall as i passthus4 as if the curse of      cain were stamped upon my front but when i come out with a letter      an immense concourse of people generally attends me to my lodging      attracted by my excited wild gestures and look  christmas being sparely kept in the new england of those days william passed that of 1861 as a cambridge letter of the afternoon indicates without opportunity for a seasonable dash to newport but with such compensations nearer at hand as are here exhibited our brother wilky i should premise had been placed with the youngest of us bob for companion at the coeducational school then but a short time previously established by mr f b sanborn at concord massachusettsand of which there will be more to say tom ward already mentioned and who having left the concord school shortly before had just entered harvard was quickly to become williams intimate approved and trusted friend the diversion of whose patient originality whose intellectual independence ability and curiosity from science and free inquiry to hereditary bankingconsequent on the position of the paternal samuel gray ward as the representative for many years in the united states of the house of baring brothershe from the first much regretted the more pertinently doubtless that this companion was of a family connected with ours through an intermarriage gus barker as mrs s g wards nephew being toms first cousin as well as ours and such links still counting in that age of comparatively less developed ramifications when sympathy and intercourse kept pace as it was kept between our pairs of parents  illustration a leaf from the letter quoted on page 129       i have been in boston the whole blest morning toted round by the      wards who had as usual asked me to dine with them i had happily      provided myself with an engagement here for all such emergencies      but as is my sportive wont i befooled tom with divers answers      and finally let him believe i would come having refused several      dazzling chances for the purpose supposing of course i should see      him here yesterday at miss uphams board and disabuse him but the      young viper went home right after breakfastso i had to go into      boston this morning and explain wilky had come up from concord to      dine in said commonwealth avenue and i as it turned out found      myself in for following the innocent lamb lily up and down the town      for two hours to hold bundles and ring bells for her wilky and      tom having vanished from the scene clear sharp cold morning      thermometer 5 degrees at sunrise and the streets covered with one      glare of ice i had thick smooth shoes and went sliding off like an      avalanche every three steps while she having indiarubbers and      being a bostonian went ahead like a swan i had among other things      to keep her bundles from harm to wipe away every three minutes the      trembling jewel with which the cold would with persistent      kindness ornament my coral nose to keep a hypocritic watchful eye      on her movements lest she fall to raise my hat gracefully to more      and more of her acquaintances every block to skate round and round      embracing lampposts and doorscrapers by the score to keep from      falling as well as to avoid serving old ladypromenaders in the      same way to cut capers 4 feet high at the rate of 20 a second      every now and then for the same purpose to keep from scooting      off down hills and round corners as fast as my ablebodied      companion often to do all these at once and then fall licketybang      like a chandelier but when so to preserve an expression of      placid beatitude or easy nonchalance despite the raging fiend      within oh it beggars description when finally it was over and i      stood alone i shook my companions dust from my feet and biting my      beard with rage sware a mighty oath unto high heaven that i would      never while reason held her throne in this distracted orb never      never by word look or gesture and this without mental      reservation acknowledge a young lady as a human being the false      and rotten spawn might die before i would wink to save it no more      parties nowat last i am a man etc etc       my enthusiasm ran very high for a few minutes but i suddenly saw      that i was a great ass and became sobered instantly so that on the      whole i am better for the circumstance being a sadder and a wiser      man i also went to the tappans and gave the children slight      presents then coming home to my venal board behaved very      considerately and paternally to a young lady who sat next to me      but with a shade of subdued melancholy in my manner which could not      have been noticed at the breakfasttable many times and bitterly      today have i thought of home and lamented that i should have to be      away at this merry christmastide from my rare family wondering      with wilky if they were missing us as we miss them and now as i      sit in the light of my kerosene with the fire quietly consuming in      the grate and the twilight on the snow outside and the melancholy      oldfashioned strains of the piano dimly rising from below i see      in vision those at home just going in to dinner my aged silvered      mother leaning on the arm of her stalwart yet flexible h merry      and garrulous as ever my blushing aunt with her old wild beauty      still hanging about her my modest father with his rippling raven      locks the genial auld rob and the mysterious alice all rise      before me a glorified throng but two other forms one tall      intellectual swarthy with curved nose and eagle eye the other      having breadth rather than depth but a goodly morsel too are      wanting to complete the harmonious whole eftsoons they vanish and      i am again alone alonewhat pathos in the word i have two      companions though most all the timeremorse and despair t s      perry took their place for a little and today they have not come      back t s seemed to enjoy his visit very much it was very      pleasant for me to have him his rustic wonder at the commonest      sights was most ludicrous and his conversation most amusing and      instructive       the place here improves to me as i go on living in it and if i      study with agassiz 4 or 5 years there is nothing i should like      better than to have you all with me regular and comfortable i      enclose another advertisement of a housebut which would be too      small for us i believe though it might be looked at i had a long      talk with one of as students the other night and saw for the      first time how a naturalist may feel about his trade exactly as an      artist does about his for instance agassiz would rather take      wholly uninstructed peoplefor he has to unteach them all they      have learnt he doesnt let them so much as look into a book for a      long while what they learn they must learn for themselves and be      masters of it all the consequence is he makes naturalists of      themdoesnt merely cram them and this student he had been there      2 years said he felt ready to go anywhere in the world now with      nothing but his notebook and study out anything quite alone a      must be a great teacher chemistry comes on tolerably but not so      fast as i expected i am pretty slow with my substances having      done but 12 since thanksgiving and having 38 more to do before the      end of the term  comment on the abundance the gaiety and drollery the generous play of vision and fancy in all this would seem so needless as to be almost officious were not the commentator constantly were he not infinitely arrested and reminded and solicited which is at once his advantage and his embarrassment such a letter at all events read over with the general key touches its contemporary scene and hour into an intensity of life for him making indeed the great sign of that life my brothers signal vivacity and cordiality his endless spontaneity of mind every thing in it is characteristic of the genius and expressive of the mood and not least of course the pleasantry of paradox the evocation of each familiar image by its vivid opposite our mother eg was not at that time nor for a good while yet so venerably silvered our handsomeheaded father had lost occipitally long before all pretence to raven locks certainly to the effect of their rippling the beauty of our admirable aunt was as happily alien either to wildness or to the hanging air as it could very well be the mystery of our young sister consisted all in the candour of her natural bloom even if at the same time of her lively intelligence and hs mirth and garrulity appear to have represented for the writer the veriest ironic translation of something in that youth i judge not a little mildlythough oh so mildlymorose or anxiously mute to the same tune the aquiline in his own nose heroically derides the slightly relaxed line of that feature and our brother wilkys want of physical depth is a glance at a different proportion of a like tinge of pleasantry i may add is the imputation of the provincial gape to our friend t s perry of newport birth and unintermitted breeding with whom we were to live so much in the years to come and who was then on the eve of entering harvardhis face already uninterruptedly turned to that love of letters that practice of them by dauntless and inordinate though never at all vulgarly resonant absorption which was to constitute in itself the most disinterested of careers i had myself felt him from the first an exemplary at once and a discouraging friend he had let himself loose in the world of books pressed and roamed through the most various literatures and the most voluminous authors with a stride that as it carried him beyond all view left me dismayed and helpless at the edge of the forest where i listened wistfully but unemulously to the faroff crash from within of his felled timber the clearing of whole spaces or periods shelf by shelf or great tree by tree the brotherinlaw of john la farge he had for us further with that reviving consciousness of american annals which the war was at once so rudely and so insidiously to quicken in us the glamour of his straight descent from the commodores perry of the lake erie in the war of 1812 respectively and of the portentous penetration of japan just after the midcentury and his longerdrawn but equally direct and so clean and comfortable affiliation to the great benjamin franklin as these things at least seemed to me under my habit too musing and brooding certainly to have made for light loquacity of pressing every windborne particle of personal historyonce the persons were only other enough from myselfinto the service of what i would fain have called picture or less explicitly less formulatedly romance  these however are but too fond insistences and what mainly bears pointing out is my brothers already restless reach forth to some new subject of study he had but lately addressed himself not without confidence to such an investigation of chemistry as he might become conscious of a warrant for yet the appeal of agassizs great authority so much in the air of the cambridge of that time found him at once responsive it opened up a world the world of sentient life in the light of which chemistry faded he had not however for the moment done with it and what i at any rate find most to the point in the pages before me is the charm of their so witnessing to the geniality and harmony of our family life exquisite as i look back on it and reflected almost as much in any one passage taken at hazard as in any other he had apparently at the date of the following changed his lodging       president feltons death has been the great event of the weektwo      funerals and i dont know how many prayers and sermons today i      thought i would go to university chapel for the sake of variety and      hear dr peabodys final word on himand a very long and      lugubrious one it was the prayer was a prolonged moan in which the      death not in its consequences but in itself was treated as a      great calamity and the whole eulogy was almost ridiculously      overcharged what was most disagreeable throughout was the wailing      tones not a bit that of simple pagan grief at the losswhich      would have been honest but a whine consciously put on as from a      sense of duty and a whine at nothing definite either only a      purposeless clothing of all his words in tears the whole style of      the performance was such that i have concluded to have nothing more

   with the smoking of my stove which went on all the first two days      that has been stopped however and the only trouble is now to get      the fire alight at all i have generally to start it 3 or 4 times      and the removal of the material of each failure from the grate is a      fearful business i have also to descend to the cellar myself to      get my coal and my hod as ma sweetser my landlady calls it      not being very much bigger than a milkpitcher doesnt add to the      charm the coal is apt to drop on the stairs and i have to pick it      all up at present the stove fills the room with a nephitic and      pestilential gas so that i have to keep the window open i went      last night with the tweedys to the concert for which they came up      and with them this morning to hear wendell phillips this sweetser      family is worthy of dickens it consists of a mr and miss s mr      ss three gushing girls a parrot and a maniac the maniac is very      obstreperous her husband left her boarding here 3 months ago and      went to cuba when she got mad he was written to but has sent no      reply and they are keeping her for the aunts sake i keep my      drawer locked against her at night old sweetser is a riddle i hope      to do justice to at some future time but cant begin on now his      sister shakes like an aspen whenever she is spoken to oh i forgot      the most important character of all the black wench who does the      room she is about 20 years old and wears short frocks but talks      like alice robeson and has an antediluvian face about as large as      the top of a flourbarrel  i can really keep my hand from nothing of whatever connection that causes his intensity of animation and spontaneity of expression to revive on a sunday evening early in 1862 he had       just returned from milton and after removing from my person a      beetle sit down to write you immediately ever since 1030 this      am the beetle sest promené à lenvi sur ma peau the first      feeling i had of his becoming attached to it made me jump so as to      scare an old lady opposite me in the car into fits finding him too      hard to crush i let him run and at last got used to him though at      times he tickled me to excruciation i ache in every limb and every      cranny of my mind from my visit they had the usual number of      stories wonderful and not wonderful to tell of their friends and      relatives of stephen somebody eg who had a waggon weighing      several tons run over his chest without even bruising him and so      on they are very nice girls indeed all the same i then went      near by to the forbess in a state of profuse perspiration and      saw handsome mrs f and her daughters and a substitute for      governor andrew in the person of his wife after which i returned      here being driven back in the car as i perceived on the front      platform by our old familiarfamiliar indeedfriend william i      mean our irish excoachman whom age doesnt seem to render more      veracious as he told me several very big stories about himself      how he smashed a car to pieces the other night how he first gave      the alarm of the great fire etc       i went to the theatre the other night and asking a gentleman to      make room for me found him to be bob temple who had arrived in      boston that day he looks very well and talks in the most      extraordinary way you ever heard about slavery and the wickedness      of human society and is apparently very sincere he sailed for      europe on wednesday i exhorted him to stop over at newport but he      wouldnt there was something quite peculiar about himhe seemed      greatly changed i can tell you more at home but wish i might have      seen more of him i have been the last three nights running to hear      john wilkes booth the young american roscius rant rant rant      of the most fearful kind the worst parts most applauded but with      any amount of fire and energy in the passionate parts in some of      which he really becomes natural you dont know what a regular      sévigné you have in alice i blush for my delinquencies toward her      but bow my head with meek humility contented to be her debtor all      my life and despairing of ever repaying her the value of her      letters mother and aunt i pine to see and the honest jack tar of      the family the rough bob with his rude untutored ways  traps for remembrance i find set at every turn here so that i have either to dodge them or patiently to suffer catching i try in vain for instance merely to brush past the image of our kinsman robert temple the younger who made with his brother will the eldest pair in that house of cousins he waylays he persuades me too much and to fail of the few right words for him would be to leave a deep debt unrepaidhis fitful hovering presence repeatedly vivid and repeatedly obscured so considerably counted for us pointing the sharpest moral pointing fifty morals and adorning a perpetual tale he was for years first on the nearer and then little by little on the further the furthest horizon quite the most emphasised of all our wastrels the figure bristling most with every irregular accent that we were to find ourselves in any closeness of relation with i held him for myself at least from far back a pure gift of freehanded chance to the grateful imagination the utmost limit of whose complaint of it could be but for the difficulty of rendering him the really proper tribute i regarded him truly for a long time as a possession of the mind the human image swung before us with most of the effect of strong and thick and inimitable colour if to be orphaned and free of range had affected my young fancy as the happy that is the romantic lot no member of the whole cousinship favoured in that sense as so many of them were enjoyed so by my making out the highest privilege of the case nothing i could afterwards easily see had been less inevitable and of a greater awkwardness of accident than his being soon after the death of his parents shipped off from albany in pursuit of an education to an unheardof school in a remote corner of scotland which fact it was however that played for me exactly the bright part of preparing to show with particular intensity what europe again with the opportunity so given was going to proceed to it thus shone out when after the lapse of several years he recurred to our more competent view that quite richly erratic creature as he might appear and to whatever degree of wonder and suspense of amusement and amazement he might wind us up the rich alien influence full of special queernesses and mysteries in this special connection had complacently turned him out for us and had ever so irretrievably and ineffaceably stamped him he rose before us tall and goodlooking and easy as a figure of an oddly civilised perversity his irreverent challenging humour playing at once without mercy over american aspects seemed somehow not less cultivated than profanejust which note in itself caused the plot beautifully to thicken for this was to distinguish and almost embellish him throughout a long career in which he was to neglect no occasion however frankly forbidding for graceless adventure that he had the pure derisive the loose and mocking mind yet initiated educated almost elegantly impudent in other words successfully impertinent and which expressed itself in particular by the pen with a literary lightness that we used to find inimitable he had dangled there further off and nearer as a character to my attention in the sense in which people in books were characters and other people roundabout us were somehow not so that i fairly thought of him though this more doubtless with the lapse of time very much as if we had owed him to thackeray or dickens the creators of superior life to whom we were at that time always owing most rather than to any set of circumstances by which we had in our own persons felt served that he was inimitable inimitably droll inimitably wasted wanton impossible or whatever else it might be making him thus one with the rounded and represented creature shining in the light of art as distinguished from the vague handful of more or less susceptible material that had in the common air to pass for a true concretion the promise of this had been to my original vision in every windborne echo of him however light i doubtless put people into books by very much the same turn of the hand with which i took them out but it had tinged itself with the finely free that proceeding in due course from his school at fochabers to the university of aberdeen each sound and syllable of this general far cry from albany had in itself an incoherence he had encountered while there the oddest of all occasions to embrace the romish faith in the same way it ministered to the vivid even if baffled view of him that he appeared then to have retreated upon the impenetrable stronghold of nairn described by him as a bleak little scotch wateringplace which yet sufficed to his cluster of predicaments whence he began to address to his bewildered pair of albany guardians and trustees the earlier of that series of incomparably amusing letters as we judged them the arrival of almost any one of which among us out of the midst of indocilities at once more and more horrific and more and more reported with a desperate drollery was to constitute an event so supremely beguiling that distressful meanings and expensive remedies found themselves alike salved to consciousness by the fact that such compositions could only be for people of taste enjoyable i think of this hapless kinsman throughout as blest with a form that appealed to the finer fibres of appreciation so that variously misadventurous as he was ever to continue his genius for expression again and again just saved himsaved him for bare life left in his hand a broken piece of the effective magic wand never perhaps waved with anything like that easy grace in an equally compromised interest  it was at any rate as if i had from the first collected and saved up the echoesor so at least it seems to me now echoes of him as all sarcastically and incorrigibly mutinous somewhat later on while in nominal charge of a despairing pasteur at neuchâtelfollowed by the intensified sense of him after i scarce remember quite what interval on his appearing at newport where his sisters as i have mentioned had been protectively gathered in during the year more or less that followed our own installation there then it was that we had the value of his being interesting with less trouble taken to that endin proportion to the effect achievedthan perhaps ever served such a cause it would perhaps scarce even be too much to say that as the only trouble he seemed capable of was the trouble of quite positively declining to interest on any terms his essential dickensism as i have called it or his thackerayan tint if preferred his comedyvirtue in fine which he could neither disown nor practically speaking misapply was stronger even than his particular sardonic cynicism strongly as that was at last to flower i wont in the least say he dazzledthat was reserved for his so quite otherwise brilliant his temporarily triumphant younger brother at whom i have already glanced who was on no possible terms with him and never could have been so that the difficulty of their relation glimmers upon me as probably half the good reason for the original queer despatch of the elder to about the remotest the most separating point in space at which educational advantages could be conceived as awaiting him i must have had no need by that time to be dazzled or even to be charmed in order more or less fondly often indeed doubtless fearfully to apprehend what i apprehended being that here was a creature quite amusedly and perceptively quite attentively and after a fashion profitably living without a single one of the elements of life of the inward i mean those one would most have missed if deprived of them that i knew as most conducive to animation what could have roused more curiosity than this for the time at least even if there hadnt been associated with it such a fine redolence as i then supposed it of the rich and strange places and things as i supposed them that had contributed to making him over he had come back madeunless one was already and too conveniently or complacently to call it unmade that was the point and it certainly wasnt albany that ever would have made him he had come back charged to my vision with prodigious english impressions and awarenesses each so thoroughly and easily assimilated that they might have played their part as convictions and standards had he pretended to anything that would in that degree have satisfied us he never spoke of his faith as that might have been the thing we could have held him to and he knew what not too gracelessly to speak of when the sense of the american grotesque in general and the largelyviewed family reducibility to the absurd in particular offered him such free light pasture he had the sign of grace that he ever perfectly considered my fatherso far as attitude distinct from behaviour went but most members of our kinship on that side still clung to this habit of consideration even when as was in certain cases but too visible they had parted with all sense of any other i have preserved no happier truth about my father than that the graceless whom according to their own fond term he and he alone of all of us understood returned to him as often and appealed to him as freely as those happier though indeed scarce less importunate in their connection who found attraction and reason enough in their understanding him my brothers impression of this vessel of intimations that evening at the boston theatre and of his sincerity and his seeming greatly changed doesnt at all events i feel fail in the least to fit into one of those amplifications upon which my incurable trick of unwillingness wholly to sacrifice any good value compromised by time tends to precipitate me with a force that my reader can scarce fear for me more than i fear it for myself there was no extraordinary way in which our incalculable kinsman mightnt talk and that william should have had for the hour the benefit of his general truth is but a happy note in my record it was not always the case that one wished one might have seen more of him but this was only because one had had on any contact the sense of seeing so much that produced consequences among which the desire for more might even be uncannily numbered john wilkes booth of the same evening was of course president lincolns assassintobe of whose crudely extravagant performance of the hero of schillers robbers i recall my brothers imitative descriptioni never myself saw him and it simplifies his case i think for distracted history that he must have been quite an abominable actor i appear meanwhile to have paid william at cambridge a visit of which i have quite oddly lost remembranceby reason doubtless of its but losing itself in like though more prolonged occasions that were to follow at no great distance and that await my further reference the manner of his own allusion to it more than suffices       the radiance of hs visit has not faded yet and i come upon      gleams of it three or four times a day in my farings to and fro      but it has never a bit diminished the lustre of faroff shining      newport all silver and blue and of this heavenly group      below5all being more or less failures especially the two      outside ones the more so as the abovementioned h could in no      wise satisfy my craving for knowledge of family and friendshe      didnt seem to have been on speaking terms with anyone for some      time past and could tell me nothing of what they did said or      thought about any given subject never did i see a somuch      uninterested creature in the affairs of those about him he is a      good soul though in his way too and less fatal than the light      fantastic and eversociable wilky who has wrought little but      disaster during his stay with me breaking down my good resolutions      about food keeping me from all intellectual exercise working      havoc on my best hat by wearing it while dressing while in his      nightgown while washing his face and all but going to bed with      it he occupied my comfortable armchair all the morning in the      position represented in the fine plate that accompanies this      letterbut one more night though and he will have gone and no      thorn shall pierce the side of the serene and hallowed felicity of      expectation in which i shall revel till the time comes for      returning home home to the hearth of my infancy and budding youth      as wilky has submitted to you a résumé of his future history for      the next few years so will i of mine hoping it will meet your      approval thus one year chemistry then one term at home then one      year with wyman followed by a medical education then five or six      years with agassiz after which probably death death death from      inflation and plethora of knowledge this you had better seriously      consider so farewell till 845 some sunday evening soon your      bold your beautiful your blossom  i lead as ever he meanwhile elsewhere records the monotonous life of the scholar with few variations       we have very general talk at our table miss upham declaiming      against the vulgarity of president lincoln and complacently telling      of her own ignorance as to the way the wind blows or as to the      political events going on and saying she thinks it a great waste      of time and of no practical account to study natural history f      j child impresses one as very witty and funny but leaves it      impossible to remember what he says i took a walk with the      divinity student this splendid afternoon he told me he had been      walking yesterday with one of the jerseymen and they had discussed      the doctrine of a future state the jerseyman thought that if the      easy unitarian doctrines were to become popular the morals of the      community would be most terribly relaxed why said the other      here you are in the very thick of unitarianism look about      youpeople are about as good as anywhere yes replied the      jerseyman i confess to you that that is what has staggered me      and i dont understand it yet  i stretch over to the next year 1863 for the sake of the following to his sister       chérie charmante i am established in a cosy little room with a      large recess with a window in it containing bed and washstand and      separated from the main apartment by a rich green silk curtain and      a large gilt cornice this gives the whole establishment a splendid      look i found when i got back here that miss upham had raised her      price so great efforts were made by two of us to form a club but      too little enthusiasm was shown by any one else and it fell      through i then with that fine economical instinct which      distinguishes me resolved to take breakfast and tea of my own      finding and making in my room and only pay miss upham for      dinners miss u is now holding forth at swampscott so i asked to      see her sister mrs wood and learn the cost of the 7 dinners a      week she with true motherly instinct said that i should only make      a slop with my selfmade meals in my room and that she would      rather let me keep on for 450 seeing it was me i said she must      first consult miss upham she returned from swampscott saying that      miss u had sworn she would rather pay me a dollar a week than      have me go away ablaze with economic passion i cried      donetrying to make it appear that she had made me a formal      offer to that effect but she then wouldnt admit it and after      much recrimination we separated it being agreed that i should come      for 450 but tell no one so mind you dont either i now lay      my hand on my heart and confidently look to my mother for that      glance of approbation which she must bestow have i not redeemed      any weaknesses of the past though part of my conception fails yet      it was boldly planned and would have been a noble stroke       i have been pretty busy this week i have a filial feeling toward      wyman already i work in a vast museum at a table all alone      surrounded by skeletons of mastodons crocodiles and the like with      the walls hung about with monsters and horrors enough to freeze the      blood but i have no fear as most of them are tightly bottled up      occasionally solemn men and women come in to see the museum and      sometimes timid little girls reminding me of thee my love only      they are less fashionably dressed who whisper is folks allowed      here it pains me to remark however that not all the little      girls are of this pleasing type many being boldfaced jades      salter is back here but morose one or two new students and prof      goodwin who is very agreeable also william everett son of the      great edward very intelligent and a capital scholar studying law      he took honours at the english cambridge i send a photograph of      general sickles for your and wilkys amusement it is a part of a      great anthropomorphological collection which i am going to make so      take care of it as well as of all the photographs you will find in      the tabledrawer in my room but isnt he a bully boy desecrate      the room as little as possible if wilky wants me as an extra nurse      send for me without hesitation     vi   these returns to that first year or two at newport contribute meanwhile to filling out as nothing in the present pages has yet done for me that vision of our fathers unsurpassable patience and independence in the interest of the convictions he cherished and the expression of them as richly emphatic as it was scantly heeded to which he daily gave himself we took his writing infinitely for grantedwe had always so taken it and the sense of him each long morning at his study table either with bent considering brow or with a halfspent and checked intensity a lapse backward in his chair and a musing lift of perhaps troubled and baffled eyes seems to me the most constant fact the most closely interwoven and underlying among all our breaks and variations he applied himself there with a regularity and a piety as little subject to sighing abatements or betrayed fears as if he had been working under pressure for his bread and ours and the question were too urgent for his daring to doubt this play of his remarkable genius brought him in fact throughout the long years no ghost of a reward in the form of pence and could proceed to publicity as it repeatedly did not only by the copious and resigned sacrifice of such calculations but by his meeting in every single case all the expenses of the process the untired impulse to this devotion figured for us comprehensively and familiarly as fathers ideas of the force and truth of which in his own view we were always so respectfully even though at times so bewilderedly and confoundedly persuaded that we felt there was nothing in his exhibition of life that they didnt or couldnt account for they pervaded and supported his existence and very considerably our own but what comes back to me to the production of a tenderness and an admiration scarce to be expressed is the fact that though we thus easily and naturally lived with them and indeed as to their more general effects the colour and savour they gave to his talk breathed them in and enjoyed both their quickening and their embarrassing presence to say nothing of their almost never less than amusing we were left as free and unattacked by them as if they had been so many droppings of gold and silver coin on tables and chimneypieces to be taken or not according to our sense and delicacy that is our felt need and felt honour the combination in him of his different vivacities his living interest in his philosophy his living interest in us and his living superiority to all greed of authority all overreaching or overemphasising success at least in the heated short run gave his character a magnanimity by which it was impossible to us not to profit in all sorts of responsive and in fact quite luxurious ways it was a luxury i today see to have all the benefit of his intellectual and spiritual his religious his philosophic and his social passion without ever feeling the pressure of it to our direct irritation or discomfort it would perhaps more truly figure the relation in which he left us to these things to have likened our opportunities rather to so many scattered glasses of the liquor of faith pouredout cups stood about for our either sipping or draining down or leaving alone in the measure of our thirst our curiosity or our strength of head and heart if there was much leaving alone in usand i freely confess that so far as the taking any of it all straight went my lips rarely adventuredthis was doubtless because we drank so largely at the source itself the personally overflowing and irrigating what it then comes to for my present vision was that he treated us most of all on the whole as he in fact treated everything by his saving imaginationwhich set us and the more as we were naturally so inclined the example of living as much as we might in some such light of our own if we had been asked in our younger time for instance what were our fathers ideas or to give an example of one of them i think we should promptly have answered i should myself have hastened to do so that the principal was a devoted attachment to the writings of swedenborg as to whom we were to remember betimes with intimate appreciation that in reply to somebodys plea of not finding him credible our parent had pronounced him on the contrary fairly insipid with veracity we liked that partly i think because it disposed in a manner that is in favour of our detachment of the great emanuel but when i remember the part played so close beside us by this latters copious revelation i feel almost ashamed for my own incurious conduct the part played consisted to a large extent in the vast even though incomplete array of swedenborgs works the old faded covers of which anciently red actually apt to be loose and backed with labels of impressive though to my sense somewhat sinister london imprint arcana coelestia heaven and hell and other such mattersthey all had as from other days a sort of black emphasis of dignityranged themselves before us wherever and however briefly we disposed ourselves forming even for short journeys the base of our fathers travelling library and perhaps at some seasons therewith the accepted strain on our mothers patience i recall them as inveterately part of our very luggage requiring proportionate receptacles i recall them as in a number considerable even when reduced part of their proprietors own most particular dependence on his leaving home during our more agitated years for those speculative visits to possible better places than whatever place of the moment from which as i have elsewhere mentioned he was apt to return under premature under passionate nostalgic reaction the swedenborgs were promptly out again on their customary shelves or sometimes more improvised perches and it was somehow not till we had assured ourselves of this that we felt that incident closed  nothing could have exceeded at the same time our general senseunless i all discreetly again confine myself to the spare record of my ownfor our good fortune in never having been even when most helpless dragged by any approach to a faint jerk over the threshold of the inhabited temple it stood there in the centre of our family life into which its doors of fine austere bronze opened straight we passed and repassed them when we didnt more consciously go round and behind we took for granted vague grand things within but we never paused to peer or penetrate and none the less never had the so natural and wistful perhaps even the so properly resentful oh i say do look in a moment for manners if for nothing else called after us as we went our admirable mother sat on the steps at least and caught reverberations of the inward mystic choir but there were positive contemporary moments when i wellnigh became aware i think of something graceless something not to the credit of my aspiring intellectual life or of whatever small pretensions to seriousness i might have begun to nourish in the anything but heroic impunity of my inattention william later on made up for this not a little redeeming so to a large extent as he grew older our filial honour in the matter of a decent sympathy if not of a noble curiosity distinct to me even are certain echoes of passages between our father and his eldest son that i assisted at more or less indirectly and wonderingly as at intellectual scenes gathering from them portents of my brothers independent range of speculation agitations of thought and announcements of difference which could but have represented far beyond anything i should ever have to show a gained and to a considerable degree an enjoyed confessedly an interested acquaintance with the paternal philosophic penetralia that particular impression refers indeed to hours which at the point i have reached had not yet struck but i am touched even now after all the years with something exquisite in my halfgrasped premonitory vision of their belonging these belated discussions that were but the flowering of the first germs of such other doubtless already such opposed perceptions and conclusions to that order of thin consolations and broken rewards which long figured as the most and the best of what was to have been waited for on our companions part without the escape of a plaint yet i feel i may claim that our awareness of all that was so serenely dispensed withto call it missed would have been quite to falsify the story and reflect meanly on the spiritnever in the least brutally lapsed from admiration however unuttered the sentiment itself after the fashion of raw youth it is in fact quite distinct to me that had there been danger of this there came to us from our mothers lips at intervals long enough to emphasise the final sincerity and beauty a fairly sacred reminder of that strain of almost solely selfnourished equanimity or in other words insuperable gaiety in her lifes comrade which she had never seen give way this was the very gaiety that kept through the years coming out for usto the point of inviting free jokes and other light familiarities from us at its expense the happiest household pleasantry invested our legend of our mothers fond habit of address your fathers ideas you know which was always the signal for our embracing her with the last responsive finality and for the full pleasure of it in his presence nothing indeed so much as his presence encouraged the licence as i may truly call it of the legendthat is of our treatment en famille of any reference to the attested public weight of his labours which i hasten to add was much too esoteric a ground of geniality a dear old family joke not to be kept for its value to ourselves but there comes back to me the impression of his appearing on occasion quite moved to the exuberance of cheeras a form of refreshment he could draw on for a stronger and brighter spurt i meanby such an apology for resonance of reputation as our harmless our of course utterly edgeless profanity represented it might have been for him by a happy stretch a sign that the world did knowtaking us for the moment in our selfish young babble as a part of the noise of the world nothing at the same time could alter the truth of his case or can at least alter it to me now he had intellectually convictionally passionally speaking a selfless detachment a lack of what is called the eye for effectalways i mean of the elated and interested orderwhich i can but marvel at in the light of the rare aptitude of his means to his end and in that of the beauty of both though the stamp was doubtless most vivid for so differing so gropingly esthetic a mind as my own in his unfailingly personal and admirable style we knew he had thoroughly his own unconventional form which by the unspeakable law of youth we managed to feel the distinction of as not platitudinous even while we a bit sneakingly felt it as quotable on possible occasions against our presence of mind the great thing was at all events that we couldnt live with him without the sense that if his books resembled his talk and his characteras we moreover felt they couldnt help almost violently doingthey might want for this that or the other which kept the conventional true to its type but could as little fail to flush with the strong colour colour so remarkably given and not taken projected and not reflected colour of thought and faith and moral and expressional atmosphere as they could leave us without that felt sidewind of their strong composition which made after all so much of the air we breathed and was in the last resort the gage of something perpetually fine going on  it is not too much to say i think that our religious education so far as we had any consisted wholly in that loose yet enlightening impression i say so far as we had any in spite of my very definitely holding that it would absolutely not have been possible to us in the measure of our sensibility to breathe more the air of that reference to an order of goodness and power greater than any this world by itself can show which we understand as the religious spirit wondrous to me as i consider again that my fathers possession of this spirit in a degree that made it more deeply one with his life than i can conceive another or a different case of its being should have been unaccompanied with a single one of the outward or formal the theological devotional ritual or even implicitly pietistic signs by which we usually know it the fact of course was that his religion was nothing if not a philosophy extraordinarily complex and worked out and original intensely personal as an exposition yet not only susceptible of application but clamorous for it to the whole field of consciousness nature and society history knowledge all human relations and questions every pulse of the process of our destiny of this vast and interesting conception as striking an expression of the religious spirit surely as ever was put forth his eldest son has given an account6so far as this was possible at once with brevity and with full comprehensionthat i should have been unable even to dream of aspiring to and in the masterly clearness and justice of which the opportunity of the son blends with that of the critic each character acting in perfect felicity after a fashion of which i know elsewhere no such fine example it conveys the whole sense of our fathers philosophic passion which was theologic by my direct impression of it to a degree fairly outdistancing all theologies representing its weight reproducing its utterance placing it in the eye of the world and making for it the strong and single claim it suggests in a manner that leaves nothing to be added to the subject i am not concerned with the intrinsic meaning of these things here and should not be even had they touched me more directly or more converted me from what i can best call to my doubtless scant honour a total otherness of contemplation during the years when my privilege was greatest and my situation for inquiry and response amplest but the active not to say the obvious moral of them in all our younger time was that a life of the most richly consequent flowed straight out of them that in this life the most abundantly and above all naturally communicated as life that it was possible to imagine we had an absolutely equal share and that in fine i was to live to go back with wonder and admiration to the quantity of secreted thought in our daily medium the quality of intellectual passion the force of cogitation and aspiration as to the explanation both of a thousand surface incoherences and a thousand felt felicities a religion that was so systematically a philosophy a philosophy that was so sweepingly a religion being together by their necessity as i have said an intensity of relation to the actual the consciousness so determined was furnished forth in a way that met by itself the whole question of the attitude of worship for instance as i have attempted a little to show that it met with a beautiful good faith and the easiest sufficiency every other when such came up those of education acquisition material vindication what is called success generally in the beauty of the whole thing again i lose myselfby which i mean in the fact that we were all the while partaking to our most intimate benefit of an influence of direction and enlargement attended with scarce a single consecrated form and which would have made many of these had we been exposed to intrusion from them absurdly irrelevant my father liked in our quite younger period to read us chapters from the new testament and the old and i hope we liked to listen to themthough i recall their seeming dreary from their association with school practice but that was the sole approach to a challenge of our complete freedom of inward not less than our natural ingenuity of outward experience no other explicit address to us in the name of the divine could i see have been made with any congruityin face of the fact that invitations issued in all the vividest social terms terms of living appreciation of spiritual perception of human fellowship to use the expression that was perhaps oftenest on his lips and his pen alike were the very substance of the food supplied in the parental nest  the freedom from pressure that we enjoyed in every direction all those immunities and exemptions that had been in protracted childhood positively embarrassing to us as i have already noted before the framework ecclesiastical and mercantile squared at us as with reprobation from other households where it seemed so to conduce to their range of resourcethese things consorted with our yet being yearned over or prescribed for by every implication after a fashion that was to make the social organisation of such invidious homes under my subsequent observation of life affect me as so much bleak penury or domestic desert where these things of the spirit these genialities of faith were concerned well do i remember none the less how i was troubled all along just by this particular crookedness of our being so extremely religious without having as it were anything in the least classified or striking to show for it so that the measure of otherworldliness pervading our premises was rather a waste though at the same time oddly enough a congestionprojecting outwardly as it did no single one of those usual symptoms of propriety any of which gathered at a venture from the general prospect might by my sense have served i shouldnt have been particular i thought as to the selection religion was a matter by this imagination to be worked off much more than to be worked in and i fear my real vague sentiment to have been but that life would under the common equipment be somehow more amusing and this even though as i dont forget there was not an item of the detail of devotional practice that we had been so much as allowed to divine i scarce know why i should have wanted anything more amusing as most of our coevals would have regarded it than that we had from as far back as i could remember indulged in no shade of an approach to keeping sunday which is one of the reasons why to speak as if piety could have borne for us any sense but the tender human or to speak at all of devotion unction initiation even of the vaguest into the exercises or professions as among our attributes would falsify altogether our mere fortune of a general liberty of living of making ourselves as brightly at home as might be in that spiritual world which we were in the habit of hearing as freely alluded to as we heard the prospect of dinner or the call of the postman the oddity of my own case as i make it out so far as it involved a confused criticism was that my small uneasy mind bulging and tightening in the wrong or at least in unnatural and unexpected places like a little jacket ill cut or ill sewn attached its gaping view as i have already more than enough noted to things and persons objects and aspects frivolities all i dare say i was willing to grant compared with whatever manifestations of the serious these being by need apparently the abstract and that in fine i should have been thankful for a state of faith a conviction of the divine an interpretation of the universeanything one might have made bold to call itwhich would have supplied more features or appearances feeling myself after persons so much more than after anything elseto recur to that side of my earliest and most constant consciousness which might have been judged most deplorablei take it that i found the sphere of our more nobly supposititious habitation too imperceptibly peopled whereas the religious life of every other family that could boast of any such and what family didnt boast affected my fancy as with a social and material crowdedness that faculty alone was affectedthis i hasten to add no directness of experience ever stirred for me it being the case in the first place that i scarce remember as to all our young time the crossing of our threshold by any faint shade of an ecclesiastical presence or the lightest encounter with any such elsewhere and equally of the essence over and above that the clerical race the preeminently restrictive tribe as i apprehended them couldnt very well have agreed less with the general colour of my fondest vision if it be not indeed more correct to say that i was reduced to supposing they couldnt we knew in truth nothing whatever about them a fact that as i recover it also flushes for me with its fine awkwardnessthe social scene in general handsomely bristling with them to the rueful view i sketch and they yet remaining for us or at any rate for myself such creatures of pure hearsay that when late in my teens and in particular after my twentieth year i began to see them portrayed by george eliot and anthony trollope the effect was a disclosure of a new and romantic species strange beyond my present power to account for it this anomaly that amid a civilisation replete with ministersfor we at least knew the wordactively competitively indeed as would often appear quite violently ministering so little sense of a brush against approved examples was ever to attend me that i had finally to draw my nearest sufficiency of a true image from pictures of a social order largely alien to our own all of which at the same time i allow myself to add didnt mitigate the simple fact of my feltmy indeed so luxuriously permitteddetachment of sensibility from everything everything that is in the way of great relations as to which our fathers emphasis was richest there was the dim dissociation there my comparative poverty or call it even frivolity of instinct i gaped imaginatively as it were to such a different set of relations i couldnt have framed stories that would have succeeded in involving the least of the relations that seemed most present to him while those most present to myself that is more complementary to whatever it was i thought of as humanly most interesting attaching inviting were the ones his schemes of importances seemed virtually to do without didnt i discern in this from the first a kind of implied snub to the significance of mineso that in the blest absence of pressure which i just sought here passingly to celebrate i could brood to my hearts content on the so conceivable alternative of a field of exposure crammed with those objective appearances that my faculty seemed alone fitted to grasp in which there was ever the small torment of the factthough i dont quite see today why it should not have been of a purely pleasant irritationthat what our parent most overflowed with was just the brave contradiction or opposition between all his parts a thing which made for perfect variety which he carried ever so easily and brightly and which would have put one no less in the wrong had one accused him of knowing only the abstract as i was so complacently and invidiously disposed to name it than if one had foolishly remarked on his living and concluding without it but i have already made clear his great mixed rangewhich of course couldnt not have been the sign of a mind conceiving our very own breathing humanity in its every fibre the absolute expression of a resident divinity no element of character no spontaneity of life but instantly seized his attention and incurred his greeting and his comment which things could never possibly have been so genially alert and expertas i have again before this superabundantly recordedif it had not fairly fed on active observation and contact he could answer one with the radiant when one challenged him with the obscure just as he could respond with the general when one pulled at the particular and i neednt repeat that this made for us during all our time anything but a starved actuality  none the less however i remember it as savouring of loss to mewhich is my present pointthat our so thoroughly informal scene of susceptibility seemed to result from a positive excess of familiarity in his earlier past with such types of the shepherd and the flock to say nothing of such forms of the pasture as might have met in some degree my appetite for the illustrational this was one of the things that made me often wish as i remember that i might have caught him sooner or younger less developed as who should say the matters that appeared however confusedly to have started his development being by this measure stranger and livelier than most of those that finally crowned it marked with their own colour as many of these doubtless were three or four strongest pages in the fragment of autobiography gathered by his eldest son into the sheaf of his literary remains describe the state of soul undergone by him in england in 44 just previous to the hour at which mrs chichester a gentle lady of his acquaintance there brought to his knowledge by a wondrous chance the possibility that the great swedenborg from whom she had drawn much light might have something to say to his case so that under the impression of his talk with her he posted at once up to london from the neighbourhood of windsor where he was staying possessed himself of certain volumes of the writings of the eminent mystic socalled i mean for to my father this description of him was grotesque and passed rapidly into that grateful infinitude of recognition and application which he was to inhabit for the rest of his days i saw him move about there after the fashion of the oldest and easiest native and this had on some sides its own considerable effect tinged even on occasion with romance yet i felt how the real right thing for me would have been the hurrying drama of the original rush the interview with the admirable mrs chichester the sweet legend of his and my mothers charmed impression of whom had lingered with usi admired her very name there seeming none other among us at all like it and then the return with the tokens of light the splendid agitation as the light deepened and the laying in of that majestic array of volumes which were to form afterward the purplest rim of his librarys horizon and which i was thus capable for my poor part of finding valuable in default of other values as coloured properties in a fine fifth act it was all a play i hadnt been to consciously at leastthat was the trouble the curtain had fallen while i was still tucked in my crib and i assisted but on a comparatively flat home scene at the echo of a great success i could still have done for the worst with a consciousness of swedenborg that should have been graced at least with swedenborgiansaware as i was of the existence of such enrolled disciples ornaments of a church of their own yet known to us only as persons rather acidly mystified by the inconvenience as we even fancied them to feel it of our fathers frankly independent and disturbingly irregular all the more for its being so expressive connection with their inspirer in the light or the dusk of all this it was surely impossible to make out that he professed any faint shade of that clerical character as to his having incurred which we were in the world to our bewilderment not infrequently questioned those of the enrolled order in the matter of his and their subject of study might in their way too have raised to my regard a fretted vault or opened a longdrawn aisle but they were never at all in the language of a later day to materialise to me we neither on a single occasion sat in their circle nor did one of them to the best of my belief ever stray remonstrantly or invitingly into ours where swedenborg was read not in the least as the bible scarce more than just escaped being but even as shakespeare or dickens or macaulay was content to bewhich was without our arranging or subscribing for it i seem to distinguish that if a fugitive or a shy straggler from the pitched camp did turn up it was under cover of night or of curiosity and with much panting and putting off of the mantle much nervous laughter above allthis safe however to become on the shortest order amusement easy and intimate that figured something in a slight wayas at least i suppose i may infer from the faint adumbration i retain but nothing none the less much attenuated what i suppose i should have denounced as the falsity of our position meaning thereby of mine had i been constitutionally at all voluble for such flights constructionally we had all the fun of licence while the truth seemed really to be that fun in the religious connection closely depended on bondage the fun was of course that i wanted in this line of diversion something of the coarser strain which came home to me in especial to cut the matter short when i was present as i yielded first and last to many an occasion for being at my fathers reading out to my mother with an appreciation of that modest grasp of somebodys attention the brief illusion of publicity which has now for me the exquisite grace of the touching some series of pages from among his papers that were to show her how he had this time at last done it no touch of the beautiful or the sacred in the disinterested life can have been absent from such scenesi find every such ideally there and my memory rejoices above all in their presentation of our mother at her very perfectest of soundless and yet absolutely allsaving service and trust to have attempted any projection of our fathers aspect without an immediate reference to her sovereign care for him and for all of us as the so widely open yet so softly enclosing lap of all his liberties and all our securities all our variety and withal our harmony the harmony that was for ninetenths of it our sense of her gathered life in us and of her having no otherto have so proceeded has been but to defer by instinct and by scruple to the kind of truth and of beauty before which the direct report breaks down i may well have stopped short with what there would be to say and yet what account of us all can pretend to have gone the least bit deep without coming to our mother at every penetration we simply lived by her in proportion as we lived spontaneously with an equanimity of confidence an independence of something that i should now find myself think of as decent compunction if i didnt try to call it instead morbid delicacy which left us free for detachments of thought and flights of mind experiments so to speak on the assumption of our genius and our intrinsic interest that i look back upon as to a luxury of the unworried that is scarce of this world this was a support on which my father rested with the absolute whole of his weight and it was when i felt her listen with the whole of her usefulness which needed no other force being as it was the whole of her tenderness and amply sufficing by itself that i understood most what it was so to rest and so to act when in the fulness of the years she was to die and he then to give us time a few months as with a beatific depth of design to marvel at the manner of his acceptance of the stroke a shown triumph of his philosophy he simply one day consciously ceased quietly declined to continue as an offered measure of his loss of interest nothinghe had enabled himself to make perfectly surewas in the least worth while without her this attested he passed away or went out with entire simplicity promptness and ease for the definite reason that his support had failed his philosophy had been not his support but his suspension and he had never i am sure felt so lifted as at that hour which splendidly crowned his faith it showed us more intimately still what in this world of cleft components one human being can yet be for another and how a form of vital aid may have operated for years with such perfection as fairly to have made recognition seem at the time a sort of excess of reaction an interference or a pedantry all which is imaged for me while i see our mother listen at her work to the full music of the papers she could do that by the mere force of her complete availability and could do it with a smoothness of surrender that was like an array of all the perceptions the only thing that i might well have questioned on these occasions was the possibility on the part of a selflessness so consistently and unabatedly active of its having anything ever left acutely to offer to abide so unbrokenly in such inaptness for the personal claim might have seemed to render difficult such a special show of it as any particular pointedness of hospitality would propose to represent i dare say it was our sense of this that so often made us all when the explicit or the categoric the impulse of acclamation flowered out in her find our happiest play of filial humour in just embracing her for the sound of it than which i can imagine no more expressive tribute to our constant depths of indebtedness she lived in ourselves so exclusively with such a want of use for anything in her consciousness that was not about us and for us that i think we almost contested her being separate enough to be proud of usit was too like our being proud of ourselves we were delightedly derisive with her even about pride in our fatherit was the most domestic of our pastimes for what really could exceed the tenderness of our fastening on her that she was he was each of us was our pride and our humility our possibility of any relation and the very canvas itself on which we were floridly embroidered how can i better express what she seemed to do for her second son in especial than by saying that even with her deepest delicacy of attention present i could still feel while my father read why it was that i most of all seemed to wish we might have been either much less religious or much more so was not the reason at bottom that i so suffered i might almost have put it under the impression of his style which affected me as somehow too philosophic for life and at the same time too living as i made out for thoughtsince i must weirdly have opined that by so much as you were individual which meant personal which meant monotonous which meant limitedly allusive and verbally repetitive by so much you were not literary or so to speak largely figurative my father had terms evidently strong but in which i presumed to feel with a shade of irritation a certain narrowness of exclusion as to images otherwiseand oh since it was a question of the pen so multitudinouslyentertainable variety varietythat sweet ideal that straight contradiction of any dialectic hummed for me all the while as a direct if perverse and most unedified effect of the parental concentration with some of its consequent though heedless dissociations i heard it felt it saw it both shamefully enjoyed and shamefully denied it as form though as form only and i owed thus supremely to my mother that i could in whatever obscure levity muddle out some sense of my own preoccupation under the singular softness of the connection that she kept for me by the outward graces with that other and truly much intenser which i was so little framed to share  if meanwhile my fathers tone so far as that went was to remain the same save for a natural growth of assurance and thereby of amplitude all his life i find it already and his very voice as we were to know them in a letter to r w emerson of 1842 without more specific date after the loose fashion of those days but from 2 washington place new york the second house in the row between the university building and broadway as he was next to note to his correspondent in expressing the hope of a visit from him it was the house in which the following year his second son was born       i came home tonight from my lecture a little disposed to think      from the smart reduction of my audience that i had about as well      not have prepared my course especially as i get no tidings of      having interested one of the sort the religious for whom they are      wholly designed when i next see you i want a halfhours support      from you under this discouragement and the purpose of this letter      is to secure it when i am with you i get no help from youof      the sort you can give me i feel sure though you must know what i      want before i listen to you next usually the temper you show of      perfect repose and candour free from all sickening partisanship      and full of magnanimous tenderness for every creature makes me      forget my wants in your lavish plenty but i know you have the same      as i have deep down in your breast and it is by these i would      fain know you i am led quite without any conscious wilfulness      either to seek the laws of these appearances that swim round us      in gods great museum to get hold of some central facts which may      make all other facts properly circumferential and orderly and you      continually dishearten me by your apparent indifference to such law      and such facts by the dishonour you seem to cast on our      intelligence as if it were what stands in our way now my      conviction is that my intelligence is the necessary digestive      apparatus for my life that there is nihil in vitaworth anything      that isquod non prius in intellectu now is it not so in truth      with you can you not report your life to me by some intellectual      symbol which my intellect appreciates do you not know your      activity but fudgei cannot say what i want to say what aches to      say itself in me and so ill hold up till i see you and try once      more to get some better furtherance by my own effort here i am      these thirtyone years in life ignorant in all outward science      but having patient habits of meditation which never know disgust or      weariness and feeling a force of impulsive love toward all      humanity which will not let me rest wholly mute a force which      grows against all resistance that i can muster against it what      shall i do shall i get me a little nook in the country and      communicate with my living kindnot my talking kindby life      only a word perhaps of that communication a fit word once a      year or shall i follow some commoner methodlearn science and      bring myself first into mans respect that i may thus the better      speak to him i confess this last theory seems rank with      earthlinessto belong to days forever past  his appeal to emerson at this hour was as he elsewhere then puts it to the invisible man in the matter who affected him as somewhere behind the more or less immediately visible the beautifully but mystifyingly audible the emerson of honeyed lectures and addresses suggestive and inspiring as that one might be and who might as we say today have something something more at least for him i will tell him that i do not value his substantive discoveries whatever they may be perhaps half so largely as he values them but that i chiefly cherish that erect attitude of mind in him which in gods universe undauntedly seeks the worthiest tidings of god and calmly defies every mumbling phantom which would challenge its freedom should his zeal for realities and contempt of vulgar shows abide the ordeal i have thus contrived for them i shall gladly await his visit to me so much at least is what i have been saying to myself now that i have told it to you also you have become a sort of confidant between me and myself and so bound to promote harmony there the correspondence expands however beyond my space for reporting of it i but pick out a few passages       i am cheered by the coming of carlyles new book which greeley      announces and shall hasten off for it as soon as i have      leisure7 the title is provokingly enigmatical but thought      enough there will be in it no doubt whatever the name thought      heaped up to topheaviness and inevitable lopsidedness but more      interesting to me than comes from any other quarter of      europeinteresting for the mans sake whom it shows according to      my notion he is the very best interpreter of a spiritual philosophy      that could be devised for this age the age of transition and      conflict and what renders him so is his natural      birthandeducationplace just to think of a scotchman with a      heart widened to german spiritualities to have overcome his      educational bigotries far enough to listen to the new ideas this      by itself was wonderful and then to give all his native shrewdness      and humour to the service of making them tell to the minds of his      peoplewhat more fortunate thing for the time could there be you      dont look upon calvinism as a fact at all wherein you are to my      mind philosophically infirmimpaired in your universality i can      see in carlyle the advantage his familiarity with it gives him over      you with a general audience what is highest in him is built upon      that lowest at least so i read i believe jonathan edwards      redivivus in true blue would after an honest study of the      philosophy that has grown up since his day make the best possible      reconciler and critic of this philosophyfar better than schelling      redivivus  in the autumn of 1843 the nook in the country above alluded to had become a question renounced so far at least as the american country was concerned and never again afterwards flushed into life i think it probable i shall winter in some mild english climate devonshire perhaps and go on with my studies as at home i shall miss the stimulus of your candid and generous society and i confess we dont like the aspect of the journey but ones destiny puts on many garments as it goes shaping itself in secretso let us not cling to any particular fashion very marked and above all very characteristic of my father in this interesting relation which i may but so imperfectly illustrate his constant appeal to his so inspired yet so uninflamed so irreducible and as it were inapplicable friend for intellectual and as he would have said spiritual help of the immediate and adjustable the more concretely vital kind the kind translatable into terms of the real the particular human terms of action and passion oh you man without a handle shall one never be able to help himself out of you according to his needs and be dependent only upon your fitful tippingsupa remarkably felicitous expression as it strikes me of that difficulty often felt by the passionatelyliving of the earlier time as they may be called to draw down their noble philosophers great overhanging heaven of universal and ethereal answers to the plane of their comparatively terrestrial and personal questions the note of the answers and their great anticipatory spirit being somehow that they seemed to anticipate everything but the unaccommodating individual case my father on his side bristled with handlesthere could scarce be a better general account of himand tipped himself up for you almost before you could take hold of one of which truth for that matter this same letter happens to give even if just trivially the hint can i do anything for you in the way of taking parcels no matter how large or expensiveor for any of your friends if you see margaret fuller ask her to give me some service to render her abroad the dear noble woman it seems a real hardship to be leaving the country now that i have just come to talk with her emerson i should add did offer personally so solid a handle that my father appears to have taken from him two introductions to be made use of in london one to carlyle and the other to john sterling the result of which shortly afterwards was as vivid and as deeply appropriated an impression of each eminent character as it was probably to be given either of them ever to have made the impression of carlyle was recorded but long subsequently i note and is included in williams gatheringin of our fathers literary remains 1885 and of the acquaintance with sterling no reflection remains but a passage in a letter under date of ventnor and of the winter of 1843 from the latter to his biographer to be carlyle having already mentioned in the life that two american gentlemen acquaintances also of mine had been recommended to him by emerson most likely and that one morning sterling appeared here with a strenuous proposal that we should come to knightsbridge and dine with him and them and accordingly we went it goes on i remember it as one of the saddest dinners though sterling talked copiously and our friends theodore parker one of them were pleasant and distinguished men my father with theodore parker his friend and the date fitting would quite seem to have been one of the pair were it not that our conversation was waste and logical i forget quite on what not joyful and harmoniously effusive it is that that doesnt fit with any real participation of hisnothing could well do less so unless the occasion had but too closely conformed to the biographers darkly and richly prophetic view of it as tragic and ominous sad as if one had been dining in a ruin in the crypt of a mausoleumall this painfully apparent through the bright mask sterling had bound himself to wear the end of his life was then to carlyles view in sight but his own note in the isle of wight on mr james your newengland friend was genial enoughi saw him several times and liked him they went on the 24th of last month back to londonor so purposed he adds because there is no pavement here for him to walk on i want to know where he is and thought i should be able to learn from you i gave him a note for mill who may perhaps have seen him  my main interest in which is i confess for the faroff germ of the odd legend destined much to grow later on thatalready the nucleus of a householdwe were new england products which i think my parents could then have even so much as seemed only to eyes naturally unaware of our american sectional differences my father when considerably past his thirtieth year if i am not mistaken had travelled east within our borders but once in his lifeon the occasion of his spending two or three months in boston as a very young man there connecting itself with this for me a reminiscence so bedimmed at once and so suggestive as now almost to torment me it must have been in 67 or 68 that giving him my arm of a slippery boston day up or down one of the steep streets that used to mount from behind and as slightly sullen with the effort to beacon hill and between which my now relaxed memory rather fails to discriminate i was arrested by his pointing out to me opposite us a house in which he had for a while had rooms long before and quite in his early time i but recall that we were more or less skirting the base of an ancient townreservoir the seat of the watersupply as then constituted a monument rugged and dark massively granitic perched all perversely as it seemed to look on the precipitous slope and whichat least as i see it through the yearsstruck quite handsomely the babylonian note i at any rate mix up with this frowning objectit had somehow a sinister presence and suggestionmy companions mention there in front of it that he had anciently taken refuge under its shadow from certain effects of a misunderstanding if indeed not of a sharp rupture for the time with a highly generous but also on occasion strongly protesting parent at albany a parent displeased with some course he had taken or had declined to take there was a tradition among us that he had been for a period quite definitely wild and relief from further discussion with whom he had sought and had more or less found on that spot it was an age in which a flight from albany to bostonthere being then no boston and albany railroadcounted as a far flight though it wasnt to occur to me either then or afterwards that the ground of this manoeuvre had been any plotted wildness in the puritan air what was clear at the moment and what he remarked upon was that the streetscene about us showed for all the lapse of time no scrap of change and i remember well for myself how my first impression of boston gave it to me under certain aspects as more expressive than i had supposed an american city could be of a seated and rooted social order an order not complex but sensibly fixedgathered in or folded back to intensity upon itself and this again and again when the compass of the posture its narrow field might almost have made the fold excruciating it had given however no sign of excruciationthat itself had been part of the puritan stoicism which perhaps was exactly why the local look recognised to the point i speak of by the visitor was so contained and yet comparatively so full full very nearly i originally fancied after the appraisable fashion of some composed townface in one of balzacs villes de province all of which i grant is much to say for the occasion of that dropped confidence on the sloshy hillside to which i alludeand part of the action of which was that it had never been dropped before this circumstance somehow a peculiar source of interest an interest i the more regret to have lost my grasp of as it must have been sharp or in other words founded to account for the long reverberation here noted i had stillas i was indeed to keep having through lifethe good fortune that elements of interest easily sprang to my incurable sense from any ghost of a drama at all presented though i of course cant in the least pretend to generalise on what may or may not have constituted living presentation this felicity occurred i make out quite incalculably just as it could or would the effect depended on some particular touch of the spring which was set in motion the instant the touch happened to be right my fathers was always right to my receptive mind as receptive that is of any scrap of enacted story or evoked picture as it was closed to the dry or the abstract proposition so that i blush the deeper at not being able in honour of his reference to make the latter more vividly floweri still so feel that i quite thrilled with it and with the standing background at the moment lighted by it there were things in it and other persons old actualities old meanings and furnishings of the other old boston as i by that time couldnt but appraise it and the really archaic the overhung and sombre and secretkeeping street socially disconnected socially mysteriousas i like at any rate to remember itwas there to testify testify to the ancient time of tension expansion sore meditation or whatever by its positively conscious gloom  the moral of this i fear amounts to little more than that putting aside the substance of his anecdote my father had not set foot in new england till toward his thirtyfifth year and my mother was not to do so till later still circumstances not in the least preventing the birth of what i have called the falsifying legend the allusion to the walking at ventnor touches his inability to deal with rural roads and paths then rougher things than now by reason of an accident received in early youth and which had so lamed him for life that he could circulate to any convenience but on even surfaces and was indeed mainly reduced to drivingit had made him for all his earlier time an excellent whip his constitution had been happily of the strongest but as i look back i see his grave disability which it took a strong constitution to carry mainly in the light of a consistency of patience that we were never to have heard broken the two acceptances melt together for methat of the limits of his material action his doing and enjoying set so narrowly and that of his scant allowance of public recognition or of the support and encouragement that spring and spring so naturally and rightly when the relation of effect to cause is close and straight from any at all attested and glad understanding of a formula as we say nowadays a message richly and sincerely urged too many such reflections however beset me here by the way my letters jump meanwhile to the summer of 1849 when i find in another of them addressed to emerson a passage as characteristic as possible of one of the writers liveliest and as i confess it was ever to seem to me most genially perverse idiosyncrasies his distinctly low opinion of mere literary men this note his letters in general again and again strikenot a little to the diversion of those who were to have observed and remembered his constant charmed subjection in the matter of practice to the masters even quite the lighter in the depreciated group his sensibility to their spell was in fact so marked that it became from an early time a household game with us to detect him in evasive tears over their pages when these were either real or romantic enough and to publish without mercy that he had so been caught there was a period in particular during which this pastime enjoyed indeed quite revelled in the form of our dragging to the light with every circumstance of derision the fact of his clandestine and deeply moved perusal of g p r james our nominal congener at that time ceasing to be prescribed it was his plea in the fifties that this romancer had been his idol in the forties and the thirties and that under renewed even if but experimental surrender the associations of youth flocked back to lifeso that we profane about the unduly displaced master were deplorably the poorer he loved the novel in fine he followed its constant course in the revue with a beautiful inconsequence and the more it was literature loved it the better which was just how he loved as well criticism and journalism the particular instance with him once he was in relation with it quite sufficiently taking care of the invidiouslyviewed typeas this was indeed viewed but a priori and at its most generaland making him ever so cheerfully forget to be consistent work was verily cut out for the particular instance as against the type in an air and at a time favouring so again and again and up and down the literary world a dire mediocrity it was the distillers of that thinness the mere ones that must have been present to him when he wrote to emerson in 1849 there is nothing i dread so much as literary men especially our literary men catch them out of the range of mere personal gossip about authors and books and ask them for honest sympathy in your sentiment or for an honest repugnancy of it and you will find the company of stagedrivers sweeter and more comforting to your soul in truth the questions which are beginning to fill the best books and will fill the best for a long time to come are not related to what we have called literature and are as well judgedi think betterby those whom books have at all events not belittled when a man lives that is lives enough he can scarcely write he cannot read i apprehend at all all his writing will be algebraicised put into the form of sonnets and proverbs and the community will feel itself insulted to be offered a big bunch of pages as though it were stupid and wanted tedious drilling like a child when i begin to quote my father however i hang over him perhaps even too historically for his expression leads me on and on so by its force and felicity that i scarce know where to stop the fact is that i am afraid i am in a very bad way for i cannot heartily engage in any topic in which i shall appear to advantagethe question having been de part et dautre of possible courses of lectures for which the appetite of new york and boston already announced itself as of the largest and it still more beguiles me that my wife and i are obligedso numerous has waxed our familyto enlarge our house in town and get a country house for the summer here came in that earnest dream of the solutional europe with which i have elsewhere noted that my very youngest sensibility was fed these things look expensive and temporary to us besides being an additional care and so considering with much pity our four stout boys who have no playroom within doors and import shocking bad manners from the street we gravely ponder whether it wouldnt be better to go abroad for a few years with them allowing them to absorb french and german and get such a sensuous education as they cant get here  in 1850 however we had still not departed for europeas we were not to do for several years yet one advantage of which was that my father remained for the time in intercourse by letter with his english friend dr j j garth wilkinson first known during my parents considerable stay in london of several years before 184344 and whose admirable style of expression in its way as personal and as vivid as henry jamess own with an added and doubtless more perceptibly fullblooded massiveness is so attested by his earlier writings8 to say nothing of the rich collection of his letters 184555 lately before menotably by the human body and its connection with man dedicated in 1851 to my fatherthat i wonder at the absence of such a master in more than one happy specimen from the common educational exhibitions of english prose dr wilkinson was a friend of emersons as well which leads the latters new york correspondent to cite to him in february 1850 a highly characteristic passage from one of the london communications       carlyle came up here presumably to hampstead on monday to see      neuberg and spoke much of you with very kind recollections he      remembered your metaphysics also and asked with terrible solicitude      whether they yet persevered i couldnt absolutely say that they      did not though i did my best to stammer out something about the      great social movement he was suffering dreadfully from malaise      and indigestion and gave with his usual force his usual putrid      theory of the universe all great men were most miserable the day      on which any man could say he was not miserable that day he was a      scoundrel god was a divine sorrow to no moment could he carlyle      ever say linger but only goodbye and never let me see your face      again and all this interpolated with convulsive laughter showing      that joy would come into him were it even by the path of hysteria      and disease to me he is an unprofitable man and though he gave me      the most kind invitation i have too much respect for my stomach to      go much into his company where hope is feeble genius and the human      voice are on the way to die by the next boat i will endeavour to      send you over my thoughts on his recent pamphlet the first of a      series of latterdaytracts he is very rapidly falling out with      all his present admirers for which i like them all the better and      indeed is driving fast toward social viewsonly his is to be a      compulsory not an attractive socialism  after quoting which my father comments never was anything more false than this worship of sorrow by carlyle he has picked it up out of past history and spouts it for mere display as a virtuoso delights in the style of his grandfather it is the merest babble in him as everyone who has ever talked an hour with him will acquit him of the least grain of humility a man who has once uttered a cry of despair should ever after clothe himself in sackcloth and ashes  the writer was to have meanwhile before our migration of 1855 a considerable lecturing activity a confused yet perfectly recoverable recollection on my own part of these years connects itself with our knowledge that our father engaged in that practice and that he went forth for the purpose with my mother always in earnest and confident even though slightly fluttered attendance at about the hour of our upward procession to bed which fact lent to the proceedingthat is to hisa strange air of unnatural riot quite as of torchlighted and windblown dissipation we went to plays and to ballets and they had comparatively speaking no mystery but at no lecture had we ever been present and these put on for my fancy at least a richer light and shade very much as if we ourselves had been on the performing side of the curtain or the wonder of admiring in our mothers person and of being admired in our fathers had been rolled for us into a single glory this glory moreover was not menaced but only made more of a thrill by the prime admirers anxiety always displayed at the last as to whether they were not starting without the feature of features the corpus delicti or manuscript itself which it was legendary with us that the admired had been known to drive back for in an abashed flurry at the moment we were launched in dreams of him as in full though mysterious operation i can see him now from the parlour window at the door of the carriage and under the gusty streetlamp produce it from a coattail pocket and shake it for her ideal comfort in the face of his companion the following to emerson i surmise is of some early date in the autumn of 52       i give three lectures in boston at the masonic temple the first      and second on nov 5th and 8th respectively i should be greatly      appalled in some respects but still charmed to have you for an      auditor seeing thus a hundred empty seats obliterated but i beg      of you dont let any engagement suffer by such kindness to me      looking over the lectures again they horrify me with their      loudmouthed imbecilitybut i hope they may fall upon less      hardened ears in some cases i am sure that the thought which is in      them or rather seems to me to struggle to be in them is worthy of      all mens rapturous homage and i will trust that a glimpse of it      may somehow befall my patient auditory the fact is that a vital      truth can never be transferred from one mind to another because      life alone appreciates it the most one can do for another is to      plant some rude formula of such truths in his memory leaving his      own spiritual chemistry to set free the germ whenever the demands      of his life exact it the reason why the gods seem so powerless to      the sensuous understanding and suffer themselves to be so long      defamed by our crazy theologies is that they are life and can      consequently be revealed only to life but life is simply the      passage of idea into action and our crazy theologies forbid ideas      to come into action any further than our existing institutions      warrant hence man leads a mere limping life and the poor gods who      are dependent upon his manliness for their true revelation and for      their real knowledge are doomed to remain forever unknown and      even denied by such solemn pedants as mr atkinson and miss      martineau however i shall try to convert myself at least into      an army of goths and huns to overcome and destroy our existing      sanctities that the supernal splendours may at length become      credible and even visible goodbye till we meet in boston and      cultivate your goodnature according to my extensive needs  i bridge the interval before our migration of 1855 exactly for the sake of certain further passages addressed to the same correspondent from london in the following year the letter is a long one and highly significant of the writers familiar frankness but i must keep down my examplesthe first of which glances at his general sense of the men he mainly met       they are all of them depressed or embittered by the public      embarrassments that beset them deflected distorted somehow      despoiled of their rich individual manliness by the necessity of      providing for these imbecile old inheritances of church and state      carlyle is the same old sausage fizzing and sputtering in his own      grease only infinitely more unreconciled to the blest providence      which guides human affairs he names god frequently and alludes to      the highest things as if they were realities but all only as for a      picturesque effect so completely does he seem to regard them as      habitually circumvented and set at naught by the politicians i      took our friend m to see him and he came away greatly distressed      and désillusionné carlyle having taken the utmost pains to deny      and descry and deride the idea of his having done the least good to      anybody and to profess indeed the utmost contempt for everybody      who thought he had and poor m being intent on giving him a      plenary assurance of this fact in his own case arthur helps      seems an amiable kindly little man with friendly offers but i told      him i had no intention to bore him and would at most apply to him      when i might want a good hatter or bootmaker he fancied a      littleat least i thought this was the casethat i was going to      make a book and might be indiscreet enough to put him in       disappoints me he is so eaten up with the spirits and all that      his imagination is so vast as to dwarf all the higher faculties      and his sympathy as narrow as dr cheevers or brownsons no      reasonable man it is true likes the clergy or the philosophers      but s dislike of them seems as envenomed as that between rival      tradesmen or rival beauties one cant endure the nonsense they      talk to be sure but when one considers the dear human meaning and      effort struggling at the bottom of it all one can feel still less      any personal separation from the men themselves s sarcasm is      of the fiercest and on the whole he is only now at last sowing his      intellectual wild oatshe will grow more genial in good time this      is it i think he is but now finding his youth that which we on      our side of the water find so early and exhaust so prodigally he      has found thus much lateri mean an emancipation from the shackles      of custom and the kicking up of his heels consequently is      proportionate to his greater maturity of muscle mrs  is a      dear little goose of a thing who fancies the divine providence in      closer league with herself than with others giving her intimations      of events about to happen and endowing her with peculiar      perspicacity in the intuition of remedies for disease and       the great brawny fellow sits by and says never a word in abatement      of this enormous domestic inflation though the visitor feels      himself crowded by it into the most inconsiderable of corners a      sweet loving innocent woman like mrs  oughtnt to grow      egotistical in the company of a truly wise man and this      accordingly is another quarrel i have with  in short i am      getting to the time of life when one values ones friends for what      they are more than for what they do i am just as much impressed as      ever by his enormous power but the goodness out of which it is      born and the wisdom by which it is nurtured and bred are things i      dont so much see  the correspondence grew more interspaced and with the year 1861 and the following when we were at home again became a matter of the occasional note i have before me a series of beautiful examples of emersons share in itduring the earlier time copious enough but these belong essentially to another case i am all but limited for any further show of the interesting relation than i have already given to reproducing a few lines from emersons diary passages unpublished at the moment i write and the first of them of april 1850 i have made no note of these long weary absences at new york and philadelphia i am a bad traveller and the hotels are mortifications to all sense of wellbeing in me the people who fill them oppress me with their excessive virility and would soon become intolerable if it were not for a few friends who like women tempered the acrid mass henry james was true comfortwise gentle polished with heroic manners and a serenity like the sun the hotels of those days may well have been an ordealdistinct to me still from no few childish glimpses of their bareness of ease and rudeness of acceuil yet that our justly fastidious friend was not wholly left to their mercy seems signified by my not less vivid remembrance of his staying with us on occasion in new york some occasion or occasions i infer of his coming on to lecture there do i roll several occasions into one or amplify one beyond reasonthis last being ever i allow the waiting pitfall of a chronicler too memoryridden i visualise at any rate the winter firelight of our backparlour at dusk and the great emersoni knew he was great greater than any of our friendssitting in it between my parents before the lamps had been lighted as a visitor consentingly housed only could have done and affecting me the more as an apparition sinuously and i held elegantly slim benevolently aquiline and commanding a tone alien beautifully alien to any we heard roundabout that he bent this benignity upon me by an invitation to draw nearer to him off the hearthrug and know myself as never yet as i was not indeed to know myself again for years in touch with the wonder of boston the wonder of boston was above all just then and there for me in the sweetness of the voice and the finish of the speechthis latter through a sort of attenuated emphasis which at the same time made sounds more important more interesting in themselves than by any revelation yet vouchsafed us was not this my first glimmer of a sense that the human tone could in that independent and original way be interesting and didnt it for a long time keep me going however unwittingly in that faith carrying me in fact more or less on to my day of recognising that it took much more than simply not being of new york to produce the music i had listened to the point was that however that might be i had had given me there in the firelight an absolutely abiding measure if i didnt know from that hour forth quite all it was to not utter sounds worth mentioning i make out that i had at least the opposite knowledge and all by the operation of those signal momentsthe truth of which i find somehow reflected in the fact of my afterwards knowing one of our household rooms for the timeit must have been our only guestchamberas mr emersons room the evening firelight played so long for me upon the doorthat is to the length probably of three days the length of a childs impression but i must not let this carry me beyond the second note of the diary this time of may 1852 i do not wish this or that thing my fortune will procure i wish the great fortune said henry james and said it in the noblest sense the report has a beauty to me without my quite understanding it the union of the two voices in it signifies quite enough the last very relevant echo of my fathers by itself in the connection i hasten now to find in a communication that must have been of the summer of 1869 when dr wilkinson paid his only visit to americathis apparently of the briefest the letter to emerson from cambridge notes that his appearance there had been delayed       he may come tomorrow possibly if in the morning i will telegraph      you if in the evening i shall try to keep him over monday that you      may meet him here at dinner on that day but i fear this bothersome      sabbath and its motionless cars may play us a trick i shall hope      for a generous monday all the same and if that hope is baulked      shall owe sunday a blackeyeand will pay my debt on the first      suitable occasion i warrant you what an awkward story the letter      continues the nation today tells of charles sumner charless      burly voice has always had for me a dreadfully hollow sound as if      it came from a great copper vat and i have loved him but with fear      and trembling accordingly is he really like all american      politicians tricky or is the nationso careful about facts      ordinarilyonly slanderous carlyle nowadays is a palpable      nuisance if he holds to his present mouthing ways to the end he      will find no showman làbas to match him for i hold barnum a much      more innocent personage i shouldnt wonder if barnum grew      regenerate in some far off day by mere force of his democracy but      carlyles intellectual pride is so stupid that one can hardly      imagine anything able to cope with it  the following in so different a key is of some seven years earlier dateapparently 62 but i have let it stand over for reasons that it may figure here as the last of the communications addressed to emerson that i shall cite written at an hotel the tremont house in boston it marks his having come up from newport for attendance at some meeting of a diningclub highly distinguished in composition as it still happily remains of which he was a memberthough but so occasionally present that this circumstance perhaps explains a little the even more than usual vivacity of his impression not indeed i may add that mustered reasons or apologies were ever much called for in any case of the play of that really prime note of his spontaneity       i go to concord in the morning but shall have barely time to see      you there even if i do as much as that so that i cant forbear to      say to you now the word i wanted as to my impression of yesterday      about hawthorne and ellery channing hawthorne isnt to me a      prepossessing figure nor apparently at all an enjoying person in      any way he has all the while the lookor would have to the      unknowingof a rogue who suddenly finds himself in a company of      detectives but in spite of his rusticity i felt a sympathy for      him fairly amounting to anguish and couldnt take my eyes off him      all dinner nor my rapt attention as that indecisive little dr      hedge9 found i am afraid to his cost for i hardly heard a word      of what he kept on saying to me and resented his maliciously      putting his artificial person between me and the profitable object      of study it isnt however that i now feel any illwill to himi      could recommend anyone but myself to go and hear him preach the      thing was that hawthorne seemed to me to possess human substance      and not to have dissipated it all away like that culturally      debauched  or even like good inoffensive comforting      longfellow john forbes and you kept up the human balance at the      other end of the table but my region was a desert with h for its      only oasis it was so pathetic to see him contented sprawling      concord owl that he was and always has been brought blindfold into      that brilliant daylight and expected to wink and be lively like      some dapper tommy titmouse i felt him bury his eyes in his plate      and eat with such voracity that no one should dare to speak to him      my heart broke for him as his attenuated lefthand neighbour kept      putting forth his long antennae to stroke his face and try      whether his eyes were open it was heavenly to see him persist in      ignoring the spectral smilesin eating his dinner and doing      nothing but that and then go home to his concord den to fall upon      his knees and ask his heavenly father why it was that an owl      couldnt remain an owl and not be forced into the diversions of a      canary i have no doubt that all the tenderest angels saw to his      case that night and poured oil into his wounds more soothing than      gentlemen ever know w ellery channing too seemed so human and      goodsweet as summer and fragrant as pinewoods he is more      sophisticated than hawthorne of course but still he was kin and i      felt the world richer by two men who had not yet lost themselves      in mere members of society this is what i suspectthat we are      fast getting so fearful one to another we members of society      that we shall ere long begin to kill one another in selfdefence      and give place in that way at last to a more veracious state of      things the old world is breaking up on all hands the glimpse of      the everlasting granite i caught in h and w e shows me that      there is stock enough left for fifty better let the old impostors      go bag and baggage for a very real and substantial one is aching      to come in in which the churl shall not be exalted to a place of      dignity in which innocence shall never be tarnished nor trafficked      in in which every mans freedom shall be respected down to its      feeblest filament as the radiant altar of god to the angels says      swedenborg death means resurrection to life by that necessary      rule of inversion which keeps them separate from us and us from      them and so prevents our being mutual nuisances let us then      accept political and all other distraction that chooses to come      because what is disorder and wrath and contention on the surface is      sure to be the greatest peace at the centre working its way thus      to a surface that shall never be disorderly  but it is in the postscript that the mixture and the transition strike me as most inevitable       werent you shocked at s engagement to think of that prim old      snuffers imposing himself on that pure young flame what a world      what a world but once we get rid of slavery the new heavens and      new earth will swim into reality  no better example could there be i think of my fathers remarkable and constant belief proof against all confusion in the imminence of a transformationscene in human affairsspiritually speaking of course alwayswhich was to be enacted somehow without gross or vulgar visibility or at least violence as i have said but was none the less straining to the front and all by reason of the worlds being deep within and at heart as he conceived so achingly anxious for it he had the happinessthough not so untroubled all the while doubtless as some of his declarations would appear to representof being able to see his own period and environment as the field of the sensible change and thereby as a great historic hour that is i at once subjoin i more or less suppose he had his measure of the imminent and immediate of the socially and historically visible and sensible was not a thing easy to answer for and when treated to any one of the loud vaticinations or particular revolutionary messages and promises our age was to have so much abounded in all his sense of proportion and of the whole of the real and the ridiculous asserted itself with the last emphasis in that mixture in him of faith and humour criticism and conviction that mark of a love of his kind which fed on discriminations and was never so moved to a certain extravagance as by an exhibited above all by a cultivated or in the least sententious vagueness in respect to these dwelt largely the original charm the peculiarly social and living challenge in that it was so straight and bright a reflection of life of his talk and temper almost all of my father shines for me at any rate in the above passages and in another that follows with their so easy glide from discrimination as i have called it that is from analytic play in the outward sphere to serenity of synthesis and confidence and high joy in the inward it was as if he might have liked so to see his fellowhumans fellowdiners fellowcelebrities or whatever in that acuity of individual salience in order to proceed thence to some enormous final doubt or dry renouncementinstead of concluding on the contrary and on the same free and familiar note to the eminently worth while character of life or its susceptibility to vast and happy conversions with which too more than i can say have i the sense here of his so finely contentious or genially perverse impulse to carry his wares of observation to the market in which they would on the whole bring least rather than mostwhere his offering them at all would produce rather a flurry there might have been markets in which it had been known to produce almost a scandal and where he would in fact give them away for nothing if thereby he might show that such produce grew never was there more of a case of the direct friendliness to startling growthsif so they might be heldof the very soil that lies under our windows i dont think he liked to scandalisecertainly he didnt in the least for scandals sake but nothing inspired him more to the act and the pleasure of appreciation for appropriation as it might be termed than the deprecating attitude of others on such groundthat degree of shyness of appropriation on their part which practically left appreciation vague it was true that the appreciation for a human use as it might be calledthat is for the high optimistic transitioncould here carry the writer far     vii   i find markedly relevant at this point a letter from newport in the autumn of 61 to another correspondent one of a series several other examples of which no less successfully appeal to me even though it involve my going back a little to place three or four of these latter written at geneva in 1860 mrs william tappan primarily caroline sturgis of boston was for long years and to the end of her life our very great friend and one of my fathers most constant and most considered interlocutors both on the ground of his gravity and on that of his pleasantry she had spent in europe with her husband and her two small daughters very much the same years from early in the summer of 55 till late in the autumn of 60 that we had been spending and like ourselves though with less continuity for the time she had come to live at newport where with no shadow of contention but with an admirable intelligence of the incurably ironic or mocking order she was such a light free somewhat intellectually perverse but socially impulsive presence always for instance insatiably hospitable as our mustered circle could ill have spared if play of mind which she carried to any point of quietlysmiling audacity that might be had not already become a noted in fact i think the very most noted value among us it would have seated itself there in her person with a nervous animation a refinement of what might have been called soundable sincerity that left mere plump assurance in such directions far in the lurch and she was interesting she became fairly historic with the drawingout of the years as almost the only survivor of that young band of the ardent and uplifted who had rallied in the other time to the transcendental standard the movement for organised candour of conversation on almost all conceivable or inconceivable things which appeared with whatever looseness to find its prime inspirer in emerson and become more familiarly if a shade less authentically vocal in margaret fuller hungry ever so cheerfully and confidently hungry had been much of the new england and peculiarly the boston of those days but with no such outreaching of the wellscoured empty platter it probably would have struck one as by the occasional and quite individual agitation of it from some ruefullyobserved doorstep of the best society it was from such a doorstep that caroline sturgis had originally taken her restless flight just as it was on such another that after a course of infinite freedom of inquiry and irony she in the later time with a fortune inherited an hospitality extended and a genial gravity of expression confirmed alighted again to the no small reenrichment of a company of friends who had had meanwhile scarce any such intellectual adventures as she was to retain in a delicate and casual irreverence the just slightly sharp fragrance or fine asperity of but who might cultivate with complacency and in support of the general claim to comprehensive culture and awareness unafraid the legend of her vicarious exposure  mr frank sanborns school which i have already mentioned and to which the following alludes was during the years immediately preceding the war as during those of the war itself the last word of what was then accounted the undauntedly modern flourishing as it did under the patronage of the most advanced thought the coeducational idea had up to that time if i mistake not taken on no such confident and consistent certainly no such graceful or plausible form small boys and big boys boys from near and boys from far consorted there and cohabited so far as community of board and lodging and of study and sport went with little girls and great girls mainly under the earnest tutoring and eldersistering of young women accomplished as scholarly accomplishment in such cases was then understood but with mr sanborn himself of course predominantly active and instructional and above all with the further felicity of the participation of the generous emerson family by sympathy and interest and the protective spread of the rich mantle of their presence the case had been from the first a frank and hightoned experiment a step down from the tonic air as was so considerably felt of radical conviction to the firm ground of radical application that is of happy demonstrationan admittedly new and trustful thing but all the brighter and wiser all the more nobly and beautifully workable for that with but the scantest direct observation of the attempted demonstrationdemonstration that is of the excellent fruit such a grafting might producei yet imagine the enacted and considerably prolonged scene it lasted a whole decade to have heaped perfectly full the measure of what it proposed the interesting the curious the characteristic thing was just however i seem to make outi seemed to have made out even at the timein the almost complete absence of difficulty it might almost then be said of the affair that it hadnt been difficult enough for interest even should one insist on treating it as sufficiently complicated or composed for picture the great war was to leave so many things changed the country over so many elements added to say nothing of others subtracted in the american consciousness at large that even though the coeducational idea taking to itself strength has during these later years pushed its conquests to the very verge of demonstration of its inevitable limits my memory speaks to me of the concord school rather as of a supreme artless word on the part of the old social order than as a charged intimation or announcement on the part of the new the later arrangements more or less in its likeness and when on a considerable scale have appeared to attentive observation i think mere endlessly multiplied notes of the range of high spirits in the light heart of communities more aware on the whole of the size and number of their opportunity of the boundless spaces the possible undertakings the uncritical minds and the absent standards about them than of matters to be closely and preparedly reckoned with they have been comparatively speaking experiments in the voidthe great void that may spread so smilingly between wide natural borders before complications have begun to grow the name of the complication before the fact is very apt to be the discoverywhich latter term was so promptly to figure for the faith that living and working more intimately together than had up to then been conceived possible would infinitely improve both the condition and the performance of the brother and sister sexes it takes long in new communities for discoveries to become complicationsthough complications become discoveries doubtless often in advance of this the large vague area with its vast marginal ease over which confidence could run riot and new kinds of human relation elatedly proposed flourish in the sun was to shift to different ground the question the concord school had played with during its term of life on its smaller stage under the great new england elms and maples and in the preoccupied new england air  the preoccupation had been in a large measure it is true exactly with such possibilities such bright fresh answers to old stale riddles as mr sanborn and his friends clubbed together to supply but i can only for my argument recover the sense of my single visit to the scene which must have been in the winter of 6263 i think and which put before me as i seem now to make out some suggested fit of perversitynot desperate quite harmless rather and almost frivolously futile on the part of a particular little world that had been thrown back upon itself for very boredom and after a spell of much admired talking and other beating of the air wanted for a change to do something the question it played with i just advisedly saidfor what could my impression have been personally if indirectly gathered and with my admirably communicative younger brother to testify but that if as a school in strict parlance the thing was scarce more than naught as a prolonged pastime it was scarce less than charming and quite filled up in that direction its ample and original measure i have to reckon i here allow with the trick of what i used irrepressibly to read into things in front of which i found myself for gaping purposes planted by some unquestioned outer force it seemed so prescribed to me so imposed on me to read more as through some everfelt claim for roundness of aspect and intensity of effect in presented matters whatever they might be than the conscience of the particular affair itself was perhaps developed enough to ask of it the experience of many of the concord pupils during the freshness of the experiment must have represented for them a free and yet ever so conveniently conditioned taste of the idyllicsuch possibilities of perfect good comradeship between unsuspected and unalarmed youths and maidens on a comprehensive ground that really exposed the business to a light and put it to a test as they were never again to see so favoured in every way by circumstance and one may quite emphatically say by atmosphere it is the atmosphere that comes back to me as most of all the making of the story even when inhaled but by an occasional whiff and from afarthe manner of my own inhaling in that air of charmed and cultivated good faith nothing for which the beautiful might be so presumingly claimedif only claimed with a sufficiently brave clean emphasiswouldnt have worked which was the great thing every one must have felt that what was aspired to did work and as i catch the manyvoiced report of it again manyvoiced but pretty well suffused with one clear tone this of inflections irreproducible now i seem to listen in convinced admiration though not by any means in stirred envy to the cheerful clatter of its working my failure of envy has however no mite of historic importance proving as it does nothing at all but that if we had in the family sense so distinctly turned our back on europe the distinctness was at no point so marked as in our facing so straight to such a picture by which i mean to such an exhibition as my fathers letter throws off without knowledge of the letter at the time i yet measured the situation much as he did and enjoyed it as he did because it would have been stupid not to but from that to any wishful vision of being in it or of it would have been a long jump of which i was unabashedly incapable to have broken so personally so all but catastrophically with europe as we had done affected me as the jump sufficient we had landed somewhere in quite another world or at least on the sharp edge of one and in the single particular sense could i as time then went on feel myself at all moved with the helpless the baffled visionary way of it to push further in what straight solicitation that phase of the american scene could exertmore coercive to the imagination than any we were ever again as americans to knowi shall presently try to explain but this was an intensely different matter       i buried two of my children yesterdayat concord mass and feel      so heartbroken this morning that i shall need to adopt two more      instantly to supply their place and lo and behold you and william      present yourselves or if you decline the honour ellen and baby      mary and i trotted forth last wednesday bearing wilky and bob in      our arms to surrender them to the famous mr sanborn the yellowest      sunshine and an atmosphere of balm were all over the goodly land      while the maple the oak and the dogwood showered such splendours      upon the eye as made the champs elysées and the bois appear      parvenus and comical mrs clark is a graceless enough woman      outwardly but so tenderly feathered inwardly so unaffectedly kind      and motherly toward the urchins under her roof that one was glad      to leave them in that provident nest she has three or four other      schoolboarders one of them a daughter of john browntall erect      longhaired and freckled as john browns daughter has a right to      be i kissed her inwardly between the eyes and inwardly heard      the martyred johannes chuckle over the fat inheritance of love and      tenderness he had after all bequeathed to his children in all good      mens minds an arch little miss plumley also lives there with      eyes full of laughter and a mouth like a bed of lilies bordered      with roses how it is going to be possible for my two boys to      pursue their studies in the midst of that bewilderment i dont      clearly see i am only sure of one thing which is that if i had      had such educational advantages as that in my youth i should      probably have been now far more nearly ripe for this worlds      business we asked to see miss waterman one of the teachers      quartered in the house in order to say to her how much we should      thank her if she would occasionally put out any too lively spark      she might see fall on the expectant tinder of my poor boys bosoms      but miss w herself proved of so siliceous a quality on      inspectionwith round tender eyes young fair and womanlythat i      saw in her only new danger and no promise of safety my present      conviction is that a general conflagration is inevitable ending in      the total combustion of all that i hold dear on that spot yet i      cant but felicitate our native land that such magnificent      experiments in education go on among us       then we drove to emersons and waded up to our knees through a      harvest of apples and pears which tired of their mere outward or      carnal growth had descended to the loving bosom of the lawn there      or elsewhere to grow inwardly meet for their heavenly rest in the      veins of ellen the saintly and others until at last we found the      cordial pan himself in the midst of his household breezy with      hospitality and blowing exhilarating trumpets of welcome age has      just the least in the world dimmed the lustre we once knew but an      unmistakable breath of the morning still encircles him and the      odour of primaeval woods pitchpine is not more pagan than he      continues to be and acorns as little confess the gardeners skill      still i insist that he is a voluntary pan that it is a condition      of mere wilfulness and insurrection on his part contingent upon a      mercilessly sound digestion and an uncommon imaginative influx and      i have no doubt that even he as the years ripen will at last      admit nature to be tributary and not supreme however this be we      consumed juicy pears to the diligent music of pans pipe while      ellen and edith softly gathered themselves upon two low stools in      the chimneycorner saying never a word nor looking a look but      apparently hemming their handkerchiefs and good mrs stearns who      sat by the window and seemed to be the village dressmaker ever and      anon glanced at us over her spectacles as if to say that never      before has she seen this wondrous pan so glistening with dewdrops      then and upon the waves of that friendly music we were duly wafted      to our educational zion and carefully made over our good and      promising and affectionate boys to the schoolmasters keeping out      into the field beside his house sanborn incontinently took us to      show how his girls and boys perform together their worship of      hygeia it was a glimpse into that new world wherein dwelleth      righteousness and which is full surely fast coming upon our      children and our childrens children and i could hardly keep      myself as i saw my childrens eyes drink in the mingled work and      play of the inspiring scene from shouting out a joyful nunc      dimittis the short of the story is that we left them and rode home      robbed of our plumage feeling sore and ugly and only hoping that      they wouldnt die any of these cold winter days before the      parental breast could get there to warm them back to life or cheer      them on to a better       mrs william hunt has just come in to tell the good news of your      near advent and that she has found the exact house for you      instigated to that activity by one of your angels of the hooper      band with whom she has been in correspondence i dont thank angel      hooper for putting angel hunt upon that errand since i should like      to have had the merit of it myself i suspect the rent is what it      ought to be if its not i will lay by something every week for you      toward it and have no doubt we shall stagger through the cold      weather  i gather from the above the very flower of my fathers irrepressible utterance of his constitutional optimism that optimism fed so little by any sense of things as they were or are but rich in its vision of the facility with which they might become almost at any moment or from one day to the other totally and splendidly different a less vague or vain idealist couldnt i think have been encountered it was given him to catch in the fact at almost any turn right or left some flagrant assurance or promise of the state of man transfigured the concord school could be to him for the hourthere were hours and hourssuch a promise could even figure in that light to his amplifying sympathy in a degree disproportionate to its genial but after all limited after all not so intensely inflated as he would have said sense of itself in which light it is that i recognise and even to elation how little practically of the idea of the revolution in the vulgar or violent sense was involved in his seeing so many things in the whole social order about him and in the interest of their being more or less immediately altered as lamentably and yet at the same time and under such a coloured light as amusingly and illustratively wrongwrong that is with a blundering helpless human salience that kept criticism humorous kept it so to speak sociable and almost sympathetic even when readiest the case was really of his rather feeling so vast a rightness close at hand or lurking immediately behind actual arrangements that a single turn of the inward wheel one real response to pressure of the spiritual spring would bridge the chasms straighten the distortions rectify the relations and in a word redeem and vivify the whole massafter a far sounder yet one seemed to see also far subtler fashion than any that our spasmodic annals had yet shown us it was of course the old story that we had only to be with more intelligence and faithan immense deal more certainlyin order to work off in the happiest manner the manysided ugliness of life which was a process that might go on blessedly in the quietest of all quiet ways that wouldnt be blood and fire and tears or would be none of these things stupidly precipitated it would simply have taken place by enjoyed communication and contact enjoyed concussion or convulsion evensince pangs and agitations the very agitations of perception itself are of the highest privilege of the soul and there is always thank goodness a saving sharpness of play or complexity of consequence in the intelligence completely alive the meaning of which remarks for myself i must be content to add is that the optimists of the world the constructive idealists as one has mainly known them have too often struck one as overlooking more of the aspects of the real than they recognise whereas our indefeasible impression williams and mine of our parent was that he by his very constitution and intimate heritage recognised many more of those than he overlooked what was the finest part of our intercourse with himthat is the most nutritivebut a positive record of that such a matter as that the factitious had absolutely no hold on him was the truest thing about him and it was all the while present to us i think as backing up his moral authority and play of vision that never for instance had there been a more numerous and candid exhibition of all the human susceptibilities than in the nest of his original nurture i have spoken of the fashion in which i still see him after the years attentively bent over those much rewritten papers that we had even at our stupidest this warrant for going in vague admiration of that they caught the eye even the most filially detached with a final face of wrought clarity and thereby of beauty that there could be no thinking unimportantand see him also fall back from the patient posture again and again in long fits of remoter consideration wondering pondering sessions into which i think i was more often than not moved to read for the fine interest and colour of it some story of acute inward difficulty amounting for the time to discouragement if one wanted drama there was drama and of the most concrete and most immediately offered to ones view and ones suspense to the point verily as might often occur of making one go roundabout it on troubled tiptoe even as one would have held ones breath at the play  these opposed glimpses i say hang before me as i look back but really fuse together in the vivid picture of the fond scribe separated but by a pane of glasshis particular preference was always directly to face the windowfrom the general human condition he was so devoutly concerned with he saw it through the near glass saw it in such detail and with a feeling for it that broke down nowherethat was the great thing which truth it confirmed that his very fallings back and long waits and stays and almost stricken musings witnessed exactly to his intensity the intensity that would come out after all and make his passionate philosophy and the fullest array of the appearances that couldnt be blinked fit together and harmonise detached as i could during all those years perhaps queerly enough believe myself it would still have done my young mind the very greatest violence to have to suppose that any plane of conclusion for him however rich and harmonious he might tend to make conclusion could be in the nature of a fools paradise small vague outsider as i was i couldnt have borne that possibility and i see as i return to the case how little i really could ever have feared it this would have amounted to fearing it on account of his genialitya shocking supposition as if his geniality had been thin and bête patched up and poor and not by the straightest connections nominal and other of the very stuff of his genius no i feel myself complacently look back to my never having even at my small poorest been so bête either as to conceive he might be wrong wrong as a thinkerout in his own way of the great mysteries because of the interest and amusement and vividness his attesting spirit could fling over the immediate ground what he saw there at least could be so enlightening so evocatory could fall in sowhich was to the most inspiring effect within the range of perception of a scant son who was doubtless as to the essential already more than anything else a novelist en herbe if it didnt sound in a manner patronising i should say that i saw that my father saw and that i couldnt but have given my own case away by not believing however obscurely in the virtue of his consequent and ultimate synthesis of course i never dreamed of any such name for iti only thought of it as something very great and fine founded on those forces in him that came home to us and that touched us all the while as these were extraordinary forces of sympathy and generosity and that yet knew how to be such without falsifying any minutest measure the structure raised upon them might well it would seem and even to the uppermost sublime reaches be as valid as it was beautiful if he so endeared himself wasnt it one asked as time went on through his never having sentimentalised or merely meditated away so to call it the least embarrassment of the actual about him and having with a passion peculiarly his own kept together his stream of thought however transcendent and the stream of life however humanised there was a kind of experiential authority in his basis as he felt his basisthere being no human predicament he couldnt by a sympathy more like direct experience than any i have known enter into and this authority which concluded so to a widening and brightening of the philosophicfor him the spiritualsky made his character as intercourse disclosed it in a high degree fascinating these things i think however are so happily illustrated in his letters that they look out from almost any continuous passage in such a series for instance as those addressed in the earlier time to mrs tappan his tone that is always so effectually looks out and the living parts of him so singularly hung together that one may fairly say his philosophy was his tone to cite a few passages here is at the same time to go back to a previous year or twowhich my examples i hold make worth while he had been on a visit to paris toward the winters end of 60 and had returned to geneva whence he writes early in april       so sleepy have i been ever since my return from paris that i am      utterly unfit to write letters i was thoroughly poisoned by      tobacco in those horrid railway carriages and this with want of      sleep knocked me down i am only half awake still and will not      engage consequently in any of those profound inquiries which your      remembrance always suggests       i am very sorry for you that you live in an excommunicated country      or next door to it and i dont wonder at your wanting to get away      but it is provoking to think that but for your other plan      switzerland might possess you all for the summer it is doubtless      in part this disappointment that will unsettle us in our present      moorings and take us probably soon to germany what after that i      have no idea and am always so little wilful about our movements      that i am ready the young ones should settle them so we may be in      europe a good while yet always providing that war keep smooth his      wrinkled front and allow us quiet newspapers they must fight in      italy for some time to come but between england and france is the      main point if they can hold aloof from tearing each other we      shall manage otherwise we go home at once to escape the universal      spatter that must then ensue       what is the meaning of all these wars and rumours of wars no      respectable person ever seems to occupy himself with the question      but i cant help feeling it more interesting than anything in homer      or plato or the gallery of the vatican i long daily with      unappeasable longing for a righteous life such a life as i am sure      is implied in every human possibility and myriads are bearing me      company what does this show but that the issue is near out of all      our existing chaos all our evil is fossil and comes from the mere      persistence of diseased institutions in pretending to rule us when      we ought to be left free to be living spirits of god there is no      fresh evil in the world no one now steals or commits murder or      any other offence with the least relish for it but only to revenge      his poor starved opportunities the superiority of america in      respect to freedom of thought over europe comes from this fact that      she has so nearly achieved her deliverance from such tyrannies all      she now needs to make her right is simply an intelligent      recognition of her spiritual whereabouts if she had this she would      put her hand to the work splendidly you and i when we get home      will try to quicken her intelligence in that respect will do at      any rate our best to put away this pestilent munching of the tree      of knowledge of good and evil and persuade to the belief of mans      unmixed innocence  which it will easily be seen was optimism with a vengeance and marked especially in the immediacy the state of being at hand for him of a social redemption what made this the more signal was its being so unattended with visions the least apocalyptic or convulsional the better order slipping in amid the worse and superseding it so insidiously so quietly and by a fair measure so easily it was a faith and an accompanying philosophy that couldnt be said not to be together simplifying and yet nothing was more unmistakable when we saw them at close range i repeat than that they werent unnourished werent what he himself would as i hear him have called the flatulent fruit of sentimentality  his correspondent had in a high degree by her vivacity of expression the art of challenging hisas is markedly apparent from a letter the date of which fails beyond its being of the same stay at geneva and of the winters end       if i had really imagined that i had bored you and your husband so      very little while i was in paris in december i should long since      have repeated the experiment the more surely that i want so much      to see again my darling nieces and delight myself in the abundance      of their largeeyed belief our alice is still under      disciplinepreparing to fulfil some high destiny or other in the      future by reducing decimal fractions to their lowest possible rate      of subsistence where they often grow so attenuated under her rapid      little fingers that my poor old eyes can no longer see them at all      i shall go before long to england and then perhaps but i shant      promise anything on her behalf       you ask me why i do not brandish my tomahawk and like walt      whitman raise my barbaric yawp over the roofs of all the houses      it is because i am not yet a cosmos as that gentleman avowedly      is but only a very dim nebula doing its modest best no doubt to      solidify into cosmical dimensions but still requiring an awful      sight of time and pains and patience on the part of its friends      you evidently fancy that cosmoses are born to all the faculty they      shall ever have like ducks no such thing there is no respectable      cosmos but what is born to such a vapoury and even gaseous      inheritance as requires long centuries of conflict on its part to      overcome the same and become pronounced or educated in its proper      mineral vegatable or animal order ducks are born perfect that is      to say they utter the same unmodified unimproved quack on their      dying pillow that they uttered on their natal day whereas cosmoses      are destined to a life of such surprising change that you may say      their career is an incessant disavowal of their birth or that      their highest maturation consists in their utter renunciation of      their natural father and mother you transcendentalists make the      fatal mistake of denying education of sundering present from past      and future from present these things are indissolubly one the      present deriving its consciousness only from the past and the      future drawing all its distinctive wisdom from our present      experience the law is the same with the individual as it is with      the race none of us can dodge the necessity of regeneration of      disavowing our natural ancestry in order to come forth in our own      divinelygiven proportions the secret of this necessity ought to      reconcile us to it however onerous the obligation it imposes for      that secret is nothing more nor less than this that we cosmoses      have a plenary divine origin and are bound eventually to see that      divinity reproduced in our most familiar and trivial experience      even down to the length of our shoeties if the deity were an      immense duck capable only of emitting an eternal quack we of course      should all have been born webfooted each as infallible in his way      as the pope nor ever have been at the expense and bother of      swimmingschools but he is a perfect man incapable of the      slightest quackery capable only of every honest and modest and      helpful purpose and these are perfections to which manifestly no      one is born but only reborn we come to such states not by      learning only by unlearning no natural edification issues in      spiritual architecture of this splendour but only a natural      demolition or undoing i dimly recognise this great truth and      hence hold more to a present imbecility than to a too eager      efficiency i feel myself more fit to be knocked about for some      time yet and vastated of my natural vigour than to commence cosmos      and raise the barbaric yawp time enough for that when i am fairly      finished say what we will you and i are all the while at school      just now the genial pedagogue may give you so little of the ferule      as to leave you to doubt whether you really are there but this      only proves what a wonderful pedagogue it is and how capable of      adapting himself to everyone  his friend in paris found herself at that time like many other persons much interested in the exercise of automatic writing of which we have since so abundantly heard and as to which she had communicated some striking observations       your letter is full of details that interest but dont      fascinate i havent a doubt of a single experience you allege and      do not agree with your friend count s your writing of this name      is obscure that the world of spirits is not an element in your      writing i am persuaded now for a long time of the truth of these      phenomena and feel no inclination to dispute or disparage them but      at the same time i feel to such a degree my own remoteness from      them that i am sure i could never get any personal contact with      them the state of mind exposing one to influences of this nature      and which makes them beneficial to it is a sceptical state and      this i have never known for a moment spiritual existence has      always been more real to me i was going to say than natural and      when accordingly i am asked to believe in the spiritual world      because my senses are getting to reveal it i feel as if the ground      of my conviction were going to be weakened rather than      strengthened of course i should have very little respect for      spiritual things which didnt ultimately report themselves to      sense which didnt indeed subside into things of sense as      logically as a house into its foundations but what i deny is that      spiritual existence can be directly known on earthknown otherwise      than by correspondence or inversely the letter of every revelation      must be directly hostile to its spirit and only inversely      accordant because the very pretension of revelation is that its a      descent an absolute coming down of truth a humiliation of it      from its own elevated and habitual plane to a lower one       admit therefore that the facts of spiritualism are all true      admit that persons really deceased have been communicating with you      about the state of europe the approaching crisis and the persons      known to us whom you name in that case i should insist that to      possess the slightest spiritual interest their revelation should      be retranslated into the spiritual tongue by correspondences      because as to any spirit knowing or caring to know those persons      or being bothered about any crisis of ours that is to me simply      incredible such matters have in each case doubtless some spiritual      or substantial counterpart answering in every particular to its      superficial features and wilkinson and emerson for instance with      the others are of course shadows of some greater or less spiritual      quantities but ill be hanged if theres the slightest sensible      accord between the substance and the semblance on either hand your      spirits no doubt give you the very communications you report to      me only wilkinson spiritually interpreted and emerson spiritually      interpreted mean things so very different from our two friends of      those denominations that if our spiritual eye were for a moment      open to discern the difference i think it highly probableim sure      it is infinitely possiblewe should renounce their acquaintance       but i have harped on this string long enough let me change the      tune your spirits tell you to repose in what they are doing for      you and with a pathos to which i am not insensible say rest now      poor child your struggles have been great clasp peace to your      bosom at last and as a general thing our ears are saluted by      assurances that these communications are all urged by philanthropy      and that everyone so addressing us wants in some way to help and      elevate us but just this is to my mind the unpleasant side of the      business i have been so long accustomed to see the most arrant      deviltry transact itself in the name of benevolence that the moment      i hear a profession of goodwill from almost any quarter i      instinctively look about for a constable or place my hand within      reach of the bellrope my ideal of human intercourse would be a      state of things in which no man will ever stand in need of any      other mans help but will derive all his satisfaction from the      great social tides which own no individual names i am sure no man      can be put in a position of dependence upon another without that      others very soon becomingif he accepts the duties of the      relationutterly degraded out of his just human proportions no      man can play the deity to his fellow man with impunityi mean      spiritual impunity of course for see if i am at all satisfied      with that relation if it contents me to be in a position of      generosity toward others i must be remarkably indifferent at      bottom to the gross social inequality which permits that position      and instead of resenting the enforced humiliation of my fellow man      to myself in the interests of humanity i acquiesce in it for the      sake of the profit it yields to my own selfcomplacency i do hope      the reign of benevolence is over until that event occurs i am sure      the reign of god will be impossible but i have a shocking bad cold      that racks my head to bursting almost i cant think to any      purpose let me hear soon from you that i have not been      misunderstood i wouldnt for the world seem wilfully to depreciate      what you set a high value on no i really cant help my judgments      and i always soften them to within an inch of their life as it is  the following no longer from the hotel de lecu but from 5 quai du mont blanc would indicate that his dear queen caroline as he addresses her was at no loss to defend her own view of the matters in discussion between them in which warm light indeed it is that i was myself in the after years ever most amusedly to see her       dont scold a fellow so exert your royal gifts in exalting only      the lowly and humbling only the proud precisely what i like to      get extricated from metaphysics is encouragement from a few      persons like yourself such encouragement as would lie in your      intelligent apprehension and acknowledgment of the great result      of metaphysics which is a godly and spotless life on earth if i      could find anyone apt to that doctrine i should not work so hard      metaphysically to convince the world of its truth and as for being      a metaphysical jack horner the thing is contradictory as no      metaphysician whose studies are sincere ever felt tempted to      selfcomplacency or disposed to reckon himself a good boy such      exaltations are not for him but only for the artists and poets      who dazzle the eyes of mankind and dont recoil from the darkness      they themselves produceas dryden says or collins  mrs tappan spending the month of june in london continued to impute for the time i infer i seem to remember a later complete detachment a livelier importance to the supernatural authors of her writing than her correspondent was disposed to admit but almost anything was a quickener of the correspondents own rich that is always so animated earnestness he had to feel an interlocutors general sympathy or recognise a moral relation even if a disturbed one for the deep tide of his conviction to rise outwardly higher but when that happened the tide overflowed indeed       my dear carolinaneither north nor south but an eminently free      state with no exulting shout of master and no groan of captive to      be heard in all its borders but only the cheerful hum of happy      husband and childrenhow do you find london here in geneva we are      so saturate with sunshine that we would fain dive to the depths of      the lake to learn coolness of the little fishes still we dont      envy your two weeks of unbroken rain in dear dismal london what a      preparation for doing justice to lenox you see i knowthrough      mary tweedy who has a hearty appreciation of her london      privileges how are a d and all the rest of them familiar      spirits are they not on a short acquaintanceand how pleasant      an aspect it gives to the middle kingdom to think you shall be sure      to find there such lovers and friends only let us keep them at a      proper distance it doesnt do for us ever to accept another only      at that others own estimate of himself if we do we may as well      plunge into tartarus at once no human being can afford to commit      his happiness to anothers keeping or what is the same thing      forego his own individuality with all that it imports the first      requisite of our true relationship to each other spiritually      speaking is that we be wholly independent of each other then we      may give ourselves away as much as we please we shall do neither      them nor ourselves any harm but until that blessed day comes by      the advance of a scientific society among men we shall be utterly      unworthy to love each other or be loved in return we shall do      nothing but prey upon each other and turn each others life to      perfect weariness       the more of it then just now the better the more we bite and      devour each other the more horribly the newspapers abound in all      the evidences of our disgusting disorganisation the      disorganisation of the old world the readier will our dull ears be      to listen to the tidings of the new world which is aching to      appear the world wherein dwelleth righteousness dont abuse the      newspapers therefore publicly but tell everybody of the use they      are destined to promote and set others upon the lookout a d is      a very good woman i havent a doubt but will fast grow a better      one if she would let herself alone and me also and all other mere      persons while she diligently inquires about the lord that is      about that lustrous universal life which gods providence is now      forcing upon mens attention and which will obliterate for ever all      this exaggeration of our personalities it is very well for lovers      to abase themselves in this way to each other because love is a      passion of ones naturethat is to say the lover is not      selfpossessed but is lifted for a passing moment to the level of      the lords life in the race and so attuned to higher issues ever      after in his own proper sphere but these experiences are purely      disciplinary and not final all passion is a mere inducement to      action and when at last activity really dawns in us we drop this      faculty of hallucination that we have been under about persons and      see and adore the abounding divinity which is in all persons alike      who will then ever be caught in that foolish snare again i did      nothing but tumble into it from my boyhood up to my marriage since      which great disillusioningyesi feel that the only lovable      person is one who will never permit himself to be loved but i have      written on without any intention and have now no time to say what      alone i intended how charming and kind and long to be remembered      you were all those paris days give my love to honest william and      tell my small nieces that i pine to pluck again the polished      cherries of their cheeks my wife admires and loves you  from which i jump considerably forward for its privately historic value to a communication from newport of the middle of august 63 my fathers two younger sons had one the previous and one at the beginning of the current year obtained commissions in the volunteer army as a sequel to which my next younger brother as adjutant of the fiftyfourth massachusetts colonel robert shaws regiment the first body of coloured soldiers raised in the north had received two grave wounds in that unsuccessful attack on fort wagner from which the gallant young leader of the movement was not to return       wilky had a bad day yesterday and kept me busy or i shouldnt have      delayed answering your inquiries till today he is very severely      wounded both in the ankle and in the sidewhere he doesnt heal so      fast as the doctor wishes in consequence of the shell having made a      pouch which collects matter and retards nature they cut it open      yesterday and today he is better or will be the wound in the      ankle was made by a cannister ball an inch and a half in diameter      which lodged eight days in the foot and was finally dislodged by      cutting down through the foot and taking it out at the sole he      is excessively weak unable to do anything but lie passive even      to turn himself on his pillow he will probably have a slow and      tedious recoverythe doctors say of a year at least but he knows      nothing of this himself and speaks so far as he does talk but of      going back in the fall if you write please say nothing of this he      is so distressed at the thought of a long sickness he is vastly      attached to the negrosoldier cause believes i think that the      world has existed for it and is sure that enormous results to      civilisation are coming out of it we heard from bob this morning      at morris island with his regiment building earthworks and      mounting guns hot he says but breezy also that the shells make      for them every few minuteswhile he and his men betake themselves      to the trenches and holes in the earth like so many landcrabs in      distress he writes in the highest spirits cabot russell wilkys      dearest friend is we fear a prisoner and wounded we hear      nothing decisive but the indications point that way poor wilky      cries aloud for his friends gone and missing and i could hardly      have supposed he might be educated so suddenly up to serious      manhood altogether as he appears to have been i hear from frank      shaw this morning and they are all welland admirable  this goes beyond the moment i had lately and doubtless too lingeringly reached as i say just as i shall here find convenience in borrowing a few passages from my small handful of letters of the time to followto the extent of its not following by a very long stretch such a course keeps these fragments of record together as scattering them would perhaps conduce to some leakage in their characteristic tone for which i desire all the fulness it can keep impossible moreover not in some degree to yield on the spot to any brush of the huge procession of those particular months and years even though i shall presently take occasion to speak as i may of my own so inevitably contracted consciousness of what the brush with its tremendous possibilities of violence could consist of in the given case i had under stress to content myself with knowing it in a more indirect and muffled fashion than might easily have beeneven should one speak of it but as a matter of mere vision of the eyes or quickened wonder of the mind or heaviness of the heart as a matter in fine of the closer and more inquiring to say nothing of the more agitated approach all of which none the less was not to prevent the whole quite indescribably intensified timeintensified through all lapses of occasion and frustrations of contactfrom remaining with me as a more constituted and sustained act of living in proportion to my powers and opportunities than any other homogeneous stretch of experience that my memory now recovers the case had to be in a peculiar degree alas that of living inwardlylike so many of my other cases in a peculiar degree compared that is to the immense and prolonged outwardness outwardness naturally at the very highest pitch that was the general sign of the situation to which i may add that my alas just uttered is in the key altogether of my then current consciousness and not in the least in that of my present appreciation of the sameso that i leave it even while i thus put my mark against it as i should restore tenderly to the shelf any odd rococo object that might have slipped from a reliquary my appreciation of what i presume at the risk of any apparent fatuity to call my relation to the war is at present a thing exquisite to me a thing of the last refinement of romance whereas it had to be at the time a sore and troubled a mixed and oppressive thingthough i promptly see on reflection how it must frequently have flushed with emotions with small scraps of direct perception even with particular sharpnesses in the generalised pang of participation that were all but touched in themselves as with the full experience clear as some object presented in high relief against the evening sky of the west at all events is the presence for me beside the stretcher on which my young brother was to lie for so many days before he could be moved and on which he had lain during his boatjourney from the south to new york and thence again to newport of lost cabot russells stricken father who failing up and down the searched field in respect of his own irrecoverable boythen dying or dead as afterwards appeared well within the enemys workshad with an admirable charity brought wilky back to a waiting home instead and merged the parental ache in the next nearest devotion he could find vivid to me still is ones almost ashamed sense of this at the hurried disordered time and of how it was impossible not to impute to his grave steady gentleness and judgment a full awareness of the difference it would have made for him all the same to be doing such things with a still more intimate pity unobliterated for me in spite of vaguenesses this quasitwilight vision of the good bereft man bereft if i rightly recall of his only son as he sat erect and dryeyed at the guarded feast of our relief and so much doubtless partly because of the image that hovers to me across the years of cabot russell himself my brothers so close comradedarkeyed youthfully brown heartily bright actively handsome and with the arrested expression the indefinable shining stigma worn to the regard that travels back to them by those of the young figures of the fallen that memory and fancy wanting never ceasing to want to do something for them set as upright and clearfaced as may be each in his sacred niche they have each to such a degree so ranged the strange property or privilegeone scarce knows what to call itof exquisitely for all our time facing us out quite blandly ignoring us looking through us or straight over us at something they partake of together but that we maynt pretend to know we walk thus i think rather ruefully before themthose of us at least who didnt at the time share more happily their risk william during those first critical days while the stretcher itself set down with its load just within the entrance to our house mightnt be moved further preserved our poor lacerated brothers aspect in a drawing of great and tender truth which i permit myself to reproduce it tells for me the double storyi mean both of wilkys then condition and of the draughtsmans admirable hand  illustration sketch of g w james brought home wounded from the assault on fort wagner  but i find waiting my fathers last letter of the small group to mrs tappan we were by that time the autumn of 1865 settled in boston for a couple of years       my dear carryare you a carryatid that you consider yourself      bound to uphold that lenox edifice through the cold winter as well      as the hot summer why dont you come to town i cant write what      i want to say my brain is tired and i gladly forego all writing      that costs thought or attention but i have no day forgotten your      question and am eager always to make a conquest of you you are so      full both of the upper and the nether might as always greatly to      excite my interest and make me feel how little is accomplished      while you are left not so i make no prayer to you i would have no      assistance from your own vows or the pleasure of my intercourse      with you would be slain i would rather outrage than conciliate      your sympathies that i might have all the joy of winning you over      at last hate me on my ideal side the side that menaces you as      much as you please meanwhile but keep a warm corner in your regard      for me personally as i always do for you until we meet again      its a delight to know a person of your sense and depth even the      gaudia certaminis are more cheering with you than ordinary      agreements with other people  on which note i may leave the exchange in question feeling how equal an honour it does to the parties     viii   i judge best to place together here several passages from my fathers letters belonging to this general period even though they again carry me to points beyond my story proper it is not for the storys sake that i am moved to gather them but for their happy illustration once more of something quite else the human beauty of the writers spirit and the fine breadth of his expression this latter virtue is most striking doubtless when he addresses his women correspondents of whom there were many yet it so pervades for instance various notes longer and shorter to mrs james t fields wife of the eminent boston publisher and editor much commended to us as founder and for a time chief conductor of the atlantic monthly our most adopted and enjoyed native recueil of that series of years the atlantic seemed somehow while the good season lasted to live with us whereas our relation to the two or three other like organs homegrown or foreign of which there could be any question and most of all naturally to the great french revue was that we lived with them the light of literature as we then invoked or at any rate received it seemed to beat into the delightful fields salon from a nearer heaven than upon any other scene and played there over a museum of relics and treasures and apparitions these last whether reflected and by that time legendary or directly protrusive and presented wearers of the bay with an intensity i feel again as i look back every resting ray of which was a challenge to dreaming ambition i am bound to note none the less oddly enough that my fathers communications with the charming mistress of the scene are more often than not a bright profession of sad reasons for inability to mingle in it he mingled with reluctance in scenes designed and preappointed and was i think mostly content to feel almost anything near at hand become a scene for him from the moment he had happened to cast into the arena which he preferred without flags or festoons the golden apple of the unexpectedin humorous talk that is in reaction without preparation in sincerity which was itself sociability it was not nevertheless that he didnt now and then acceptwith attenuations       if therefore you will let alice and me come to you on wednesday      evening i shall still rejoice in the benignant fate that befalls my      houseeven though my wife indisposed feels reluctantly      constrained to count herself out of the sphere of your      hospitality and i will bind myself moreover by solemn vows not      to perplex the happy atmosphere which almost reigns in yours by      risking a syllable of the incongruous polemic your husband wots of      i will listen devotedly to you and him all the evening if thereby i      may early go home repaired in my own esteem and not dilapidated      as has been hitherto too often the case  he could resist persuasion even in the insidious form of an expressed desire that he should read something something he was writing to a chosen company       your charming note is irresistible at first sight and i had almost      uttered a profligate yesthat is a promise irrespective of a      power to perform when my good angel arrested me by the stern      inquiry what have you got to give them and i could only say in      reply to this intermeddling but blest spirit nothing my dear      friend absolutely nothing whereupon the veracious one said again      sit you down immediately therefore and confessing your literary      indigence to this lovely lady pray her to postpone the fulfilment      of her desire to some future floodtide in the little stream of      your inspiration when you will be ready to serve her  the following refers to the question of his attending with my mother at some session of a social club at which a prepared performance of some sort was always offered but of which they had lately found it convenient to cease to be members       i snatch the pen from my wifes hand to enjoy myself the      satisfaction of saying to you how good and kind and charming you      always are and how we never grow tired of recounting the fact      among ourselves here and yet how we still shall be unable to      accept your hospitality why simply because we have a due sense of      what becomes us after our late secession and would not willingly      be seen at two successive meetings lest the carnal observer should      argue that we had left the club by the front door of obligation      only to be readmitted at the back door of indulgence i put it as      fields would phrase it to speak of him always reminds me of      various things so richly endowed is the creature in all good      gifts but the dominant consideration evoked in my mind by his name      is just his beautiful home and that atmosphere of faultless womanly      worth and dignity which fills it with light and warmth and makes      it a blessing to ones heart whenever one enters its precincts      please felicitate the wretch for me  however earnest these deprecations he could embroider them with a rare grace       my wifewho has just received your kind note in rapid route for      the dedham profane asylum or something of that sortbegs leave to      say through me as a willing and sensitive medium that you are one      of those arva beata renowned in poetry which visit them never      so often one is always glad to revisit which are attractive in      all seasons by their own absolute light and without any emersonian      pansies and buttercups to make them so this enthusiastic dedhamite      says further in effect that while she is duly grateful for your      courteous offer of a seat upon your sofa to hear the conquered      sage she yet prefers the material banquet you summon us to in your      diningroom since there we should be out of the mist and able to      discern between nature and cookery between what eats and what is      eaten at all events and feel a thankful mind that we were in      solid comfortable charles street instead of in the vague and wide      weltering galaxy and should be sure to deem a and j i am sure      of a and i think my wife feels equally sure of j finer      fireflies than ever sparkled in the old empyrean but alas who      shall control his destiny not my wife whom multitudinous cares      enthrall nor yet myself whom a couple of months enforced      idleness now constrains to a preternatural activity lest the world      fail of salvation please accept then our united apologies and      regrets       ps who contrived the comical title for es      lecturesphilosophy of the people may it not have been a joke      of j t fs it would be no less absurd for emerson himself to      think of philosophising than for the rose to think of botanising      he is the divinely pompous rose of the philosophic garden gorgeous      with colour and fragrance so what a sad lookout for tulip and      violet and lily and the humbler grasses if the rose should turn      out philosophic gardener as well  there connects itself with a passage in another letter to the same correspondent a memory of my own that i have always superlatively cherished and that remains in consequence vivid enough for some light reflection here but i first give the passage which is of date of november 67 what a charming impression of dickens the other night at the nortons dinner how innocent and honest and sweet he is maugre his fame fields was merely superb on the occasion but dickens was saintly as a young person of twentyfour i took part restrictedly yet exaltedly in that occasionand an immense privilege i held it to slip in at allfrom after dinner on at which stage of the evening i presented myself in the company of my excellent friend arthur sedgwick brother to our hostess and who still lives to testify for the honour of introduction to the tremendous guest how tremendously it had been laid upon young persons of our generation to feel dickens down to the soles of our shoes no more modern instance that i might try to muster would give i think the least measure of i can imagine no actual young person of my then age and however like myself so ineffably agitated so mystically moved in the presence of any exhibited idol of the mind who should be in that character at all conceivably like the author of pickwick and of copperfield there has been since his extinction no corresponding caseas to the relation between benefactor and beneficiary or debtor and creditor no other debt in our time has been piled so high for those carrying it as the long the purely victorian pressure of that obligation it was the pressure the feeling that made itas it made the feeling and no operation of feeling on any such ground has within my observation so much as attempted to emulate it so that on the evening i speak of at shady hill it was as a slim and shaken vessel of the feeling that one stood thereof the feeling in the first place diffused public and universal and in the second place all unfathomably undemonstrably unassistedly and as it were unrewardedly proper to ones self as an already groping and fumbling already dreaming and yearning dabbler in the mystery the creative that of comedy tragedy evocation representation erect and concrete before us there as in a sublimity of mastership i saw the masternothing could be more evidentin the light of an intense emotion and i trembled i remember in every limb while at the same time by a blest fortune emotion produced no luminous blur but left him shining indeed only shining with august particulars it was to be remarked that those of his dress which managed to be splendid even while remaining the general spare uniform of the dinerout had the effect of higher refinements of accents stronger and better placed than we had ever in such a connection seen so much as hinted but the offered inscrutable mask was the great thing the extremely handsome face the face of symmetry yet of formidable character as i at once recognised and which met my dumb homage with a straight inscrutability a merciless military eye i might have pronounced it an automatic hardness in fine which at once indicated to me and in the most interesting way in the world a kind of economy of apprehension wonderful was it thus to see and thrilling inwardly to note that since the question was of personal values so great no faintest fraction of the whole could succeed in not counting for interest the confrontation was but of a moment our introduction my companions and mine once effected by an arrest in a doorway nothing followed as it were or happened what might have happened it remained in fact impossible to conceive but intense though the positive perception there was an immensity more left to understandfor the long aftersense i mean and one or the chief of these later things was that if our hero neither shook hands nor spoke only meeting us by the barest act so to say of the trained eye the penetration of which to my sense revealed again a world there was a grim beauty to ones subsequently panting imagination in that very truth of his then so knowing himself committed to his monstrous readings and with the force required for them ominously ebbing on the outer edge of his once magnificent margin so at any rate i was to like for long to consider of it i was to like to let the essential radiance which had nevertheless reached me measure itself by this accompaniment of the pitying vision he couldnt loosely spend for grace what he had to keep for lifewhich was the awful nightly or all but nightly exhibition such the economy as i have called it in which i was afterwards to feel sure he had been locked upin spite of the appearance in the passage from my fathers letter of the opened gates of the hour or two before these were but a reason the more really for the so exquisitely complicated image which was to remain with me to this day and which couldnt on any other terms have made itself nearly so important for that was the whole sense of the matter it hadnt been in the least important that we should have shaken hands or exchanged platitudesit had only been supremely so that one should have had the essence of the hour the knowledge enriched by proof that whatever the multifold or absolute reason no accession to sensibility from any other at all similar source could have compared for penetration to the intimacy of this particular and prodigious glimpse it was as if i had carried off my strange treasure just exactly from under the merciless military eyeplaced there on guard of the secret all of which i recount for illustration of the force of action unless i call it passion that may reside in a single pulse of time  i allow myself not to hang back in gathering several passages from another series for fear of their crossing in a manner the line of privacy and giving a distinctness to old intimate things the distinctness is in the first place all to the honour of the persons and the interests thus glimmering through and i hold in the second that the light touch under which they revive positively adds by the magic of memory a composite fineness the only thing is that to speak of my fathers correspondent here is to be more or less involved at once in the vision of her frame and situation and that to get at all into relation with the nortons as they were known to us at that period to say nothing of all the years to follow is to find on my hands a much heavier weight of reference than my scale at this point can carry the relation had ripened for us with the settlement of my parents at cambridge in the autumn of 66 and might i attempt even a sketch of the happy fashion in which the university circle consciously accepted for its better satisfaction or in other words just from a sense of what was within its range in the highest degree interesting the social predominance of shady hill and the master there and the ladies of the masters family i should find myself rich in material that institution and its administrators however became at once under whatever recall of them a picture of great inclusions and implications so true is it of any community and so true above all of one of the american communities best to be studied fifty years ago in their homogeneous form and native essence and identity that a strong character reinforced by a great culture a culture great in the given conditions obeys an inevitable law in simply standing out charles eliot norton stood out in the air of the place and timewhich for that matter i think changed much as he changed and couldnt change much beyond his own range of experimentwith a greater salience granting his background i should say than i have ever known a human figure stand out with from any an effect involved of course in the nature of the background as well as in that of the figure he profited at any rate to a degree that was a lesson in all the civilities by the fact that he represented an ampler and easier above all a more curious play of the civil relation than was to be detected anywhere about and a play by which that relation had the charming art of becoming extraordinarily multifold and various without appearing to lose the note of rarity it is not of course through any exhibition of mere multiplicity that the instinct for relations becomes a great example and bears its best fruit the weight of the example and the nature of the benefit depending so much as they do on the achieved and preserved terms of intercourse here it was that the curiosity as i have called it of shady hill was justifiedso did its action prove largely humanising this was all the witchcraft it had usedthat of manners understood with all the extensions at once and all the particularisations to which it is the privilege of the highest conception of manners to lend itself what it all came back to naturally was the fact that on so happy a ground the application of such an ideal and such a genius could find agents expressive and proportionate and the least that could be said of the ladies of the house was that they had in perfection the imagination of their opportunity history still at comparatively close range lays to its lips i admit a warning fingeryet how can i help looking it bravely in the face as i name in common courtesy jane norton she distilled civility and sympathy and charm she exhaled humanity and invitation to friendship which latter she went through the world leaving at mortal doors as in effect the revelation of a new amenity altogethersomething to wait most other matters being meanwhile suspended for her to come back on a turn of the genial tide and take up again according to the stirred desire with each beneficiary all this to the extent moreover i confess that it takes the whole of ones measure of her rendered service and her admirable life cut so much too shortit takes the full list of her fond acclaimers the shyest with the clearest those who most waited or most followed not to think almost more of the way her blest influence went to waste as by its mere uneconomised and selfless spread than of what would have been called what was by the simplyseeing freely enough called her achieved success it was given her at once to shine for the simplyseeing and to abide forever with the subtly which latter so far as they survive are left again to recognise how there plays inveterately within the beautiful if it but go far enough the fine strain of the tragic the household at shady hill was leaving that residence early in the summer of 68 for a long stay in europe and the following is of that moment       when i heard the other day that you had been at our house to say      farewell i was glad and also sorry glad because i couldnt say      before all the world so easily what i wanted to say to you in      parting and sorry because i longed for another sight of your      beautiful countenance and then i consoled myself with thinking      that i should write you the next morning and be able to do my      feelings better justice but when the morning came i saw how you      would with all your wealth of friends scarcely value a puny      chirrup from one of my like and by no means probably expect it      and so i desisted and now comes your heavenly letter this moment      to renew my happiness in showing me once more your undimmed      friendly face how delightful that face has ever been to me since      first i beheld it how your frank and gracious and healing manners      have shed on my soul a celestial dew whenever i have encountered      you i despair to tell you in fitting words you are the largest      and more generous nature i know and one that remains always at      the same time so womanly and while you leave behind you such a      memory you neednt fear that our affectionate wishes will ever fail      you for a moment i for my part shall rest in my affection for you      till we meet where to love is to live  shady hill was meanwhile occupied by other friends out of the group of which especially as reflected in another of my fathers letters to miss norton there rise for me beckoning ghosts against whose deep appeal to me to let them lead me on i have absolutely to steel myselfso far for the interest of it i feel that they might take me       we dined the other night at shady hill where the gurneys were      charming and the company excellent but there was a perpetual      suggestion of the elysian fields about the banquet to me and we      seemed met together to celebrate a memory rather than applaud a      hope godkin and his wife were there and they heartily lent      themselves to discourse of you all ever and anon his friendship      gave itself such an emphatic jerk to your address that you might      have heard it on your windowpanes if you had not been asleep as      for herwhat a great clot she is of womanly health beauty and      benignity that is a most unwonted word to use in such a      connection but it came of itself and i wont refuse it as it      means to express a wealth that seems chaoticseems so because      apparently not enough exercised or put to specific use the      ashburners and sedgwicks continue your tradition and even ornament      or variegate it with their own original force i go there of a      sunday afternoon whenever possible to read anew the gospel of      their beautiful life and manners and bring away a text for the good      of my own household no one disputes the authenticity of that      gospel and i have no difficulty in spreading its knowledge  on which follows as if inevitably the tragic note reechoed news having come from dresden in march 72 of the death of mrs charles norton still young delightful inestimable       what a blow we have all had in the deeper blow that has prostrated      you i despair to tell you how keen and how real a grief is felt      here by all who have heard the desolating news with my own family      the brooding presence of the calamity is almost as obvious as it is      in the kirkland street home and i have to make a perpetual effort      to reason it down reflectively i confess i am somewhat surprised      that i could have been so much surprised by an event of this      order i know very well that death is the secret of life      spiritually and that this outward image of death which has just      obtruded itself upon our gaze is only an imageis wholly unreal      from a spiritual point of view i know in short that your lovely      sister lives at present more livingly than she has ever lived      before and yet my life is so low habitually that when i am      called upon to put my knowledge into practice i am as superstitious      as anybody else and grovel instead of soaring keep me in your own      sweet and fragrant memory for nowhere else could i feel myself      more embalmed to my own selfrespect indeed if anything could      relieve a personal sorrow to me it would be the sense that it was      shared by a being so infinitely tender and true as yourself  of the mass of letters by the same hand that i further turn over too many are of a domestic strain inconsistent with other application but a page here and there emerges clear with elements of interest and notes of the characteristic that rather invite than deprecate an emphasis from these i briefly glean not minding that later dates are involvedno particular hour at that time being far out of touch with any other and the value of everything gaining here as i feel by my keeping my examples together the following addressed to me in england early in 69 beautifully illustrates to my sense our fathers close participation in any once quite positive case that either one or the other of his still somewhat undetermined but none the less interesting sonsinteresting to themselves to each other and to himmight appear for the time to insist on constituting william had in 68 been appointed to an instructorship in psychology at harvard       he gets on greatly with his teaching his studentsfiftyseven of      themare elated with their luck in having him and i feel sure he      will have next year a still larger number attracted by his fame he      came in the other afternoon while i was sitting alone and after      walking the floor in an animated way for a moment broke out      bless my soul what a difference between me as i am now and as i      was last spring at this time then so hypochondriachalhe used      that word though perhaps less in substance than formand now      with my mind so cleared up and restored to sanity its the      difference between death and life he had a great effusion i was      afraid of interfering with it or possibly checking it but i      ventured to ask what especially in his opinion had produced the      change he said several things the reading of renouvier      particularly his vindication of the freedom of the will and of      wordsworth whom he has been feeding on now for a good while but      more than anything else his having given up the notion that all      mental disorder requires to have a physical basis this had become      perfectly untrue to him he saw that the mind does act      irrespectively of material coercion and could be dealt with      therefore at first hand and this was health to his bones it was a      splendid declaration and though i had known from unerring signs of      the fact of the change i never had been more delighted than by      hearing of it so unreservedly from his own lips he has been      shaking off his respect for men of mere science as such and is      even more universal and impartial in his mental judgments than i      have known him before  nothing in such a report could affect me more at a distance as indeed nothing shines for me more sacredly now than the writers perfect perception of what it would richly say to me even if a little to my comparative confusion and bewilderment engaged as i must rightly have appeared in working out not to say in tentatively playing with much thinner things i like to remember as i do ineffaceably that my attention attached itself intensely and on the spot to the very picture with whatever else conveyed which for that matter hangs before me still the vision of my brother agitated by the growth of his genius moving in his burst of confidence his bright earnestness about the room i knew which must have been our admirable parents studywith that admirable parent himself almost holding his breath for the charm and the accepted peace of it after earlier discussions and reserves to say nothing too if charm was in question of the fact of rarity and beauty i must have felt or in any case at present feel in the resource for such an intellectually living and fermenting son of such a spiritually perceiving and responding sire what was the whole passage but a vision of the fine private luxury of eachwith the fine private luxury of my own almost blurred image of it superadded of that same spring of 69 is another page addressed to myself in europe my memory must at the very time have connected itself with what had remained to me of our common or certainly of my own inveterate childish appeal to him in early new york days for repetition in the winter afternoon firelight of his most personal most remembering and picturerecovering story that of a visit paid by him about in his nineteenth year as i make it out to his irish relatives his fathers nephews nieces and cousins with a younger brother or two perhaps as i set the scene forthwhich it conduced to our liveliest interest to see billy taylor the negro servant accompanying him from albany altogether rule from the point of view of effect the dignity of this apparition indeed i must parenthesise would have yielded in general to the source of a glamour still more markedthe very air in which the young emissary would have moved as the son of his father and the representative of an american connection prodigious surely in its power to dazzle william james of albany was at that time approaching the term of his remarkably fruitful career and as i see the fruits of it stated on the morrow of his deathin the new york evening post of december 20th 1832 for instance i find myself envying the friendly youth who could bring his modest irish kin such a fairytale from over the sea i attach as i hang upon the passage a melancholy gaze to the cloud of images of what might have been for us all that it distractingly throws off our grandfathers energy exercised in albany from the great year 1789 appears promptly to have begun with his arrival there everywhere we see his footsteps turn where we may and these are the results of his informing mind and his vast wealth his plans of improvement embraced the entire city and there is scarcely a street or a square which does not exhibit some mark of his hand or some proof of his opulence with the exception of mr astor this delightful report goes on to declare no other business man has acquired so great a fortune in this state to his enormous estate of three millions of dollars there are nine surviving heirs his enterprises have for the last ten years furnished constant employment for hundreds of our mechanics and labourers the enterprises appear alas to have definitely ceased or to have fallen into less able hands with his deathand to the mass of property so handsomely computed the heirs were more exactly not nine but a good dozen which fact however reduces but by a little the rich ambiguity of the question that was to flit before my fathers children as they grew up with an air of impenetrability that i remember no attempt on his own part to mitigate i doubt for that matter whether he could in the least have appeased our all but haunting wonder as to what had become even in the hands of twelve heirs he himself naturally being one of the admirable three millions the various happy and rapid courses of most of the participants accounted for much but did they account for the full beautiful value and would even the furthest stretch of the charming legend of his own early taste for the amusements of the town really tell us what had been the disposition by such a measure of his share our dear parent we were later quite to feel could have told us very little in all probability under whatever pressure what had become of anything there had been by our inference a general historynot on the whole exhilarating and pressure for information could never i think have been applied wherefore the question arrests me only through the brightly associated presumption that the irish visit was made to its extreme enlivening in the character of a gilded youth a youth gilded an inch thick and shining to effulgence on the scene not otherwise brilliant which image appeals to my filial fidelityeven though i hasten not to sacrifice the circle evoked that for which i a trifle unassuredly figure a small town in county cavan as forming an horizon and which consisted we used to delight to hear with every contributive circumstance of the local lawyer the doctor and the let us hopefor we did hope principal merchant whose conjoined hospitality appeared as it was again agreeable to know to have more than graced the occasion the main definite pictorial touches that have lingered with me being that all the doors always stood open with the vistas mostly raking the provision of whiskey on every table and that these opportunities were much less tempting to our narrator than that of the quest of gooseberries in the garden with a certain beautiful barbara otherwise anonymous who was not of the kin but on a visit from a distance at one of the genial houses we liked to hear about barbara liked the sound of her still richer rarer surname which in spite of the fine irish harmony it even then struck me as making i have frivolously forgotten she had been matchlessly fair and she ate gooseberries with a charm that was in itself of the nature of a brogueso that as i say we couldnt have too much of her yet even her measure dwindled for our appetite beside the almost epic shape of black billy taylor carrying off at every juncture alike the laurel and the bay he singularly appealed it was clear to the irish imagination performing in a manner never to disappoint it his young masterin those days even in the north young mastership hadnt too long since lapsed to have lost every grace of its traditionhad been all cordially acclaimed but not least it appeared because so histrionically attended he had been the ringmaster as it were of the american circus the small circus of two but the other had been the inimitable clown my point is that we repaired retrospectively to the circus as insatiably as our irish cousins had of old attended it in personeven for the interest of which fact however my fathers words have led me too far what here follows i must nevertheless add would carry me on again for development of reference should i weakly allow it the allusion to my brother wilkys vividly independent verbal collocations and commentative flights reechoes afresh for instance as one of the fond bywords that spoke most of our whole humorous harmony just so might the glance at the next visitor prompt a further raising of the curtain save that this is a portrait to which for lack of acquaintance with the original i have nothing to contributebeyond repeating again that it was ever the sign of my fathers portraits to supply almost more than anything else material for a vision of himself       your enjoyment of england reminds me of my feelings on my first      visit there forty years ago nearly when i landed in devonshire in      the month of may or june and was so intoxicated with the roads and      lanes and hedges and fields and cottages and castles and inns that      i thought i should fairly expire with delight you cant expatiate      too much for our entertainment on your impressions though you make      us want consumedly to go over and follow in your footsteps wilky      has been at home now for 2 or 3 days and is very philosophic and      enthusiastic over your letters i hoped to remember some of his      turns of speech for you but one chases another out of my memory      and it is now all a blank i will consult alices livelier one      before i close       my friend  is a tropical phenomenon a favourite of nature      whatever his fellow man may say of him his face and person are      handsome rather than otherwise and its obvious that he is a very      unsoiled and pure piece of humanity in all personal regards and      with such a gift of oratorysuch a boundless wealth of diction set      off by copious and not ungraceful gesticulation here is where he      belongs to the tropics where nature claims him for her own and      flings him like a cascade in the face of conventional      goodbreeding i cant begin to describe him he is what i have      never before met i see that he cant help turning out excessively      tiresome but he is not at all vulgar he has a genius for      elocution that is all but a real genius and no mistake in      comparison with mr f l or mr longfellow or the restrained      boston style of address generally he is what the sunflower is to      the snowdrop but on the whole if i could kick his shins whenever      i should like to and so reduce him to silence i prefer him to the      others  what mainly commends to me certain other passages of other dates these still reaching on a little is doubtless the fact that i myself show in them as the object of attention and even in a manner as a claimant for esthetic aid this latter active sympathy overflows in a letter of the spring of 70 which would be open to more elucidation than i have alas space for let the sentence with which it begins merely remind me that forrest the american actor of high renown in his time and of several of whose appearances toward the close of his career i keep a memory uneffacedthe impression as of a deeptoned thunderous organ a prodigious instrument pounded by a rank barbarianhad been literally from what we gathered an early comrade of our parent literally i say because the association could seem to me at my hours of ease so bravely incongruous by my hours of ease i mean those doubtless too devoted to that habit of wanton dispersed embroidery for which any scrap of the human canvas would serve from one particular peg i at the same time allow the strongest sense of the incongruity dependedmy remembrance long entertained of my fathers relating how on an occasion which must have been betimes in the morning of his calling on the great tragedian a man of enormous build and strength the latter fresh and dripping from the bath had entered the room absolutely upside down or by the rare gymnastic feat of throwing his heels into the air and walking as with strides on his hands an extraordinary performance if kept up for more than a second or two and the result at any rate of mere exuberance of muscle and pride and robustious joie de vivre it had affected me the picture as one of those notes of high colour that the experience of a young albany viveur the like of which i felt i was never to come in for alone could strike off but what was of the finer profit in it was less the direct illustration of the mighty mountebank than of its being delightful on the part of a domestic character we so respected to have had with everything else a bohemian past toosince i couldnt have borne at such moments to hear it argued as not bohemian what did his having dropped in after such a fashion and at a late breakfasthour on the glory of the footlights and the idol of the town what did it fall in with but the kind of thing one had caught glimpses and echoes of from the diaries and memoirs so far as these had been subject to the passing peep of the giftedly idle and the fashionably great the byrons the bulwers the pelhams the coningsbys or even for a nearer vividness perhaps the n p willisesof all of whom it was somehow more characteristic than anything else to the imagination that they always began their day in some such fashion even if i cite this as a fair example of ones instinct for making much of a littleonce this little a chance handful of sand could show the twinkle of the objective or even the reflective grain of goldi still claim value for that instanced felicity as i felt it of being able to yearn thanks to whatever chance support over bohemia and yet to have proof in the paternal presence close at hand of how well even the real frequentation of it when achieved in romantic youth might enable a person at last to turn out the lesson may now indeed seem to have been one of those that rather more strictly adorn a tale than point a moral but with me at that period i think the moral ever came first and the tale more brilliantly followed as for the recital in such detail of the theme of a possible literary effort which the rest of my letter represents how could i feel this when it had reached me as anything but a sign of the admirable anxiety with which thought could be taken even though amateurishly in my professional interestsince professional i by that time appeared able to pass for being and how above all can it not serve as an exhibition again of the manner in which all my benevolent backers inveterate original malaise in face of betrayed symptoms of the impulse to narrow down on the part of his young found its solution always or its almost droll simplification as soon as the case might reach for him a personal enough or social enough as he would have said relation to its fruits then the malaise might promptly be felt as changed by a wave of that wand to the extremity of active and expatiative confidence       horatio alger is writing a life of edwin forrest and i am afraid      will give him a bowery appreciation he reports his hero as a very      fine talkerin which light i myself dont so much recall him      though he had a native breadthas when telling alger for example      of old gilbert stuarts having when in a state of dilapidation      asked him to let him paint his portrait i consented said      forrest and went to his studio he was an old white lion so      blind that he had to ask me the colour of my eyes and my hair but      he threw his brush at the canvas and every stroke was life alger      talks freely about his own late insanitywhich he in fact appears      to enjoy as a subject of conversation and in which i believe he has      somewhat interested william who has talked with him a good deal of      his experience at the somerville asylum charles grinnellthough      not à propos of the crazyhas become a great reader and apparently      a considerable understander of my productions alger aforesaid      aussi everyone hopes that j g hasnt caught a rosamund vincy in      miss m i dont know whether this hope means affection to j or      disaffection to the young lady       i have written to gail hamilton to send me your story but she does      it not as yet i will renew my invitation to her in a day or two if      necessary i went to see osgood lately about his publishing a      selection from your tales he repeated what he had told youthat      he would give you 15 per cent and do all the advertising etc you      paying for the plates or he would pay everything and give you 10      per cent on every copy sold after the first thousand i shall be      glad in case you would like to publish and i think it time for      you to do so to meet the expense of your stereotyping and if you      will pick out what you would like to be included we shall set to      work at once and have the book ready by next autumn i have      meanwhile the materials of a story for you which i was telling      william of the other day as a regular tourgéneff subject and he      urged me to send it off to you at oncehe was so struck with it       matthew henry w was a very cultivated and accomplished young man      in albany at the time i was growing up he belonged to a highly      respectable family of booksellers and publishers and was himself      bred to the law but had such a love of literature and more      especially of the natural sciences that he never devoted himself      strictly to his profession he was the intimate friend of my dear      old tutor joseph henry of the smithsonian and of other      distinguished men of science he corresponded with foreign      scientific bodies and his contributions to science generally were      of so original a cast as to suggest great hopes of his future      eminence he was a thorough gentleman of perfect address and      perfect courageutterly unegotistic and ones wonder was how he      had ever grown up in albany or resigned himself to living there      one day he invested his money of which he had a certain quantity      in a scheme much favoured by the president of the bank in which he      deposited and this adventure proved a fortune there lived near us      as well a family of the name of k your cousin mary minturn      posts stepmother being of its members and this family reckoned      upon a great social sensation in bringing out their youngest      daughter lydia sibyl who had never been seen by mortal eye      outside her own immediate circle save that of a physician who      reported that she was fabulously beautiful she was the most      beautiful girl i think i ever saw at a little distance well she      made her sensation and brought matthew henry promptly to her feet      her family wanted wealth above all things for her but here was      wealth and something more very much more and they smiled upon      his suit everything went merrily for a whilem h was deeply      intoxicated with his prize never was man so enamoured and never      was beauty better fitted to receive adoration she was of an      exquisite grecian outline as to face with a countenance like the      tender dawn and form and manners ravishingly graceful but w was      not content with his adventurehe embarked again and lost almost      all he owned the girls fatheror her mother rather being the      ruler of the family and as hard as the nether world at heartgave      the cue to her daughter and my friend was dismissed he couldnt      believe his senses he raved and cursed his fate but it was      inexorable what was to be done with a bitterness of heart      inconceivable he plucked his revenge by marrying at once a stout      and blooming jade who was to lydia sibyl as a peony to a violet      absolutely nothing but flesh and blood her he bore upon his arm at      fashionable hours through the streets her he took to church      preserving his admirable ease and courtesy to everyone as if      absolutely nothing had occurred and her he pretended to take to      his bosom in private with what a shudder one can imagine      everybody stood aghast he went daily about his affairs as serene      and unconscious apparently as the moon in the heavens soon his      poverty showed itself in certain economies of his attire which had      always been most recherché soon again he broke his leg and went      about on crutches but neither poverty nor accident had the least      power to ruffle his air of equanimity he was always superior to      his circumstances met you exactly as he had always done impressed      you always as the bestbred man you knew and left you wondering      what a heart and what a brain lay behind such a fortune one      morning we all read in the newspaper at breakfast that mr m h w      had appealed the day before to the protection of the police      against his wife who had taken to beating him and whom as a woman      he couldnt deal with by striking back and the police responded      properly to his appeal he went about his affairs as usual that day      and every day never saying a word to any one of his trouble nor      even indirectly asking sympathy but making you feel that here if      anywhere was a rare kind of manhood a selfrespect so eminent as      to look down with scorn on the refuges open to ordinary human      weakness this lasted five or six years he never drank or took to      other vices and lived a life of such decorum so far as his own      action was concerned a life of such interest and science and      literature as to be the most delightful and unconscious of      companions even when his coat was at the last shabbiness and you      didnt dare to look at him for fear of betraying your own vulgar      misintelligence finally lydia sibyl died smitten with smallpox and      all her beauty gone to hideousness he lingered awhile his      charming manners undismayed still his eye as undaunted as at the      beginning and then he suddenly died i never knew his equal for a      manly force competent to itself in every emergency and seeking none      of the ordinary subterfuges that men so often seek to hide their      imbecility i think it a good basis  returning from europe in june 70 after a stay there of some fifteen months i had crossed the sea eastward again two years later with my sister and our admirable aunt as companionsleaving them i may mention to return home at the end of six months while i betook myself to italy where i chiefly remained till the autumn of 74 the following expresses our fathers liberality of recognition and constant tenderness of tone in a manner that no comment need emphasise but at one or two of his references i allow myself to glance i happen to remember perfectly for instance the appearance of the novel of madame sands that he so invidiously alludes to in one of the first numbers of the cherished revue that reached us after the siege of paris had been raisedsuch a pathetically scant starved pale number i quite recall as expressed the share even of the proud periodical in the late general and so tragic dearth with which it comes back to me that i had myself a bit critically mused on the characteristic queerness the oddity of the light thrown on the stricken french consciousness by the prompt sprouting of such a flower of the native imagination in the chill air of discipline accepted and after the administration to that consciousness of a supposedly clarifying dose but i hadnt gone the length of my father who must have taken up the tale in its republished form a so slim salmoncoloured volume this time oh the repeated arrival during those years of the salmoncoloured volumes in their habit as they lived a habit reserved to my extreme appreciation for this particular series and that enclosing the extraordinarily fresh fruit of their authors benign maturity left tamaris and valvèdre and mademoiselle la quintinie in no degree ever discounted for us as devotees of the revue i make out by their being but renewals of acquaintance the sense of the salmoncoloured distinctive of madame sand was even to come back to me long years after on my hearing edmond de goncourt speak reminiscentially and i permit myself to note not at all reverently of the robe de satin fleurdepêcher that the illustrious and infatuated lady whose more peculiar or native tint as blanche amory used to say didnt contribute to a harmony sétait fait faire in order to fix as much as possible the attention of gustave flaubert at the dîner magny of gustave flaubert who according to this most invidious of reporters disembroiled from each other with too scant ease his tangle of possibly incurred ridicule from the declared sentiment of so old a woman even in a peachblossom dress and the glory reflected on him by his admirers immense distinction which vision of a complicated past recovered even as i writeand of a past indeed contemporary with the early complacencies i attribute to ourselvesdoesnt at all blur its also coming back to me that i was to have found my parent hard on poor francia in spite of my own comparative reserves these being questions and shades that i rejoice to think of our having had so discussionally and well at home for the most part the social education of i see that general period as quite flushed and toned by the salmoncoloured covers so that a kind of domestic loyalty would ever operate as we must have all felt to make us take the thick with the thin and not y regarder for a francia the more or the less when i say all indeed i doubtless have in mind especially my parents and myself with my sister and our admirable aunt in her times of presence thrown into the extent of our subjection to the charm of such matters in particular as la famille de germandre la ville noire nanon and lhomme de neige round which last above all we sat ranged in united ecstasy so that i was to wonder through the after years and i think perhaps to this day how it could come that a case of the story strain at its finest and purest a gush of imaginative force so free and yet so artfully directed shouldnt have somehow stood out more in literary history perhaps indeed lhomme de neige does essentially stand out in the unwritten parts of that recordwhich are content to be mere tacit tender tradition for all the world as if since there are more or less dreadful perpetuated books by the hundred dreadful from whatever baseness or whatever scantness that for shame as it were we never mention so one may figure others as closeted in dimness than which there is nothing safer by the very scruple of respect at its richest i hover for instance about the closet of lhomme de neige i stand outside a moment as if listening for a breath from within but i dont open the door you seewhich must mean in all probability that i wouldnt for the world inconsiderately finger again one of the three volumes that meaning in its turn doubtless that i have heard the breath i had listened for and that it can only have been what my argument wants the breath of life unquenched isnt it relevant to this that when she was not reading trollope our dear mother was reading over la famille de germandre which with several of its companions of the same bland period confirmed her in the sense that there was no one like their author for a lovestorya conviction however that when made articulate exposed her to the imputation of a larger tolerance than she doubtless intended to project till the matter was cleared up by our generally embracing her for so sweetly not knowing about valentine and jacques and suchlike and having only begun at la mare au diable and even thereafter been occasionally obliged to skip  so far do i let myself go while to recur to my letter chauncey wright sits for me in his customary corner of the deep library sofa and his strange conflictingly conscious light blue eyes appealing across the years from under the splendid arch of his fair head one of the handsomest for representation of amplitude of thought that it was possible to see seems to say to me with a softness more aimed at the heart than any alarm or any challenge but what then are you going to do for me i find myself simply ache i fear as almost the only answer to thisbeyond his figuring for me as the most wasted and doomed the biggest at once and the gentlest of the great intending and unproducing in anything like the just degree bachelors of philosophy bachelors of attitude and of life and as he so sits loved and befriended and welcomed valued and invoked and vainly guarded and infinitely pitied till the end couldnt but come he renews that appeal to the old kindness left over as i may say and which must be more or less known to all of us for the good society that was helplessly to miss a right chronicler and the names of which so full at the time of their fine sense were yet to be writ in water chauncey wright of the great imperfectlyattested mind jane norton of the train so markedly of the distinguished the sacrificial devoted exquisite mrs gurney of the infallible taste the beautiful hands and the tragic fate gurney himself for so long dean of the faculty at harvard and trusted judge of all judgments this latter pair the subject of my fathers glance at the tenantship of shady hill in the nortons absence they would delightfully adorn a page and appease a piety that is still athirst if i hadnt to let them pass harshly condemned to let them pass and looking wistfully after them as they go how can i yet not have inconsequently asked them to turn a moment more before disappearing       my heart turns to you this morning so radiant in the paternal      panoply you wear toward alice and your aunt and i would give a      great deal to see you the enclosed scrap of a letter from william      is sent to show you how vastly improved are his eyes especially      when you shall have learned that he has written us within the last      four or five days twenty pages of like density to these he would      fain persuade us to go to mount desert perhaps later we may go to      quebec but we are so comfortable together reading trollope and      talking philosophy that we cheerfully drop the future from our      regard mamma is free and active and bracing she is a domestic      norwester carrying balm and bloom into every nook and corner of      her empire she hangs over the eustace diamonds while i try      vainly to read george sands francia i have come across nothing of      that ladys that reflects a baser light on her personal history      what must a woman have been through to want to grovel at this time      of day in such uncleanness dont buy iti wish i hadnt the new      north american is out with a not too interesting article of      chauncey wrights on mivart a scandalous in point of taste essay      of mr stirling on buckle full of scotch conceit insolence and      wut a very very laboured article by james lowell on dante in      which he determines to exhaust all knowledge and these are all i      have read mr stirling of course makes buckle ridiculous but he      stamps himself a shabby creature  i find the following addressed to his daughter in august 72 so beautifully characteristic of our parents always explicit admonition to us in our dependent years against too abject an impulse to be frugal in their interests that i may fairly let it stand as a monument to this particular aspect of their affection       your and hs last letters bring tears of joy to our eyes its a      delight above all delights to feel ones children turn out all that      the heart covets in children your conviction is not up to the      truth our tender thoughts of you are so constant that i have      hardly been able to settle to anything since you have been gone i      can do little else than recount to myself the tender mercies of      the lord to me and my household still i am not wholly useless i      try to write every day and though i havent my daughter at hand to      look after my style and occasionally after my ideas i manage to do      a little your conscientious economy is excessively touching but      its a little overstrained you neednt be afraid of putting us to      any embarrassment so long as your expenses dont exceed their      present rate and you can buy all you want in paris without      stretching your tether a particle this is mammas message as well      as mine charles atkinson wishes me to say that monte genneroso      above lugano lakethe po mendrisiooffers a wondrous climate      and mamma thinksso fearful is she that you will descend into      italy before the warm weather is over and so compromise your      strengththat you had either better go there awhile first or else      be ready to retreat on it in case you find the summer heat in      venice impossible  nor does this scrap from a letter to myself at the same season breathe a spirit less liberalso far as the sympathy with whatever might pass for my fondest preoccupations was concerned these were now quite frankly recognised as the arduous attempt to learn somehow or other to write       i send you the nation though there seems nothing in it of your      own and i think i never fail to recognise you a notice of gustave      drozs babolain by t s p i suppose there is which book i      read the other day this fumbling in the cadaver of the old world      however only disgusts me when so unrelieved as in this case by any      contrast or any souffle of inspiration such as you get in      tourguéneff its curious to observe how uncertain the authors      step is in this storyhow he seems always on the lookout for some      chance to break away but it has mastered him he cant lay the      ghost he has conjured  to which i should limit myself for the commemoration of that group of years by the gentle aid of the always vivid excerpt were it not that i have before me a considerable cluster of letters addressed by the writer of the foregoing to mr j eliot cabot most accomplished of bostonians most cultivated even among the cultivated as we used to say and of a philosophic acuteness to which my father highly testified with which indeed he earnestly contended the correspondence in question covered during the years i include philosophic ground and none other but though no further exhibition of it than this reference may convey is to my purpose i lay it under contribution to the extent of a passage or two just for the pleasure of inviting recognition as i invite it wherever we meet an instance of the fashion after which the intensely animated soul can scarce fail of a harmony and a consistency of expression that are nothing less than interesting that in fact become at once beautiful in themselves by which remark i nevertheless do not mean to limit the significance of the writers side of his long argument with mr eliot cabot into which i may not pretend to enter nor the part that in any such case a rare gift for style must inveterately play       i grant then that i am often tempted to conceive as i read your      letters that we differ only in your terms being more abstract      mine more concrete and yet i really dont think this difference is      exhaustive if i thought philosophy capable ever of being reduced      to logical compass or realising itself as science i should give in      at once but this is just what i cannot think philosophy is the      doctrine exclusively of the infinite in the finite and deals with      the latter therefore only as a mask only as harbouring the      former but if you formulate it scientifically your terms are      necessarily all finite as furnished by experience and the      infinite is excluded or at most creeps in as the      indefinitehegels becoming for example thus hegels dialectic      modulates only in the sphere of his distance his being is      universal existence and as universals have only a logical truth      being in se is equivalent to nothing but nothing hasnt even a      logical basis lithe as human thought is it cant compass the      conception it is a mere brutum fulmen devised to disguise the      absence of thought or its inanition and hegel if he had been      wise would have said nothought instead of nothing for nothing      doesnt express the complete absence of existence existence is of      two sorts real and personal sensible and conscious quantitative      and qualitative the most you are entitled to say therefore when      existence disappears in quantitative real or sensible form is      that it has been taken up into purely qualitative personal or      conscious form nothing being the logical equivalent of      allperson thus i who in hegels formula presumably extract      existence from being survive the operation as person and though i      am most clearly nothing i am yet not being indeed i am not even      existence any longer since by knocking thing out of being i have      forfeited my own reality and consent henceforth to be pure      personality ie phenomenality and personal or phenomenal      existence is constituted by referring itself to a foreign source      or what is the same thing confessing itself created so that the      fundamental word of philosophy by hegels own formula is      creation which however as i understand him he denies in any      objective sense of the word this then is what i complain of in      himwith deference of course to your better knowledge which      however you do not urge as yet in what seems to me a silencing      waythat he makes existence essential to being so that take      existence away and being becomes nothing it would not be a whit      less preposterous in me to say that thought is essential to thing      subject to object marble to statue canvas to picture woman to      wife mother to child it is literally putting the cart before the      horse and converting philosophy to a practical quagmire being      implies existence of course just as picture implies canvas or as      personality implies reality or as chick implies egg but it      implies it only to a lower intelligence than itself an unspiritual      intelligence to wit which has no direct or inward intuition of      being and requires to be agitated to discerning it when i      recognise the spiritual life of art i never think of marble or      canvas as entering even conditionally into its manifestations  but i hold my case for a rare command of manner thus proved and need go no further the more that i have dropped too many of those threads of my rather niggled tapestry that belong but to the experience of my own weaving hand and the interplay of which represents thereby a certain gained authority i disentangle these again if the term be not portentous though reflecting too and again with complacency that though i thus prize them as involved most in my own consciousness this is just because of their attachment somewhere else to other matters and other lives     ix   i went up from newport to cambridge early in the autumn of 62 and on one of the oddest errands i think that given the several circumstances i could possibly have undertaken i was nineteen years old and it had seemed to me for some time past that some such step as my entering for instance the harvard law school more or less urgently concerned what i could but try to help myself out by still putting forward as my indispensable educationi am not sure indeed that the claim didnt explicitly figure or at least successfully dangle as that of my possibly graceful mere culture i had somehowby which i mean for reasons quite sufficientto fall back on the merciful mere for any statement of my pretensions even to myself so little they seemed to fit into any scheme of the conventional maximum as compared with those i saw so variously and strongly asserted about me especially since the outbreak of the war i am not sure whether i yet made bold to say it but i should surely be good for nothing all my days if not for projecting into the concrete by hook or by crookthat is my imagination shamelessly aidingsome show of again mere life this impression was not in the least the flag i publicly brandished in fact i must have come as near as possible to brandishing none whatever a sound instinct always hinting to me i gather that the tune for such a performance was much more after than beforebefore the perfect place had been found for the real planting of the standard and the giving of its folds to the air no such happy spot had been marked decidedly at that period to my inquiring eye in consequence of which the emblazoned morsel hoisted sooner or later by all of us i think somehow and somewhere might have passed for the hour as a light extravagant bandanna rolled into the tight ball that fits it for hiding in the pocket there it considerably stayed so far as i was concerned and all the more easily as i can but have felt how little any particular thing i might meanwhile do would mattersave for some specious appearance in it this last i recognise had for me a virtueprincipally that of somehow gaining time though i hasten to add that my approach to the law school can scarcely as a means to this end in the air of it that comes back to me have been in the least deceptive by which i mean that my appearance of intentions qualifications possibilities or whatever else in the connection hadnt surely so much as the grace of the specious i spoke above of the assumed indispensability of some show of my being further subject to the education theory but this was for the moment only under failure to ask to whom or for what such a tribute was indispensable the interest to myself would seem to have been as i recover the sense of the time that of all the impossibilities of action my proceeding to cambridge on the very vaguest grounds that probably ever determined a residence there might pass for the least flagrant as i breathe over again at any rate the comparative confidence in which i so moved i feel it as a confidence in the positive saving virtue of vagueness could i but work that force as an ideal i felt it must see me through for the beauty of it in that form was that it should absolutely superabound i wouldnt have allowed either that it was vaguer to do nothing for in the first place just staying at home when everyone was on the move couldnt in any degree show the right mark to be properly and perfectly vague one had to be vague about something mere inaction quite lacked the noteit was nothing but definite and dull i thought of the law school experiment i remember in all sorts of conceivable connections but in the connection of dulness surely never for an hour i thought of it under the head of lifeby which term at the same time i blush to confess i didnt in the least mean free evening access to boston in a jangling horsecar with whatever extension this might give to the joy of the liberated senses i simply meantwell what was monstrously to happen which i shall be better inspired here to deal with as a demonstration made in its course than as a premonition relatively crude and at the time still to be verified marked in the whole matter however these things might be was that irony of fate under the ugly grin of which i found my father reply in the most offhand and liberal manner to my remark that the step in questionmy joining in a sense my brother at cambridgewouldnt be wholly impracticable it might have been from his large assent to it a masterstroke of high policy a certain inconsequence in this left me wondering why then if the matter was now so natural it hadnt been to his mind a year before equally simple that i should go to college and to that college after a more showy even though i see it would have been at the same time a less presumptuous fashion to have deprecated the college course with such emphasis only so soon afterwards to forswear all emphasis and practically smile in mild oblivion on any harvard connection i might find it in me to take up was to bring it home i well recall that the case might originally have been much better managed  all of which would seem to kick up more dust than need quite have hung about so simple a matter as my setting forth to the cambridge scene with no design that i could honourably exhibit a superficial account of the matter would have been that my father had a year or two earlier appeared to think so ill of it as to reduce me given the delicacy the inward not then the outward which i have glanced at to mild renunciationmild i say because i remember in fact rather to my mystification now no great pang of disappointment no soreness of submission i didnt want anything so much as i wanted a certain good or wanted thus supremely to want it if i may say so with which a conventional going to college wouldnt have so tremendously much to do as for the giving it up to break my heartor an unconventional notgoing so tremendously much either what i wanted to want to be was all intimately just literary a decent respect for the standard hadnt yet made my approach so straight that there werent still difficulties that might seem to meet it questions it would have to depend on passing the harvard portal positively failed in fact to strike me as the shorter cut to literature the sounds that rose from the scene as i caught them appeared on the contrary the most detached from any such interest that had ever reached my ear merely to open the door of the big square closet the ample american closet to the like of which europe had never treated us on the shelves and round the walls of which the pink revues sat with the air row upon row of a choir of breathing angels was to take up that particular that sacred connection in a way that put the coarser process to shame the drop of the harvard question had of a truth really meant as i recover it a renewed consecration of the rites of that chapel where the taper always twinkledwhich circumstance i mention as not only qualifying my sense of loss but as symbolising after a queer fashion the independence blest vision to the extent that is of its being a closer compact with the life of the imagination that i should thus both luckily come in for and designingly cultivate cultivate in other words under the rich cover of obscurity i have already noted how the independence was ever so few months later by so quaint a turn another mere shake of the tree to drop into my lap in the form of a great golden applea value not a simple windfall only through the fact that my fathers hand had after all just lightly loosened it this accession pointed the moral that there was no difficulty about anything no intrinsic difficulty so that to reemphasise the sweet bewilderment i was to go where i liked in the harvard direction and do what i liked in the harvard relation such was the situation as offered me though as i had to take it and use it i found in it no little difference two things and more had come upthe biggest of which and very wondrous as bearing on any circumstance of mine as having a grain of weight to spare for it was the breaking out of the war the other the infinitely small affair in comparison was a passage of personal history the most entirely personal but between which as a private catastrophe or difficulty bristling with embarrassments and the great public convulsion that announced itself in bigger terms each day i felt from the very first an association of the closest yet withal i fear almost of the least clearly expressible scarce at all to be stated to begin with the queer fusion or confusion established in my consciousness during the soft spring of 61 by the firing on fort sumter mr lincolns instant first call for volunteers and a physical mishap already referred to as having overtaken me at the same dark hour and the effects of which were to draw themselves out incalculably and intolerably beyond all present notation the interlaced undivided way in which what had happened to me by a turn of fortunes hand in twenty odious minutes kept company of the most unnaturali can call it nothing lesswith my view of what was happening with the question of what might still happen to everyone about me to the country at large it so made of these marked disparities a single vast visitation one had the sense i mean of a huge comprehensive ache and there were hours at which one could scarce have told whether it came most from ones own poor organism still so young and so meant for better things but which had suffered particular wrong or from the enclosing social body a body rent with a thousand wounds and that thus treated one to the honour of a sort of tragic fellowship the twenty minutes had sufficed at all events to establish a relationa relation to everything occurring round me not only for the next four years but for long afterwardthat was at once extraordinarily intimate and quite awkwardly irrelevant i must have felt in some befooled way in presence of a crisisthe smoke of charleston bay still so acrid in the airat which the likely young should be up and doing or as familiarly put lend a hand much wanted the willing youths all round were mostly starting to their feet and to have trumped up a lameness at such a juncture could be made to pass in no light for graceful jammed into the acute angle between two high fences where the rhythmic play of my arms in tune with that of several other pairs but at a dire disadvantage of position induced a rural a rusty a quasiextemporised old engine to work and a saving stream to flow i had done myself in face of a shabby conflagration a horrid even if an obscure hurt and what was interesting from the first was my not doubting in the least its durationthough what seemed equally clear was that i neednt as a matter of course adopt and appropriate it so to speak or place it for increase of interest on exhibition the interest of it i very presently knew would certainly be of the greatest would even in conditions kept as simple as i might make them become little less than absorbing the shortest account of what was to follow for a long time after is therefore to plead that the interest never did fail it was naturally what is called a painful one but it consistently declined as an influence at play to drop for a single instant circumstances by a wonderful chance overwhelmingly favoured itas an interest an inexhaustible i mean since i also felt in the whole enveloping tonic atmosphere a force promoting its growth interest the interest of life and of death of our national existence of the fate of those the vastly numerous whom it closely concerned the interest of the extending war in fine the hurrying troops the transfigured scene formed a cover for every sort of intensity made tension itself in fact contagiousso that almost any tension would do would serve for ones share  i have here i allow not a little to foreshortenhave to skip sundry particulars certain of the steps by which i came to think of my relation to my injury as a modus vivendi workable for the time these steps had after the first flush of reaction inevitably had to be communications of my state recognitions and admissions which had the effect i hasten to add of producing sympathies supports and reassurances i gladly took these things i perfectly remember at that value distinct to me as it still is nevertheless that the indulgence they conveyed lost part of its balm by involving a degree of publication direfully distinct have remained to me the conditions of a pilgrimage to boston made that summer under my fathers care for consultation of a great surgeon the head of his profession there whose opinion and advicethe more that he was a guaranteed friend of my fathershad seemed the best light to invoke on the less and less bearable affliction with which i had been for three or four months seeking to strike some sort of bargain mainly up to that time under protection of a theory of temporary supine rest against which everything inward and outward tended equally to conspire agitated scraps of rest snatched to my consciousness by the liveliest violence were to show for futile almost to the degree in which the effort of our interview with the high expert was afterwards so to show the truth being that this interview settled my sad business settled it just in that saddest sense for ever so long to come this was so much the case that as the mere scene of our main appeal the house from which we had after its making dejectedly emerged put forth to me as i passed it in many a subsequent season an ironic smug symbolism of its action on my fate that action had come from the complete failure of our approached oracle either to warn to comfort or to commandto do anything but make quite unassistingly light of the bewilderment exposed to him in default of other attention or suggestion he might by a mere warning as to gravities only too possible and already well advanced have made such a difference but i have little forgotten how i felt myself the warning absent treated but to a comparative poohpoohan impression i long looked back to as a sharp parting of the ways with an adoption of the wrong one distinctly determined it was not simply small comfort it was only a mystification the more that the inconvenience of my state had to reckon with the strange fact of there being nothing to speak of the matter with me the graceful course on the whole ground again and where moreover was delicacy the proposed the intended without grace was to behave accordingly in good set terms as if the assurance were true since the time left no margin at all for ones gainsaying with the right confidence so high an authority there were a hundred ways to behavein the general sense so freely suggested i mean and i think of the second half of that summer of 62 as my attempt at selection of the best the best still remained under closer comparisons very much what it had at first seemed and there was in fact this charm in it that to prepare for an ordeal essentially intellectual as i surmised might justly involve in the public eye a season of some retirement the beauty wasi can fairly see it now through the haze of time even as beautythat studious retirement and preparatory hours did after all supply the supine attitude did invest the ruefulness did deck out the cynicism of lying down book in hand with a certain fine plausibility this was at least a negative of combat an organised not a loose and empty one something definitely and firmly parallel to action in the tented field and i well recall for that matter how when early in the autumn i had in fact become the queerest of forensic recruits the bristling horde of my law school comrades fairly produced the illusion of a mustered army the cambridge campus was tented field enough for a conscript starting so compromised and i can scarce say moreover how easily it let me down that when it came to the point one had still fine fierce young men in great numbers for company there being at the worst so many such who hadnt flown to arms i was to find my fancy of the merely relative right in any way to figure or even on such terms just to exist i was to find it in due course quite drop from me as the cambridge year played itself out leaving me all aware that full though the air might be of stiffer realities one had yet a rare handful of ones own to face and deal with  at cambridge of course when i got there i was further to find my brother on the scene and already at a stage of possession of its contents that i was resigned in advance never to reach so thoroughly i seemed to feel a sort of quickening savoury meal in any cold scrap of his own experience that he might pass on to my palate this figure has definite truth that is but for association at the board literally yielding us nourishmentthe happiest as to social composition and freedom of supply of all the tables dhôte of those days a veritable haunt of conversation ruled by that gently fatuous miss upham something of whose angular grace and antique attitude has lived again for us in williams letters i place him if not at the moment of my to that extent joining him then at least from a short time afterwards in quarters that he occupied for the next two or three yearsquiet cloistered rooms as they almost appeared to me in the comparatively sequestered divinity hall of that still virtually rustic age which though mainly affected to the use of postgraduates and others of a unitarian colour enrolled under harvards theological faculty offered chance accommodation much appreciated for a certain supposedly separate charm not to say a finer dignity by the more maturely studious in other branches as well the superstition or aftertaste of europe had then neither left me nor hinted that it ever might yet i recall as a distinct source of interest to be desperately dealt with and dealt with somehow to my inward advantage the special force of the circumstance that i was now for the first time in presence of matters normally entirely consistently american and that more particularly i found myself sniff up straight from the sources such as they unmistakably were the sense of that new england which had been to me till then but a name this from the first instant was what i most took in and quite apart from the question of what one was going to make of it of whether one was going in the simple formula to like it and of what would come could the impression so triumph of such monstrous assimilations clear to me in the light thus kindled that my american consciousness had hitherto been after all and at the best singularly starved and that newport for instance during the couple of years had fed it but with sips of an adulterated strain newport with its operaglass turned for ever across the seafor newport or at least our newport even during the war lived mainly and quite visibly by the operaglasswas comparatively and in its degree incurably cosmopolite and though on our first alighting there i had more or less successfully as i fancied invited the local historic sense to vibrate it was at present left me to feel myself a poor uninitiated creature however an initiation at least by the intelligence into some given thingalmost anything really given would dowas essentially what i was as we nowadays say after the fault with my previous data in the american kind had been that they werent sufficiently given so that here would be boston and cambridge giving as with absolute authority the war had by itself of course on the ground i speak of communicated something of the quality or rather of the quantity otherwise deficient only this was for my case of which alone i speak an apprehension without a language or a channela revelation as sublime as one would like to feel it but spreading abroad as a whole and not alas by any practice of mine reducible to parts what i promptly made out at cambridge was that america would be given as i have called it to a tune altogether fresh so that to hear this tune wholly played out might well become on the spot an inspiring privilege if i indeed i should add said to myself wholly this was of course not a little straining a point since putting my initiation my grasp of the exhibition at its conceivable liveliest far more of the supposed total was i inevitably to miss than to gather to my use but i might gather what i could and therein was exactly the adventure to rinse my mouth of the european aftertaste in order to do justice to whatever of the native bittersweet might offer itself in congruous vesselssuch a brave dash for discovery and such only would give a sense to my posture with which it was unmistakable that i shouldnt in the least have painfully to strive of such a force of impact was each impression clearly capable that i had much rather to steady myself at any moment where i stood and quite to a sense of the luxury of the occasion than to cultivate inquiry at the aggressive pitch there was no need for curiosityit was met by every object i seemed to see so much more than half way unless indeed i put it better by saying that as all my vision partook of that principle the impulse and the object perpetually melted together it wasnt for instance by the faintest process of inquiry that the maison upham where i three times daily sat at meat had scarce to wait an hour to become as vivid a translation into american terms of balzacs maison vauquer in le père goriot as i could have desired to deal with  it would have been at once uplifting to see in the american terms a vast improvement on the prime version had i not been here a bit baffled by the sense that the correspondence was not quite after all of like with like and that the main scene of balzacs action was confessedly and curiously sordid and even sinister whereas its equivalent under the harvard elms would rank decidedly as what we had de mieux or in other words of most refined in the boarding line to show i must have been further conscious that what we had de mieux in the social line appeared quite liable on occasion to board wherever it mightthe situation in balzacs world being on this head as different as possible no one not deeply distressed or dismally involved or all but fatally compromised could have taken the chances of such an establishment at all so that any comparison to our own particular advantage had to be on reflection nipped in the bud there was a generic sameness none the less i might still reason enough of that at least to show the two pictures as each in its way interestingwhich was all that was required the maison vauquer its musty air thick with heavier social elements might have been more so for the harvard elms overhung no strange vautrin no old goriot no young rastignac yet the interest of the kirkland street company couldnt so to speak help itself either any more than i could help taking advantage of it in one respect certainly in the matter of talk as talk we shone incomparably brighter and if it took what we had de mieux to make our so regular resort a scene essentially of conversation the point was none the less that our materials were there i found the effect of this very easily as american as i likedliked that is to think of it and to make all i might of it for being about which in truth all difficulty vanished from the moment the local colour of the war broke in so of course this element did at that season come back to us through every outward opening and mean enough by contrast had been the questions amid which the vauquer boarders grubbed anything even indirectly touched by our public story stretching now into volume after volume of the very biggest print took on that reflected light of dignity of importance or of mere gross salience which passion charged with criticism and criticism charged with the thousand menaced affections and connections the whole of the reactioncharged in short with immediate intimate lifehave a power in such conditions to fling as from a waving torch the torch flared sufficiently about miss uphams boardsave that she herself ancient spinster pushed it in dismay from her top of the table blew upon it with vain scared sighs and would have nothing to do with a matter so disturbing to the right temperature of her plats we others passed it from hand to hand so that it couldnt go quite outsince i must in fairness add that the element of the casual and the more generally ironic the play of the studious or the irrepressibly social intelligence at large couldnt fail to insist pretty constantly on its rights there were quarters as well i should note in which the sense of local colour proceeding at all straight from the source i have namedreflected that is from camp and fieldcould but very soon run short sharply enough do i recall for instance the felt even if all so privately felt limits of my poor stream of contributive remark despite my habit so fondly practised in the connection of expatiating in petto my poor stream would have trickled truly had it been able to trickle at all from the most effective of my few occasions of realising up to that time as to field and camp literally as to camp in fact since the occasion had consisted of a visit paid or a pilgrimage rather ever so piously so tenderly made one august afternoon of the summer just ended to a vast gathering of invalid and convalescent troops under canvas and in roughly improvised shanties at some point of the rhode island shore that figures to my memory though with a certain vagueness as portsmouth grove american local names lend themselves strangely little to retention i find if one has happened to deal for long years with almost any group of european designationsthese latter springing as it has almost always come to seem straight from the soil where natural causes were anciently to root them each with its rare identity the bite into interest of the borrowed the imposed the faked label growing but as by a dab of glue on an article of trade is inevitably much less sharp vagueness at best attends however the queer experience i glance at what lives of it in the ineffaceable way being again by my incurable perversity my ambiguous economy much less a matter of the facts of the case as they should even though so dead and buried now revive to help me through an anecdote than the prodigiously subjective side of the experience thanks to which it still presumes to flush with the grand air of an adventure if i had not already so often brazened out my confession of the far from showy in the terms on which impressions could become indelibly momentous to me i might blush indeed for the thin tatter dragged in thus as an affair of record it consisted at the time simply of an emotionthough the emotion i should add appeared to consist of everything in the whole world that my consciousness could hold by that intensity did it hang as bravely as possible together and by the title so made good has it handed itself endlessly down  owing to which it is that i dont at all know what troops were in question a mere couple of rhode island regiments nothing in those days could be too big to escape the application of the mere or a congeries of the temporarily incapacitated the more or less broken picked from the veteransso far as there already were suchof the east at large and directed upon the grove as upon a place of stowage and sanitation discriminations of the prosaic order had little to do with my first and all but sole vision of the american soldier in his multitude and above allfor that was markedly the colour of the whole thingin his depression his wasted melancholy almost an effect that somehow corresponds for memory i bethink myself with the tender elegiac tone in which walt whitman was later on so admirably to commemorate him the restrictions i confess to are abject but both my sense and my aftersense of the exhibition i here allude to had thanks to my situation to do all the work they could in the way of representation to me of what was most publicly most heroically most wastefully tragically terribly going on it had so to serve for my particular nearest approach to a contact with the active dramai mean of course the collectively and scenically active since the brush of interest against the soldier single and salient was an affair of every daythat were it not for just one other strange spasm of awareness scarce relaxed to this hour i should have been left all but pitifully void of any scrap of a substitute for the concrete experience the long hot july 1st of 63 on which the huge battle of gettysburg had begun could really beor rather couldnt possibly not bea scrap of concrete experience for any group of united persons new york cousins and all who in a newport garden restlessly strolling sitting neither daring quite to move nor quite to rest quite to go in nor quite to stay out actually listened together in their almost ignobly safe stillness as to the boom of faraway guns this was as it were the warthe war palpably in pennsylvania not less than my hour of a felt rage of repining at my doomed absence from the sight of that march of the 54th massachusetts out of boston bob shaw at its head and our exalted wilky among its officers of which a great sculptor was on the spot of their vividest passing to set the image aloft forever poor other visitations comparatively had had to suffice for me i could take in fact for amusing most of all since that thank goodness was high gaiety a couple of impressions of the brief preliminary camp life at readville during which we admired the charming composition of the 44th of the same state under colonel frank lee and which fairly made romantic for me wilkys quick spring out of mere juvenility and into such brightlybristling ranks he had begun by volunteering in a company that gave him half the ingenuous youth of the circle within our social ken for brothersinarms and it was to that pair of readville afternoons i must have owed my all so emphasised vision of handsome young cabot russell who again to be his closest brotherinarms in the 54th irrecoverably lost himself as we have seen at fort wagner a dry desert one must suppose the life in which for memory and appreciation made one certain single hours or compressed groups of hours have found their reason for standing out through everything for insistently living on in the cabinet of intimate reference the museum as it were of the souls curiositieswhere doubtless at the same time an exhibition of them to mere other eyes or ears or questioning logical minds may effect itself in no plain terms we recognise such occasions more and more as we go on and are surely as a general thing glad when for the interest of memorywhich its such a business to keep interestingthey constitute something of a cluster in my queer cluster at any rate that flower of the connection which answers to the name of portsmouth grove still overtops other members of its class so that to finger it again for a moment is to make it perceptibly exhale its very principle of life this was for me at the time neither more nor less than that the american soldier in his multitude was the most attaching and affecting and withal the most amusing figure of romance conceivable the great sense of my vision being thus that as the afternoon light of the place and time lingered upon him both to the seeming enhancement of his quality and of its own romance of a more confused kind than i shall now attempt words for attended his every movement it was the charmingest touchingest dreadfullest thing in the world that my impression of him should have to be somehow of his abandonment to a rueful humour to a stoic reserve which could yet melt a relation with him once established into a rich communicative confidence and in particular all over the place of his own scanted and more or less baffled though constantly and as i couldnt not have it pathetically knowing devices  the great point remained for me at all events that i could afterwards appear to myself to have done nothing but establish with him a relation that i established it to my imagination in several casesand all in the three or four hourseven to the pitch of the last tenderness of friendship i recover that strolling about with honest and so superior fellowcitizens or sitting with them by the improvised couches of their languid rest i drew from each his troubled tale listened to his plaint on his special hard casetaking form this in what seemed to me the very poetry of the esoteric vernacularand sealed the beautiful tie the responsive sympathy by an earnest offer in no instance waved away of such pecuniary solace as i might at brief notice draw on my poor pocket for yet again as i indulge this memory do i feel that i might if pushed a little rejoice in having to such an extent coincided with not to say perhaps positively anticipated dear old walteven if i hadnt come armed like him with oranges and peppermints i ministered much more summarily though possibly in proportion to the time and thanks to my better luck more pecuniarily but i like to treat myself to making out that i can scarce have brought to the occasion in proportion to the time again and to other elements of the case less of the consecrating sentiment than he i like further to put it in a light that ever so curiously if the good walt was most inwardly stirred to his later commemorative accents by his participating in the common americanism of his hospital friends the familiar note and shared sound of which formed its ground of appeal i found myself victim to a like moving force through quite another logic it was literally i fear because our common americanism carried with it to my imagination such a disclosed freshness and strangeness working as i might say over such gulfs of dissociation that i reached across to their these hospital friends side of the matter even at the risk of an imperilled consistency it had for me the state in question colour and form accent and quality with scarce less authority than if instead of the rough tracks or worn paths of my casual labyrinth i had trod the glazed halls of some school of natural history what holds me now indeed is that such an institution might have exemplified then almost nothing but the aspects strictly native to our social and seasonal air so simply and easily conceivable to the kindly mind were at that time these reciprocities so great the freedom and pleasure of them compared with the restrictions imposed on directness of sympathy by the awful admixtures of today those which offer to the wouldbe participant among us on returns from sojourns wherever homogeneity and its entailed fraternity its easy contacts still may be seen to work the strange shock of such amenities declined on any terms really not possible then i think the perception now accompanying on american ground this shockthe recognition by any sensibility at all reflective of the point where our national theory of absorption assimilation and conversion appallingly breaks down appallingly that is for those to whom the consecrated association of the sort still at play where community has not been blighted strongly speaks which remarks may reinforce the note of my unconsciousness of any difficulty for knowing in the old the comparatively brothering conditions what an american at least was absurd thus no doubt that the scant experience over which i perversely linger insists on figuring to me as quite a revel of the right confidence  the revel though i didnt for the moment yet know it was to be renewed for me at cambridge with less of a romantic intensity perhaps but more usefully so to put it and more informingly surrounded as i presently found myself at the law school with young types or rather with young members of a single type not one of whom but would have enriched my imagined hall of congruous specimens that with the many months of it was to be the real disclosure the larger revelation that was to be the fresh picture for a young person reaching the age of twenty in wellnigh grotesque unawareness of the properties of the atmosphere in which he but wanted to claim that he had been nourished of what i mean by this i shall in a moment have more to sayafter pointing a trifle more for our patience the sense of my dilatation upon portsmouth grove perfectly distinct has remained the sail back to newport by that evenings steamboat the mere memory of which indeedand i recall that i felt it inordinately longmust have been for me just above the spring of the whole reference the sail was long measured by my acute consciousness of paying physically for my excursionwhich hadnt answered the least little bit for my impaired state this last disobliging fact became one at the same time with an intensity indeed a strange rapture of reflection which i may not in the least pretend to offer as a clear or coherent or logical thing and of which i can only say leaving myself there through the summer twilight in too scant rest on a deck stool and against the bulwark that it somehow crowned my little adventure of sympathy and wonder with a shining round of resignationa realisation as we nowadays put it that measuring wounds against wounds or the compromised the particular taxed condition at the least against all the rest of the debt then so generally and enormously due one was no less exaltedly than wastefully engaged in the common fact of endurance there are memories in truth too fine or too peculiar for notation too intensely individual and supersubtlecall them what one will yet which one may thus no more give up confusedly than one may insist on them vainly their kind is nothing ever to a present purpose unless they are in a manner statable but is at the same time ruefully aware of threatened ridicule if they are overstated not that i in the least mind such a menace however in just adding that soothed as i have called the admirable ache of my afternoon with that inward interpretation of it i felt the latteror rather doubtless simply the entire affairabsolutely overarched by the majestic manner in which the distress of our return drew out into the lucid charm of the night to which i must further add that the hour seemed by some wondrous secret to know itself marked and charged and unforgettablehinting so in its very own terms of cool beauty at something portentous in it an exquisite claim then and there for lasting value and high authority     x   all of which foregoing makes i grant a long parenthesis in my recovery of the more immediate cambridge impressions i have left them awaiting me yet i am happy to say not sensibly the worse for it in their cluster roundabout miss upham and her board of beneficiary images which latter start up afresh and with the softest submission to any convenient neglectthat ineffably touching and confessed dependence of such apparitions on ones pleasure save the mark for the flicker of restorative light the image most vividly restored is doubtless that of professor f j child head of the english department at harvard and master of that great modern science of folklore to his accomplishment in which his vast and slowlypublished collection of the ballad literature of our language is a recognised monument delightful man rounded character passionate patriot admirable talker above all thorough humanist and humorist he was the genial autocrat of that breakfasttable not only but of our symposia otherwise timed and as he comes back to me with the fresh and quite circular countenance of the time before the personal cares and complications of life had gravely thickened for him his aspect all finely circular with its close rings of the fairest hair its golden rims of the largest glasses its finished rotundity of figure and attitude i see that there was the american spiritsince i was after itof a quality deeply inbred beautifully adjusted to all extensions of knowledge and taste and as seemed to me quite sublimely quickened by everything that was at the time so tremendously in question that vision of him was never afterwards to yield to other lightsthough these even had occasion for them been more frequent with me couldnt much have interfered with it so that what i still most retain of him is the very flush and mobility the living expansion and contraction the bright comedy and almost lunar eclipse of his cherubic face according as things appeared to be going for the country i was always just across from him as my brother beside whom i took my place had been and i remember well how vivid a clockface it became to me i found still as in my younger time matter enough everywhere for gaping but greatest of all i think while that tense season lasted was my wonder for the signs and portents the quips and cranks the wreathèd smiles or otherwise the candid obscurations of our prime talkers presented visage i set as it were the small tick of my own poor watch by itwhich private register would thump or intermit in agreement with these indications i recover it that thanks to the perpetual play of his sympathy and irony confidence and scorn as well as to that of my own less certainly directed sensibility he struck me on the bad days which were then so many as fairly august cherubism and all for sincerity of association with every light and shade every ebb and flow of our cause where he most shone out indeed so that depression then wasnt a gloom in him but a darting flame was in the icy air of the attitude of the nations to us that of the couple the most potent across the sea with which we were especially concerned and which as during the whole earlier half of the war and still longer it more and more defined itself drew from him at once all the drolleries and all the asperities of his sarcasm nothing more particularly touched me in him i make outfor it lingers in a light of its ownthan the fashion after which he struck me as a fond grave guardian not so much of the memory and the ashes yet awhile as of the promise in all its flower of the sacrificial young men whom the university connection had passed through his hands and whom he looked out for with a tenderness of interest a nursing pride that was as contagious as i could possibly have wished it i didnt myself know the young men save three or four and could only at our distance hold my tongue and do them homage never afterwards as i even then foreknew would be the case missing when i could help it or failing to pick up a single brush a scattered leaf of their growing or their riper legend certain of them whom i had neither seen nor as they fell in battle was destined ever to see have lived for me since just as communicated images figures created by his tone about themwhich i admit mightnt or neednt have mattered to me for all the years yet which couldnt help so doing from the moment the right touch had handed them over to my restless claim  it was not meanwhile for want of other figures that these were gathered in for i have again to grant that in those days figures became such for me on easy terms and that in particular william had only to let the light of his attention his interest his curiosity his aversion even could he indeed have passingly lived in the helplessness of mere aversion visibly rest on them for me entirely to feel that they must count for as much as might beso far at least as my perception was concerned contact being truly another affair that was the truth at that season if it wasnt always to remain the truth i felt his interpretations his personal allowances so largely and inveterately liberal always impose themselves it was not till ever so much later and then only little by little that i came to accept the strange circumstance of my not invariably liking in homely parlance his people and his not invariably liking mine the process represented by that word was for each of us i think a process so involved with other operations of the spirit so beautifully complicated and deformed by them that our results in this sort doubtless eventually lost themselves in the labyrinth of our reasons which latter eventuallythe labyrinth i meancould be a frequent and not other than animated meetingplace in spite of the play of divergence the true case i all the while plentifully felt and still more feel now was that i diverged and my brother almost never in the sense that is that no man can well have cared less for the question or made less of the consciousness of dislikehave valued less their developments and comforts even the opposite of that complacency scarce seemed a recognised or at least in any degree a cultivated state with him his passion and that a passion of the intelligence was justice unafraidand this as it were almost unformulatedly altogether unpedantically it simply made him utterly not mind numberless things that with most people serve as dim lights warnings or attractions in the grope of appreciation or the adventure of instinct his luminous indifference kept his course thus as i was later to recognise extraordinarily straightto the increase as i have noted of my own poor sense of weakly straggling unaccompanied as this at the same time was by the least envy of such a deficiency in what is roughly called prejudice and what i to save my face in my ups and downs of sociability or curiosity could perhaps have found no better term for than the play of taste as taste wonderful and to me in the last resort admirable was williams fine heritage and awareness of that principle without its yet affecting him on the human the more largely social just the conversable and workable groundin presence of some other principle that might do so whether this validly or but speciously interfered the triumph over distaste in ones relations ones exposures ones judgments that i could understand as high virtue strained heroism the ideal groaningly applied but what left me always impressed to put it mildly was the fact that in my brothers case the incorruptibility of his candour would have had to be explained to him and with scant presumption too of his taking it in or having patience while one spoke such an enterprise i was well aware would at any rate have left me a sorry enough figure afterwards what one would have had to be what one could in the least decently be except candid without alternativethis with other like matters i should have had to be prepared to set forth and more and more addressed as i eventually found myself to a cultivation of the absolute in taste as taste to repeat my expression i was far from the wish to contend for it as against any appearance whatever of a better way such was part of the experience or call it even the discipline of association with a genius so marked for the process known as giving the benefit of the doubtand giving it for that was the irritating charm not in smug charity or for a pointed moral but through the very nature of a mind incapable of the shut door in any direction and of a habit of hospitality so free that it might again and again have been observed in contact and intercourse to supply weaker and less graced vessels with the very means of bringing in response often absolutely in retort this last of course was not so much the benefit of the doubt as the displayed unconsciousness of any doubt a perpetual aid rendered the doubtful especially when incarnate in persons to be more right or more true more clever or more charming or whatever than mere grudging love of form standing by could at all see it entitled to become anything like williams unawareness of exertion after having helped the lame dog of converse over stile after stile i have in no other case met together with which however i may not forbear to add the very occasional and comparatively small flare in him of some blest perversity of prejudice that one might enjoy on ones own side the vulgar luxury of naming as such was a thing which conformably to that elation one reached out for as one might for the white glint of the rare edelweiss on some high alpine ledge  if these remarks illustrate in their number the inevitable bent of the remark to multiply within me as an effect of fraternal evocation i thereby but stick the more to my subject or in other words to the muchpeopled scene as i found it which i should scarce have found without him peopled as it was with his people which they at first struck me as markedly being it led me then to take the company apart from f j child for whatever he all vividly and possessively pronounced it i having for a long time but the scantest company of my own even at the law school where my fellowdisciples could bear the name for me only as a troop of actors might have done on that further side of footlights to which i never went round this last at least with few exceptions while there were none to the exquisite rule as i positively today feel it of my apprehension of williams cluster as a concern of hisinteresting exactly because of that reference any concern of his was thus a thing already charged with life his life over and above its own if it happened by grace to have any comparable which as i pick out the elements again from the savoury upham shades could indeed be claimed for several of these i pick out the ardent and delicate and firm john may son as he comes back to me of a distinguished abolitionist of new york staterare bird and seen by that fact in a sort of glamour of picturesque justification an air deriving colour from the preestablished gallantry yet the quiet and gentlemanly triumph of his attitude so at least do i read back into blurred visions the richest meanings they could have i pick out for a not less baffled tribute a particular friend of my brothers and a comrade of mays whom i identify on the superficial side but by his name of salter and the fact of his studentship in theology which pursuit it comes over me as i write he must have shared of homely almost of sickly new england type as he was with may of the fine features the handsome smile by my resolute recollection the developed moustache and short dark pointed beard the property of vaguely recalling in fine some old portrait supposedly spanish supposedly and perhaps to a fantastic tune by mefor i dare say it was by no one else salter had no such referencesit even appalled me to have a bit intelligently to imagine to what origins starved of amenity or colour his aspect and air the slope of his shoulders the mode of growth of his hair the relation of his clothes to his person and the relation of his person to the inevitable needs of intercourse might refer him but there played about him a bright force in the highest and extraordinarily quick flares of which one felt nothing while the exhibition lasted but his intellectual elegance he had the distinction of witso rare we ever feel it to be when we see it beautifully act and i remember well how as that was indeed for me almost the whole of intellectual elegance i fell back on the idea that such an odd assortment of marks in him was at least picturesque or much in the maison vauquer line pinched as i must have been by the question of whether a person of that type and cut had the right to be witty on what else but the power the right rested i couldnt doubtless have said i but recall my sense that wit was somehow the finest of all social matters and that it seemed impossible to be less connected with such than this product of new england at its sparest and dryest which fact was a sort of bad mark for the higher civilisation i was prepared to recognise that you might be witty and ugly ugly with the highest finish of uglinesshadnt the celebrated voltaire been one of the scrappiest of men as well as of the most immortally quotedbut it cost a wrench to have to take it that you could shine to admiration out of such a platitude of the mere plain it was william in especial who guaranteed to me salters superior gift of which in the free commerce of divinity hall he had frequent illustrationso that what i really most apprehended i think was the circumstance of his apprehending this too with a much finer intellectual need and competence than mine after all and in the course of debates and discussions ardent young symposia of the spirit which struck me as falling in with all i had ever curiously conceived of those hours that foster the generous youth of minds preappointed to greatness there was the note of the effective quaint on which i could put my finger catch a poor student only dreary enough and then light in him the flame of irony at its intensest the range of question and the command of figure at their bravest and one might with ones appetite for character feed on the bold antithesis i had only to like for my brother and verily almost with pride his assured experience of any queer concretionhis experience of abstractions i was to rise to much more feebly and belatedly scarce more indeed ever than most imperfectlyto find the very scene of action or at least of passion enjoyed by these my elders and betters enriched and toned and consecrated after the fashion of places referred to in literature and legend  i thus live back of a suddenfor i insist on just yielding to itinto the odd hours when the poor little old divinity hall of the overgrown present faced me as through the haze of all the past indian summers it had opened its brooding studywindows to when the avenue of approach to it from the outer world was a thing of dignity a positive vista in a composition when the norton woods near by massed themselves in scarlet and orange and when to penetrate and mount a stair and knock at a door and enjoying response then sink into a windowbench and inhale at once the vague golden november and the thick suggestion of the room where nascent thought had again and again piped or wailed was to taste as i had never done before the poetry of the prime initiation and of associated growth with cards of such pale pasteboard could the trick to my vision play itselfby which i mean that i admire under this memory the constant dodges of an imagination reduced to such straits for picking up a living it was as if ones sense of europe sufficiently sure of itself to risk the strategic retreat had backed away on tiptoe just to see how the sense of what was there facing one would manage without itmanage for luxury that is with the mere indispensable doubtless otherwise provided for that the sense in question did manage beautifully when at last so hard pressed and that the plasticity and variety of my vision draw from me now this murmur of elation are truths constituting together for me the perhaps even overloaded moral of my tale with which i scarce need note that so elastic a fancy so perverse a little passion for finding good in everythinggood for what i thought of as history which was the consideration of life while the given thing whatever it was had only to be before mewas inevitably to work a storage of other material for memory closepacked enough to make such disengagement as i thus attempt at the end of time almost an act of violence i couldnt do without the scene as i have elsewhere had occasion to hint whether actually or but possibly peopled the people always calling for the background and the background insisting on the people and thanks to this harmless extravagance or thanks in other words to the visionary liberties i constantly took so that the plate of sense was at the time i speak of more overscored and figured for me than sense was in the least practically required to have it my path is even now beset to inconvenience with the personal image unextinct it presents itself i feel beyond reason and yet if i turn from it the ease is less and i am divided when i further press the spring between compunction at not pausing before some shade that seems individually and even hopefully to wait and the fear of its feeling after all scanted of service should i name it only to leave it i name for instance just to hover a little silent vanderpool the mutest presence at the upham board and quite with no sense of the invidious in so doing he was save for myself by my remembrance the only member of the law school there present i see him moreover altogether remarkably just incorruptibly and exquisitely dumb though with a gentlemanly presence a quasiconservative new jersey finish so delicate those dim discriminations that would have seemed naturally to go with a certain forensic assurance he looked so as if he came from good peoplewhich was no very common appearance on the harvard scene of those days as indeed it is to a positive degree no so very common appearance on any scene at any time it was a note of aspect which one in any case found ones self to whatever vague tune apt quite to treasure or save up so it was impossible not to recognise in our soundless commensal the very finest flower of shyness the very richest shade of the deprecating blush that one had perhaps ever encountered one ended in fact by fairly hanging on the question of whether the perfection of his modestyfor it was all a true welter of modesty not a grain of it anything stifferwould beautifully hold out or would give way to comparatively brute pressure from some point of our circle i longed to bet on him to see him through without a lapse and this in fact was so thoroughly reserved to me that my eventual relief and homage doubtless account for the blest roundness of my impression he had so much for him was tall and fine equipped and appointed born quite to an effect of ultimately basking in the light of the law acquainted one couldnt fail of seeing with a tradition of manners not to mention that of the forensic as aforesaid and not to name either the use of means equally imputable how rare accordingly would be the quality letting even the quantity alone of his inhibitions and how interesting in the event the fact that he was absolutely never to have deviated he disappeared without having spoken and yet why should i now be noting it if he hadnt nevertheless admirably expressed himself what this consisted of was that there was scarce anything he wouldnt have done for us had it been possible and i think in view of the distinctness with which he still faces me the tenderness with which he inspires my muse and the assurance with which i have gone into him that i can never in all my life since have seen so precious a message delivered under such difficulties admirable ineffaceable because so essentially all decipherable vanderpool  it wasnt either that john bancroft tossed the ball of talkwhich but for the presence of the supremely retentive agent just commemorated would have appeared on occasion to remain in his keeping by a preference on its own part not to be outwitted this more or less at all times too but especially during the first weeks of his dawning on us straight out of germany and france flushed with the alarm as one might have read it of having to justify rare opportunities and account for the time he had inordinately obscurely or at least not a little mysteriously spentthe implication of every inch of him being that he had spent it seriously odd enough it certainly was that we should have been appointed to unveil so far as we might a pair of such marked monuments to modesty marble statues as they might have been on either side of the portal of talk what i at any rate preserve of my immediate vision of bancroftwhose very promptest identity indeed had been his sonship to the eminent historian of our country and earlier and later diplomatistwas an opposition trying to me rather than engaging as its like had been in the composition of vanderpool between what we somehow wanted from him or what i at least did and what we too scantly gathered this excellent friend as he was later on to become with his handsome high head large colourable brow and eyes widely dividedbrave contribution ever to a fine countenancesat there in a sort of glory of experience which had he been capable of anything so akin to a demonstration he would have appeared all unsociably to repudiate it was bruited of him that like john la farge whose friend he was admiringly to becomefor he too had a newport connectionhe painted that is persisted which was the wondrous thing in painting and that this practice had grown upon him in france where en province his brother had entirely taken root and where the whole artlife as well as the rural life of the country had been opened to him besides its a little later coming to light that he had romantically practised at dusseldorf where too he had personally known and tremendously liked george du maurier whose first so distinguished appearances as an illustrator had already engaged our fondest attentionwere they most dawningly in the early cornhill or in punch or in once a week they glimmer upon me darkly and richly as from the pages of the last named not to be rendered i may again parenthesise our little thrilled awareness williams and mine though mine indeed but panting after his of such peeping phenomena of the european day as the outbreak of a new man upon our yearning view of the field of letters and of the arts i am moved to wonder at how we came by it shifting all for ourselves and with the parental flair so far as the sensibility of home was concerned turned but to directions of its own and much less restless on the whole than ours more touching to me now than i can say at all events this recapture of the hour at which du maurier consecrated to much later to then still faroff intimate affection became the new man so significantly as to make a great importance of john bancrofts news of him which already bore among many marvels upon the supreme wonder of his working as he was all his life bravely to work under impaired and gravely menaced eyesight when i speak as just above of what through so many veils came to light i should further add i use a figure representing a considerable lapse of time and shading off for full evocation into more associations than i can here make place for nothing in this connection came soon to light at least but that endless amazement might lie in the strange facts of difference between our companion and his distinguished sirethe latter so supremely so quaintly yet so brilliantly social a figure i apprehended when gaped at a still more angular but more polished and pacific don quixote on the sleekest of rosinantes with whitetipped chin protrusive with high sharp elbows raised and long straight legs beautifully pointed all after the gallantest fashion against the clear sunset sky of old newport cavalcades mr bancroft the elder the great was a comfort that is a fine high identity a cluster of strong accents the sort of thing ones vision followed in the light of history if not of mere misguided fancy for illustration of conceived typetype say in this case of superior person of the ancient and the more or less alien public order the world of affairs transacted at courts and chancelleries in which renown one had gathered from the perusal of memoirs allowed for much development of detail and much incision of outline when not even directly resting on them as it had been a positive bliss to me that words and names might prove in extremity sources of support so it comes back to me that i had drawn mystic strength from just obscurely sighing metternich or talleyrand as mr bancroft bounced by meso far as a pair of widelyopened compasses might bouncein the august gloaming the value of which for reflection moreover was not in the least in its being that if his son remained so long pleadingly inscrutable any derived metternich suggestion had contributed to keep him sofor quite there was the curiosity of the case that among the imputations john appeared most to repudiate was that of having at any moment breathed the air either of records or of protocols if he persisted in painting for years after his return to america without as the legend grew the smallest disclosure of his work or confession of his progress to human eye or ear he drew the rigour of this course wholly from his singleness of nature in the aftertime to be so much approved to us however i pause before the aftertime into the lap of which more than one sort of stored soundness and sweetness was to fall from him drop by drop  i scarce know whether my impulse to lead forth these most shrinking of my apparitions be more perverse or more naturalmainly feeling i confess however it appear that the rest of my impression of the animated cambridge scene so far as i could take it in was anything but a vision of unasserted forces it was only i as now appears to me who ready as yet to assert nothing hung back and for reasons even more appreciable to me today than then wondering almost regretting as i do that i didnt with a still sharper promptness throw up the sponge for stoppage of the absurd little boxingmatch within me between the ostensible and the realthis i mean because i might afterwards thereby have winced a couple of times the less in haunting remembrance of exhibited inaptitude my condition of having nothing to exhibit was blessedly one that there was nobody to quarrel withand i couldnt have sufficiently let it alone i didnt in truth under a misleading light reconsider it much yet i have kept to this hour a black little memory of my having attempted to argue one afternoon by way of exercise and under what seemed to me a perfect glare of publicity the fierce light of a mootcourt some case proposed to me by a fellowstudentwho can only have been one of the most benign of men unless he was darkly the designingest and to whom i was at any rate to owe it that i figured my shame for years much in the image of my having stood forth before an audience with a fiddle and bow and trusted myself to rub them together desperately enough after the fashion of rousseau in a passage of the confessions to make some appearance of music my music i recall before the look on the faces around me quavered away into mere collapse and cessation a void now engulfing memory itself so that i liken it all to a merciful fall of the curtain on some actor stricken and stammering the sense of the brief glare as i have called the luckless exposure revives even on this hither side of the wide gulf of time but i must have outlived every witnessi was so obviously there the very youngest of all aspirantsand in truth save for one or two minor and merely comparative miscarriages of the sacrificial act before my false gods my connection with the temple was to remain as consistently superficial as could be possible to a relation still restlessly perceptive through all its profaneness perceiving even with its accompaniments of noting wondering fantasticating kicked up no glare but went on much rather under richest shades or in manycoloured lightsa tone of opportunity that i look back on as somehow at once deliciously soothing to myself and favourable to the clearness of each item of the picture even as the cool grey sky of a landscape is equalising that was of course especially when i had let everything slideeverything but the mere act of rather difficultly living by reason of my scant physical ease and fallen back again on the hard sofa of certain ancient rooms in the winthrop square contracted nook of a local order now quite abolished and held to my nose for long and sustaining sniffs the scented flower of independence i took my independence for romantic or at least for a happy form of yawning vessel into which romance even should it perforce consist but of mere loose observational play might drop in the shape of ripe fruit from a shaken tree winthrop square as i had occasion to note a couple of years since is a forgotten name and the disappearance of my lodging spares me doubtless a reminder possibly ironic of the debility of those few constructional and pictorial elements that mustering a wondrous goodwill i had invited myself to rejoice in as colonial the house was indeed very old as antiquity in cambridge went with everything in it slanting and gaping and creaking but with humble antique points and a dignity in its decay above all with the deep recess or alcove a sweet irregularity so could irregularities of architectural conception then and there count thrust forth from its sittingroom toward what i supposed to be the brighton hills and forming by the aid of a large window and that commanding view not to mention the grace of an ancient expansive bureau or secretarydesk this such a piece i now venture to figure as would today be pounced on at any cunning dealers a veritable bower toward which even so shy a dreamer as i still then had to take myself for might perhaps hope to woo the muse the muse was of course the muse of prose fictionnever for the briefest hour in my case the presumable not to say the presuming the muchtakingforgranted muse of rhyme with whom i had never had even in thought the faintest flirtation and she did in the event i note yield to the seduction of so appointed a nookas to which romantic passage however i may not here anticipate i but lose myself in the recovered sense of what it richly meant to me just to have a place where i could so handsomely receive her where i could remark with complacency that the distant horizon an horizon long since rudely obliterated was not after all too humble to be blue purple tawny changeable in short everything an horizon should be and that over the intervening marshes of the charles if i dont go astray in so much geography there was all the fine complicated cloudscenery i could wishso extravagantly did i then conceive more or less associational cloudscenery after the fashion i mean of that feature of remembered english and boulognese watercolours to promote the atmosphere of literary composition as the act had begun to glimmer for me  everything however meant as i say more quite other things than i can pretend now to treat of the mere fact of a sudden rupture as by the happiest thought with the form of bringing home from the lawlibrary sheepskin volumes that might give my table if not for sufficiency of emphasis my afflicted self a temporary countenance heaped up the measure of my general intentionfrom the moment i embraced instead of it the practice of resorting to gore hall exclusively for my readingmatter a practice in the light of which my general intention took on the air of absolutely basking to get somehow and in spite of everything in spite especially of being so much disabled at life that was my brooding purpose straight out of which the college library with its sparse bristle of aspiring granite stood open to far more enchanted distances than any represented by the leathery walls with never a breach amid their labelled and numbered blocks that i might pretend to beat against in the other quarter yet happily enough on this basis of general rather than of special culture i still loosely rejoiced in being where i was and by way of proof that it was all right the swim into my ken of saintebeuve for whose presence on my table in still other literary company gore hall aiding i succeeded in not at all blushing became in the highest degree congruous with regular attendance at lectures the forenoon lectures at dane hall i never in all my time missed that i can recollect and i look back on it now as quite prodigious that i should have been so systematically faithful to them without my understanding the first word of what they were about they contrivedor at least my attendance at them did inimitablyto be life and as my wondering dips into the vast deep well of the french critic to whom all my roused response went out brought up that mystery to me in cupfuls of extraordinary savour where was the incongruity of the two rites that the causeries du lundi wholly fresh then to my grateful lips should so have overflowed for me was certainly no marvelthat prime acquaintance absolutely having by my measure to form a really sacred date in the development of any historic or aesthetic consciousness worth mentioning but that i could be to the very end more or less thrilled by simply sitting all stupid and sentient in the thick company of my merely nominal associates and under the strange ministrations of dr theophilus parsons governor washburn and professor joel parker would have appeared to defy explanation only for those by whom the phenomena of certain kinds of living and working sensibility are unsuspected for myself at any rate there was no anomalythe anomaly would have been much rather in any prompter consciousness of a sated perception i knew why i liked to go i knew even why i could unabashedly keep going in face of the fact that if i had learned my reason i had learned and was still to learn absolutely nothing else and that sufficiently supported me through a stretch of bodily overstrain that i only afterwards allowed myself dejectedly to measure the mere sitting at attention for two or three hourssuch attention as i achievedwas paid for by sorry pain yet it was but later on that i wondered how i could have found what i got an equivalent for the condition produced the condition was one of many and the others for the most part declared themselves with much of an equal though a different sharpness it was acute that is that one was so incommoded but it had broken upon me with force from the first of my taking my seatwhich had the advantage i acknowledge of the rim of the circle symbolising thereby all the detachment i had been foredoomed tothat the whole scene was going to be and again and again as american and above all as suffused with new england colour however one might finally estimate that as i could possibly have wished such was the effect of ones offering such a plate for impressions to play on at their will as well as of ones so failing to ask in advance what they would matter so taking for granted that they would all matter somehow it would matter somehow for instance that just a queer dusky half smothered light as from windows placed too low or too many interposing heads should hang upon our old auditoriumlong since voided of its then use and with all its accessory chambers seated elsewhere afresh and in much greater state which glimpse of a scheme of values might well have given the measure of the sort of profit i was or rather wasnt to derive it doubtless quite ought to have confounded me that i had come up to faire mon droit by appreciations predominantly of the local chiaroscuro and other like quantities but i remember no alarmi only remember with what complacency my range of perception on those general lines was able to spread  it mattered by the same law no end that dr theophilus parsons whose rich if slightly quavering old accents were the first to fall upon my ear from the chair of instruction beneath a huge hot portrait of daniel webster should at once approve himself a vivid and curiouslycomposed person an illustrative figure as who should sayexactly with all the marks one might have wished him marks of a social order a general air a whole history of things or in other words of people since there was nothing one mightnt by my sentiment do with such a subject from the moment it gave out character character thus was all over the place as it could scarce fail to be when the general subject the one gone in for had become identical with the persons of all its votaries such was the interest of the source of edification just named not one ray of whose merely professed value so much as entered my mind governor washburn was of a different but of a no less complete consistencyqueer ingenuous more candidly confiding especially as to his own pleasant fallibility than i had ever before known a chaired dispenser of knowledge and all after a fashion that endeared him to his young hearers whose resounding relish of the frequent tangle of his apologetic returns upon himself quite almost always to inextricability was really affectionate in its freedom i could understand and admire thatit seemed to have for me legendary precedents whereas of the third of our instructors i mainly recall that he represented dryness and hardness prose unrelieved at their deadliestpartly perhaps because he was most master of his subject he was none the less placeable for these things withal and what mainly comes back to me of him is the full sufficiency with which he made me ask myself how i could for a moment have seen myself really browse in any field where the marks of the shepherd were such an oblong dome of a bare cranium such a fringe of dropping little ringlets toward its base and a mouth so meanly retentive so ignorant of style as i made out above a chin so indifferent to the duty or at least to the opportunity of chins if i had put it to myself that there was no excuse for the presence of a young person so affected by the idea of how people looked on a scene where the issue was altogether what they usefully taught as well as intelligently learned and wanted to learn i feel i should after my first flush of confusion have replied assuredly enough that just the beauty of the former of these questions was in its being of equal application everywhere which was far from the case with the latter the question of how people looked and of how their look counted for a thousand relations had risen before me too early and kept me company too long for me not to have made a fight over it from the very shame of appearing at all likely to give it up had some fleeting delusion led me to cast a slur upon it it would do i was already sure half the work of carrying me through life and where was better proof of all it would have to give than just in the fact of what it was then and there doing it worked for appreciationnot one of the uses of which as an act of intelligence had all round finer connections and on the day in short when one should cease to live in large measure by ones eyes with the imagination of course all the while waiting on this one would have taken the longest step towards not living at all my companionshowever scantly indeed they were to become suchwere subject to my so practising in a degree which represented wellnigh the whole of my relation with them small reciprocity for them as there may have been in it since vision and nothing but vision was from beginning to end the fruit of my situation among them there was not one of them as to whom it didnt matter that he looked by my fancy of him thus or so the key to this disposition of the accents being for me to such an extent that as i have said i was with all intensity taking in new england and that i knew no better immediate way than to take it in by my senses what that name really comprehended had been a mystery daily growing less to which everything that fell upon those senses referred itself making the innumerable appearances hang together ever so densely theophilus parsons with his tone his unction his homage still to some ancient superstition some standard of manners reached back as to a state of provincialism rounded and compact quite selfsupporting which gave it serenity and quality something comparatively rich and urban the good exgovernor on the other hand of whom i think with singular tenderness opened through every note of aspect and expression straight into those depths of rusticity which more and more unmistakably underlay the social order at large and out of which one felt it to have emerged in any degree but at scattered points where it did emerge i seemed to see it held itself as high as possible conscious panting a little elate with the fact of having cleared its skirts saved its life consolidated its boston yet as with wastes unredeemed roundabout it propping up and pushing inall so insistently that the light in which one for the most part considered the scene was strongly coloured by their action this was ones clue to the labyrinth if labyrinth it was to be calleda generalisation into which everything fitted first to surprise and then indubitably to relief from the moment one had begun to make it under its law the puritan capital however visibly disposed to spread and take on new disguises affected me as a rural centre even to a point at which i had never known anything as rural there being involved with this too much further food for curiosity and wonder boston was in a manner of its own stoutly and vividly urban not only a town but a town of historyso that how did it manage to be such different things at the same time that was doubtless its secretmore and more interesting to study in proportion as on closer acquaintance yet an acquaintance before which the sense of ones preferred view from outside never gave way one felt the equilibrium attained as on the whole an odd fusion and intermixture of the chemical sort as it were and not a matter of elements or aspects sharply alternating there was in the exhibition at its best distinctly a savouran excellent thing for a community to have and part of the savour was as who should say the breath of the fields and woods and waters though at their domesticated and familiarised stage or the echo of a tone which had somehow become that of the most educated of our societies without ceasing to be that of the village  of so much from the first i felt sure and this all the more that by my recollection of new york even indeed by my recollection of albany we had been aware in those places of no such strain new york at least had been whatever disagreeable not to say whatever agreeable other thing one might have declared itit might even have been vulgar though that cheap substitute for an account of anything didnt i think in the connection then exist for me but the last reference to its nature likely to crop up in its social soil was beyond question the flower of the homely new england had by ones impression cropped up there but had done so just as new england new england unabsorbed and unreconciled which was exactly a note in the striated the piebald or more gracefully cosmopolite local character i am not sure that the comparativelyi say comparativelymarkettown suggestion of the city by the charles came out for me as a positive richness but it did essentially contribute to what had become so highly desirable the reinforcement of my vision of american life by the idea of variety i apparently required of anything i should take to my heart that it should be approached at different angles like as many other things as possiblein accordance with which it made for a various america that boston should seem really strong really in not having for better or worse the same irrepressible likenesses as new york i invoked i called down the revelation of new likenesses by the simple act of threading the boston streets whether by garish day the afterglow of the great snowfalls of winter was to turn in particular to a blinding glare an unequalled hardness of light or under that mantle of night which draped as with the garb of adventure our longdrawn townward little rumbles in the interest of the theatre or of parkersoh the sordid yet never in the least deterrent conditions of transit in that age of the unabbreviated the dividing desert and the primitive horsecar the desert is indeed despite other local developments and the general theory of the rate at which civilisation spreads and ugliness wanes still very much what it was in the last midcentury but the act of passage through it has been made to some extent easier parkers played in the intercourse of cambridge with boston a part of a preponderance that i look back upon i confess as the very condition of the purest felicity we knewi knew at any rate myself none whether of a finer or a grosser strain that competed with this precious relation competition has thickened since and proportions have alteredto no small darkening of the air but the time was surely happier a single such point de repère not only sufficed but richly heaped up the measure parkers on the whole side of the joy of life was bostonspeaking as under the thrill of early occasions recaptured boston could be therefore in the acutest connections those of young comradeship and young esthetic experience heaven save the mark fondly prepared or properly crowned but the enjoyed and shared repast literally the american feast as i then appraised such values a basis of native abundance on which everything else rested the theatre resorted to whenever possible rested indeed doubtless most though with its heaviest weight thrown perhaps at a somewhat later time the theatre my uncanny appetite for which strikes me as almost abnormal in the light of what i braved to reach it from the studious suburb or more particularly braved to return from it i touch alas no spring that doesnt make a hum of memories and pick them over as i will three or four of that scenic strain linger on my sense the extraordinary fact about thesewhich plays into my generalisation a little way backwas that for all the connection of such occasions with the great interest of the theatre at large there was scarce an impression of the stage wrung from current opportunity that didnt somehow underscore itself with the special boston emphasis and this in spite of the fact that plays and performers in those days were but a shade less raggedly itinerant over the land than they are now the implication of the provincial in the theatric air and of the rustic in the provincial may have been a matter of the house itself with its twenty kinds of redolence of barbarismwith the kind determined by the very audience perhaps indeed plainest vivid to me at all events is it how i felt even at the time in repairing to the howard atheneum to admire miss maggie mitchell and miss kate bateman that one would have had only to scratch a little below the surface of the affair to come upon the but halfburied puritan curse not so very long before devoted to such perversities wasnt the curse still in the air and could anything less than a curse weighing from far back on the general conscience have accounted for one could scarce say what want of selfrespect in the total exhibitionfor that intimation more than anything else perhaps of the underhand snicker with which one sat so oddly associated by the blest law of youth and fancy withal one did admire the actressthe young need to admire as flatly as one could broke through all crowding apprehensions i like to put it down that nothing in the world qualified my wonder at the rendering by the first of the performers i have named of the figure of fanchon the cricket in a piece so entitled an artless translation from a german original if i rightly remember which original had been an arrangement for the stage of la petite fadette george sands charming rustic idyll i like to put it down that miss maggie mitchells having for years as i gathered twanged that one string and none other every night of her theatric life over the huge country before she was revealed to usjust as mr joe jefferson with no word of audible reprehension ever once addressed to him was to have twanged hisdid nothing to bedim the brightness of our vision or the apparent freshness of her art and that above all it seemed a privilege critically to disengage the delicacy of this art and the rare effect of the natural in it from the baseness in which it was framed so golden a glimmer is shed as one looks back from any shaky little torch lighted by whatever fond stretch at the high esthetic flame upon these faint sparks in the night of time would i gently breathe just to see them again distinguishably glow rather than leave their momentary function uncommemorated strange doubtless were some of the things that represented these momentary functionsstrange i mean in proportion to the fires they lighted the small bower of the muse in winthrop square was first to know the fluttered descent of the goddess to my appeal for her aid in the composition of a letter from which the admired miss maggie should gather the full force of my impression particularly do i incline even now to mention that she testified to her having gratefully gathered it by the despatch to me in return of a little printed copy of the play a scant pamphlet of acting edition humility addressed in a hand which assumed a romantic cast as soon as i had bethought myself of finding for it a happy precedent in that of pendenniss miss fotheringay  it had been perhaps to the person of this heroine that pendennis especially rendered homage while i without illusions or at least without confusions was fain to discriminate in favour of the magic of method that is of genius itself which exactly more than anything else could have done success as i considered crowning my demonstration contributed to consecrate to an exquisite use the exquisite my auspicious réduit aforesaid for an esthetic vibration to whatever touch had but to be intense enough to tremble on into other reactions under other blest contacts and commotions it was by the operation again of the impulse shaking me up to an expression of what the elder star of the howard atheneum had artistically meant to me that i first sat down beside my view of the brighton hills to enrol myself in the bright band of the fondly hoping and fearfully doubting who count the days after the despatch of manuscripts i formally addressed myself under the protection not to say the inspiration of winthrop square to the profession of literature though nothing would induce me now to name the periodical on whose protracted silence i had thus begun to hang with my own treasures of reserve to match it the bearing of which shy ecstasiesshy of exhibition then that is save as achievements recognisedis on their having thus begun at any rate to supply all the undertone one needed to whatever positive perfunctory show the show proceeding as it could all the while thanks to much help from the undertone which felt called upon at times to be copious it is not i allow that memory may pretend for me to keep the two elements of the under and the over always quite distinctit would have been a pity all round in truth should they have altogether escaped mixing and fraternising the positive perfunctory show at all events to repeat my term hitched itself along from point to point and could have no lack of outside support to complain of i reflect from the moment i could make my own every image and incitementthose as i have noted of the supply breaking upon me with my first glimpse of the cambridge scene if i seem to make too much of these it is because i at the time made still more more even than my pious record has presumed to set down the air of truth doubtless hangs uneasy as the matter stands over so queer a case as my having by my intimation above found appreciability in life at the law school even under the failure for me of everything generally drawn upon for it whether the glee of study the ardour of battle or the joy of associated adventure not to have felt earlier sated with the mere mechanic amusement or vain form of regularity at lectures would strike me today as a fact too rum for belief if certain gathered flowers by the way flowers of perverse appreciation though they might but be didnt give out again as i turn them over their unspeakable freshness they were perforce gathered what makes it still more wondrous all too languidly yet they massed themselves for my sense through the lapsing months to the final semblance of an intimate secret garden such was the odd the almost overwhelming consequenceor one of these for they are manyof an imagination to which literally everything obligingly signified one of the actual penalties of this is that so few of such ancient importances remain definable or presentable it may in the fulness of time simply sound bête that with the crash of greater questions about one i should have been positively occupied with such an affair as the degree and the exact shade to which the blest figures in the school array each quite for himself might settle and fix the weight the interest the function as it were of his americanism i could scarce have cleared up even for myself i dare say the profit or more pertinently the charm of that extravaganceand the fact was of course that i didnt feel it as extravagance but quite as homely thrift moral social esthetic or indeed as i might have been quite ready to say practical and professional it was practical at least in the sense that it probably more helped to pass the time than all other pursuits together the real proof of which would be of course my being able now to string together for exhibition some of these pearls of differentiationsince it was to differentiation exactly that i was then in my innocence most prompted not dreaming of the stiff law by which on the whole american ground division of type in the light of opposition and contrast was more and more to break down for me and fail so that verily the recital of my mere concomitant efforts to pick it up again and piece its parts together and make them somehow show and serve would be a record of clinging courage i may note at once however as a light on the anomaly that there hung about all young appearances at that period something ever so finely derivative and which at this day rather defies reexpressionthe common character or shared function of the precious clay so largely making up the holocausts of battle an advantage working for them circuitously or perhaps ambiguously enough i grant but still placing them more or less under the play of its wing even when the arts of peace happened for the hour to engage them they potentially they conceivably they indirectly paid and nothing was for the most part more ascertainable of them individually than that with brothers or other near relatives in the ranks or in commands they came to their credit of paying families all of which again may represent the high pitch of ones associated sensibilitythere having been occasions of crisis were they worth recovering when under its action places persons objects animate or not glimmered alike but through the grand idealising the generalising blur at moments of less fine a strain it may be added the sources of interest presented themselves in looser formation the young appearances as i like to continue to call them could be pleasingly or at least robustly homogeneous and yet for livelier appeal to fancy flower here and there into special cases of elegant deviationsports of exotic complexion one enjoyed denominating these or would have enjoyed had the happy figure then flourished thrown off from the thick stem that was rooted under our feet even these rare exceptions the few apparitions referring themselves to other producing conditions than the new england wrought by contrast no havoc in the various quantities for which that section was responsible it was certainly refreshingalways to the fond imaginationthat there were for a change imprints in the stuff of youth that didnt square with the imprint virtually one throughout imposed by springfield or worcester by providence or portland or whatever rural wastes might lie between yet the variations i none the less gather as i strive to recall them beguiled the spirit talking always of my own rather than coerced it and this even though fitting into life as one had already more or less known it fitting in that is with more points of contact and more reciprocation of understanding than the new england relation seemed able to produce it could in fact fairly blind me to the implication of an inferior immediate portée that such and such a shape of the new york heterogeneity however simplified by silliness or at least by special stupidity though who was i to note that pressed a certain spring of association waiting as i always was for such echoes rather than left it either just soundless or bunglingly touched  it was for example a link with the larger life as i am afraid i must have privately called it that a certain young new yorker an outsider of still more unmistakable hue than i could suppose even myself came and went before us with an effect of cultivated detachment that i admired at the time for its perfect consistency and that caused him it was positively thrilling to note not in the least to forfeit sympathy but to shine in the high light of public favour the richest reflections sprang for me from this some of them inspiring even beyond the promptly grasped truth a comparative commonplace that the variation or opposition sufficiently embodied the line of divergence sharply enough drawn always achieves some triumph by the fact of its emphasis by its putting itself through at any cost any cost in particular of ridicule so much one had often observed but what really enriched the dear induction and made our friends instance thus remain with me was the part played by the utter blandness itself of his protest such an exhibition of the sweet in the imperturbable this it was that enshrined him by my vision in a popularity than which nothing could have seemed in advance less indicated and that makes me wonder today whether he was simply the luckiest of gamblers or just a conscious and consummate artist he reappears to me as a finished fop finished to possibilities we hadnt then dreamt of and as taking his stand or rather taking all his walks on that the magicians wand of his ideally tight umbrella under his arm and the magicians familiar of his bristling toyterrier at his heels he became thus an apparition entrancing to the mind his clothes were of a perfection never known nor divined in that sphere a revelation straight and blindingly authentic of savile row in its prime his single eyeglass alone and his inspired his infinite use of it as at once a defensive crystal wall and a lucid window of hospitality one couldnt say most which might well have foredoomed him by all likelihood to execration and destruction he became none the less as i recover him our general pride and joy his entrances and exits were acclaimed beyond all others and it was his rare privilege to cause the note of derision and the note of affection to melt together beyond separation in vague but virtual homage to the refreshment of felt type to see it dawn upon rude breasts for rude comparatively were the breasts of the typeless or at the best of the typed but in one character throughout the same that defiant and confident difference carried far enough might avert the impulse to slay was to muse ever so agreeably on the queer means by which great morals picking up a life as they may can still get themselves pointed the connotation of the trivial it was thus attaching to remark could perfectly serve when that of the important roughly speaking failed for a grateful connectionfrom the moment some such was massed invitingly in view the difficulty with the type about me was that in its monotony beginning and ending with itself it had no connections and suggested none whereas the grace of the salient apparition i have perhaps too earnestly presented lay in its bridging over our separation from worlds from great faroff reservoirs of a different mixture altogether another civility and complexity young as i was i myself clearly recognised that ground of reference saw it even to some extent in the light of experienceso could i stretch any scrap of contact kept hold of it by fifty clues recalls and reminders that dangled for me mainly out of books and magazines and heard talk things of picture and story things of prose and verse and anecdotal vividness in fine and as i have elsewhere allowed for the most part hoardedly english and french our character man of the priceless monocle and the trotting terrier was like some type in a collection of typesthat was the word for it and there being no collection nor the ghost of one roundabout us was a lone courageous creature in the desert of our bald reiterations the charm of which conclusion was exactly as i have said that the common voice did by every show bless him for rendered service his dropped hint of an ideal containing the germ of other idealsand confessed by that fact to more appetites and inward yearnings than it the least bit consciously counted up  not quite the same service was rendered by g a j who had no ridicule to brave and i can speak with confidence but of the connections rather confused if they were opened up to me by his splendid aspect and which had absolutely nothing in common with the others that hung near it was brilliant to a degree that none other had by so much as a single shade the secret of and it carried the mooning fancy to a further reach even on the whole than the figure of surprise i have just commemorated this last comparatively scant in itself and rich only by what it made us read into it and g a j on the other hand intrinsically and actively ample and making us read wonders as it were into whatever it might be that was as we used to say back of him he had such a flush of life and presence as to make that reference mysteriously and inscrutably loomand the fascinating thing about this as we again would have said was that it could strike me as so beguilingly american that too was part of the glamour that its being so could kick up a mystery which one might have pushed on to explore whereas our new york friend only kicked up a certainty for those properly prepared and left not exploration but mere assured satisfaction the mark of the case g a j reached westward westward even of new york and southward at least as far as virginia teeming facts that i discovered so to speak by my own unaided intelligenceso little were they responsibly communicated little was communicated that i recoverit would have had to drop from too great a personal height so that the fun as i may call it was the greater for my opening all by myself to perceptions i was getting furiously american in the big sense i invoked through this felt growth of an ability to reach out westward southward anywhere everywhere on that apprehension of finding myself but patriotically charmed thus there dawned upon me the grand possibility that charm for charm the american the assumed the postulated would in the particular case of its really acting count double whereas the european paid for being less precarious by being also less miraculous it counted single as one might say and only made up for that by counting almost always it mightnt be anything like almost always even at the best no doubt that an americangrown value of aspect would so entirely emerge as g a js seemed to do but what did this exactly point to unless that the rarity so implied would be in the nature of the splendid that at least was the way the cultivation of patriotism as a resource was the cultivation of workable aids to the same however ingenious these just to glow belligerently with ones country was no resource but a primitive instinct breaking through and besides this resources were cooling not heating it might have seemed that i might after all perfectly dispense with friends when simple acquaintances and rather feared ones at that though feared but for excess of lustre could kindle in the mind such bonfires of thought feeding the flame with gestures and sounds and light accidents of passage so beyond their own supposing in spite of all which however g a j was marked for a friend and taken for a kinsman from the day when his blaze of colour should have sufficiently cleared itself up for me to distinguish the component shades     xi   i am fully aware while i go i should mention of all that flows from the principle governing by my measure these recoveries and reflectionseven to the effect hoped for at least of stringing their apparently dispersed and disordered parts upon a fine silver thread none other than the principle of response to a longsought occasion now gratefully recognised for making trial of the recording and figuring act on behalf of some case of the imaginative faculty under cultivation the personal history as it were of an imagination a lively one of course in a given and favourable case had always struck me as a task that a teller of tales might rejoice in his advance through it conceivably causing at every step some rich precipitationunless it be rather that the play of strong imaginative passion passion strong enough to be for its subject or victim the very interest of life constitutes in itself an endless crisis fed by every contact and every apprehension and feeding in turn every motion and every act wouldnt the light in which it might so cause the whole scene of life to unroll inevitably become as fine a thing as possible to represent the idea of some pretext for such an attempt had again and again naturally haunted me the man of imagination and of an awfully good one showed as the creature of that force or the sport of that fate or the wielder of that arm for the hero of a hundred possible fieldsif one could but first catch him after the fashion of the hare in the famous receipt who and what might he prove when caught in respect to other signs and conditions he might take it would seem some finding and launching let alone much handlingwhich itself however would be exactly part of the pleasure meanwhile it no less appeared there were other subjects to go on with and even if one had to wait for him he would still perhaps come it happened for me that he was belatedly to come but that he was to turn up then in a shape almost too familiar at first for recognition the shape of one of those residual substitutes that engage doubting eyes the day after the fair he had been with me all the while and only too obscurely and intimatelyi had not found him in the market as an exhibited or offered value i had in a word to draw him forth from within rather than meet him in the world before me the more convenient sphere of the objective and to make him objective in short had to turn nothing less than myself inside out what was i thus within and essentially what had i ever been and could i ever be but a man of imagination at the active pitchso that if it was a question of treating some happy case any that would give me what artistically speaking i wanted here on the very spot was one at hand in default of a better it wasnt what i should have preferred yet it was after all the example i knew best and should feel most at home withgranting always that objectivity the prize to be won shouldnt just be frightened away by the odd terms of the affair it is of course for my reader to say whether or no what i have done has meant defeat yet even if this should be his judgment i fall back on the interest at the worst of certain sorts of failure i shall have brought up from the deep many things probably not to have been arrived at for the benefit of these pages without my particular attempt sundry of such i seem still to recognise and not least just now those involved in that visionary assistance at the drama of the war from however far off which had become a habit for us without ceasing to be a strain i am sure i thought more things under that head with the fine visionary ache than i thought in all other connections together for the simple reason that one had to ask leaveof ones own spiritfor these last intermissions whereas one but took it with both hands free for ones sense of the bigger cause there was not in that the least complication of consciousness i have sufficiently noted how my apprehension of the bigger cause was at the same time and this all through at once quickened and kept low to the point that positively my whole acquaintance of the personal sort even with such a matter as my brother wilkys enrolment in the 44th massachusetts was to reduce itself to but a single visit to him in camp  i recall an afternoon at readville near boston and the fashion in which his state of juniority gave way for me on the spot to immensities of superior difference immensities that were at the same time intensities varieties supremacies of the enviable in the alldifficult and the delightful in the impossible such a fairytale seemed it and withal such a flat revolution that this soft companion of my childhood should have such romantic chances and should have mastered by the mere aid of his native gaiety and sociability such mysteries such engines such arts to become first a happy soldier and then an easy officer was in particular for g w j an exercise of sociabilityand that above all was my extract of the readville scene which most came home to me as a picture an interplay of bright breezy air and high shantycovered levels with blue horizons and laughing welcoming sunburnt young men who seemed mainly to bristle through their welcome with boston genealogies and who had all alike turned handsome only less handsome than their tawnybearded colonel under i couldnt have said what common grace of clear blue toggery imperfectly and hitchingly donned in the midst of the camp labours that i gaped at by the blessing of heaven i could in default of other adventures still gape as at shining revels i couldnt do things i couldnt indefinitely hang about though on occasion i did so as it comes back to me verily to desperation which had to be my dim explanationdim as to my ever insisting on itof so rare a snatch at opportunity for gapings the liveliest or in better terms admirations the crudest that i could have presumed to encumber the scene with scarce credible to me now even under recall of my frustrations that i was able in all this stretch of time to respond but to a single other summons to admire at any cost which i think must have come again from readville and the occasion of which that of my brothers assumed adjutancy of the so dramatically so much more radically recruited 54th involved a view superficially less harmonious the whole situation was more wound up and girded then the formation of negro regiments affected us as a tremendous war measure and i have glanced in another place at the consequence of it that was at the end of a few months most pointedly to touch ourselves that second aspect of the weeks of preparation before the departure of the regiment can not at all have suggested a frolic though at the time i dont remember it as grim and can only gather that as the other impression had been of something quite luminous and beautiful so this was vaguely sinister and sadperhaps simply through the fact that though our sympathies our own as a familys were in the current phrase all enlisted on behalf of the race that had sat in bondage it was impossible for the mustered presence of more specimens of it and of stranger than i had ever seen together not to make the young men who were about to lead them appear sacrificed to the general tragic need in a degree beyond that of their more orthodox appearances the air of sacrifice was however so to brighten as to confound itself with that of splendid privilege on the day may 28th 63 of the march of the 54th out of boston its fairest of young commanders at its head to great reverberations of music of fluttering banners launched benedictions and every public sound only from that scene when it took place i had to be helplessly absentjust as i see myself in a like dismal manner deprived of any nearness of view of my still younger brothers military metamorphosis and contemporary initiation i vainly question memory for some such picture of him at this stage of his adventure as would have been certain to hang itself for reasons of wonder and envy again in my innermost cabinet our differently compacted and more variously endowed bob who had strained much at every tether was so eager and ardent that it made for him a positive authority but what most recurs to me of his start in the 45th or of my baffled vision of it is the marvel of our not having all just wept more than anything else either for his being so absurdly young or his being so absurdly strenuouswe might have had our choice of pretexts and protests it seemed so short a time since he had been lingénieux petit robertson of the domestic schoolroom pairing with our small sister as i paired with wilky we didnt in the least weep howeverwe smiled as over the interest of childhood at its highest bloom and that my parents with their consistent tenderness should have found their surrender of their latest born so workable is doubtless a proof that we were all lifted together as on a wave that might bear us where it would our ingenious robertson was but seventeen years old but i suspect his ingenuity of having in so good a cause anticipated his next birthday by a few months the 45th was a ninemonths regiment but he got himself passed out of it in advance of its discharge to a lieutenancy in the 55th usct colonel a p hallowell transferred from lieutenantcolonelcy of the 54th commanding though not before he had been involved in the siege of charleston whence the visionary the quite edgar poeish look for my entertainment of the campcovered folly island of his letters while his regiment was engaged in seymours raid on florida he suffered a serious sunstroke with such consequences that he was recommended for discharge of which he declined to avail himself obtaining instead a position on general amess staff and enjoying thus for six months the relief of being mounted but he returned to his regiment in front of charleston after service with the tenth army corps part of the army of the james before petersburg and richmond and though i have too scant an echo of his letters from that scene one of the passages that i do recover is of the happiest it was when the line wavered and i saw genl hartwells horse on my right rear up with a shell exploding under him that i rammed my spurs into my own beast who maddened with pain carried me on through the line throwing men down and over the rebel works some distance ahead of our troops for this action he was breveted captain and the 55th later on was the first body of troops to enter charleston and march through its streetswhich term of his experience as it unfolded presents him to my memory as again on staff duty with brigadiergenerals potter rufus hatch and his old superior and at my present writing gallant and vivid survivor alfred hartwell who had been his captain and his lieutcolonel in the 45th and the 55th respectively10  i can at all events speak perfectly of my own sense of the uplifting wave just alluded to during the couple of years that the boys letters from the field came in to uswith the one abatement of glamour for them the fact that so much of their substance was in the whole air of life and their young reports of sharp experience but a minor pipe in the huge mixed concert always in our ears faded and touching pages these letters are in some abundance before me now breathing confidence and extraordinary cheerthough surviving principally but in wilkys admirable hand of all those i knew at that time the most humiliating to a feebler yet elder fist and with their liveliest present action to recompose for me not by any means so much the scenes and circumstances the passages of history concerned as to make me know again and reinhabit the places the hours the stilled or stirred conditions through which i took them in these conditions seem indeed mostly to have settled for me into the single sense of what i missed compared to what the authors of our bulletins gained in wondrous opportunity of vision that is appreciation of the thing seenthere being clearly such a lot of this and all of it by my conviction portentous and prodigious the key to which assurance was that i longed to live by my eyes in the midst of such farspreading chances in greater measure than i then had help to and that the measure in which they had it gloriously overflowed this capacity in them to deal with such an affluence of life stood out from every line and images sprung up about them at every turn of the story the story the general one of the great surge of action on which they were so early carried was to take still other turns during the years i now speak of some of these not of the happiest but with the same relation to it on my own part too depressingly prolongedthat of seeing sharing envying applauding pitying all from too faroff and with the queer sense that whether or no they would prove to have had the time of their lives it seemed that the only time i should have had would stand or fall by theirs this was to be yet more deplorably the case later oni like to give a twitch to the curtain of a future reduced to the humility of a past when the war being over and we confronted with all the personal questions it had showily muffled up only to make them step forth with their sharper angles well upon us our father easily beguiled acquired by purchase and for the benefit of his younger sons divers cottonlands in florida which scene of blighted hopes it perhaps was that cast upon me at its defiant distance the most provoking spell there was provocation at those subsequent seasons in the very placename of serenola beautiful to ear and eye unforgettable were to remain the times while the vain experiment dragged on for our anxiety and curiosity and finally to our great discomfiture when my still ingenuous young brothers occupied in raising and selling crops that refused alike it seemed to come and to go wafted northward their fluctuating faith their constant hospitality and above all for one of the number at home their large unconscious evocations the mere borrowed and so brokenly borrowed impression of southern fields basking in a light we didnt know of scented subtropic nights of a situation suffused with economic and social drama of the strangest and sharpest worked in me i dare say most deceptively as a sign of material wasted my material not being in the least the crops unproduced or unsold but the precious store of images ungathered however the vicarious sensation had as i say been intense enough from point to point before that a series of wilkys letters of the autumn of 62 and the following winter during operations in north carolina intended apparently to clear an approach to charleston overflow with the vivacity of his interest in whatever befell and still more in whatever promised and reflect in this freshness of young assurances and young delusions the general public fatuity the thread of interest for me here would certainly be much more in an exhibition of some such artless notes of the period with their faded marks upon them than in that of the spirit of my own poor perusal of themwere it not that those things shrink after years to the common measure when not testifying to some rarity of experience and expression all experience in the field struck me indeed as then rare and i wondered at both my brothers military mastery of statement through which played on the part of the elder a whimsicality of turn an oddity of verbal collocation that we had ever cherished in the family circle as the sign of his address the next fight we have i expect he writes from newberne n c on new years day 63 will be a pretty big one but i am confident that under foster and our gunboats we will rid the state of these miserable wretches whom the divine providence has created in its wisdom to make men wish send on then open yourselves a recruiting establishment if necessaryall we want is numbers they are the greatest help to the individual soldier on the battlefield if he feels he has 30000 men behind him pushing on steadily to back him he is in much more fighting trim than when away in the rear with 10000 ahead of him fighting like madmen it seems that halleck told foster when f was in washington that he scarcely slept for a week after learning that we were near goldsboro having heard previously that a reinforcement of 40000 rebels were coming down there to whip us long live foster  it was so cold this morning he writes at another and earlier date that divine service was held in our barracks instead of outofdoors as it generally is and it was the most impressive that i have ever heard the sermon was on profanity and the chaplain after making all the observations and doing by mouth and action as much as he could to rid the regiment of the curse sat down credulous being thinking he had settled the question for ever colonel lee then rose and said that the chaplain the other day accused himmost properlyof profanity and of its setting a very bad example to the regiment also that when he took the command he had felt how very bad the thing would be in its influence on all around him he felt that it would be the great conflict of his life at this point his head drooped and he lifted his handkerchief to his face but he went on in conclusion now boys let us try one and all to vindicate the sublime principles our chaplain has just so eloquently expressed and i will do my best i hope to god i have wounded no mans feelings by an oath if i have i humbly beg his pardon here he finished how this passage impressed me at the time signifies little but i find myself now feel in its illustration of what could then happen among soldiers of the old puritan commonwealth a rich recall of some story from cromwellian ranks striking the continuity and not unworthy of it my brothers further comment i leave you to imagine which of these appeals did most good the conventional address of the pastor or the honest manly hearttouching acknowledgment of our colonel that is the man through and through and i heard myself say afterwards let him swear to all eternity if he is that sort of man and if profanity makes such for goodness sake let us all swear this may be a bad doctrine but is one that might after all undergo discussion from which letter i cull further i really begin to think youve been hard in your judgments of mcclellan you dont know what an enemy we have to conquer every secesh ive seen and all the rebel prisoners here talk of the war with such callous earnestness a letter from newberne of december 2nd contains a pathetic record of momentary faith the sort so abundant at the time in what was not at all to be able to happen moreover a name rings out of it which it is a kind of privilege to give again to the airwhen one can do so with some approach to an association signified so much did charles lowells virtue and value and death represent at the season soon to come for those who stood within sight of them and with such still unextinct emotion may the few of these who now survive turn to his admirably inspired kinsmans harvard commemoration ode and find it infinitely and tenderly suffused with pride two gallantest nephews particularly radiant to memory had james russell lowell to commemorate      i sweep for them a pæan but they wane         again and yet again     into a dirge and die away in pain      in these brave ranks i only see the gaps     thinking of dear ones whom the dumb turf wraps     dark to the triumph which they died to gain       cabot has had news that mr amos lawrence of boston is getting up a      cavalry regiment wilky writes and he has sent home to try for a      commission as 2nd lieutenant now if we could only both get such      a commission in that regiment you can judge yourself how desirable      it would be perkins will probably have one in the massachusetts      2nd and our orderly stands a pretty good chance of one in the 44th      this cavalry colonelcy will probably be for cabots cousin charles      lowell       there is a report that we start this week for kinston and if so we      shall doubtless have a good little fight we have just received 2      new mass regiments the 8th and the 51st we have absolutely no      time to ourselves and what time we do have we want much more to      give to lying down than to anything else but try your best for me      now and i promise you to do my best wherever i am  a homelier truth is in a few lines three weeks later       the men as a general thing think war a mean piece of business as      its carried on in this state we march 20 or 30 miles and find the      enemy entrenched in riflepits or hidden away in some      outoftheway place we send our artillery forward and after a      brisk skirmish ahead the foe is driven back into the woods and we      march on for 20 miles more to find the same luck we were all on      the last march praying for a fight so that we might halt and throw      off our knapsacks i dont pretend i am eager to make friends with      bullets but at whitehall after marching some 20 miles i was on      this account really glad when i heard cannonading ahead and the      column was halted and the fight began  the details of this engagement are missing from the letter but we found matter of interest in two or three other passagesone in particular recording a december days march with 15000 men not including artillerymen 70 pieces of artillery and 1100 cavalry which on account of obstructions on the roads had achieved by night but seventeen miles and resulted in a bivouac in 3 immense cottonfields one about as large as eastons pond at newport       we began to see the camp fires of the advance brigade about 4 miles      ahead of us and i assure you those miles were soon got over i      think willys artistic eye would have enjoyed the sightit seemed      so as if the world were on fire when we arrived on the field the      stacks were made the ranks broken and the men sent after rail      fences which fortunately abound in this region and are the only      comfort we have at night a long fire is made the length of the      stacks and one rank is placed on one side of it and the other      opposite i try to make a picture you see but scratch it out in      despair the fires made we sit down and make our coffee in our tin      dippers and often is one of these pushed over by some careless      wretch who hasnt noticed it on the coals or has been too tired to      look the coffee and the hard tack consumed we spread our rubber      blankets and sleep as sound as any house in christendom at about 5      the fearful réveillé calls us to our feet we make more coffee      drink it in a hurry sling our knapsacks and spank down the road in      one of fosters regular old quicksteps  thrilling at our fireside of course were the particulars of the kinston engagement and still more doubtless the happy freshness of the writer       at 8 am we were on the road and had hardly marched 3 miles when      we knew by sounds ahead that the ball had opened we were ordered      up and deployed in an open field on the right of the road where we      remained some half an hour then we were moved some hundred yards      further but resumed our former position in another field here      foster came up to the major who was directly in the rear of our      company and told him to advance our left wing to support morrisons      battery which was about half a mile ahead he also said he was      pressing the rebs hard and that they were retiring at every shell      from our side on we went the left flank company taking the lead      and many a bullet and shell whizzed over our heads in that longest      halfmile of my life we seemed to be nearing the fun for wounded      men were being carried to the rear and dead ones lay on each side      of us in the woods we were taken into another field on the left of      the road and before us were deployed the 23rd mass who were      firing in great style first we were ordered to lie down and then      in 5 or 10 minutes ordered up again when we charged down that      field in a manner creditable to any waterloo legion i felt as if      this moment was the greatest of my life and as if all the devils of      the inferno were my benighted system we halted after having      charged some 60 yards when what should we see on our left just      out of the woods and stuck up on a rail but a flag of truce      placing under its protecting wing some 50 or 60 poor cowering      wretches who in their zeal for recognition not only pulled out      all their pocket handkerchiefs but in the case of one man spread      out his white shirtflaps and offered them pacifically to the      winds the most demonic shouts and yells were raised by the 23rd      ahead of us at this sight in which the 44th joined while the      regiments on our right and that of the road greeted in the same      frightful manner 200 prisoners they had cut off from retreat by the      bridge so far i was alive and the thing had lasted perhaps 3      hours all the enemy but the 200 just named had got away over the      bridge to kinston and our cavalry were in hot pursuit i dont      think sergeant g w has ever known greater glee in all his born      days at about 3 pm we crossed the bridge and got into the town      all along the road from bridge to town rebel equipments guns and      cartridgeboxes lay thick and within the place dead men and horses      thickened too we were taken ahead through the town to support the      new york 3rd artillery beyond where it was shelling the woods      around and ridding the place for the night of any troublesome      wanderers the union pickets posted out ahead that night said the      shrieks of women and children further on in the wood could be heard      perfectly all night long these unfortunates having taken refuge      there from the threatened town that night we lived like      fightingcocksmolasses pork butter cheese and all sorts of      different delicacies being foraged for and houses entered      regardless of the commonest dues of life and others set on fire to      show kinston was our own she belonged to our army and almost      every man claimed a house if i had only had your orders beforehand      for trophies i could have satisfied you with anything named from a      gold watch to an old brickbat this is the ugly part of war a too      victorious army soon goes down but we luckily didnt have time      for big demoralisation as the next day in the afternoon we found      ourselves some 17 miles away and bivouacking in a single prodigious      cornfield  to which i dont resist subjoining another characteristic passage from the same general scene as a windup to that small chapter of history       the report has gained ground today that we leave tomorrow and if      so i suppose the next three months will be important ones in the      history of the war four ironclads and a great many gunboats are in      beaufort harbour we have at present a force of 50000 infantry an      immense artillery and upwards of 800 cavalry transports      innumerable are filling up every spare inch of our harbour and      every mans pity and charity are exercised upon charleston mobile      or wilmington we are the only ninemonths regiment going a fact      which to the sensitive is highly gratifying showing fosters      evident high opinion of us the expedition i imagine will be      pretty interesting for we shall have excitement enough without the      fearful marches today is sunday and ive been reading hugos      account of waterloo in les misérables and preparing my mind for      something of the same sort at wilmington god grant the battle may      do as much harm to the rebels as waterloo did to the french if it      does the fight will be worth the dreadful carnage it may involve      and the experience for the survivors an immense treasure men will      fight forever if they are well treated give them little marching      and keep the wounded away from them and theyll do anything i am      very well and in capital spirits though now and then rather blue      about home but only 5 months more and then heaven general foster      has just issued an order permitting us to inscribe goldsboro      kinston and whitehall on our banner  on the discharge of the 44th after the term of nine months for which it had engaged and my brothers return home he at once sought service again in the massachusetts 54th his connection with which i have already recorded as well as his injuries in the assault on fort wagner fruitlessly made by that regiment in the summer of 63 he recovered with difficulty but at last sufficiently from his wounds with one effect of which he had for the rest of his short life grievously to reckon and made haste to rejoin his regiment in the fieldto the promotion of my gathering a few more notes from off grahams point tillapenny river headquarters 2nd brigade he writes in december 64       we started last night from the riflepits in the front of deveaux      neck to cross the tillapenny and make a reconnaissance on this side      and try and get round the enemys works it is now halfpast 10      am and i have been trying to wash some of my mud off we are all      a sorry crowd of beggarsi dont look as i did the night we left      home i am much of the time mud from head to foot and my spirit is      getting muddled also but i am in excellent condition as regards my      wounds and astonish myself by my powers i rode some 26 miles      yesterday and walked some 3 in thick mud but dont feel a bit the      worse for it were only waiting here an hour or two to get a      relief of horses when we shall start again we shant have a fight      of any kind today but tomorrow expect to give them a little      trouble at pocotaligo colonel hallowell commands this      reconnaissance we have only 4 regiments and a section of artillery      from the 2nd brigade with us we heard some fine music from the      rebel lines yesterday they have got a stunning band over there      prisoners tell us its a militia band from georgia most all the      troops in our front are militia composed of old men and boys the      flower of the chivalry being just now engaged with sherman at      savannah we hear very heavy firing in that direction this morning      and i guess the chivalry is getting the worst of it the taking of      fort mcallister the other day was a splendid thingwe got 280      prisoners and made them go out and pick up the torpedoes round the      fort sherman was up at oguchee and ossahaw yesterday on another      consultation with foster we had called our whole army out the      night before in front of our works to give him three cheers this      had a marvellous effect upon the rebs about 20 men came in the      night into our lines thinking we had got reinforcements and were      going to advance later a scout has just come in and tells us the      enemy are intrenched about 4 miles off so that we shall have      today a shindy of some kind our headquarters are now in a large      house once owned by judge graham the coloured troops are in high      spirits and have done splendidly this campaign  the high spirits of the coloured troops appear naturally to have been shared by their officersin the field tillapenny river late at night on december 23rd 64       we have just received such bully news to comfort us that i cant      help rising from my slumbers to drop you a line a despatch just      received tells us that sherman has captured 150 guns 250000 dols      worth of cotton at savannah that forrest is killed and routed by      rousseau and that thomas has walked into hood and given him the      worst kind of fits i imagine the poor rebel outposts in our front      feel pretty blue tonight for what with that and the thermometer      at about zero i guess the night wont pass without robbing their      army of some of its best and bravest we suffer a good deal from      the cold but are now sitting round our camp fire in as good      spirits as men could possibly be a despatch received early this      evening tells us to look out sharp for hardee but this latest news      knocks that to a cocked hat and we are only just remembering that      that gentleman is round my foot is bully  as regards that impaired member on which he was ever afterwards considerably to limp he opines three days later on christmas evening that even in the palmy days of old it never felt better than now and he goes on       though savannah is taken i fear we shant get much credit for      having helped to take it yet night and day we have been at it      hammer and tongs and as we are away from the main army and      somewhat isolated and cut off our work has been pretty hard we      have had only 1200 effective men in our brigade and out of that      number have had regularly 400 on picket night and day and the      fatigue and extra guard duty have nearly used them up twice we      have been attacked and both times held our own twice we attacked      and once have been driven the only prisoners we have captured on      the whole expedition have been taken by this part of the column      and on the whole though we didnt march into savannah i know you      will give us a little credit for having hastened its downfall      three prisoners that we took the other night slept at our hdqrs      and we had a good long talk with them we could get out of them      nothing at all that helps from a military point of view but their      stories about the confederacy were most hopeless they were 3      officers and gentlemen of a crack sc cavalry company which has      been used during the war simply to guard this coast and their      language and state of mind were those of the true southern      chevalier they confessed to a great scare on finding themselves      hemmed in by coloured troops and all agree that the niggers are      the worst enemies they have had to face on thursday we turned them      over to the provostmarshal at deveaux neck who took them to genl      hatch the general had got our despatch announcing we could get      nothing at all out of them and he came down on them most      ruthlessly and told them to draw lots as one would have to swing      before night he told them he had got the affidavit of an escaped      union prisoner a man captured at honey hill and who had come into      our lines the day previous to the effect that he had witnessed the      hanging of a negro soldier belonging to the 26th usct and that      he had determined one of them should answer for it two seemed very      much moved but the third lee by name cousin of genl stephen lee      of the cavalry said he knew nothing about it but if it was so      so it might be the other two were taken from each other and genl      hatch managed to draw a good deal of information from them about      our position that is the force and nature of the enemy and works      in our front lee refused to the last to answer any question      whatever and they all 3 now await at hilton head the issue of the      law the hanging of the negro seems a perfectly ascertained      facthe was hung by the 48th georgia infty and the story has      naturally much stirred up our coloured troops if hardee should      decide to come down on us i believe he would get the worst of it      and only hope now that our men wont take a prisoner alive they      certainly make a great mistake at washington in not attending to      these little matters and i am sure the moral effect of an order      from the president announcing that such things have happened and      that the coloured troops have taken them thoroughly to heart would      be greater on the rebels than any physical blow we can deal them  when i read again in the field before pocotaligo toward the middle of january 65 that sherman leaves tonight from beaufort with logans corps to cross beaufort ferry and come up on our right flank and push on to pocotaligo bridge the stir as from great things rises again for me wraps about shermans name as with the huge hum that then surrounded it and in short makes me give the passage such honour as i may we are waiting anxiously for the sound of his musketry announcing him i was never in my life to wait for any such sound but how at that juncture i hung about with privileged wilky we all propose at hdqrs to take our stores out and ride up to the bank of the river and watch the fight on the other side we are praying to be relieved hereour men are dying for want of clothing and when we see morris island again we shall utterly rejoice he writes three days later from headquarters established in a plantation the name of which as well as that of the stream of whatever magnitude that they had crossed to reach it happens to be marked by an illegibility quite unprecedented in his splendid scriptto the effect of a still intenser evocation as was then to be felt at any rate of all the bignesses involved shermans whole army is in our front and they expect to move on charleston at any moment shermans whole armyit affected me from afar off as a vast epic vision the old vibration lives again but with it also that of the smaller and nearer the more intimate notessuch for instance as i shall go up to the 20th corps tomorrow and try for a sight of billy perkins and sam storrow in the 2nd mass into which i somehow read under the touch of a ghostly hand no more weirdly laid than that more volumes than i can the least account for or than i have doubtless any business to  my visionary yearning must however i think have drawn most to feed on from the first of a series of missives dated from headquarters department of the south hilton head sc this particular one of the middle of february i write in a great hurry to tell you i have been placed on general gillmores staff as adc it is just the very thing for my foot under present circumstances and i consider myself most fortunate i greatly like the general who is most kind and genial and very considerate my duties will be principally the carrying of orders to savannah morris island fortress monroe combalee florida and the generals correspondence charleston is ours he goes on two days later it surrendered to a negro regiment yesterday at 9 am we have just come up from sumter where we have hoisted the american flag we were lying off bulls bay yesterday noon waiting for this when the general saw through his glass the stars and stripes suddenly flown from the town hall we immediately steamed up to sumter and ran up the colours there old gillmore was in fine feather and i am in consummate joy the joy nevertheless i may add doesnt prevent the remark after a couple of days more that charleston isnt on the whole such a very great material victory in fact the capture of the place is of value only in that its moral effect tends to strengthen the union cause after which he proceeds       governor aiken of sc came up to hdqrs today to call on the      genl and they had a long talk he is a gradual emancipationist      and says the worst of the presidents acts was his sweeping      proclamation before that every one in this state was ready to come      back on the gradual system and would have done so if lincolns act      hadnt driven them to madness this is all fine talk but there is      nothing in it they had at least 5 months warning and could have      in that time perfectly returned within the fold in fact the strong      abolitionists of the north were afraid the president had made the      thing but too easy for them and that they would get ahead of us and      themselves emancipate this poor gentleman is simple crazy and      weakminded between davis and us he is puzzled beyond measure      and doesnt know what line to take one thing though troubled him      most namely the ingratitude of the negro he cant conceive how      the creatures he has treated with such extraordinary kindness and      taken such care of should all be willing to leave him he says he      was the first man in the south to introduce religion among the      blacks and that his plantation of 600 of them was a model of      civilisation and peace just think of this immense slaveholder      telling me as i drove him home that the coat he had on had been      turned three times and his pantaloons the only ones he possessed      he stated this so simply and touchingly that i couldnt help      offering him a pair of minewhich he refused however there are      some 10000 people in the town mostly women and negroes and its      tremendously ravaged by our shell about which they have naturally      lied from beginning to end  bob has just come down from charleston he writes in marchhe has been commissioned captain in the 103rd usct i am sorry he has left his regiment still he seemed bent on doing so and offers all kinds of reasons for it he may judge rightly but i fear hes hasty and indeed this might appear from a glimpse of our younger brother at his ease given by him in a letter of some days before written at two oclock in the morning and recording a day spent in a somewhat arduously performed visit to charleston i drove out to the entrenchments today to see b and found him with hartwell r js colonel smoking their long pipes on the verandah of a neat country cottage with a beautiful garden in front of them and the birds chirping and rambling around bob looks remarkably well and seemed very nice indeed he speaks very highly of hartwell and the latter the same of him they seemed settled in remarkable comfort at charleston and to be taking life easy after their 180 miles march through south carolina he mentions further that his visit to the captured city begun the previous day had been made in interesting conditions there is in fact matter for quotation throughout the letter the last of the small group from which i shall borrow he had with his general accompanied a large senatorial delegation from washington and shown them round the place he records the delegations delight in what they saw how a large crowd of young ladies were of the party so that the senatorial presences were somewhat relieved and lightened to the members of the staff and also that they all went over to forts sumter and moultrie and the adjacent works the pleasure of the whole company in the scene of desolation thus presented is one of those ingenuous historic strokes that the timespirit after a sufficient interval permits itself to smile atand is not the only such it may be noted in the sincere young statement       tomorrow they go to savannah returning here in the evening when      there is to be a grand reception for them at hdqrs we expect genl      robert anderson the loyalist commandant at sumter when originally      fired upon by the next steamer with gideon welles secretary of      the navy and a number of other notables from washington anderson      is going to raise the old flag on sumter and of course there will      be a great shindy herei only wish you were with us to join in it      i never go to sumter without the deepest exhilarationso many      scenes come to my mind its the centre of the nest and for one to      be there is to feel that the whole game is up these people have      always insisted that there the last gun should be fired but the      suffering and desolation of this land is the worst feature of the      whole thing if you could see what they are reduced to you couldnt      help being touched the best people are in utter penury they look      like the poorest of the poor and they talk like them also they are      deeply demoralised in fact degraded charleston is more forsaken      and stricken than i can describe it reminds me when i go through      the streets of some old doomed city on which the wrath of god has      rested from far back and if it ever revives will do so simply      through the infinite mercy and charity of the north but for this      generation at least the inhabitants are done for cant h come      down and pay us a visit of 2 or 3 weeks i can get him a war dept      pass approved by general gillmore  h knew and well remembers the pang of his inability to accept this invitation to the value of which for emphasis of tragic life on the scene of the great drama the next passage adds a touch mrs william young the lady alluded to was a friend we had known almost only on the european stage and amid the bright associations of paris in particular whom did we suppose he had met on the arrival of a steamer from the north but this more or less distracted acquaintance of other dayswho had come down to try and get her stepmother into our lines and take her home she is accompanied by a friend from new york and expects to succeed in her undertaking i hardly think she will however as her mother is 90 miles out of our lines and a very old woman we have sent a negro out to give her mrs youngs news but how can this poor old thing travel such a distance on foot and sleep in the swamp besides its an absurd idea but i shall do everything in my power to facilitate it of what further befell i gather no account but i remember how a later time was to cause me to remark on the manner in which even dire tragedy may lapse in the individual life and leave no trace on the ground it has ravagednone at least apparent unless pushingly searched for the last thing to infer from appearances on much subsequent renewal of contact with mrs young in paris again was that this tension of a reach forth across great warwasted and swampsmothered spaces for recovery of an aged and halfstarved pedestrian female relative counted for her as a chapter of experience the experience of paris dressmakers and other like matters had so revived and supervened but let me add that i speak here of mere appearances and have ever inclined to the more ironic and more complicating vision of them it would doubtless have been too simple for wonder that our elegant friend should have lived as it were under the cloud of reminiscenceand wonder had always somewhere to come in     xii   it had been however neither at newport nor at cambridgethe cambridge at least of that single yearthat the plot began most to thicken for me i figure it as a sudden stride into conditions of a sort to minister and inspire much more all round that we early in 1864 migrated as a family to boston and that i now seem to see the scene of our existence there for a couple of years packed with drama of a finer consistency than any i had yet tasted we settled for the interesting time in ashburton placethe sympathetic old house we occupied one of a pair of tallish brick fronts based as to its ground floor upon the dignity of timedarkened granite was lately swept away in the interest of i know not what grander cause and when i wish to think of such intercourse as i have enjoyed with the good city at its closest and as who should say its kindest though this comes doubtless but to saying at its freshest i live over again the story of that sojourn a period bristling while i recover my sense of it with an unprecedented number of simultaneous particulars to stick as i can only do to the point from which my own young outlook worked the things going on for me so tremendously all at once were in the first place the last impressions of the war a whole social relation to it crowding upon us there as for many reasons all of the best it couldnt have done elsewhere and then more personally speaking the prodigious little assurance i found myself gathering as from one day to another that fortune had in store some response to my deeply reserved but quite unabashed design of becoming as literary as might be it was as if our whole new medium of existence aiding i had begun to see much further into the question of how that end was gained the vision quickened by a wealth a great mixture of new appearances became such a throbbing affair that my memory of the time from the spring of 64 to the autumn of 66 moves as through an apartment hung with garlands and lightswhere i have but to breathe for an instant on the flowers again to see them flush with colour and but tenderly to snuff the candles to see them twinkle afresh things happened and happened repeatedly the mere brush or sidewind of which was the stir of life and the fact that i see when i consider how it was mostly the mere sidewind i got doesnt draw from the picture a shade of its virtue i literally and under whatever felt restriction of my power to knock about formed independent relationsseveral and two or three of them as i then thought of the very most momentous i may not attempt just here to go far into these save for the exception of the easiest to treat which i also by good fortune win back as by no means the least absorbingthe beautiful the entrancing presumption that i should have but to write with sufficient difficulty and sufficient felicity to get once for all that was the point into the incredibility of print i see before me in the rich the manyhued light of my room that overhung dear ashburton place from our third floor the very greenbacks to the total value of twelve dollars into which i had changed the cheque representing my first earned wage i had earned it i couldnt but feel with fabulous felicity a circumstance so strangely mixed with the fact that literary composition of a high order had at that very table where the greenbacks were spread out quite viciously declined and with the air of its being also once for all to come on any save its own essential terms which it seemed to distinguish in the most invidious manner conceivable from mine it was to insist through all my course on this distinction and sordid gain thereby never again to seem so easy as in that prime handling of my fee other guerdons of the same queer the same often rather greasy complexion followed for what had i done to the accompaniment of a thrill the most ineffable an agitation that as i recapture it affects me as never exceeded in all my life for fineness but go one beautiful morning out to shady hill at cambridge and there drink to the lees the offered cup of editorial sweetnessnone ever again to be more delicately mixed i had addressed in trembling hope my first fond attempt at literary criticism to charles eliot norton who had lately and with the highest brightest competence come to the rescue of the north american review submerged in a stale tradition and gasping for life and he had not only published it in his very next numberthe interval for me of breathless brevitybut had expressed the liveliest further hospitality the gage of which was thus at once his welcome to me at home i was to grow fond of regarding as a positive consecration to letters that halfhour in the long library at shady hill where the winter sunshine touched serene bookshelves and arrayed pictures the whole embrowned composition of objects in my view with i knew not what golden light of promise what assurance of things to come there was to be nothing exactly like it later onthe conditions of perfect rightness for a certain fresh felicity certain decisive pressures of the spring can occur it would seem but once this was on the other hand the beginning of so many intentions that it mattered little if the particular occasion was not repeated for what did i do again and again through all the years but handle in plenty what i might have called the small change of it  i despair however as i look back of rendering the fusions in that muchmixed little time every feature of which had something of the quality and interest of every other and the more salient the more epochmakingi apply with complacency the portentous termto drape themselves romantically in the purple folds of the whole i think it must have been the sense of the various climaxes the enjoyed because so long postponed revenges of the war that lifted the moment in the largest embrace the general consciousness was of such big things at last in sight the huge national emergence the widening assurance however overdarkened it is true by the vast black cost of what general grant no lighthanded artist he was doing for us he was at all events working to an end and something strange and immense even like the light of a new day rising above a definite rim shot its rays through the chinks of the immediate the highpiled screen of sacrifice behind which he wrought i fail to seize again to my wonder the particular scene of our acclamation of lees surrender but i feel in the air the exhalation of our relief which mingled near and far with the breath of the springtime itself and positively seemed to become over the land over the world at large in fact an element of reviving nature sensible again are certain other sharpest vibrations then communicated from the public consciousness ashburton place resounds for me with a wild cry rocks as from a convulsed breast on that early morning of our news of lincolns death by murder and in a different order but also darkening the early day there associates itself with my cherished chamber of application the fact that of a sudden and while we were always and as much as ever awaiting him hawthorne was dead what i have called the fusion strikes me as indeed beyond any rendering when i think of the peculiar assault on my private consciousness of that news i sit once more halfdressed late of a summer morning and in a bedimmed light which is somehow at once that of dear old green american shutters drawn to against openest windows and that of a moral shadow projected as with violencei sit on my belated bed i say and yield to the pang that made me positively and loyally cry i didnt rise early in those days of scant easei now even ask myself how sometimes i rose at all which ungrudged license withal i thus make out was not less blessedly effective in the harmony i glance at than several showier facts to tell at all adequately why the pang was fine would nevertheless too closely involve my going back as we have learned to say on the whole rich interpenetration i fondly felt it in those days invaluable that i had during certain last and otherwise rather blank months at newport taken in for the first time and at one straight draught the full sweet sense of our one fine romancers workfor sweet it then above all seemed to me and i remember well how while the process day after day drew itself admirably out i found the actual exquisite taste of it the strain of the revelation justify up to the notch whatever had been weak in my delay this prolonged hanging off from true knowledge had been the more odd so that i couldnt have explained it i felt through the fact that the wonderbook and twicetold tales had helped to enchant our childhood the consequence at any rate seemed happy since without it very measurably the sudden sense of recognition would have been less uplifting a wave the joy of the recognition was to know at the time no lapsewas in fact through the years never to know one and this by some rare action of a principle or a sentiment i scarce know whether to call it a clinging consistency or a singular silliness that placed the seven gables the blithedale romance and the story of donatello and miriam the accepted title of which i dislike to use not the marble but very particularly the human faun being throughout in question somewhere on a shelf unvisited by harsh inquiry the feeling had perhaps at the time been marked by presumption by a touch of the fatuity of patronage yet wasnt wellnigh the best charm of a relation with the works just named in the impulse known from the first somehow to stand in between them and harsh inquiry if i had asked myself what i meant by that term at which freedom of appreciation in fact of intelligence might have looked askance i hope i should have found a sufficient answer in the mere plea of a sort of bêtise of tenderness i recall how once in the air of rome at a time ever so long subsequent a friend and countryman now no more who had spent most of his life in italy and who remains for me with his accomplishment his distinction his extraordinary play of mind and his too early and too tragic death the clearest case of cosmopolitan culture i was to have known exclaimed with surprise on my happening to speak as from an ancient fondness for hawthornes treatment of the roman scene why can you read that thing and hereto me it means nothing at all i remember well that under the breath of this disallowance of any possibility of association and quite most of such a one as i had from far back positively cultivated the gentle perforated book tumbled before me from its shelf very much as old polonius at the thrust of hamlets sword must have collapsed behind the pictured arras of course i might have picked it up and brushed it off but i seem to feel again that i didnt so much as want to lost as i could only have been in the sense that the note of harsh inquiry or in other words of the very stroke i had anciently wished to avert there fell straight upon my ear it represented everything i had so early known we must have none of though there was interest galore at the same time as there almost always is in lively oppositions of sensibility with the sharpness of each its special exclusions well exhibited in an american measure that could so reject our beautiful genius and in a roman as it were that could so little see he had done anything for rome h b brewster in truth literary master of three tongues at least was scarce american at all homely superstitions had no hold on him he was french italian above all perhaps german and there would have been small use even had there been any importance in my trying to tell him for instance why it had particularly been in the gentle time that i had settled once for all to take our authors case as simply exquisite and not budge from that taking which indeed scarce bears telling now with matters of relative if but of relative urgence on handconsisting as it mainly did in the fact that his work was all charged with a tone a full and rare tone of prose and that this made for it an extraordinary value in an air in which absolutely nobodys else was or has shown since any aptitude for being and the tone had been in its beautyfor me at leastever so appreciably american which proved to what a use american matter could be put by an american hand a consummation involving it appeared the happiest moral for the moral was that an american could be an artist one of the finest without going outside about it as i liked to say quite in fact as if hawthorne had become one just by being american enough by the felicity of how the artist in him missed nothing suspected nothing that the ambient air didnt affect him as containing thus he was at once so clear and so entireclear without thinness for he might have seemed underfed it was his danger and entire without heterogeneity which might with less luck and to the discredit of our sufficing manners have had to be his help these remarks as i say were those i couldnt or at any rate didnt make to my roman critic if only because i was so held by the other case he offered methat of a culture for which in the dense medium around us miriam and donatello and their friends hadnt the virtue that shines or pushes through i tried to feel that this constatation left me musingand perhaps in truth it did though doubtless if my attachment to the arranger of those images had involved to repeat my not budging my meditation whatever it was respected that condition  it has renewed itself however but too much on this spot and the scene viewed from ashburton place claims at the best more filling in than i can give it any illustration of anything worth illustrating has beauty to my vision largely by its developments and developments alas are the whole flowering of the plant while what really meets such attention as one may hope to beguile is at the best but a plucked and tossed sprig or two that my elder brother was during these months away with professor agassiz a member of the party recruited by that great naturalist for a prolonged exploration of brazil is one of the few blooms i see that i must content myself with detachingthe main sense of it being for myself no doubt that his absence and he had never been at anything like such a distance from us left me the more exposed and thereby the more responsive to contact with impressions that had to learn to suffice for me in their uncorrected when not still more in their inspiringly emphasised state the main sense for william himself is recorded in a series of letters from him addressed to us at home and for which against my hope these pages succeed in affording no spacethey are to have ampler presentation but the arrival of which at irregular intervals for the greater part of a year comes back to me as perhaps a fuller enrichment of my consciousness than it owed for the time to any other single source we all still hung so together that this replete organ could yet go on helping itself with whatever awkwardness from the conception or projection of others of a like general strain such as those of ones brothers might appear thanks to which constant hum of borrowed experience in addition to the quicker play of whatever could pass as more honestly earned my stage of life knew no drop of the curtain i literally came and went i had never practised such coming and going i went in particular during summer weeks and even if carrying my general difficulty with me to the white mountains of new hampshire with some repetition and again and again back to newport on visits to john la farge and to the edmund tweedys their house almost a second summer home to us to say nothing of winter attempts a little weak but still more or less achieved upon new yorkwhich city was rapidly taking on the capital quality the large worldly sense that dear old london and dear old paris with other matters in hand for them as time went on the time they were biding for me indulgently didnt grudge it the matters they had in hand wandered indeed as stray vague airs across to usthis i think i have noted but boston itself could easily rule in default even of new york when to go in particular was an act of such easy virtue to go from ashburton place was to go verily round the corner not less than further afield to go to the athenæum to the museum to a certain door of importances in fact of immensities defiant of vulgar notation in charles street at the opposite end from beacon the fruit of these mixed proceedings i found abundant at the time and i think quite inveterately sweet but to gather it in again nowby which i mean set it forth as a banquet for imaginations already providedwould be to presume too far not least indeed even on my own cultivated art of exhibition the fruit of golden youth is all and always goldenit touches to gold what it gathers this was so the essence of the case that in the first place everything was in some degree an adventure and in the second any differences of degree guiding my selection would be imperceptible at this end of time to the cold eye of criticism not least moreover in the third place the very terms would fail under whatever ingenuity for my really justifying so bland an account of the period at large do i speak of it as a thumping sum but to show it in the small change the handful of separate copper and silver coin the scattered occasions reduced to their individual cash value that spread upon the table as a treasure of reminiscence might only excite derision why was staying at newport so absurdly insistently romantic romantic out of all proportion as we saywhy unless i can truly tell in proportion to what it became so it consisted often in my sitting to john la farge within his own precincts and in the open air of attenuated summer days and lounging thereby just passive to the surge of culture that broke upon me in waves the most desultory and disjointed it was true but to an absolute effect of unceasingly scented spray particular hours and old that is young ineffable reactions come back to me its like putting ones ear doctorfashion to the breast of timeor say as the subtle savage puts his to the groundand catching at its start some vibratory hum that has been going on more or less for the fifty years since newport the barren isle of our return from europe had thus becomeand at no such great expense if the shock of public affairs everywhere making interests start to their feet be counted out of the processa source of fifty suggestions to me which it would have been much less however i hasten to add if the call of la farge hadnt worked in with our other most standing attraction and this in turn hadnt practically been part of the positive affluence of certain elements of spectacle why again i should have been able to see the pictorial so freely suggested that pictorial which was ever for me the dramatic the social the effectively human aspect would be doubtless a baffling inquiry in presence of the queer and dear old phenomena themselves those that taken together may be described at the best i suppose rather as a muchmixed grope or halting struggle call it even a competitive scramble toward the larger the ideal elegance the traditional forms of good society in possession than as a presentation of great noble assurances  spectacle in any case broke out spectacle accumulated by our then measure many thicknesses deep flushing in the sovereign light as one felt it of the waning rhode island afternoons of august and september with the most evolved material civilisation our american world could then show the vividest note of this in those years unconscious even to an artless innocence of the wider wings still to spread being the long daily corso or processional drive with cavaliers and amazons not otherwise than conveniently intermixed which with a different direction for different days offered doubtless as good an example of that gregarious exercise at any cost distinguishing fashionable life as was anywhere on the globe to be observed the price paid for the sticking together was what emphasised i mean the wondrous resolve to stick however scant and narrow and unadjusted for processional effect the various fields of evolution the variety moreover was short just as the incongruities of composition in the yearning array were marked but the tender grace of old sunset hours the happier breadth of old shining sands under favour of friendly tides the glitter quand même of caparisoned animals appointed vehicles and approved charioteers to say nothing of the other and more freely exchanged and interrelated brightnesses then at play in the softer ease of women the more moustachiod swagger of men the braver bonhomie of the social aspect at large melted together for fond fancy into a tone a rhythm a representational virtue charged as to the amenities with authority the amenities thus sought their occasion to multiply even to the sound of far cannonades and i well remember at once reflecting in such maturity as i could muster that the luckier half of a nation able to carry a huge warburden without sacrifice of amusement might well overcome the fraction that had to feed but on shrinkage and privation at the same time that the so sad and handsome face of the most frequent of our hostesses mary temple the elder as she had been now the apt image of a stern priestess of the public altar was to leave with me for the years to come the grand expression and tragic irony of its revulsion from those who offering us some high entertainment during days of particular tension could fiddle as she scathingly said while rome was burning blest again the state of youth which could appreciate that admirable look and preserve it for illustration of one of the forms of ancient piety lost to us and yet at the same time stow away as part of the poetry of the general drama just the luxury and pride overhanging summer seas and projecting into summer nights great shafts of light and sound that prompted the noble scorn the round of pleasure all this with a grand good conscience of coursefor it always in the like case has that had it at least when arranging performances dramatic and musical at ever so much a ticket under the advantage of rare amateur talent in aid of the great sanitary commission that walked in the footsteps and renewed in various forms the example of florence nightingale these exhibitions taking place indeed more particularly in the tributary cities new york philadelphia boston we were then shut up to those but with the shining stars marked for triumphant appearance announced in advance on the newport scene and glittering there as beauties as élégantes as vocalists as heroines of european legend hadnt there broken upon us under public stress a refluent wave from paris the midempire paris of the highest pitch which was to raise our social watermark to a point unprecedented and there strikingly leave it we were learning new lessons in every branchthat was the sense of the so immensely quickened general pace and though my examples may seem rather spectral i like to believe this bigger breathing of the freshness of the future to have been what the collective rumble and shimmer of the whole business most meant it exhaled an artless confidence which yet momently increased it had no great sense of a direction but gratefully took any of which the least hint was given gathering up by the way and after the fact whatever account of itself a vague voice might strike off there were times when the account of itself as flooding lawtons valley for afternoon tea was doubtless what it would most comfortably have welcomedlawtons valley at a good drives length from the seaward quarter being the scene of villeggiatura of the boston muse as it were and the boston muse having in those after all battlehaunted seasons an authority and a finish of accent beyond any other tyrtaean strain the new york and perhaps still more the philadelphia of the time fumbled more helplessly even if aspiringly with the boston evidences in general i think than they were to be reduced to doing later on and by the happy pretext certainly that these superior signs had then a bravery they were not perhaps on their own side indefinitely to keep up  they rustled with the other leafage of the umbrageous grove in the summer airs that hung over the long teatables afternoon tea was itself but a new and romantic possibility with the lesson of it gratefully learnt at hands that dispensed with the tea and sugar and in the charmingest voice perhaps then to be heard among us a tone of talk that new york took for exotic and inimitable yet all the more felt good much better than it might if left all to itself for thus flocking in every sort of conveyance to listen to the valley was deep winding and pastoralor at least looks so now to my attached vision the infancy of a finer selfconsciousness seemed cradled there the inconsequent vehicles fraternised the dim the more dejected with the burnished and upstanding so that i may really perhaps take most for the note of the hour the first tremor of the sense on the part of fashion that if it could as it already more or less suspected get its thinking and reading and writing almost everything in fact but its arithmetic a bit dingily but just by that sign cleverly done for it so occasion seemed easy after all for a nearer view without responsibility of the odd performers of the service when these last were not literally all bostonians they were new yorkers who might have been mistaken for suchnever indeed by bostonians themselves but only by other new yorkers the rich and guileless so the effect as of a vague tribute to culture the most authentic if i speak not too portentously was left over for the aftertaste of simple and subtle alike those were comparatively thin seasons i recognise in the so ample career of mrs howe mistress of the valley and wife of the eminent the militant philhellene dr s g of the honoured name who reached back to the byronic time and had dedicated his own later to still more distinguished liberating work on behalf of deaf mutes for if she was thus the most attuned of interlocutors most urbane of disputants most insidious of wits even before her gathered fame as julia ward and the established fortune of her elegant battlehymn she was perhaps to have served the state scarce better through final organised activities and shining optimisms and great lucky lyric hits than by having in her vale of heterogeneous hospitality undermined the blank assurance of her thicker contingentafter all too but to an amusing vague unrestand thereby scattered the first rare seed of new assimilations i am moved to add that by the old terminology the avenue might have been figured in the connection as descending into the glen to meet the pointwhich save for a very small number of the rarest representatives of the latter it could meet nowhere else the difficulty was that of an encounter of birds and fishes the two tribes were native to elements as opposed as air and water the avenue essentially nothing if not exalted on wheels or otherwise expertly mounted and the point hopelessly pedestrian and unequipped with stables so that the very levels at which they materially moved were but upper and lower dreadfully lower parallels and indeed the way to see the pointwhich without playing on the word naturally became our highest lawwas at the point where it appeared to much higher advantage than in its trudge through the purple haze or golden dust of supercilious parades of the advantage to which it did so appear off in its own more languorous climate and on its own ground we fairly cultivated a conviction rejoicing by that aid very much as in certain old french towns it was possible to distinguish invidiously the ville from the cité the point was our cité the primal aboriginal newportwhich striking us on a first acquaintance as not other than dilapidated might well have been restored quite as m violletleduc was even then restoring carcassonne and this all the more because our elder newport the only seat of history had a dismantled grassy fort or archaic citadel that dozed over the waterside and that might though i do take the vision at close quarters for horrible be smartly waked up the waterside which was that of the inner bay the ample reach toward providence so much more susceptible of quality than the extravagant open sea the old houses the old elms the old quaker faces at the smallpaned old windows the appointedness of the scene for the literary and artistic people who by our fond constructive theory lodged and boarded with the quakers always thrifty these for the sake of all the sweetness and quaintness for the sake above all somehow of our hungry felicity of view by which i mean mine and that of a trusty friend or two t s perry in especialthose attributes meeting a want as the phrase is of the decent imagination made us perhaps overdramatise the sphere of the clever people but made them at least also when they unmistakably hovered affect us as truly the finest touches in the picture for they were in their way ironic about the rest and that was a tremendous lift in face of an avenue that not only as one could see at a glance had no irony but hadnt yet risen the magazines and the point aiding to so much as a suspicion of the effect familiar to later generations with which the word can conversationally come in oh the old clever people with their difference of shade from that of the clever old onessome few of these to have been discerned no doubt as of avenue position i read back into their various presences i know not what queer little functional value the exercise and privilege of which uncontested uncontrasted save with the absence of everything but stables represents a felicity for the individual that is lost to our age it could count as functional then it could count as felicitous to have been reabsorbed into boston or to propose to absorb even for the first time new york under cover of the mantle the old artistic draped cloak that had almost in each case trailed round in florence in rome in venice in conversations with landor in pencilled commemoration a little niggling possibly but withal so sincere of the haunts of dante in a general claim of having known the brownings ah the brownings of those days in a disposition to arrange readings of these and the most oddly associated other poets about the great bleak parlours of the hotels i despair however of any really right register of the art with which the cité ingratiated itself with me in this character of a vivid missionary bohemia i met it of course more than half way as i met everything in the faintest degree ingratiating even suggesting to it with an art of my own that it should become sothough in this matter i rather missed i fear a happy conversion as if the authenticity were there but my sort of personal dash too absent  i appear to myself none the less to have had dash for approaches to a confidence more largely seated since i recall how having commenced critic under charles nortons weighty protection i was to find myself on all but the very morrow invited to the high glory as i felt it of aiding to launch though on the obscurer side of the enterprise a weekly journal which putting forth its first leaves in the summer of 65 and under the highest auspices was soon to enjoy a fortune and achieve an authority and a dignity of which neither newspaper nor critical review among us had hitherto so much as hinted the possibility the new york nation had from the first to the enlivening of several persons consciously and ruefully astray in our desert made no secret of a literary leaning and indeed its few foremost months shine most for me in the light of their bestowal of one of the longest and happiest friendships of my life a relation with edwin lawrence godkin the nation incarnate as he was to become which bore fruit of affection for years after it had ceased to involve the comparatively poorer exercise godkins paper godkins occasional presence and interesting history and vivid ability and above all admirably aggressive and ironic editorial humour of a quality and authority new in the air of a journalism that had meant for the most part the heavy hand alone these things with the sudden sweet discovery that i might for my own part acceptedly stammer a style are so many shades and shifting tints in the positive historic iridescence that flings itself for my memory as i have noted over the period of ashburton place wherever i dip again i pull out a plum from under the tooth of timethis at least so to my own rapt sense that had i more space i might pull both freely and at a venture the strongest savour of the feastwith the fumes of a feast it comes backwas i need scarce once more insist the very taste of the war as ending and ended through which blessing more and more the quantity of military life or at least the images of military experience seemed all about us quite paradoxically to grow greater this i take to have been a result first of the impending and then of the effective breakup of the vast veteran army swamping much of the scene as with the flow of a monster tide and bringing literally home to us in bronzed matured faces and even more in bronzed matured characters above all in the absolutely acquired and stored resource of overwhelming reference reference usually of most substance the less it was immediately explicit the more in fact it was faded and jaded to indifference what was meant by having patiently served the very smell of having so served was somehow at least to my supersensitive nostril in the larger and cooler air where it might have been an emanation the most masculine the most communicative as to associated faroff things according to the nature ever of elements vaguely exhaled from the operation of the general huge gesture of relieffrom worn toggery put off from old armycloth and other fittings at a discount from swordbelts and buckles from a myriad saturated articles now not even lying about but brushed away with an effect upon the passing breeze and all relegated to the dim state of some mere theoretic commemorative panoply that was never in the event to be objectively disposed the generalisation grew richly or as it were quite adorably familiar that life was ever so handsomely reinforced and manners not to say manner at large refreshed and personal aspects and types accented and categories multiplied no category for the dreaming painter of things could our scene afford not to grab at on the chance just by the fact of the discharge upon society of such an amount of outoftheway experience as it might roughly be termedsuch a quantity and variety of possession and assimilation of unprecedented history it had been unprecedented at least among ourselves we had had it in our own highly original conditionsor they to be more exact had had it admirably in theirs and i think i was never to know a case in which his having been directly touched by it or in a word having consistently soldiered learnt all about it and exhausted it wasnt to count all the while on behalf of the happy man for ones own individual impression or attention call it again as everything came back to that ones own need to interpret the discharge upon society is moreover what i especially mean it being the sense of how society in our image of the word was taking it all in that i was most concerned with plenty of other images figured of course for other entertainers of such the world immediately roundabout us at any rate bristled with more of the young or the younger cases i speak of cases of things seen and felt and a delectable difference in the man thereby made imputable than i could begin here to name even had i kept the record i think i fairly cultivated the perceiving of it all so that nothing of it under some face or other shouldnt brush my sense and add to my impression yet my point is more particularly that the body social itself was for the time so permeated in the light i glance at that it became to its own consciousness more interesting as so many existent parts of it however unstoried yet to their minor credit various thrilled persons could inhale the interest to their fullest capacity and feel that they too had been pushed forwardand were even to find themselves by so much the more pushable yet  i resort thus to the lift and the push as the most expressive figures for that immensely remonté state which coincided for us all with the great disconcerting irony of the hour the unforgettable death of lincoln i think of the springtime of 65 as it breathed through boston streetsmy remembrance of all those days is a matter strangely enough of the outofdoor vision of ones constantly dropping down from beacon hill to the brave edge of which we clung for appreciation of those premonitory gusts of april that one felt most perhaps where park street church stood dominant where the mouth of the common itself uttered promises more signs and portents than one could count more prodigies than one could keep apart and where further strange matters seemed to charge up out of the lower districts and of the business world generative as never before of news the streets were restless the meeting of the seasons couldnt but be inordinately so and ones own poor pulses matchedat the supreme pitch of that fusion for instance which condensed itself to blackness roundabout the dawn of april 15th i was fairly to go in shame of its being my birthday these would have been the hours of the streets if none others had beenwhen the huge general gasp filled them like a great earthshudder and peoples eyes met peoples eyes without the vulgarity of speech even this was all so strangely part of the lift and the swell as tragedy has but to be of a pure enough strain and a high enough connection to sow with its dark hand the seed of greater life the collective sense of what had occurred was of a sadness too noble not somehow to inspire and it was truly in the air that whatever we had as a nation produced or failed to produce we could at least gather round this perfection of a classic woe true enough as we were to see the immediate harvest of our loss was almost too ugly to be bornefor nothing more sharply comes back to me than the tune to which the esthetic sense if one glanced but from that high window which was after all one of many too recoiled in dismay from the sight of mr andrew johnson perched on the stricken scene we had given ourselves a figurehead and the figurehead sat there in its habit as it lived and we were to have it in our eyes for three or four years and to ask ourselves in horror what monstrous thing we had done i speak but of aspects those aspects which under a certain turn of them may be all but everything gathered together they become a symbol of what is behind and it was open to us to waver at shopwindows exposing the new photograph exposing that is the photograph and ask ourselves what we had been guilty of as a people when all was said to deserve the infliction of that form it was vain to say that we had deliberately invoked the common in authority and must drink the wine we had drawn no countenance no salience of aspect nor composed symbol could superficially have referred itself less than lincolns mouldsmashing mask to any mere matterofcourse type of propriety but his admirable unrelated head had itself revealed a typeas if by the very fact that what made in it for roughness of kind looked out only less than what made in it for splendid final stamp in other words for commanding style the result thus determined had been precious for representation and above all for fine suggestional function in a degree that left behind every medal we had ever played at striking whereas before the image now substituted representation veiled her head in silence and the element of the suggested was exactly the direst what however on the further view was to be more refreshing than to find that there were excesses of native habit which truly we couldnt bear so that it was for the next two or three years fairly sustaining to consider that let the reasons publicly given for the impeachment of the official in question be any that would serve the grand inward logic or mystic law had been that we really couldnt go on offering each other before the nations the consciousness of such a presence that was at any rate the style of reflection to which the humiliating case reduced me just this withal now especially working i feel into that image of our generally quickened activity of spirit our having by the turn of events more ideas to apply and even to play with that i have tried to throw off everything i recover i again risk repeating fits into the vast miscellanythe detail of which i may well seem however too poorly to have handled  let it serve then for a scrap of detail that the appearance of williams further fortune enjoyed thereabouts a grasp of my attention scarce menaced even by the call on that faculty of such appearances of my own as i had naturally in some degree also to take for graces of the banquet i associate the sense of his being in a great cause far away on the billow with that clearance of the air through the tremendous draught from sea to sea of the northern triumph which seemed to make a goodnatured infinitude of room for all the individual interests and personal lives that might help the pot to bubbleif the expression be not too mean for the size of our confidence that the cause on which the agassiz expedition to south america embarked was of the greatest being happily a presumption altogether within my scope it reawoke the mild divinatory rage with which i had followed with so little to show for it the military fortune of my younger brothersfeeding the gentle passion indeed it must be added thanks to the letterwriting grace of which the case had now the benefit with report and picture of a vividness greater than any ever to be shed from a like source upon our waiting circle everything of the kind for me was company but i dwelt for that matter and as i put it all together in company so constant and so enchanting that this amounted to moving in whatever direction with the massmore and more aware as i was of the fun to express it grossly of living by my imagination and thereby finding that company in countless different forms could only swarm about me seeing further into the figurable world made company of persons and places objects and subjects alike it gave them all without exception chances to be somehow or other interesting and the imaginative ply of finding interest once taken i think i had by that time got much beyond looking for it the whole conspiracy of aspects danced round me in a ring it formed by my present vision of it a shining escort to ones possibly often hampered or mystified but never long stayed and absolutely never wasted steps it hung about after the fashion of winter evening adumbrations just outside the reach of the lamplight while one sat writing reading listening watchingperhaps even again incurably but dawdling and gaping and most of all doubtless if it supplied with colour people and things often by themselves i dare say neutral enough how it painted thick how it fairly smothered any surface that did it the turn of showing positive and intrinsic life ah the things and the people the hours and scenes and circumstances the inénarrables occasions and relations that i might still present in its light if i would and with the enormous advantage now for this i should unblushingly claim of being able to mark for present irony or pity or wonder or just for a better intelligence or again for the high humour or extreme strangeness of the thing the rare indebtedness calculated by the long run in which it could leave particular cases this necessity i was under that everything should be interestingfor fear of the collapse otherwise of ones sustaining intentionwould have confessed doubtless to a closest connection of all the connections with the small inkpot in which i seemed at last definitely destined to dip to the exclusion of any stream more pactolean a modest manner of saying that difficulty and slowness of composition were clearly by this time not in the least appointed to blight me however inveterate they were likely to prove that production such as it was floundered on in spite of them and that to put it frankly if i enjoyed as much company as i have said no small part of it was of my very own earning the freshness of first creationssince we are exalted in art to these arrogant expressionsnever fails i take it to beguile the creator in default of any other victim even to the last extravagance so that what happened was that one found all the swarm of ones intentions ones projected images quite good enough to mix with the rest of ones society setting up with it terms of interpenetration an admirable commerce of borrowing and lending taking and giving not to say stealing and keeping did it verily all this freshness of felt contact of curiosity and wonder come back perhaps to certain small and relatively ridiculous achievements of production as aforesaidridiculous causes i mean of such prodigious effects i am divided between the shame on the one hand of claiming for them these concocted short stories that they played so great a part and a downright admiring tenderness on the other for their holding up their stiff little heads in such a bustle of life and traffic of affairs i of course really and truly cared for them as we say more than for aught else whatevercared for them with that kind of care infatuated though it may seem that makes it bliss for the fond votary never to so much as speak of the loved object makes it a refinement of piety to perform his rites under cover of a perfect freedom of mind as to everything but them these secrets of the imaginative life were in fact more various than i may dream of trying to tell they referred to actual concretions of existence as well as to the supposititious the joy of life indeed drawbacks and all was just in the constant quick flit of association to and fro and through a hundred open doors between the two great chambers if it be not absurd or even base to separate them of direct and indirect experience if it is of the great comprehensive fusion that i speak as the richest note of all those hours what could truly have been more in the sense of it than exactly such a perfect muddle of pleasure for instance as my having and as i seem to remember at his positive invitation addressed the most presuming as yet of my fictional bids to my distinguished friend of a virtual lifetime as he was to become william dean howells whom i rejoice to name here and who had shortly before returned from a considerable term of exile in venice and was in the act of taking all but complete charge of the boston atlantic the confusion was to be plain of more things than can hope to go into my picture with any effect of keeping distinct therethe felt felicity literally in my performance the felt ecstasy the still greater in my receipt of howellss message and then naturally most of all the at once to be recorded blest violence in the break upon my consciousness of his glittering response after perusal  there was still more in it all than that howeverwhich is the point of my mild demonstration i associate the passage to press closer with a long summer from may to november spent at the then rural retreat of swampscott forty minutes by train northward from boston and that scene of fermentation in its turn i invest with unspeakable memories it was the summer of 66 and of the campaign of sadowa across the seawe had by that time got sufficiently away from our own campaigns to take some notice of those of other combatants on which we bestowed in fact i think the highest competence of attention then anywhere at play a sympathetic sense that bore us even over to the francogerman war four years later and helped us to know what we meant when we felt strongly about it no strength of feeling indeed of which the vibration had remained to us from the other time could have been greater than our woestricken vision of the plight of france under the portent of sedan i had been back to that country and some of its neighbourhoods for some fifteen months during the previous interval and i recover again no share in a great collective pang more vividly than our particular appalled state that of a whole company of us while we gaped out at the cry of reiterated bulletins from the shade of an august verandah and then again from amid boskages of more immediate consolation during the saratoga and the newport seasons of 1870 i had happened to repair to saratoga of all inconsequent places on my return from the paris and the london of the weeks immediately preceding the war and though it was not there that the worst sound of the first crash reached us i feel around me still all the air of our dismaywhich was in the queerest way in the world that of something so alien mixed to the increase of horror with something so cherished the great hot glare of vulgarity of the aligned hotels of the place and period drenching with its crude light the apparent collapse of everything we had supposed most massive which forward stretch on the part of this chronicle represents i recognise the practice of the discursive wellnigh overmastering its principleor would do so rather werent it that the fitful and the flickering the extravagant advance and the corrective retreat from it the law and the lovely art of foreshortening have had here throughout most to serve me it is under countenance of that law that i still grasp my capricious clue making a jump for the moment over two or three years and brushing aside by the way quite numberless appeals claims upon tenderness of memory not less than pleas for charm of interest against which i must steel myself even though i account this rank disloyalty to each there is no quarter to which i have inclined in my brief recovery of the high tide of impression flooding the period of ashburton place that might not have drawn me on and on so that i confess i feel myself here drag my mantle right and left from the clutch of suppliant handsvoluminous as it may doubtless yet appear in spite of my sense of its raggedness wrapped in tatters it is therefore that with three or four of williams letters of 67 and 68 kept before me i make my stride not only for the sake of what i still regard as their admirable interest but for the way they bring back again to me everything they figured at the time every flame of faith they rekindled every gage they held out for the future present for me are still others than these in particular which i keep over for another introducing but even the pages i here preserve overflow with connectionsso many that extravagant as it may sound i have to make an effort to breast them these are with a hundred matters of our then actual lifelittle as that virtue may perhaps show on their face but above all just with the huge small fact that the writer was by the blest description in europe and that this had verily still its way of meaning for me more than aught else beside for what sprang in especial from his situation was the proof with its positive air that a like when all was said might become again ones own that such luck wasnt going to be for evermore perversely out of the question with us and that in fine i too was already in a manner transported by the intimacy with which i partook of his having been i shouldnt have overstated it i think in saying that i really preferred such a form of experience of this particular one to the simplergiven most of our current conditions there was somehow a greater richness a larger accession of knowledge vision life whatever one might have called it in having him there as we said and in my individually getting the good of this with the peculiar degree of ease that reinforced the general quest of a special sufficiency of that boon to which i was during those years rigidly and yet on the whole by no means abjectly reduced  our parents had in the autumn of 66 settled virtually for the rest of their days at cambridge and william had concomitantly with this that is from soon after his return from brazil entered upon a season of study at the harvard medical school then keeping its terms in boston and under the wide wing ofas one supposed it or as i at any rate didthe massachusetts general hospital i have to disengage my mantle here with a force in which i invite my reader to believefor i push through a thicket of memories in which the thousandfingered branches arrestingly catch otherwise i should surrender and with a passionate sense of the logic in it to that long and crowded swampscott summer at which its graceless name has already failed to keep me from having glanced the place smothered in a dense prose of prosperity now may have been even in those days by any high measure a weak enough apology for an offered breast of nature nevertheless it ministered to me as the only american country save the silky newport fringes with which my growing imagination not to mention my specious energy had met at all continuous occasion to playso that i should have but to let myself go a little as i say to sit up to my neck again in the warm depth of its deposit out of this i should lift great handfuls of variety of vision it was to have been in its way too a season of coming and going and with its main mark i make out that it somehow absurdly flowered first and last into some intenser example of every sort of intimation up to then vouchsafed me whether by the inward or the outward life i think of it thus as a big bouquet of blooms the most mixedyet from which it is to the point just here to detach the sole reminiscence coloured to a shade i may not reproduce of a days excursion to see my brother up at the hospital had i not now been warned off too many of the prime images brought for their confusion to the final proof i should almost risk ever so briefly evoking the impression this mere snatch was to leave with me the picture as of sublime activities and prodigious possibilities of genial communities of consideration and acquisition all in a great bright porticoed and gardened setting that was to hang itself in my crazy cabinet for as long as the light of the hour might allow i put my hand on the piece stillin its now so deeply obscured corner though the true point of my reference would seem to be in the fact that if william studied medicine long enough to qualify and to take his degree so as to have become as roundedly scientific as possible he was yet immediately afterwards by one of those quick shifts of the scene with which we were familiar beginning philosophic study in germany and again writing home letters of an interest that could be but reemphasised by our having him planted out as a reflector of impressions where impressions were both strong and as different as possible from those that more directly beat upon us i myself could do well enough with these last i may parenthesise so long as none others were in question but that complacency shrank just in proportion as we were reached by the report of difference and of the foreign note the report particularly favourablewhich was indeed what any and every report perforce appeared to me williams from anywhere had ever an authority for me that attended none others even if this be not the place for more than a word of light on the apparent disconnection of his actual course it comes back to me that the purpose of practising medicine had at no season been flagrant in him and he was in fact his hospital connection once over never to practise for a day he was on the other hand to remain grateful for his intimate experience of the laboratory and the clinic and i was as constantly to feel that the varieties of his application had been as little wasted for him as those of my vagueness had really been for me his months at dresden and his winter in berlin were of a new varietythis last even with that tinge of the old in it which came from his sharing quarters with t s perry who his four years at harvard ended and his ensuing grand tour of europe as then comprehensively carried out performed was giving the universities of berlin and paris a highly competent attention to whatever else of method may have underlain the apparently lawless strain of our sequences i should add the action of a sharp lapse of health on my brothers part which the tension of a year at the dissecting table seemed to have done much to determine as well as the fond fact that europe was again from that crisis forth to take its place for us as a standing remedy a regular mitigation of all suffered or at least of all wrong stress of which remarks but a couple of letters addressed to myself i have to recognise form here the occasion these only in that order have survived the accidents of time as i the more regret that i have in my minds eye still much of the matter of certain others notably of one from paris on his way further recounting a pair of evenings at the theatre first for the younger dumas and les idées de madame aubray with pasca and delaporte this latter of an exquisite truth to him and then for something of the palais royal with four comedians as he emphatically noted who were each wonderful to say de la force of warren of the boston museum he spent the summer of 67 partly in dresden and partly at badteplitz in bohemia where he had been recommended the waters he was to return for these again after a few months and was also to seek treatment by hydropathy at the establishment of divonne in the french backcountry of lake leman where a drawing sent home in a letter and which i do my best to reproduce very comically represents him as surrounded by the listening fair i remember supposing even his dresden of the empty weeks to bristle with precious images and every form of local characterthis a little perhaps because of his treating us first of all to a pair of whimsical crayoned views of certain animated housetops seen from his window it is the old names in the old letters however that now always most rewrite themselves to my eyes in colourshades alas that defy plain notation and if the two with which the following begins and especially the first of them only asked me to tell their story i but turn my back on the whole company of which they are part       i got last week an excellent letter from frank washburn who      writes in such a manly way but the greatest delight ive had was      the loan of 5 weekly transcripts from dick derby its strange how      quickly one grows away from ones old surroundings i never should      have believed that in so few months the tone of a boston paper      would seem so outlandish to me as it was i was in one squeal of      amusement surprise and satisfaction until deep in the night when      i went to bed tired out with patriotism the boisterous animal      goodhumour familiarity reckless energy and selfconfidence      unprincipled optimism esthetic saplessness and intellectual      imbecility made a mixture hard to characterise but totally      different from the tone of things here and as the germans would      say whose existenz so völlig dasteht that there was nothing to      do but to let yourself feel it the americans themselves here too      amuse me much they have such a hungry restless look and seem so      unhooked somehow from the general framework the other afternoon as      i was sitting on the terrace a gentleman and two young ladies came      and sat down quite near me i knew them for americans at a glance      and the man interested me by his exceedingly american expression a      reddish moustache and tuft on chin a powerful nose a small light      eye half insolent and all sagacious and a sort of rowdy air of      superiority that made me proud to claim him as a brother in a few      minutes i recognised him as general mclellan rather different      from his photographs of the wartime but still not to be mistaken      and i afterwards learned he is here whatever his faults may be      that of not being one of us is not among them  this next is the note of a slightly earlier impression       the germans are certainly a most gemüthlich people the way all the      old women told me how freundlich their rooms wereso freundlich      mobilirt and so forthmelted my heart whenever you tell an      inferior here to do anything eg a cabman he or she replies      schön or rather schehn with an accent not quick like a      frenchmans bien but so protracted soothing and reassuring to      you that you feel as if he were adopting you into his family you      say ive said nothing of the people of this house but there is      nothing to tell about them the doctor is an openhearted excellent      man as ever was and wrapped up in his children frau semler is a      sickly miserly pettyspirited nonentity the children are quite      uninteresting though the younger anna or aennchen aged five is      very handsome and fat the following short colloquy which i      overheard one day after breakfast a few days since may serve you      as a piece of local colour aennchen drops a book she is carrying      across the room and exclaims herr jesus       mother ach das sagen kinder nicht anna       aennchen reflectively to herself sotto voce nicht fur kinder        what here follows from divonneof fourteen months lateris too full and too various to need contribution or comment       you must have envied within the last few weeks my revisiting of the      sacred scenes of our youth the shores of leman the ecu de genève      the sloping corraterie etc my only pang in it all has been caused      by your absence or rather by the fact of my presence instead of      yours for i think your abstemious and poetic soul would have got      much more good of the things ive seen than my hardening and      definitegrowing nature i wrote a few words about nürnberg to      alice from montreux i found that about as pleasant an impression      as any i have had since being abroadand this because i didnt      expect it the americans at dresden had told me it was quite      uninteresting i enclose you a few stereographs i got therei      dont know why for they are totally irrelevant to the real effect      of the place this it would take théophile gautier to describe so      i renounce it was strange to find how little i remembered at      genevai couldnt find the way i used to take up to the academy      and the shops and houses of the rue du rhône visible from our old      windows left me uncertain whether they were the same or new ones      kohler has set up a new hotel on the quai du montblancyou      remember hes the brother of our old madame buscarlet there but i      went for associations sake to the Écu the diningroom was      differently hung and the only thing in my whole 24 hours in the      place that stung me so to speak with memory was that kind of      chinesepatterned dessertservice we used to have so runs the      world away i didnt try to look up ritter chantre or any of ces      messieurs but started off here the next morning where i have now      been a week       illustration the cold water cure at divonneexcellent for      melancholiafrom a letter of william james page 447       my impression on gradually coming from a german into a french      atmosphere of things was rather unexpected and not in all respects      happy i have been in germany half amused and half impatient with      the slowness of proceeding and the uncouthness of taste and      expression that prevail there so largely in all things but on      exchanging it for the brightness and shipshapeness of these      quasifrench arrangements of life and for the tart      firecrackerlike speech of those who make them i found myself      inclined to retreat again on what i had left and had for a few      days quite a homesickness for the easy ugly substantial german      ways the tarnal smartness in which the railway refreshment      counters for example are dressed up the tight waists and      tasteful white caps of the female servants the everlasting      monsieur and madame and especially the quickness and snappishness      of enunciation suggesting such an inward impatience quite      absurdly gave on my nerves but i am getting used to it all and      the french people who sit near me here at table and who repelled me      at first by the apparently coldblooded artificiality of their      address to each other now seem less heartless and inhuman i am      struck more than ever i was with the hopelessness of us english      and a fortiori the germans ever competing with the french in      matters of form or finite taste of any sort they are sensitive to      things that simply dont exist for us i notice it here in manners      and speech how can a people who speak with no tonic accents in      their words help being cleaner and neater in expressing      themselves on the other hand the limitations of reach in the      french mind strike me more and more their delight in rallying      round an official standard in all matters in counting and dating      everything from certain great names their use and love of      catchwords and current phrases their sacrifice of independence of      mind for the mere sake of meeting their hearer or reader on common      ground their metaphysical incapacity not only to deal with      questions but to know what the questions are stand out plainer and      plainer the more headway i make in german one wonders where the      versöhnung or conciliation of all these rival national qualities      is going to take place i imagine we english stand rather between      the french and the germans both in taste and in spiritual      intuition in germany while unable to avoid respecting that      solidity of the national mind which causes such a mass of permanent      work to be produced there annually i couldnt help consoling      myself by the thought that whatever after all they might do      the germans were a plebeian crowd and could never be such      gentlemen as we were i now find myself getting over the french      superiority by an exactly inverse process of thought the frenchman      must sneer at us even more than we sneer at the germansand which      sneer is final his at us two or ours at him or the germans at      us it seems an insoluble question which i fortunately havent got      to settle       ive read several novels lately some of the irrepressible      georges la daniella and the beaux messieurs de boisdoré was it      thee by the bye that wrotest the nation notices on her on w      morriss new poem and on the spanish gypsy they came to me      unmarked but the thoughts seemed such as you would entertain and      the style in some places like yoursin others not george sand      babbles her improvisations on so that i never begin to believe a      word of what she says ive also read the woman in white a couple      of balzacs etc and a volume of tales by mérimée which i will      send you if i can by frank washburn he is a big man but the      things which have given me most pleasure have been some sketches of      travel by th gautier what an absolute thing genius is that this      creature with no more soul than a healthy poodledog no      philosophy no morality no information for i doubt exceedingly if      his knowledge of architectural terms and suchlike is accurate      should give one a finer enjoyment than his betters in all these      respects by mere force of goodnature clear eyesight and felicity      of phrase his style seems to me perfect and i should think it      would pay you to study it with loveprincipally in the most      trivial of these collections of notes of travel t s p has a      couple of them for you and another which ive read here and is      called caprices et zigzags is worth buying it contains wonderful      french in the classic sense i mean with all those associations      descriptions of london im not sure if you know gautier at all      save by the delicious capitaine fracasse but these republished      feuilletons are all of as charming a quality and i should think      would last as long as the language       there are 70 or 80 people in this etablissement no one of whom i      have as yet particularly cottoned up to its incredible how even      so slight a barrier as the difference of language with most of      them and still more as the absence of local and personal      associations range of gibes and other common ground to stand on      counts against ones scraping acquaintance its disgusting and      humiliating there is a lovely maiden of etwa 19 sits in sight of      me at the table with whom i am falling deeply in love she has      never looked at me yet and i really believe i should be quite      incapable of conversing with her even were i introduced from a      sense of the above difficulties and because one doesnt know what      subjects or allusions may be possible with a jeune fille i suppose      my life for the past year would have furnished you as the great      american nouvelliste a good many motives and subjects of      observationespecially so in this place i wish i could pass them      over to yousuch as they are youd profit by them more than i and      gather in a great many more i should like full well an hours or      even longer interview with you and with the parents and the      sister and the aunt and all just so as to start afresh on a clean      basis give my love to wendell holmes ive seen   several      times but what a coldblooded cuss he is write me your impression      of t s p who will probably reach you before this letter if      frank washburn ever gets home be friendly to him he is much aged      by travel and experience and is a most charming character and      generous mind     xiii   if i add to the foregoing a few lines more from my brothers hand these are of a day separated by long years from that time of our youth of which i have treated addressed after the immense interval to an admirable friend whom i shall not name here they yet so vividly referand with something i can only feel as the first authorityto one of the most prized interests of our youth that under the need of still failing to rescue so many of these values from the dark gulf i find myself insist the more on a place here before i close for that presence in our early lives as to which my brothers few words say so much to have so promptly and earnestly spoken of mary temple the younger in this volume is indeed i think to have offered a gage for my not simply leaving her there the opportunity not so to leave her comes at any rate very preciously into my hands and i can not better round off this record than by making the most of it the letter to which william alludes is one that my reader will presently recognise it had come back to him thus clearly at the far end of time       i am deeply thankful to you for sending me this letter which      revives all sorts of poignant memories and makes her live again in      all her lightness and freedom few spirits have been more free than      hers i find myself wishing so that she could know me as i am now      as for knowing her as she is now i find that she means as      much in the way of human character for me now as she ever did      being unique and with no analogue in all my subsequent experience      of people thank you once more for what you have done  the testimony so acknowledged was a letter in a copious succession the product of little more than one year january 69 to february 70 sacredly preserved by the recipient who was not long after the day of my brothers acknowledgment to do me the honour of communicating to me the whole series he could have done nothing to accord more with the spirit in which i have tried to gather up something of the sense of our faroff past his own as well as that of the rest of us and no loose clue that i have been able to recover unaided touches into life anything like such a tract of the timesmothered consciousness more charming and interesting things emerge for me than i can point to in their orderbut they will make i think their own appeal it need only further be premised that our delightful young cousin had had from some months back to begin to reckon with the progressive pulmonary weakness of which the letters tell the sad story also i can scarce help saying the whole world of the old new york that of the earlier dancing years shimmers out for me from the least of her allusions       i will write you as nice a letter as i can but would much rather      have a good talk with you as i cant have the best thing i am      putting up with the secondbest contrary to my pet theory i feel      as if i were in heaven todayall because the day is splendid and      i have been driving about all the morning in a small sleigh in the      fresh air and sunshine until i found that i had in spite of      myself for the time being stopped asking the usual inward      question of why i was born i am not going to canadai know no      better reason for this than because i said i was going my      brotherinlaw makes such a clamour when i propose departure that i      am easily overcome by his kindness and my own want of energy      besides it is great fun to live here the weather just now is      grand and i knock about all day in a sleigh and do nothing but      enjoy it and meditate then we are so near town that we often go in      for the day to shop and lunch with some of our numerous friends      returning with a double relish for the country we all went in on a      spree the other night and stayed at the everett house from which      as a startingpoint we poured ourselves in strong force upon mrs      gracie kings balla very grand affair given for a very pretty      miss king at delmonicos our raid consisted of thirteen emmets      and a moderate supply of temples and the ball was a great success      it was two years since i had been to one and i enjoyed it so much      that i mean very soon to repeat the experimentat the next      assembly if possible the men in society in new york this winter      are principally a lot of feebleminded boys but i was fortunate      enough to escape them as my partner for the german was a man of      thirtyfive the solitary man i believe in the room curiously      enough i had danced my last german two years before in that very      place and with the same person he is a mr lee who has spent      nearly all his life abroad two of his sisters have married german      princes and from knocking about so much he has become a thorough      cosmopolite as he is intelligent with nothing to do but amuse      himself he is a very agreeable partner and i mean to dance with      him again as soon as possible i dont know why i have tried your      patience by writing so about a person you have never seen unless      its to show you that i havent irrevocably given up the world the      flesh and the devil but am conscious of a faint charm about them      still when taken in small doses i agree with you perfectly about      uncle henryi should think he would be very irritating to the      legal mind he is not at all satisfactory even to mine have you      seen much of willy james lately that is a rare creature and one      in whom my intellect if you will pardon the misapplication of the      word takes more solid satisfaction than in almost anybody i      havent read brownings new booki mean to wait till you are by to      explain it to mewhich reminds me along with what you say about      wishing for the spring that we shall go to north conway next      summer and that in that case you may as well make up your mind to      come and see us there i cant wait longer than that for the      browning readings which would have been of the ring and the      book arthur sedgwick has sent me matthew arnolds photograph      which harry had pronounced so disappointing i dont myself on the      whole find it so on the contrary after having looked at it much      i like itit quite harmonises with my notion of him and i have      always had an affection for him you must tell me something that      you are sure is truei dont care much what it may be i will      take your word for it things get into a muddle with mehow can i      give you a start on the way of righteousness you know that way      better than i do and the only advice i can give you is not to stop      saying your prayers i hope god may bless you and beyond those      things i hardly know what is right and therefore what to wish you      goodbye  north conway in the foregoing has almost the force for me of a wizards wand the figures spring up again and move in a harmony that is not of the fierce present the sense in particular of the august of 65 shuts me in to its blest unawarenesses not less than to all that was then exquisite in its current certainties and felicities the fraternising endlessly conversing group of us gather under the rustling pinesand i admire precisely the arrival the bright revelation as i recover it of the so handsome young man marked with military distinction but already with our light american promptitude addressed to that high art of peace in which a greater eminence awaited him of whom this most attaching member of the circle was to make four years later so wise and steady a confidant our circle i fondly call it and doubtless then called it because in the light of that description i could most rejoice in it and i think of it now as having formed a little world of easy and happy interchange of unrestricted and yet all so instinctively sane and secure association and conversation with all its liberties and delicacies all its mirth and its earnestness protected and directed so much more from within than from without that i ask myself perhaps too fatuously whether any such right conditions for the play of young intelligence and young friendship the reading of matthew arnold and browning the discussion of a hundred human and personal things the sense of the splendid american summer drawn out to its last generosity survives to this more complicated age i doubt if there be circles today and seem rather to distinguish confusedly gangs and crowds and camps more propitious i dare say to material affluence and physical riot than anything we knew but not nearly so appointed for ingenious and ingenuous talk i think of our interplay of relation as attuned to that fruitful freedom of what we took for speculation what we didnt recoil from as boundless curiosityas the consideration of life that is the personal the moral inquiry and adventure at large so far as matter for them had up to then met our viewi think of this fine quality in our scene with no small confidence in its having been rare or to be more exact perhaps in its having been possible to the general american felicity and immunity as it couldnt otherwise or elsewhere have begun to be merely to say as an assurance that such relations shone with the light of innocence is of itself to breathe on them wrongly or rudely is uncouthly to defend themas if the very air that consciously conceived and produced them didnt all tenderly and amusedly take care of them i at any rate figure again to my customary positive piety all the aspects now that in especial of my young orphaned cousins as mainly composing the maiden train and seeming as if they still had but yesterday brushed the morning dew of the dear old albany naturalness that of the venerable genial erect greataunt their more immediately active guardian a model of antique spinsterhood appointed to cares such as even renewals of wedlock could scarce more have multiplied for her and thus among her many ancient and curious national referencesone was tempted to call themmost impressive by her striking resemblance to the portraits the most benignant of general washington she might have represented the mother no less adequately than he represented the father of their country i can only feel however that what particularly drew the desired circle sharpest for me was the contribution to it that i had been able to effect by introducing the companion of my own pilgrimage who was in turn to introduce a little later the great friend of his then expanding situation restored with the close of the war to civil pursuits and already deep in them the interesting pair possessed after this fashion of a quantity of common fine experience that glittered as so much acquired and enjoyed luxuryall of a sort that i had no acquisition whatever to match i remember being happy in that i might repeatedly point our moral under permission for we were always pointing morals with this brilliant advantage of theirs even if i might with none of my own and i of course knewwhat was half the beautythat if we were just the most delightful loose band conceivable and immersed in a regular revel of all the harmonies it was largely by grace of the three quite exceptional young men who thanks in part to the final sublime coachdrive of other days had travelled up from boston with their preparation to admire inevitably quickened i was quite willing to offer myself as exceptional through being able to promote such exceptions and see them justified to waiting apprehension there was a dangling fringe there were graceful accessories and hovering shades but essentially we of the true connection made up the drama or in other words for the benefit of my imagination reduced the fond figment of the circle to terms of daily experience if drama we could indeed feel this as being i hasten to add we owed it most of all to our just having such a heroine that everything else inevitably came mary temple was beautifully and indescribably thatin the technical or logical as distinguished from the pompous or romantic sense of the word wholly without effort or desire on her partfor never was a girl less consciously or consentingly or vulgarly dominanteverything that took place around her took place as if primarily in relation to her and in her interest that is in the interest of drawing her out and displaying her the more this too without her in the least caring as i sayin the deep the morally nostalgic indifferences that were the most finally characteristic thing about herwhether such an effect took place or not she liked nothing in the world so much as to see others fairly exhibited not as they might best please her by being but as they might most fully reveal themselves their stuff and their truth which was the only thing that after any first flutter for the superficial air or grace in an acquaintance could in the least fix her attention she had beyond any equally young creature i have known a sense for verity of character and play of life in others for their acting out of their force or their weakness whatever either might be at no matter what cost to herself and it was this instinct that made her care so for life in general just as it was her being thereby so engaged in that tangle that made her as i have expressed it ever the heroine of the scene life claimed her and used her and beset hermade her range in her groping her naturally immature and unlighted way from end to end of the scale no one felt more the charm of the actualonly the actual comprised for her kinds of reality those to which her letters perhaps most of all testify that she saw treated round her for the most part either as irrelevant or as unpleasant she was absolutely afraid of nothing she might come to by living with enough sincerity and enough wonder and i think it is because one was to see her launched on that adventure in such bedimmed such almost tragically compromised conditions that one is caught by her title to the heroic and pathetic mark it is always difficult for us after the fact not to see young things who were soon to be lost to us as already distinguished by their fate this particular victim of it at all events might well have made the near witness ask within himself how her restlessness of spirit the finest reckless impatience was to be assuaged or met by the common lot one somehow saw it nowhere about us as up to her terrible young standard of the interestingeven if to say this suggests an air of tension a sharpness of importunity than which nothing could have been less like her the charming irresistible fact was that one had never seen a creature with such lightness of forms a lightness all her own so inconsequently grave at the core or an asker of endless questions with such apparent lapses of care it is true that as an effect of the state of health which during the year 69 grew steadily worse the anxious note and serious mind sound in her less intermittently than by her former wont       this might be headed with that line of a hymn hark from the      tombs etcbut perhaps it wont prove as bad as that it looks      pretty doubtful still but i have a sort of feeling that i shall      come round this one time more by which i dont mean to brag the      it of which i speak is of course my old enemy hemorrhage of      which i have had within the last week seven pretty big ones and      several smaller hardly worth mentioning i dont know what has      come over mei cant stop them but as i said i mean to try and      beat them yet of course i am in bed where i shall be      indefinitelynot allowed to speak one word literally even in a      whisper the reason i write this is because i dont think it will      hurt me at allif i take it easy and stop when i feel tired it is      a pleasant break in the monotony of gruel and of thinking of the      graveand then too a few words from somebody who is strong and      active in the good old world as it seems to me now would be very      refreshing but dont tell anyone i have written because it will      be sure to reach the ears of my dear relatives and will cause them      to sniff the air and flounce you see i am a good deal of a      babyin the sense of not wanting the reproaches of my relatives      on this or any other subject all the emmets are so good and      kind that i found when it came to the point that there was a good      deal to make life attractive and that if the choice were given me      i would much rather stay up here on the solid earth in the air and      sunshine with an occasional sympathetic glimpse of another      persons soul than to be put down underground and say goodbye for      ever to humanity with all its laughter and its sadness yet you      mustnt think me now in any special danger of dying or even in      low spirits for it isnt sothe doctor tells me i am not in      danger even if the hemorrhages should keep on however you cant      fool a regular boarder as mr holmes would say and i cant see      why there is any reason to think they will heal a week hence when      i shall be still weaker if they cant heal now still they may      be going to stopi havent had one since yesterday at 4 and now      its 3 nearly twentyfour hours i am of a hopeful temperament and      not easily scared which is in my favour if this should prove to      be the last letter you get from me why take it for a goodbye      ill keep on the lookout for you in the spirit world and shall be      glad to see you when you come there provided its a better place      than this elly is in new york enjoying herself immensely and i      havent let her know how ill i have been as there were to be      several parties this last week and i was afraid it might spoil her      fun i didnt mean you to infer from my particularising willy      jamess intellect that the rest of him isnt to my likinghe is      one of the very few people in this world that i love he has the      largest heart as well as the largest head and is thoroughly      interesting to me he is generous and affectionate and full of      sympathy and humanitythough you mustnt tell him i say so lest      he should think i have been telling you a lie to serve my own      purposes goodbye  i should have little heart i confess for what is essentially the record of a rapid illness if it were not at the same time the image of an admirable soul surrounded as she was with affection she had yet greatly to help herself and nothing is thus more penetrating than the sense as one reads that a method of care would have been followed for her today and perhaps followed with signal success that was not in the healing or nursing range of forty years ago       it is a week ago today i think since i last wrote to you and i      have only had one more hemorrhagethe day after i feel pretty      sure they have stopped for the present and i am sitting up in my      room as bright as possible yesterday when i walked across it i      thought i should never be strong again but now its quite      different and so nice to be out of bed that my spirits go up      absurdly as soon as i am able i am to be taken to town for another      examination and then when i know my fate i will do the best i can      this climate is trying to be sure but such as it is ive got to      take my chance in it as there is no one i care enough for or who      cares enough for me to take charge of me to italy or to the south      anywhere i dont believe any climate however good would be of      the least use to me with people i dont care for you may let your      moustache grow down to your toes if you like and i shall but smile      scornfully at your futile precautions  of the following in spite of its length i can bring myself to abate nothing       well to make a long story short as hannah her old nurse      says i caught a cold and it went to the weak spot and i had      another slight attack of hemorrhage but i took the necessary steps      at once stayed in bed and didnt speak for six days and then it      stopped and i felt better than i had at all since i was first taken      ill but i began to tire so of such constant confinement to my room      that they promised to take me to town as soon as i was well enough      and perhaps to the opera this of course would have been a wild      excitement for me and i had charming little plans of music by day      and by night for a week which i meant to spend with mrs      griswold accordingly a cavalcade set out from here on monday      consisting of myself escorted by sisters and friends who were to      see me safely installed in my new quarters and leave me i arrived      bundled up at mrs griswolds and had begun to consider myself      already quite emancipated from bondageso that i was discussing      with my brotherinlaw the propriety of my going that evening to      hear faust this but the beginning of a mad career on which i      proposed to rush headlongwhen dr bassett arrived who is the      medical man that i had meant to consult during my stay      incidentally and between the pauses in the music the first thing      he said was what are you doing here go directly back to the      place you came from and dont come up again till the warm weather      as for music you mustnt hear of it or even think of it for two      months this was pleasant but there was nothing to be done but      obey which i did a few hours later with my trunk still unpacked      and my immediate plan of life somewhat limited       i say my immediate plan because my permanent found itself by no      means curtailed but on the contrary expanded and varied in a      manner i had not even dared to hope this came from what dr b      said subsequently when he had examined my lungs that is to say      after he had laid his head affectionately first under one of my      shoulders and then the other and there kept it solemnly for about      ten minutes in a way that was irresistibly ludicrous especially      with kitty as spectator his verdict was that my lungs were      sound that he couldnt detect the least evidence of disease and      that hemorrhage couldnt have come from the lung itself but from      their membraneous lining and that of the throat whatever this may      be so he gave me to understand that i have as sound a pair of      lungs at present as the next person in fact from what he said one      would have thought them a pair that a prizefighter might covet at      the same time he sent me flying back to the country with orders      not to get excited nor to listen to music nor to speak with      anybody i care for nor to do anything in short that the      unregenerate nature longs for this struck my untutored mind as      somewhat inconsistent and i ventured a gentle remonstrance which      however was not even listened to and i was ignominiously thrust      into a car and borne back to pelham the problem still bothers me      either sound lungs are a very dangerous thing to have or there is      a foul conspiracy on foot to oppress me still i cling to the      consoling thought of my matchless lungs and this obliterates my      present sufferings       harry came to see me before he sailed for europe im very glad he      has gone though i dont expect to see him again for a good many      years i dont think he will come back for a long time and i hope      it will do him good and that he will enjoy himselfwhich he hasnt      done for several years i havent read all of faust but i think i      know the scenes you call divineat least i know some that are      exquisite but why do you speak so disparagingly of king david      whom i always had a weakness for think how charming and lovable a      person he must have been poet musician and so much else      combinedwith however their attendant imperfections i dont think      i should have cared to be queen david exactly i am possessed      with an overpowering admiration and affection for george eliot i      dont know why this has so suddenly come over me but everything i      look at of hers nowadays makes me take a deeper interest in her i      should love to see her and i hope harry will i asked him to give      my love to her but i dont remember ever to have heard you speak      of her goodbye i wish conventionality would invent some other      way of ending a letter than yours truly i am so tired of it and      as one says it to ones shoemaker it would be rather more      complimentary to ones friends to dispense with it altogether and      just sign ones name without anything after the manner of miss      emerson and other free boston citizens but i am a slave to      conventionality and after all am yours truly  singularly present has remained to harry as may be imagined the rapid visit he paid her at pelham that february he was spending a couple of days in new york on a quick decision before taking ship for england i was then to make in europe no such stay as she had forecasti was away but for fifteen months though i can well believe my appetite must have struck her as open to the boundless and can easily be touched again by her generous thought of this as the right compensatory thing for me that indeed is what i mainly recall of the hour i spent with herso unforgettable none the less in its general value our so beautifully agreeing that quite the same course would be the right thing for her and that it was wholly detestable i should be voyaging off without her but the precious question and the bright aspect of her own still waiting chance made our talk for the time all gaiety it was strangely enough a laughing hour altogether coloured with the vision of the next winter in rome where we should romantically meet the appearance then being of particular protective friends with roman designs under whose wing she might happily travel she had at that moment been for many weeks as ill as will here have been shown but such is the priceless good faith of youth that we perfectly kept at bay together the significance of this i recall no mortal notenothing but the bright extravagance of her envy and see her again in the oldtime pelham parlours ever so erectly slight and so more than needfully so transparently fair i fatuously took this for becoming glide as swiftly toss her head as characteristically laugh to as free a disclosure of the handsome largeish teeth that made her mouth almost the main fact of her face as if no corner of the veil of the future had been lifted the house was quiet and spacious for the day after the manner of all american houses of that age at those hours and yet spoke of such a possible muster at need of generous gregarious neighbouring sympathising emmets in spite of which withal the impression was to come back to me as of a child struggling with her ignorance in a sort of pathless desert of the genial and the casual three months before i returned to america the struggle had ended i was as happened soon to see in london her admiration and my own the great george eliota brief glimpse then but a very impressive and wellnigh my main satisfaction in which was that i should have my cousin to tell of it i found the charles nortons settled for the time in london with social contacts and penetrations a give and take of hospitality that i felt as wondrous and of some elements of which they offered me in their great kindness the benefit so that i was long to value having owed them in the springtime of 69 five separate impressions of distinguished persons then in the full flush of activity and authority that affected my young provincialism as a positive fairytale of privilege i had a sunday afternoon hour with mrs lewes at north bank no second visitor but my gentle introducer the younger miss norton sharing the revelation which had some odd and for myself peculiarly thrilling accompaniments and then the opportunity of dining with mr ruskin at denmark hill an impression of uneffaced intensity and followed by a likeand yet so unlikeevening of hospitality from william morris in the medieval miseenscène of queen square this had been preceded by a luncheon with charles darwin beautifully benignant sublimely simple at down a memory to which i find attached our incidental wondrous walkmrs charles norton the too near term of her earthly span then smoothly out of sight being my guide for the happy excursionacross a private park of great oaks which i conceive to have been the admirable holwood and where i knew my first sense of a matter afterwards through fortunate years to be more fully disclosed the springtime in such places the adored footpath the first primroses the stir and scent of renascence in the watered sunshine and under spreading boughs that were somehow before aught else the still reach of remembered lines of tennyson ached over in nostalgic years the rarest hour of all perhaps or at least the strangest strange verily to the pitch of the sinister was a vision provided by the same care of d g rossetti in the vernal dusk of queens house chelseaamong his pictures amid his poetry itself his whole haunting esthetic and yet above all bristling with his personality with his perversity with anything as it rather awfully seemed to me but his sympathy though it at the same time left one oddly desirous of more of him these impressions heaped up the measure goodness knew of what would serve for minnies curiosityshe was familiarly minnie to us the point remaining all along however that impatient at having overmuch to wait i rejoiced in possession of the exact vivid terms in which i should image george eliot to her i was much later on to renew acquaintance with that great lady but i think i scarce exceed in saying that with my so interested cousins death half the savour of my appreciation had lost itself just in those days that month of april the latter had made a weak ineffectual move to philadelphia in quest of physical reliefwhich expressed at the same time even more one of those reachings out for appeasement of the soul which were never too publicly indulged in but by which her power to interest the true subjects of her attraction was infinitely quickened it represented wonderments i might well indeed have said to myself even beyond any inspired by the high muse of north bank       i suppose i ought to have something special to say after having      been suddenly transplanted to a new place and among new people yet      there isnt much to tell i came because they all thought at home      that the climate might do me good i dont feel however any      difference in my sensations between this and new yorkif i do its      in favour of new york i wish it might turn out that an inland      climate isnt after all necessary for me as i like the other sort      much better and really think i feel stronger in it too my doctor      told me that boston would kill me in six monthsthough he is      possibly mistaken i am going to try it a little longer here and      then go back to pelham where im pretty sure i shall find myself      better again it may be that the mental atmosphere is more to me      than any other for i feel homesick here all the while or at least      what i call so being away from what is most like home to me and      what if i were there i should call tired the chief object i had in      coming was to listen to phillips brooks i have heard him several      times and am not i think disappointed to be sure he didnt say      anything new or startling but i certainly oughtnt to have      expected that though i believe i did have a secret hope that he      was going to expound to me the old beliefs with a clearness that      would convince me for ever and banish doubt i had placed all my      hopes in him as the one man i had heard of who progressive in all      other ways had yet been able to keep his faith firm in the things      that most earnest men have left far behind them yet in preaching      to his congregation he doesnt or didnt touch the real      difficulties at all he was leading them forward instead of trying      to make it clear to me that i have any good reason for my      feelings still it was something to feel that he has them too and      isnt afraid to trust them and live for them i wonder what he      really does believe or think about it all and whether he knows the      reaction that comes to me about thursday after the enthusiasm and      confidence made by his eloquence and earnestness on sunday      tomorrow will be saturday and i shall be glad when sunday comes      to wind me up again i feel sadly run down tonight and as if i      should like to see some honest old pagan and shake him by the hand      it will seem all right and easy again soon i know but is it      always thus is there no more of that undoubting faith in the      world that there used to be but i wont talk any more about it      now or i shant sleep it is getting late and all themes but the      least interesting must be put away  quaint as we now say it at this end of time seems to me that phillips brooks the great episcopal light of the period first in philadelphia and then in boston and superior character excellent even ardent thoughtful genial practical man should have appeared to play before her a light possibly of the clear strain the rich abundance the straight incidence that she so desired to think attainable a large in fact an enormous softly massive and sociably active presence of capacious attention and comforting suggestion he was a brave worker among those who didnt too passionately press their questions and claimshalf the office of such a minister being no doubt to abate the high pitch and the high pitch being by the same token too much minnies tendency she was left with it in the smug philadelphia visibly on her hands she had found there after all but a closed door to which she was blandly directed rather than an open and the sigh of her falling back with her disappointment seems still to reach ones ears she found them too much all round the stiff blank barriers that for whatever thumping didnt give and in fine i like not too faintly to colour this image of her as failing in her avid young sincerity to draw from the honest pastor of more satisfied souls any assurance that she could herself honestly apply i confess that her particular recorded case slender enough in its lonely unrest suggests to me a force or at least a play of effective criticism more vivid today than either of the several rich monuments honourably as these survive to phillips brookss positive success she had no occasion or no chance to find the delightful harmonising friend in himwhich was part of the success for so many others but her letter goes on after a couple of daysshe had apparently not sent the previous part and it brings her back we can rejoicingly note to george eliot whose poem alluded to must have been the spanish gipsy this work may indeed much less have counted for her than the allengulfing mill on the floss incomparably privileged production which shone for young persons of that contemporaneity with a nobleness that nothing under our actual star begins in like case to match these are great recognitions but how can i slight for them a mention that has again and again all but broken through in my pagesthat of francis boott and his daughter she to become later on mrs frank duveneck and to yield to the same dismal decree of death before her time that rested on so many of the friends of our youth when i turn in thought to the happiness that our kinswoman was still to have known in her short life for all her disaster elizabeth boott delightful devoted and infinitely under the charm at once hovers for me this all the more i hasten to add that we too on our side and not least mary temple herself were under the charm and that that charm if less immediately pointed affected all our young collective sensibility as a wondrous composite thing there was the charm for usif i must not again speak in assurance but for myselfthat europe the irrepressible even as the ewig weibliche of literary allusion was irrepressible had more than anything else to do with and then there was the other that strange to say strange as i once more found myself feeling it owed nothing of its authority to anything so markedly out of the picture the spell to which i in any case most piously sacrificed most cultivated the sense of was ever of this second castand for the simple reason that the other serene in its virtue fairly insolent in its pride needed no rites and no care it must be allowed that there was nothing composite in any spell proceeding whether directly or indirectly from the great albany connection this form of the agreeable through whatever appeals could certainly not have been more of a piece as we saymore of a single superfused complexion an element or principle that we could in the usual case ever so easily and pleasantly account for the case of that one in the large number of my cousins whom we have seen to be so incomparably the most interesting was of course anything but the usual yet the albany origin the woodnote wild sounded out even amid her various voices and kept her true in her way to something we could only have called local or perhaps family type essentially however she had been a free incalculable product a vivid exception to rules and precedents so far as she had at all the value of the composite it was on her own lines altogetherthe composition was of things that had lain nearest to hand it mattered enormously for such a pair as the bootts intimately associated father and daughter that what had lain nearest their hand or at least that of conspiring nature and fortune in preparing them for our consumption had been the things of old italy of the inconceivable tuscany that of the but lately expropriated grand dukes in particular and that when originally alighting among us en plein newport they had seemed fairly to reek with a saturation esthetic historic romantic that everything roundabout made precious i was to apprehend in due course and not without dismay that what they really most reeked with was the delight of finding us ourselves exactly as we were they fell so into the wondrous class of inverted romantics several other odd flowers of which i was later on to have anxiously to deal with we and our large crude scene of barbaric plenty as it might have been called beguiled them to appreciations such as made our tribute to themselves excite at moments their impatience and strike them as almost silly it was our conditions that were picturesque and i had to make the best of a time when they themselves appeared to consent to remain so but by the beautiful gaiety of their preference this i remember well i found disconcerting so that my main affectionate business with them became under amusement by the way that of keeping them true to type what above all contributed was that they really couldnt help their case try as they would to shake off the old infection they were of old world production through steps it was too late to retrace and they were in the practical way and in the course of the very next years to plead as guilty to this as the highest proper standard for them could have prescribed they went back and again and again with a charming smiling pleading inconsequenceany pretext but the real one the fact that the prime poison was in their veins serving them at need so that as the case turned all my own earlier sense on the spot of florence and rome was to mix itself with their delightfully rueful presence there i could then perfectly put up with that flame of passion for boston and newport in them which still left so perfect their adaptability to italian installations that would have been impossible save for subtle italian reasons  i speak of course but of the whole original view time brings strange revenges and contradictions and all the later history was to be a chapter by itself and of the fullest we had been all alike accessible in the first instance to the call of those references which played through their walk and conversation with an effect that their qualifying ironies and amusing reactions where such memories were concerned couldnt in the least abate for nothing in fact lent them a happier colour than just this ability to afford so carelessly to cheapen the certain treasure of their past they had enough of that treasure to give it perpetually awayin our subsequently to be more determined our present sense in short we had the fondest use for their leavings even when they themselves hadnt mary temple with her own fine quality so far from composite rejoiced in the perception however unassisted by any sort of experience of what their background had meant she would have liked to be able to know just that for herself as i have already hinted and i actually find her image most touching perhaps by its so speaking of what she with a peculiar naturalness dreamed of and missed of clear old english stock on her fathers side her sense for what was english in lifeso we used to simplifywas an intimate part of her little chance as it enjoyed for happy verifications in the bootts despite their still ampler and more recently attested share in that racial strain the foreign tradition had exceedingly damped the english which didnt however in the least prevent her being caught up by it as it had stamped itself upon the admirable the infinitely civilised and sympathetic the markedly produced lizzie this delightful girl educated cultivated accomplished toned above all as from steeping in a rich old medium to a degree of the rarest among her coevals on our side had the further the supreme grace that she melted into american opportunities of friendshipand small blame to her given such as she then metwith the glee of a sudden scarce believing discoverer tuscany could only swoon away under comparison of its starved sociabilities and complacent puerilities the stress of which her previous years had so known with the multiplied welcomes and freedoms the exquisite and easy fellowships that glorified to her the home scene into not the least of these quick affinities had her prompt acquaintance with mary temple confidently ripened and with no one in the aftertime so long as that too escaped the waiting shears was i to find it more a blest and sacred rite guarded by no stiff approaches to celebrate my cousins memory that really is my apology for this evocationwhich might under straighter connections have let me in still deeper since if i have glanced on another page of the present miscellany at the traps too often successfully set for my wandering feet my reader will doubtless here recognise a perfect illustration of our danger and will accuse me of treating an inch of canvas to an acre of embroidery let the poor canvas figure time and the embroidery figure consciousnessthe proportion will perhaps then not strike us as so wrong consciousness accordingly still grips me to the point of a felt pressure of interest in such a matter as the recoverable historyhistory in the esthetic connection at leastof its insistent dealings with a given case how in the course of time for instance was it not insistently to deal for a purpose of application with the fine prime image deposited all unwittingly by the picturesque as i absolutely required to feel it boott situation or boott data the direct or vital value of these last in so many ways was experiential a stored and assimilated thing but the seed of suggestion proved after long years to have kept itself apart in order that it should develop under a particular breath a not other than lonely and bereft american addicted to the arts and endowed for them housed to an effect of long expatriation in a massive old florentine villa with a treasured and tended little daughter by his side that was the germ which for reasons beyond my sounding the case of frank boott had been appointed to plant deep down in my vision of things so lodged it waited but the special instance as i say had lodged it and it lost no vitalityon the contrary it acquired every patienceby the fact that little by little each of its connections above ground so to speak was successively cut then at last after years it raised its own head into the air and found its full use for the imagination an italianate bereft american with a little moulded daughter in the setting of a massive old tuscan residence was at the end of years exactly what was required by a situation of my ownconceived in the light of the novel and i had it there in the authenticated way with its essential fund of truth at once all the more because my admirable old friend had given it to me and none the less because he had no single note of character or temper not a grain of the nonessential in common with my gilbert osmond this combination of facts has its shy interest i think in the general imaginative or reproductive connectiontestifying as it so happens to do on that whole question of the putting of people into books as to which any ineptitude of judgment appears always in order i probably shouldnt have had the gilbert osmonds at all without the early form of the frank bootts but i still more certainly shouldnt have had them with the sense of my old inspirers the form had to be disembarrassed of that sense and to take in a thoroughly other thanks to which account of the matter i am left feeling that i scarce know whether most to admire for support of ones beautiful business of the picture of life the relation of people to art or the relation of art to people adorable each time the mystery of which of these factors as we say has the more prevailingly conduced to a given effectand too much adored at any rate i allow when carrying me so very far away i retrace my steps with this next       i have made several attempts lately to write you a letter but i      have given it up after two or three pages because i have always      been in a blue state of mind at the time and have each time      charitably decided before it was too late to spare you but if i      were to wait until things change to rosecolour i might perhaps      wait till i die or longer even in which case your next      communication from me would be a spiritual one i am going to      newport in the early part of may to meet the boottshenrietta has      just come back from there delighted with her visit why heaven      knows i suppose but i dontexcept that she is in that blissful      state of babyhood peculiar to herself where everything seems      delightful i like george eliot not through her poem so much      not nearly so much as through her prose the creature interests me      personally and i feel a desire to know something of her life how      far her lofty moral sentiments have served her practicallyfor      instance in her dealings with lewes i see that she understands the      character of a generous woman that is of a woman who believes in      generosity and who must be that or nothing and who feels keenly      notwithstanding how hard it is practically to follow this out and      how looking at it from the point of view of comfort as far as this      world goes it pays not at all we are having weather quite like      summer and rather depressing i dont feel very well and am always      catching coldthat is i suppose i am as i have a cough nearly all      the time as for phillips brooks what you say of him is no doubt      all truehe didnt touch the main point when i heard him at all      events and that satisfaction you so kindly wish me is i am      afraid not to be got from any man the mystery of this world grows      and grows and sticks out of every apparently trivial thing      instead of lessening i hope this feeling may not be the incipient      stage of insanity paul told the truth when he said that now we see      through a glass very darkly i hope and trust that the rest may      be equally true and that some day we shall see face to face you      say it is easy to drown thought by welldoing and is it not also      the soundest philosophy so long of course as one doesnt humbug      oneself since by simply thinking out a religion who has ever      arrived at anything that did not leave ones heart empty do you      ever see willy james goodbye  needless enough surely to declare that such pages were essentially not loveletters that they could scarce have been less so seems exactly part of their noble inevitability as well as a proof singularly interesting and charming that confident friendship may obey its force and insist on its say quite as much as the sentiment we are apt to take as to many of its occasions for the supremely vocal we have so often seen this latter beat distressfully about the bush for something still deficient something in the line of positive esteem or constructive respect whether offered or enjoyed that an esteem and a respect such as we here apprehend explicit enough on either side to dispense with those superlatives in which graceless reaction has been known insidiously to lurk peculiarly refresh and instruct us the fine special quietude of the relation thus promoted in a general consciousness of unrestand even if it could breed questions too since a relation that breeds none at all is not a living onewas of the highest value to the author of my letters who had already sufficiently lived in her generous way to know well enough in how different a quarter to look for the grand inconclusive the directness the ease the extent of the high consideration the felt need of it as a support indeed one may almost say as an inspiration in trouble and the free gift of it as a delightful act of intelligence and justice render the whole exhibition to my sense admirable in its kind questions luckily could haunt it as i say and as we shall presently see but only to illustrate the more all the equilibrium preserved i confess i can imagine no tribute to a manly nature from a feminine more final even than the confidence in mere consideration here embodiedthe comfort of the consideration being in the fact that the character with which the feminine nature was dealing lent it could it but come such weight we seem to see play through the whole appeal of the younger person to the somewhat older an invocation of the weight suspended weight of judgment weight of experience and authority and which may ever so quietly drop how kindly in another relation it had been in fact capable of dropping comes back to me in the mention of my brother wilky as to whom this aspect of his admiring friendship for our young relatives correspondent the fruit of their common military service roundabout charleston again comprehensively testifies that comradeship was a privilege that wilky strongly cherished as well as what one particularly liked to think for him of his having knownhe was to have known nothing more fortunate in no less a degree was our elder brother to come to prize his like share in the associationthis being sufficiently indicated for that matter in the note i have quoted from him that i have prized my own share in it let my use of this benefit derived strongly represent but again for minnie herself the sadder admonition is sharp and i find i know not what lonely pluck in her relapses shaken off as with the jangle of silver bells her expert little efforts to live them down newport and other matters aiding and the general preoccupied good will all vainly at her service pitiful in particular her carrying her trouble experimentally back to the newport of the first gladness of her girlhood and of the old bright spectacle       i know quite well i dont owe you a letter and that the custom for      maidens is to mete out strictly letter for letter but if you dont      mind it i dont and if you do mind that kind of thing you had      better learn not to at onceif you propose to be a friend of mine      or else have your feelings from time to time severely shocked      after which preamble i will say that there is a special reason in      this case though there might not be in another  she mentions having seen a common friend in great bereavement and trouble who has charged her with a message to her correspondent if you know of anything to comfort a person when the one they love best dies for heavens sake say it to heri hadnt a word to say and she goes on       i wrote to you that i was going to newport and i meant to go next      tuesday but i had another hemorrhage last night and it is      impossible to say when i shall be able to leave here i think i was      feeling ill when i last wrote to you and ever since have been      coughing and feeling wretchedly until finally the hemorrhage has      come if that goes over well i think i shall be better i am in bed      now on the old plan of gruel and silence and i may get off      without any worse attack this time it is a perfect day like      summermy windows are up and the birds sing it seems quite out of      keeping that i should be in bed i should be all right if i could      only get rid of coughing the warm weather will set me up again i      wonder what you are doing today probably taking a solitary walk      and meditatingon what goodbye  but she went to newport after a few days apparently whence comes this       i believe i was in bed when i last wrote to you but that attack      didnt prove nearly so bad a one as the previous i rather bullied      it and after the fourth hemorrhage it ceased moreover my cough is      better since i came here but i am to tell the truth a little      homesickand am afraid i am becoming too much of a baby whether      its from illness or from the natural bent i know not but there is      no comfort in life away from people who care for younot an heroic      statement i am fully aware i hear that wilky is at home and dare      say he will have the kindness to run down and see me while i am      here at least i hope so but i am not in the mood for writing      todayi am tired and can only bore you if i kept on it is just a      year since we began to write and arent you by this time a little      tired of it if you are say so like a mandont be afraid of me      now i am going to lie down before dressing for dinner goodbye  this passage more than a month later makes me ask myself of which of the correspondents it strikes me as most characteristic the gay clearness of the one looks outas it always looked out on the least chance givenat the several apparent screens of the other each of which is indeed disconnectedly independently clear but tells too small a part at least for her pitch of lucidity of what they together enclose and what was quand même of so fine an implication delightful at the same time any page from her that is not one of the huddled milestones of her rate of decline       how can i write to you when i have forgotten all about youif one      can forget what one has never known however i am not quite sure      whether it isnt knowing you too much rather than too little that      seems to prevent do you comprehend the difficulty of course you      dont so i will explain the trouble is i think that to me you      have no distinct personality i dont feel sure to whom i am      writing when i say to myself that i will write to you i see      mentally three men all answering to your name each liable to read      my letters and yet differing so much from each other that if it is      proper for one of them its quite unsuitable to the others do you      see if you can once settle for me the question of which gets my      letters i shall know better what to say in them is it the man i      used to see i cant say know at conway who had a beard i think      and might have been middleaged and who discussed trollopes      novels with kitty and elly this was doubtless one of the best of      men but he didnt interest me i never felt disposed to speak to      him and used to get so sleepy in his society at about eight      oclock that i wondered how the other girls could stay awake till      eleven is it that person who reads my letters or is it the      young man i recently saw at newport with a priestly countenance      calm and critical with whom i had certainly no fault to find as a      chance companion for three or four days but whom i should never      have dreamt of writing to or bothering with my affairs one way or      the other happiness or no happiness as he would doubtless at once      despise me for my nonsense and wonder at me for my gravity does      he get my lettersor is it finally the being who has from time      to time himself written to me signing by the same name that the      other gentlemen appropriate if my correspondent is this last i      know where i standand please heaven shall stand there some time      longer him i wont describe but hes the only one of the three i      care anything about my only doubt is because i always address him      at pemberton square and i think him the least likely of the three      to go there much but goodbye whichever you are  it was not at any rate to be said of her that she didnt live surrounded even though she had to go so far afieldvery far it may at moments have appeared to herfor the freedom of talk that was her greatest need of all how happily and hilariously surrounded this next of the end of the following august and still more its sequel of the midseptember abundantly bring back to me so in the habit were the numerous emmets it might almost be said of marrying the numerous young women of our own then kinship they at all events formed mainly by themselves at that time the figures and the action of her immediate scene the marriage of her younger sister was as yet but an engagementto the brotherinlaw of the eldest already united to richard emmet and with temple kinship into the bargain playing between the pairs all of which animation of prospective and past weddingbells with whatever consolidation of pleasant ties couldnt quench her ceaseless instinct for the obscurer connections of things or keep passionate reflections from awaiting her at every turn this disposition in her and the way in which at the least push the gate of thought opened for her to its widest which was to the prospect of the soul and the question of interests on its part that wouldnt be ignored by no means fails to put to me that she might well have found the mystifications of life had she been appointed to enjoy more of them much in excess of its contentments it easily comes up for us over the relics of those we have seen beaten this sense that it was not for nothing they missed the ampler experience but in no case that i have known has it come up for me so much in none other have i so felt the naturalness of our asking ourselves what such spirits would have done with their extension and what would have satisfied them since dire as their defeat may have been we dont see them in the ambiguous light of some of their possibilities at peace with victory this may be perhaps an illusion of our interest in them a mere part of its ingenuity and i allow that if our doubt is excessive it does them a great wrongwhich is another way in which they were not to have been righted we soothe a little with it at any rate our sense of the tragic       the irretrievableness of the step her sister es marriage      comes over my mind from time to time in such an overwhelming way      that its most depressing and i have to be constantly on my guard      not to let temple and elly see it as it would naturally not please      them after all since they are not appalled at what theyve done      and are quite sure of each other as they evidently are why should      i worry myself i am well aware that if all other women felt the      seriousness of the matter to the extent i do hardly any would      ever marry and the human race would stop short so i ought      perhaps to be glad so many people can find and take that little      ease that clough talks about without consciously giving up the      highest thing and may not this majority of people be the truly      wise and my own notions of the subject simply fanatical and      impracticable i clearly see in how small a minority i am and that      the other side has with bishop blougram the best of it from one      point of view but i cant help that can i we must be true to      ourselves mustnt we though all the rest of humanity be of a      contrary opinion or else throw discredit upon the wisdom of god      who made us as we are and not like the next person do you remember      my old hobby of the remote possibility of the best thing being      better than a clear certainty of the second best well i believe      it more than ever every day i live indeed i dont believe      anything elsebut is not that everything and isnt it exactly      what christianity means wasnt christ the only man who ever lived      and died entirely for his faith without a shadow of selfishness      and isnt that reason enough why we should all turn to him after      having tried everything else and found it wantingturn to him as      the only pure and unmixed manifestation of god in humanity and      if i believe this which i think i do how utterly inconsistent and      detestable is the life i lead which so far from being a loving      and cheerful surrender of itself once for all to gods service is      at best but a base compromisea few moments or acts or thoughts      consciously and with difficulty divested of actual selfishness      must this always be so is it owing to the indissoluble mixture of      the divine and the diabolical in us all or is it because i myself      am hopelessly frivolous and trifling or is it finally that i      really dont believe that i have still a doubt in my mind      whether religion is the one exclusive thing to live for as      christ taught us or whether it will prove to be only one of the      influences though a great one which educate the human race and      help it along in that culture which matthew arnold thinks the most      desirable thing in the world in fine is it the meaning and end of      our lives or only a moral principle bearing a certain part in our      development       since i wrote this i have been having my tea and sitting on the      piazza looking at the stars and thinking it most unfaithful and      disloyal of me even to speak as i did just now admitting the      possibility of that faith not being everything which yet at moments      is so divinely true as to light up the whole of life suddenly and      make everything clear i know the trouble is with me when doubt      and despondency come but on the other hand i cant altogether      believe it wrong of me to have written as i have for then what      becomes of my principle of saying what one really thinks and      leaving it to god to take care of his own glory the truth will      vindicate itself in spite of my voice to the contrary if you think      i am letting myself go this way without sufficient excuse i wont      do it again but i cant help it this time i have nobody else to      speak to about serious things if by chance i say anything or ask a      question that lies at all near my heart my sisters all tell me i am      queer and that they wouldnt be me for anythingwhich is no      doubt sensible on their part but which puts an end to anything      but conversation of the most superficial kind on mine you know one      gets lonely after a while on such a plan of living so in sheer      desperation i break out where i perhaps more safely can  such is the magic of old letters on its subtlest occasions that i reconstitute in every detail to a vivid probabilityeven if i may not again proportionately project the bristling imageour scene of next mention drawing for this upon my uneffaced impression of a like one my cousin katharine temples bright nuptials in the same general setting very much before and in addition seeming to see the very muse of history take a fresh scroll in order to prepare to cover it in her very handsomest hand well before my eyes covered is it now for me with that abounding and interesting life of the generations then to come at the pair of preliminary flourishes ushering in the record of which i thus feel myself still assist       but a line today to tell you that elly was safely married on      wednesday she looked simply beautiful in her wedding garment and      behaved herself throughout with a composure that was as delightful      as it was surprising i send you a photograph of myself that i had      taken a few weeks ago it looks perhaps a trifle melancholy but i      cant help thati did the best i could but i wont write moreit      wouldnt be enlivening everything looks grey and blue in the world      nowadays it will all be bright again in time i have no doubt      there is no special reason for it i think i am simply tired with      knocking about yet my week in newport might have been pleasant      enough if the dentist hadnt taken that occasion to break my bones      for me in a barbarous manner you are very kind and friendly to      meyou dont know how much happiness your letters give me you      will be surprised i dare say but i shall not at the last day      when the accounts are all settled to find how much this counts in      your favour goodbye  i find my story so attaching that i prize every step of its course each note of which hangs together with all the others the writer is expressed to my vision in every word and the resulting image so worth preserving much of ones service to it is thus a gatheringin of the ever so faded ashes of the happiness that did come to her after all in snatches everything could well on occasion look grey and blue as she says yet there were stretches even if of the briefest when other things still were present than the active symptoms of her state the photograph that she speaks of above is before me as i write and blessedly helpful to memoryso that i am moved to reproduce it only till i feel again how the fondness of memory must strike the light for apprehension the plan of the journey to california for the advantage of the climate there was with other plans taken up and helplessly dropped but beguiling for the day to accompany her almost to the end       the templeemmet caravan have advanced as far as newport and now      propose to retreat again to pelham without stopping at boston or      anywhere else my brotherinlaw has business in new york and cant      be away any longer i havent been well of late or i should have      run up to boston for a day or two to take a sad farewell of all i      love in that city and thereabouts before i cross the rocky      mountains this little trip has been made out for me by my friends      i have determined to go and shall probably start with elly and      temple in about ten days possibly not for a fortnight to spend      the winter in san francisco i cant be enthusiastic about it but      suppose i might as well take all the means i can to get better a      winter in a warm climate may be good for me in short i am going      and now what i want you to do about it is simply to come and see      us before that kitty is going to send you a line to add her      voiceperhaps that may bring you you may never see me again you      know and if i were to die so far away youd be sorry you hadnt      taken leave of me wouldnt you  the idea of california held and with other pleasant matters really occupied the scene out of which moreover insist on shining to me accessory connections or connections that then were to be intensely distinct for example the figure of miss crawford afterwards madame von rabe sister of my eminent friend f marion of the name and in her essence i think but by a few shades less entire a figure than hewhich is saying much the most endowed and accomplished of men frank crawford so that i have scarcely known another who had more aboundingly lived and wrought about whom moreover there was singularly more to be said it struck me than at all found voice at the time he might have been commemorated therefore if the young lady alluded to in my cousins anecdote was at all of the same personal style and proportionwell i should draw the moral if it didnt represent here too speciously the mouth of a trap one of those i have already done penance for the effect of my yielding to which would be a shaft sunk so straight down into matters interesting and admirable and sad and strange that with everything that was futurity to the occasion noted in our letter and is an infinitely mixed and a heavily closed past now i hurry on without so much as a glance       the present plan is to send me to california in about three weeks      by water under the care of one of the emmet boys and temples      valetfor nurse and by the time i get there early in december      they will be settled in san francisco for the winter the idea of a      twentyone days seavoyage is rather appallingwhat do you think      of it this day is but too heavenly here i havent been to      church but walking by myself as happy as possible when one      sleeps well and the sun shines what happiness to live i wish you      were herewouldnt i show you pelham at high tide on a day that      is simply intoxicating with a fresh breeze blown through the red      and yellow leaves and sunshine on field and hill in heart and      brain as mr lowell says i suppose you remember the pony i      drove and punch the little scotch terrier that tried so to      insinuate himself into your affections on the piazza the morning      you left the former has been cutting up the latter cut up      since then you wouldnt believe me when i told you the pony was a      highly nervous creaturebut she behaved as one the other day when      i took the roman miss crawford who has been staying near here a      ride she shied at a dog that frightened her and dragged the cart      into a ditch and tried to get over a stone wall waggon and all i      of course had to hang on to the reins but i suggested to miss      crawford that she should get out as the cart was pretty steady      while the horses forefeet were on top of the wall which she did      into a mudpuddle and soiled her pretty striped stockings and      shoes in a horrible way it ended by the dear little beasts      consenting to get back upon all fours but i found it very amusing      and have liked her better ever since how does mr holmes      persevere about smoking i pity him if he cant sleep and wish i      had a vicious habit so that i might give it up but i must finish      my tale of the quadruped punch who was called upon in the dead of      night by five dogs of the neighbourhood and torn to pieces by them      the coachman heard him crying in the night and in the morning we      found himthat is to say we gathered him together his dear little      tail from one place and his head from another etc so went out a      very sweet little spiriti wonder where it is now dont tell me      he hadnt more of a soul than that kaufmann the fat oysterman  i find bribes to recognition and recovery quite mercilessly multiply and with the effort to brush past them more and more difficult with the sense for me at any rate whatever that may be worth for wisdom or comfort of sitting rather queerly safe and alone though as with a dangle of legs over the edge of a precipice on the hither side of great gulfs of history but these things dated toward the end of that november speak now in a manner for themselves       my passage for california is taken for the 4th of december elly      and temple have written to me to come at oncethey are settled in      san francisco for the winter my brotherinlaw here has been      promised that i shall be made so comfortable i shant want to tear      myself from the ship when i arrive the captain is a friend of      temples and also of my uncle captain temple and both of them are      going to arrange so for me that i fully expect the ship to be hung      with banners and flowers when i step on board i enjoyed my time      in boston far more than i had expectedin fact immensely and      wouldnt have missed it for anything i feel now as if it had      necessarily had to happen i dont know how i should have done      the winter and especially started off for an indefinitely long      absence in the west without the impetus that it gave me in certain      directionsthe settling down and shaking up the dissipating of      certain impressions that i had thought fixed and the strengthening      of others that i hadnt been so sure of an epoch in short i dare      say you have had suchin which a good deal of living was done in a      short time to be turned over and made fruitful in days to come i      saw mr holmes once and was very glad of that glimpse short as it      was i went home by way of newport where i stayed two daysand      where i was surprised to hear of fred joness engagement to miss      rawle of philadelphia do you know her when i got to new york i      went to the hones to ask something about fred and his affairs and      found that miss rawle was staying next door with mrs willy duncan      so i went in to see her on the spur of the moment very much as i      had come from the boat not particularly presentable for a first      call however i thought if she had a soul she wouldnt mind      itand such i found the case lizzie boott was as sweet and      good to me as ever i think she is at once the most unselfish and      most unegotistical girl i knowthey dont always go together  what follows here has in its order i think that it still so testifies to lifeif one doesnt see in it indeed rather perhaps the instinct on the writers part though a scarce conscious one to wind up the affairs of her spirit as it were and be able to turn over with a sigh of supreme relief for an end intimately felt as at hand the moral fermentation breaking through the bustle of outward questions even at a time when she might have thrown herself as one feels on the great soft breast of equalising nature or taken her chance of not being too wrong is a great stroke of truth no one really could be less morbid yet she would take no chanceit wasnt in herof not being right with the right persons among whom she so ranked her correspondent       my address at san francisco will be simply care of c temple emmet      esq and i am surely off this time unless heaven interposes in a      miraculous way between now and saturday ive no great courage      about it but after all its much the same to me where i am life      is always full of interest and mystery and happiness to me and as      for the voyage the idea of three weeks of comparative solitude      between sea and sky isnt unattractive i know that by my      question as to why he had written apparently that she was of      her nature far off from him i am putting an end to that      delightful immunity i have enjoyed so much with you from sickening      introspection analysis of myself and yourself that exhausting and      nauseating subjectivity with which most of my other friends see      fit to deluge me thereby taking much that is refreshing out of      life dont be afraid of hurting my feelings by anything you can      say our friendship has always been to my mind a onesided thing      and if you should tell me you find me in any way unsympathetic or      unsatisfactory it wont disappoint me and i wont even allow      myself to think im sorry i feel so clearly that god knows best      and that we ought neither of us surely to wish to distort his      creatures from the uses he made them for just to serve our own      purposesthat is to get a little more sympathy and comfort we      must each of us after all live out our own lives apart from      everyone else and yet this being once understood as a fundamental      truth there is nobodys sympathy and approval that would encourage      me so much as yours i mean that if ones heart and motives could      be known by another as god knows them without disguise or      extenuation and if it should then prove that on the whole you      didnt think well of me it would more than anything else could      shake my confidence in my own instincts which must after all      forever be my guide and yet as i said before i am quite prepared      for the worst and shall listen to it if necessary quite humbly      i am very much inclined to trust your opinion before my own       an hour later sold again by all thats wonderfuli had almost      said by all thats damnable though it isnt exactly that my      brother dick has just walked in with a telegram from temple i      shall be back in decemberdont send m a tremendous revulsion of      feeling and a general sigh of relief have taken place on this      announcement and its all right im sure though when i wrote you      an hour ago i thought the same of the other prospect  one catches ones breath a little frankly at what was to follow the above within a few daysimplying as it does that she had drawn upon herself some fairly direct statement of her correspondents reserves of view as to her human or intellectual composition to have had such reserves at such an hour and to have responded to the invitation to express themfor invitation there had beenis something that our actual larger light quite helps us to flatter ourselves we shouldnt have been capable of but what was of the essence between these admirable persons was exactly the tone of truth the larger light was all to wait for and the real bearings of the hour were as unapparent as the interlocutors themselves were at home in clearness so far as they might bring that ideal about and whatever turn their conversation took is to the honour always of the generous girls passion for truth as this long letter admirably illustrates that i withdraw from it almost nothing the record of the rare commerce would be incomplete without it all the more perhaps for the wonder and pain of our seeing the noble and pathetic young creature have of all things in her predicament to plead for extenuations to excuse and justify herself       i understood your letter perfectly wellit was better than i      feared it might be but bad enough better because i knew already      all it told me and had been afraid there might be some new and      horrible development in store for me which i hadnt myself felt      but bad enough because i find it in itself new or old such a      disgusting fact that i am intellectually so unsympathetic it is a      fault i feel profoundly conscious of but one that strange to say      i have only of late been conscious of as a fault i dare say i      have always known in a general way that i am very unobservant      about things and take very little interest in subjects upon which      my mind doesnt naturally dwell but it had never occurred to me      before that it is a fault that ought to be corrected whether      because i have never been given to studying myself much but have      just let myself go the way my mind was most inclined to more      interested in the subject itself than in the fact that it      interested me or whether because one is averse to set oneself down      as indolent and egotistic i dont know at all events i have of      late seen the thing in all its unattractiveness and i wish i could      get over it do you think that now i am fully roused to the fact      my case is hopeless or that if i should try hard for the next      twentyfive years i might succeed in modifying it i am speaking      now of a want of interest in all the rest of the world of not      having the desire to investigate subjects naturally uninteresting      to me just because they are interesting to some other human being      whom i dont particularly owe anything to except that he is a      human being and so his thoughts and feelings ought to be respected      by me and sympathised with not to do this is i know      unphilosophic and selfish conceited and altogether inhuman to be      unselfish to live for other people to mould our lives as much as      possible on the model of christs allembracing humanity seems      most clearly to my mind the one thing worth living for and yet it      is still the hardest thing for me to do and i think i do it less      than anybody else who feels the necessity of it strongly at all       i am glad you still go to an occasional balli should rather like      to meet you at one myself its a phase of life we have seen so      little of together i have been feeling so well lately that i dont      know what to make of it i dont remember ever in my life being in      such good spirits not that they are not in general pretty natural      to me when there is the slightest excuse for them but now      everything seems bright and happy my life so full of interest my      time so thoroughly filled and such a delicious calm to have settled      down on my usually restless spirit such an enjoyment of the      present such a grateful contentment is in each new day as i see      it dawn in the east that i can only be thankful and say to myself      make a note of thisyou are happy dont forget it nor to be      thankful for this beautiful gift of life this is sunday morning      and i wonder whether you are listening to phillips brooks i      understand how you feel about his preachingthat it is all feeling      and no reason i found it so myself last winter in philadelphia he      was good for those within the pale but not good to convince      outsiders that they should come in i am glad however that he      preaches in this wayi think his power lies in it for it seems to      me after all that what comfort we get from religion and what      light we have upon it come to us through feeling that is through      trusting our instinct as the voice of god the holy ghost though      it may at the same time appear to us directly against what our      intellect teaches us i dont mean by this that we should deny the      conclusions arrived at by our intellectwhich on the contrary i      believe we should trust and stand by to the bitter end whenever      this may be but let us fearlessly trust our whole nature      showing our faith in god by being true to ourselves all through      and not dishonouring him by ignoring what our heart says because it      is not carried out by our intellect or by wilfully blunting our      intellectual perception because it happens to run against some      cherished wish of our heart       but you will say how can a man live torn to pieces this way by      these contrary currents well i know it is hard to keep our faith      sure of a standpoint where these apparent inconsistencies are all      reconciled and the jangle and discord sound the sweetest harmony      but i do believe there is one in god and that we must only try      to have that faith and never mind how great the inconsistency may      seem nor how perplexing the maze it leads us through let us never      give up one element of the problem for the sake of coming to a      comfortable solution of it in this world i dont blame those eager      minds that are always worrying studying investigating to find      the solution here below it is a noble work and let them follow it      out and without a bit of compromise to whom god has given the      work but whether we find it or not i would have them and all of us      feel that it is to be found if god willsand through no other      means surely than by our being true blessed are they who have      not seen and who have yet believed but i am going out now for a      walk we have had the most delightful weather this whole week and      capital sleighing and i have spent most of my time driving myself      about with that same dear little pony i went to town yesterday to      a matinée of william tell it was delightful and i slept all night      after it too i am reading german a little every day and its      beginning to go pretty well goodbye dont tire yourself out      between work and dissipation  i find myself quite sit up to her as we have it today while she sits there without inconvenience after all that has happened under the dead weight of william tell the relief of seeing her sublimely capable of which with the reprieve from her formidable flight to the pacific doubtless not a little contributing helps to draw down again the vision or more exactly the sound of the old new york and boston opera as our young generation knew and artlessly admired it admired it by my quite broken memories of the early time in brignoli the sweet and vague in susini the deep and rich in miss kellogg the native and charming in adelaide phillipps the universal to say nothing of other acclaimed warblers they appear to me to have warbled then so much more than since whom i am afraid of not placing in the right perspective they warbled faust a dozen times it comes back to me for once of anything else miss kellogg and brignoli heaped up the measure of that success and i well remember the great yearning with which i heard my cousin describe her first enchanted sense of it the next in date of the letters before me of the last day but one of december 69 is mainly an interesting expression of the part that music plays in her mental economythough but tentatively offered to her correspondent who she fears may not be musical enough to understand her understand how much spiritual truth has been borne in upon me by means of harmony the relation of the part to the whole the absolute value of the individual the absolute necessity of uncompromising and unfaltering truth the different ways in which we like our likes and our unlikes things all that have been so made clearer to her of a singular grace in movement and attitude a grace of free mobility and activity as original and unconventional as it was carelessly natural she never looked more possessed of her best resources than at the piano in which she delighted at which she had ardently worked and where slim and straight her shoulders and head constantly sympathetically swaying she discoursed with an admirable touch and a long surrender that was like a profession of the safest relation she could know comparatively safe though it might have been however in the better time she was allowed now i gather but little playing and she is deep again toward the end of january 70 in a quite other exposure the old familiar exposure to the demon as she calls it of the why whence whither long as the letter is i feel it a case again for presentation whole the last thoughts of her life as they appear breathe in it with such elevation they seem to give us her last words and impulses and with what follows of the middle of february constitute the moving climax of her rich short story       there have been times and they will come again no doubt when i      could write to you about ordinary things in a way at least not      depressing but for a good while now i have felt so tired out      bodily and mentally that i couldnt conscientiously ask you to      share my mood the life i live here in the country and so very      much alone is capable of being the happiest or the unhappiest of      existences as it all depends so on oneself and is so very little      interfered with by outside influences perhaps i am more than      usually subject to extremes of happiness and of depression yet i      suppose everyone must have moments even in the most varied and      distracting life when the old questioning spirit the demon of the      why whence whither stalks in like the skeleton at the feast and      takes a seat beside him i say everyone but i must except those      rare and happy souls who really believe in christianity who no      longer strive after even goodness as it comes from ones own      effort but take refuge in the mysterious sacrifice of christ his      merit sufficing and in short throw themselves in the orthodox way      on the consoling truth of the atonementto me hitherto neither      comprehensible nor desirable these people having completely      surrendered self having lost their lives as it were in christ      must truly have found them must know the rest that comes from      literally casting their care of doubt and strife and thought upon      the lord       i say hitherto the doctrine of the vicarious suffering of christ      has been to me not only incomprehensible but also unconsoling i      didnt want it and didnt understand even intellectually the      feeling of people who do i dont mean to say that the life and      death of christ and the example they set for us have not been to me      always the brightest spot in historyfor they have but they have      stood rather as an example that we must try to follow that we must      by constant and ceaseless effort bring our lives nearer tobut      always to some extent at least through ourselves that is through      ourselves with gods help got by asking him for it and by his      giving it to us straight and with no mediation when i have seen as      time went by my own shortcomings all the more instead of the less      frequent i have thought well you dont try hard enough you are      not really in earnest in thinking that you believe in the christian      life as the only true one the more i tried nevertheless the      less it seemed like the model life the best things i did continued      to be the more spontaneous ones the greatest efforts had the least      success until finally i couldnt but see that if this was      christianity it was not the rest that christ had promised his      disciplesit was nothing more than a pagan life with a high ideal      only an ideal so high that nothing but failure and unhappiness came      from trying to follow it and one night when i was awake through      all the hours it occurred to me what if this were the need that      christianity came to fill up in our hearts what if after all      that old meaningless form of words that had been sounded in my      unheeding ears all my days were suddenly to become invested with      spirit and truth what if this were the good tidings that have made      so many hearts secure and happy in the most trying situations for      if morality and virtue were the test of a christian certainly      christ would never have likened the kingdom of heaven to a little      child in whose heart is no struggle no conscious battle between      right and wrong but only unthinking love and trust       however it may turn out whether it shall seem true or untrue to me      finally i am at least glad to be able to put myself intellectually      into the place of the long line of christians who have felt the      need and the comfort of this belief it throws a light upon uncle      henrys talk which has seemed to me hitherto neither reasonable      nor consoling when i was with him it so far disgusted me that i      fear i showed him plainly that i found it not only highly      unpractical but ignoble and shirking i knew all the while that he      disliked what he called my pride and conceit but felt all the same      that his views didnt touch my case a bit didnt give me the least      comfort or practical help and seemed to me wanting in earnestness      and strength now i say to myself what if the good gentleman had      all along really got hold of the higher truth the purer      spirituality verily there are two sides to everything in this      world and one becomes more charitable the older one grows      however if i write at this length it is because i am feeling      today too seedy for anything else i had a hemorrhage a week ago      which rather took the life out of me but as it was the only one i      feel i should by this time be coming round againand probably      might if i hadnt got into a sleepless state which completely      knocks me up the old consolatory remark patience neighbour and      shuffle the cards ought to impart a little hope to me i suppose      but its a long time since ive had any trumps in my hand and you      know that with the best luck the game always tired me willy james      sometimes tells me to behave like a man and a gentleman if i wish      to outwit fate what a real person he is he is to me in nearly      all respects a head and shoulders above other people how is      wendell holmes elly is having the gayest winter in washington and      wants me to go to them there which i had meant to do before the      return of my last winters illness but its not for me now       lateri have kept my letter a day or two thinking i might feel      in tune for writing you a better one and not sending this at all      but alas i shall have to wait some time before i am like my old      self again so i may as well let this go you see im not in a      condition mentally or physically to take bright and healthy views      of life but if you really care you may as well see this mood as      another for heaven only knows when i shall get out of it can you      understand the utter weariness of thinking about one thing all the      time so that when you wake up in the morning consciousness comes      back with a sigh of oh yes here it is again another day of      doubting and worrying hoping and fearing has begun if i dont      get any sleep at all which is too frequently the case the strain      is a leetle bit too hard and i am sometimes tempted to take a      drop of pison to put me to sleep in earnest that momentary      vision of redemption from thinking and striving of a happy rest      this side of eternity has vanished away again i cant help it      peaceful desirable as it may be the truth is that practically i      dont believe it it was such a sudden thing such an entire change      from anything that had ever come to me before that it seemed      almost like an inspiration and i waited almost expecting it to      continue to be permanent but it doesnt stay and so back swings      the universe to the old placepaganism naturalism or whatever      you call the belief whose watchword is god and our own soul and      who shall say there is not comfort in it one at least feels that      here one breathes ones native air welcoming back the old human      feeling with its beautiful pride and its striving its despair      its mystery and its faith write to me and tell me whether as one      goes on one must still be tossed about more and more by these      conflicting feelings or whether they finally settle themselves      quietly one way or the other and take only their proper share at      least of ones life this day is like summer but i should enjoy it      more if last night hadnt been quite the most unpleasant i ever      spent i got so thoroughly tired about two in the morning that i      made up my mind in despair to give the morphine another trial and      as one dose had no effect took two the consequence of which is      that i feel as ill today as one could desire i can tell you sir      you had better prize the gift of sleep as it deserves while you      have it if i dont never write to you no more youll know its      because i really wish to treat you kindly but one of these days      youll get another kind of letter brimfull perhaps with health      and happiness and thoroughly ashamed of my present self i had a      long letter yesterday from harry james at florenceenjoying italy      but homesick did you see those verses in the north american      translated from the persian goodbye  the last of all is full both of realities and illusions the latter insistently living through all the distress of the former and i should like to say or to believe that they remained with her to the end which was near       dont be alarmed at my pencili am not in bed but only bundledup      on the piazza by order of the doctor i started for new york      feeling a good deal knocked up but hoping to get better from the      change i was to stay there over sunday and see dr metcalfe who      has a high reputation and was a friend of my fathers i left a      request at his office that he would come to me on sunday pm but      in the meantime my cousin mrs minturn post with whom i was      staying urged upon me her physician dr taylor who came on      saturday night just as i was going to bed and after sounding my      lungs told me very dreadful things about them as his verdict was      worse than metcalfes proved i will tell you what he said first he      began very solemnly my dear young lady your right lung is      diseased all your hemorrhages have come from there it must have      been bad for at least a year before they began you must go to      europe as soon as possible this was not cheerful as i had been      idiot enough to believe some time ago such a different explanation      but of course i wanted to learn what he absolutely thought and      told him i wasnt a bit afraid if there werent tubercles was i      curable and if there were was i hopeless i asked him for the      very worst view he had conscientiously to take but didnt mean      definitely to ask how long i should live and so was rather      unprepared for his reply of two or three years i didnt however      wish to make him regret his frankness so i said well doctor      even if my right lung were all gone i should make a stand with my      left and then by way of showing how valiant the stand would be      fainted away this i should say was owing a good deal to my      previous usedup condition from want of sleep it made him at any      rate hasten to assure me that there was every possibility of my      case being not after all so badwith which he took his departure      to my great relief as i didnt think him at all nice his grammar      was bad and he made himself generally objectionable       the next night dear dr metcalfe came whom i love for the gentlest      and kindest soul i have ever seen to start with hes a gentleman      as well as an excellent physician and to end with he and my father      were fond of each other at west point and he takes a sort of      paternal interest in me he told me that my right lung is decidedly      weaker than my left which is quite sound and that the hemorrhage      has been a good thing for it and kept it from actual disease and      also that if i can keep up my general health i may get all right      again he has known a ten times worse case get entirely well he      urged me not to go to washington but decidedly to go to europe so      this last is what i am to do with my cousin mrs post if i am not      dead before june in a fortnight im to go back to new york to be      for some time under metcalfes care i feel tired out and hardly      able to stir but my courage is good and i dont propose to lose      it if i can help for i know it all depends on myself whether i get      through or not that is if i begin to be indifferent to what      happens i shall go down the hill fast i have fortunately through      my mothers father enough irish blood in me rather to enjoy a good      fight i feel the greatest longing for summer or spring i should      like it to be always spring for the rest of my life and to have all      the people i care for always with me but who wouldnt like it      so goodbye  to the gallantry and beauty of which there is little surely to add but there came a moment almost immediately after when all illusion failed which it is not good to think of or linger on and yet not pitiful not to note one may have wondered rather doubtinglyand i have expressed thatwhat life would have had for her and how her exquisite faculty of challenge could have worked in with what she was likely otherwise to have encountered or been confined to none the less did she in fact cling to consciousness death at the last was dreadful to her she would have given anything to liveand the image of this which was long to remain with me appeared so of the essence of tragedy that i was in the faroff aftertime to seek to lay the ghost by wrapping it a particular occasion aiding in the beauty and dignity of art the figure that was to hover as the ghost has at any rate been of an extreme pertinence i feel to my doubtless too loose and confused general picture vitiated perhaps by the effort to comprehend more than it contains much as this cherished companions presence among us had represented for william and myselfand it is on his behalf i especially speakher death made a mark that must stand here for a too waiting conclusion we felt it together as the end of our youth   the end                                       the following typographical errors have been

was indeed not least remarkably applied many illustrations of it would be to give had i more margin and not one of them anything less than striking thanks to the vivacity of his intelligence the variety of his gifts and the native ability in which he was himself so much less interested than was the case with everyone he met however casually that he became many years before his death in 1910 our one gentleman of leisure so far as this condition might consort with the easiest aptitude for admirable talk charged with natural life perception humour and colour that i have perhaps ever known there were times when bobs spoken overflow struck me as the equivalent for fine animation of williams epistolary the note of the ingenious in him spent itself as he went but i find an echo of one of its many incidents in the passage of verse that i am here moved to rescue from undue obscurity it is too amateurish and has too many irregular lines but images admirably the play of spirit in him

smote at last to make me free     as he was smitten on the tree     and nailèd there he knew of old     the human heart and mine is cold     and i know now that all we gain     until we come to him is

thee to thee belong     once was i wakened by thy light     but years have passed and now the night     takes me to thee i am content     so be it in thy perfect plan     a mansion is where i am sent     to dwell among the innocent
