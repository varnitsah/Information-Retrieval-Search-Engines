party that writes the leading article is nobody and the chap that speaks in the house of commons is a hero lord lord how the world is umbugged poplar representation what is poplar representation dammy

wonderful how he picked up french whilst we were abroad esprit des lois what is it it must be dreadfully stupid and as for reading helvetius who i suppose was a roman general i really cant understand howdear dear what airs these persons give themselves what will come next a footmani beg mr howells pardona butler and confidential valet lolls on the drawingroom sofa and reads montesquieu impudence and add to this he follows me for the last two or three months with eyes that are quite horrid what can the creature mean but i forgoti am only a governess a governess is not a ladya governess is but a servanta governess is to work and walk all day with the children dine in the schoolroom and come to the drawingroom to play the man of the house to sleep a governess is a domestic only her place is

touchit why should not my stepfather and my mother dine with me i can afford it i am a domestic man and like to see my relations about me i am in the city all day  touchitluckily for you  millikenand my pleasure of an evening is to sit under my own vine and under my own figtree with my own olivebranches round about me to sit by my fire with my children at my knees to coze over a snug bottle of claret after dinner with a friend like you to share it to see the young folks at the breakfasttable of a morning and to kiss them and so off to business with a cheerful heart this was my scheme in marrying had it pleased heaven to prosper my plan when i was a boy and came from school and college i used to see mr bonnington my fatherinlaw with his young ones clustering round about him so happy to be with him so eager to wait on him all down on their little knees round my mother before breakfast or jumping up on his after dinner it was who should reach his hat and who should bring his coat and who should fetch his umbrella and who should get the last kiss  touchitwhat didnt he kiss you oh the hardhearted old ogre  millikendont touchit dont laugh at mr bonnington he is as good a fellow as ever breathed between you and me as my half brothers and sisters increased and multiplied year after year i used to feel rather lonely rather bowled out you understand but i saw them so happy that i longed to have a home of my own when my mother proposed arabella for me for she and lady kicklebury were immense friends at one time i was glad enough to give up clubs and bachelorhood and to settle down as a married man my mother acted for the best my poor wifes character my mother used to say changed after marriage i was not as happy as i hoped to be but i tried for it george i am not so comfortable now as i might be a house without a mistress with two mothersinlaw reigning over itone worldly and aristocratic another what you call serious though she dont mind a rubber of whist i give you my honor my mother plays a game at whist and an uncommonly good game tooeach woman dragging over a child to her side of course such a family cannot be comfortable bell rings theres the first dinnerbell go and dress for heavens sake  touchitwhy dress there is no company  millikenwhy ah her ladyship likes it you see and it costs nothing to humor her quick for she dont like to be kept
