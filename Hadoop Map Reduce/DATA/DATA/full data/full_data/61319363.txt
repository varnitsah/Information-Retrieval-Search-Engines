61319363	neal the miller  a son of liberty   by  james otis     contents      i  the project    ii  the escape   iii  in boston    iv  on the pascataqua     v  stephen kidder    vi  sewatis     chapter i  the project   i fear you are undertaking too much neal when a fellow lacks two years of his majority  you forget that i have been my own master more than a year father gave me my time before he died and that in the presence of governor wentworth himself  why before him rather than squire white  i dont know my good friend andrew mccleary attended to the business for me and today i may make contracts as legally as two years hence  even with that advantage i do not see how it will be possible for you to build a gristmill or if you should succeed in getting so far with the project how you can procure the machinery it is such an undertaking as andrew mccleary himself would not venture  yet he has promised me every assistance in his power  and how much may that be he has no friends at court who can  neither does he wish for one there stephen kidder he is a man who has the welfare of the colonists too much at heart to seek for friends near the throne  it is there he will need them if he hopes to benefit new hampshire  perhaps not the time is coming when it behooves each of us to observe well the law regarding our arms  you mean the statute which declares that every male from sixteen to sixty must have ready for use one musket and bayonet a knapsack cartridgebox one pound of powder twenty bullets and twelve flints  there is none other that i know of  then i shall not be a lawbreaker for i am provided in due form but what has that to do with your mill i think you will find it difficult to buy the stamped paper necessary for the lawful making of your contracts unless you dispose of your outfit for war or hunting which is the best to be found in portsmouth  that i shall never do even if i fail in getting the mill do you know stephen that i was admitted to the ranks of the sons of liberty last night  the honours are being heaped high on the head of the wouldbe miller of the pascataqua kidder replied with a laugh do you expect the sons of liberty will do away with the necessity for stamped paper  who shall say much can  walter neal did not conclude the sentence for at that instant two men passed and a signal so slight as not to be observed by his companion was given by one of the newcomers causing the young man to hasten away without so much as a word in explanation of his sudden departure while stephen kidder stood gazing after him in blank amazement  the two friends whose conversation was so suddenly interrupted were natives of the town of portsmouth in the province of new hampshire and had either had occasion to set down the date of this accidental meeting it would have been written october 26th 1765  as has been suggested walter neals ambition was to erect a gristmill a certain distance up the pascataqua river where was great need of one since land in that portion of the province was being rapidly settled and although without capital he believed it might be possible for him to accomplish his desires  he was favourably known to the merchants of portsmouth and thanks to the efforts of his friend andrew mcclearyten years his seniorseveral tradesmen had intimated that perhaps they might advance sufficient money to start the enterprise in a limited way  neal had inherited a small amount of property from his father but like many of the farmers in the new world he was sadly hampered by the lack of ready money during several weeks prior to this accidental meeting with stephen kidder he had been forced to temporarily abandon his scheming in regard to the mill that he might try to raise sufficient money with which to pay the annual tax already more than burdensome upon his small estate  as neal hastened after the two men who had given him the signal to follow them the most engrossing thought in his mind was as to how the amount of four pounds and seven shillings in cash could be raised without a sacrifice of the cattle from the home farm  ephraim foulsham had partially agreed to advance the sum if he could be secured by a chattelmortgage and when neal overtook those in advance he was speculating upon the possibility of getting the amount that day lest execution should be issued against him  that which he heard however speedily drove all thoughts of a personal nature from his mind master mccleary would be pleased to see you and quickly one of the men said in a low tone when the three were where there was no other to overhear the conversation  is it important i should go at once  yes unless you would break the oath you took last night  neal waited to ask no more questions ten minutes later he was at samuel leavitts store where he knew mccleary would be found at this time of the day  before neal could speak his friend walked quickly out of the building toward the shore of the harbour giving the wouldbe millowner an expressive look which plainly told that he was to follow  not until mccleary was at a point where no one could approach him without being seen did he halt and then neal was by his side  a messenger must be sent to boston at once the elder man said in a low tone it is not generally known that you have been admitted to our association therefore you are the one to go  when shall i start  at once there is no time to be lost will you ride my horse  my own will serve me better suspicions might be aroused if i should be seen on yours  very true i had not thought of that you are to make all speed and go direct to master reveres say to him that george messerve who has been appointed distributor of the tax stamps for new hampshire will arrive in boston shortly if indeed he is not already there tell master revere that the feeling in our section grows stronger against this last imposition every day until there is danger lest the excesses which marked the 26th of august in boston may be repeated here he will understand what it is we want him to do  shall i have time  you will not have time for delay start at once and as you perform this mission so will you be benefiting yourself in the project of the mill  it does not require i should know that in order to be faithful to the trust imposed upon me  i was about to ask if i should have time to attend to raising the amount of my taxes for i have twice been warned that they are due  i will see to it that you do not suffer by the delay go at once and let nothing detain you we expect the message will be delivered early tomorrow morning  neals home lay two miles west of portsmouth and without waiting to attend to the business for which he had visited the town he hastened toward it at a rapid pace his mind was easy in regard to the payment of the taxes for mccleary would keep every promise made and when he returned it should be possible to make the necessary arrangements with ephraim foulsham within twentyfour hours  when he arrived in view of the loghouse which his father had built twenty years previous walter understood that something out of the ordinary course of events had happened the doors of the barn were open and his mother stood in front of the building as if in deepest distress a portion of the railfence which enclosed the buildings was torn down and the cart that had been left by the side of the road was no longer to be seen  you could not borrow the money his mother said interrogatively while he was yet some distance away  i havent had an opportunity to see master foulsham what has happened  the worst my son that could befall us at this time the officers have attached the cattle and the horse even if you can borrow money the costs of the action will eat up all we had to live on this coming winter  the horse gone walter exclaimed as if in bewilderment  we could better spare him just now than the cattle because of the work yet to be done  neal was not at that moment thinking of the farm duties nor yet of the mill which was more distant in the future than before but only of the fact that it was necessary he should be in boston on the following morning  hurriedly he explained to his mother why it was he must leave home and added in conclusion  master mccleary has promised that i shall not suffer because of the delay in paying the tax and i am certain he will keep faith with me  and do you intend to leave home now  i must there are those who depend upon me and they shall not be disappointed  i am afraid walter you are pursuing the wrong course it is best that wiser and older heads than yours should be concerned in the struggle which must come if the people resist this new tax  father would have done as i am doing and since i am to fill his place it is fit i should do what i can  but how will you reach boston without a horse or money  walter hesitated by returning to portsmouth he could get the animal which mccleary had proposed he should ride and yet to do so would delay him greatly in addition to the possibility of arousing suspicion against his friend  by leaving the main road six miles farther on and striking across a tract of wooded country the distance could be reduced materially but even then there would remain at least fifty miles to be traversed  i can walk to salem he said at length and there william cotton will provide me with a horse  it is a desperate journey and dangerous if some should learn why you had undertaken it i  you would not bid me stay mother but rather urge me forward i have no time to lose  you will at least wait until i can put up some food  yes it will be necessary to eat i suppose bread and cheese will be enough and even that must be got together quickly  mrs neal made no attempt to dissuade her son from his purpose that which he had said concerning his father had been sufficient to silence her on the score of danger and when the small store of provisions were wrapped in a stout piece of cloth and placed in the pocket of his coat she kissed him but did not dare trust her voice to speak  with a stout hickory stick as a walkingcane walter set out and there was sufficient in his mind to provide ample food for thought during the first two hours of the journey he was not at all certain that now that the cost of making an attachment of his property was to be added to the amount of his tax ephraim foulsham would be willing to advance the money and even if the sum could be raised in such a manner it was so much increased that he could not hope to see the wishedfor mill under erection until another season at the earliest  at the end of the second hour he had accomplished at least nine miles of the distance and could well afford to indulge in a brief halt while partaking of his food  nine miles from home means eleven from portsmouth he said aloud as if the sound of his own voice gave him encouragement by this path salem cannot be more than twentyfour miles away and i must make it in five hours in order to reach boston by sunrise it can be done if i do not allow myself too much time in which to rest my legs and  he ceased speaking very suddenly for at that instant as if they had descended from the clouds two horsemen stood before him  the mosscovered path had deadened the sound of the animals approach as they came up from the rear  walter recognized both the newcomers the foremost was samuel haines a man who had made an unsuccessful attempt to get the appointment to distribute stamped paper in new hampshire and the other james albert a halfbreed indian who was well known in portsmouth as a quarrelsome fellow ready to take part in any business however disreputable so long as he was provided with an ample supply of rum  walter nodded familiarly to haines but paid no attention to the indian  wait a moment master neal the former said gravely as walter attempted to pass him where are you going that you cannot stop for a short converse  on business which admits of no delay  do you expect to walk from here to boston before daylight  who said i was going to boston  perhaps i guessed as much  then kindly guess that i cant wait here simply for the pleasure of talking with master haines  i shant try to do that my rebellious friend when jim gets ready  walter half turned to see what part the indian was to play in this interview and as he did so the fellows arms were around him pinioning his own to his side  what is the meaning of this he cried angrily as he tried in vain to release himself  it means master neal that i wish to see the message you carry and haines dismounting hastily searched the prisoners pockets  you have found yourself mistaken as sadly as when you believed the king would give you the dirty work of selling stamped paper walter said with a laugh noting the look of disappointment on hainess face when he failed to find any document  you have been intrusted to deliver the message by word of mouth and it will serve my purpose as well if i prevent you from calling on that seditious revere here jim tie him to a tree with this and haines drew from his saddlebags a piece of stout rope  it was in vain walter struggled taken at a disadvantage as he had been he was powerless and in a few moments was bound securely to a tree while his captors threw themselves on the ground in front of him as if to make a long stay  if you repeat what you were told to say to revere i will see to it that you are made more comfortable haines said after a long pause  and what then  we shall make certain you dont return to portsmouth for two or three days that is all  if i have a message to deliver i will keep it to myself instead of intrusting it to you walter said grimly but his mind was sorely troubled for he realized that if he should be delayed here no more than four hours the information he was to give might arrive too late     chapter ii  the escape   during the hour which followed walters capture the two men remained close at hand while their horses were allowed to stroll along the path eating grass and at the expiration of that time the animals could no longer either be seen or heard  go and bring them back jim haines said in a peremptory tone it would be a hard job for us if they should stray too far  the halfbreed hesitated an instant as if undecided whether to obey this command and then rising slowly to his feet he slouched down the path lazily  after the brief conversation which had followed the capture of walter neither of the men had spoken until this moment but as soon as his comrade disappeared among the bushes haines said in what he intended should sound like a friendly tone  i am sorry to see a promising young man like you neal led astray by these fanatics who dream of opposing his majestys just and wise laws you have too much solid sense to train in any such company  you seem to have a remarkably good opinion of me walter said grimly  so i have lad so i have i know you have been hoping to build a mill of your own on the pascataqua and am interested in the project for it is a sensible one there is plenty of money to be made in that section  according to appearances now i shant reap any very large harvest this year  it depends upon yourself if you had kept proper company there would have been no attachment made today  how did you know anything about that walter asked sharply  i heard the matter discussed and feel certain you would have been given more time but for your own very unwise move last night  then you know  walter stopped suddenly on realizing that he was about to betray a secret but haines finished the remark  that you enrolled yourself among that rabble who call themselves the sons of liberty yes i know it and so do others  it seems i am of more importance than i fancied i never supposed anything i did could make any difference to the good people of portsmouth but i was mistaken  it concerns rightminded people anywhere when a boy who stands on the threshold of manhood makes a grievous mistake  that remains to be proven  and it will be speedily as you must learn to your cost if you really want a mill on the pascataqua i will show you how it can be built at once  i should like to learn the secret  abandon the evil companions you have chosen reveal such of their plots against his majestys officers as you are acquainted with and i guarantee that a sufficient sum of money to put up the buildings and purchase the machinery shall be loaned you within twentyfour hours  i am a fool not to have understood the drift of your conversation before it reached this point walter said hotly i had rather never own a mill than get it as you propose and as for evil companions i am proud to have been allowed to join them  you will soon regret it  so you have said before but since i have little faith in such predictions suppose you change the subject by explaining why you hold me prisoner and how long i am to be kept in this uncomfortable position  there is no reason why both questions should not be answered you are to remain in my custody till george messerve arrives in portsmouth in order that your friends may not intimidate him and it will be necessary to stay exactly as you are several hours longer  walter asked no more questions he understood it was the purpose of his captors to keep him out of sight that mccleary might believe his messenger had gotten through to boston in safety and in the meanwhile someone else would be sent to warn the newlyappointed distributor of stamped paper of somethingwalter could not divine whatwhich might be attempted against him  ten minutes passed in silence and then the voice of the halfbreed could be heard far away in the distance calling to his comrade  with an exclamation of impatience haines rose to his feet gave a careless glance at the rope which bound walter and then replied to the indian as he went quickly in the direction from which the hail had come  left alone walter looked around as if expecting to see some one who might aid him and then tugged and strained at his bonds trying to wrench free either hand or foot  the rope had been tied too securely to admit of his slipping a knot but it was nearly new and the prisoners heart beat fast as he realized that by exerting all his strength it would be possible to stretch it a trifle  if he could succeed in making his escape immediately all might yet be well but if he was forced to remain there until his captors returned there was little chance he would have another opportunity  regardless of the pain he writhed and twisted until beadlike drops of perspiration stood out on his forehead and at the instant when he was convinced all efforts were useless that portion of the rope which confined his wrists suddenly loosened sufficiently to enable him to withdraw one hand at the expense of no slight amount of skin from the knuckles  once he was thus far on the road to escape the remainder was comparatively simple  with the hand which was free he untied the knots and in less than five minutes from the time haines disappeared among the foliage he was at liberty  the only thought in his mind now was to take such a course as would best enable him to elude his pursuers and he knew full well that the halfbreed could track him where the white man would be wholly at a loss to find a trace of his movements  its hard to turn back but it must be done he said half to himself as he hesitated the merest fraction of time and then ran down the path in the same direction from which he had come  he had hardly started when the sound of horses hoofbeats caused his cheek to grow pale he had regained his liberty only to lose it  involuntarily he glanced backward and then a low cry of satisfaction burst from his lips  the horse coming down the path was riderless it was the animal haines had ridden and apparently much the better steed of the two  turning quickly walter ran toward the horse seized him by the bridle before he had time to wheel around and in another second was in the saddle  a short ridingwhip hung from the pommel and with this the fugitive struck the animal sharply as he forced him directly into the underbrush toward the south  fortunately walter was well acquainted with this section of the country having been over it  many times with his father and knew exactly which direction to take in order to gain that portion of the forest where it would be possible to ride at a reasonably rapid gait before venturing on the path again  his escape however was not to be as simple as at first seemed before he was twenty yards from the starting point a loud cry in the rear told that his departure had been discovered and this was followed almost immediately by the report of a pistol  if you dont do anything worse than shoot i shant come to much grief he said with a laugh master haines is not as wise a man as i have supposed him to be if he thinks it is possible to bring his game down by firing at random for he surely cant see me  walter failed to realize that his movements could be plainly heard even though he was hidden from view by the foliage and soon the sounds of pursuit reached his ear  there is no need of the indian while my horse is floundering among the bushes he muttered to himself haines has mounted the other animalwas probably on his back before i started and counts on riding me down he can do it too walter exclaimed in a louder tone once he is where i can serve as a target the chase will be brought to a speedy end  now he understood that if he hoped to escape he must return to the path where the horse would have an opportunity to show his speed and he wheeled him suddenly around regardless of the risk of coming directly upon haines  fortunately his pursuer was not as near as he had fancied and soon he was riding at the best possible pace over the narrow path he had emerged beyond the spot where the halfbreed was stationed and before him was nothing to jeopardize safety it only remained to distance the white man  two miles were traversed in a remarkably short space of time and then he was on that portion of the road which ran in a straight line through a sort of clearing that it was possible for his pursuer to see him during a certain time was shown as a bullet whistled within an inch of the fugitives head  that makes two shots my friend he said as if to keep up his courage unless i am mistaken you had only a couple of pistols and by the time they are reloaded i shall be screened by the bushes again  that his calculations were not correct was shown as a second ball passed uncomfortably close and a third tore through his coatsleeve causing the warm blood to gush down over his hand  only a scratch nothing more he shouted and then he was among the friendly shelter of the trees again  the horse upon which haines rode could not hold the pace and when half an hour had elapsed no sound of pursuit was heard  it was time walter gave the captured animal a breathing spell if he hoped to reach salem as he had calculated and he brought him to a standstill while he pulled off his coat to examine the wound on his arm  it was rather deeper than a scratch but yet nothing more serious than to cause a goodly show of blood and walter put on his coat again without a thought that any bandaging might be necessary  this done he rode on at a more leisurely pace but listening intently for any sound betokening the approach of his enemy  nothing occurred to cause him alarm and it was not yet sunset when he drew rein in front of william cottons store  that gentleman was in and disengaged as was seen when he came to the door for a view of the new arrival  what is it you walter neal  there is no doubt about it in my mind although my joints are so stiff from long riding that if i was less acquainted with myself i might believe i was only a portion of the saddle walter said laughingly as he dismounted and added in a graver tone i must speak with you alone friend cotton  i am alone now take your horse to the stable and come back at once  i will leave him where he is perhaps it will not be well for you to know anything about him and then hurriedly entering the store walter explained why he must reach boston without delay after which he gave a brief account of his misadventures  william cotton although a sympathizer with those who were about to offer resistance to the commands of his most gracious majesty was a prudent man and feared to be known as a disloyal citizen  the fact that samuel haines would probably soon arrive in search of his horse caused master cotton no little disquietude of mind and he said reprovingly  it is well to be zealous in a good cause walter but it is wrong to commit a crime in order to compass your own ends  what crime have i committed  the theft of the horse will be charged against you and those who are intrusted with the execution of the law do not favour such an association as that in which you have enlisted  my getting possession of him was the fortune of war not a theft i was a prisoner made so unlawfully and had the right to escape as best i could  that argument is good here but will be of little avail to those who look upon you as a disloyal youth who should be deprived of his liberty  if i am to be charged with horsestealing because of what has been done it cannot be avoided now before i am arrested i must carry the message with which i have been entrusted and to do so i need another horse i had believed i could get one from you without difficulty  so you can lad but at the same time you must not think hardly of me if i use proper precaution to save myself from being caught in the meshes of the law you know where my stable is take an animal from there without my permission and i cannot prevent it  i am to steal another horse in order that you may not get into trouble  it can make but little difference to you so long as you see master revere by daylight and i must not neglect my own interests no one has seen you and you may be able to get out of town secretly  walter could not afford to waste any more time in what seemed very like quibbling and without further parley he turned to act upon his friends suggestion  it is not well that you remain in boston any longer than may be absolutely necessary for your business the worthy master cotton called after him warningly there is that being done which you need not be identified with  walter made no reply but when he was out of the building on his way to the stable he muttered to himself  if i was as timorous as you master cotton i should now be in the company of sam haines with a rope tied tightly about me  five minutes later he was riding out of salem at full speed on the fleetest horse to be found in the stable and there was every reason for him to believe that he would in due season deliver the message with which he had been charged     chapter iii  in boston   the light of the coming day had not yet appeared in the eastern sky when the young messenger drew rein at the edge of charlestown harbour and sat in the saddle gazing curiously around as he speculated upon the chances of being ferried across to boston  it was well the journey was ended for the heaving flanks of master cottons horse told that he had been ridden so long at full speed as to be wellnigh exhausted  immediately on leaving salem walter had debated in his mind as to the choice of roads by making a long detour he could ride directly into the city of his destination but it would be at the expense of considerable time which he believed to be precious   on the other hand by traversing the shortest road he would as he now did find himself penniless with a broad stretch of water to be crossed before the message could be delivered  i shall get over in some way he had said as he arrived at a decision and now was come the time when that some way must be found  it is certain i shant be able to take the horse with me he said after a brief time of silence and i must look around for a place in which he can be hidden  by riding slowly along the shoreline he soon found a spot where the grass was luxuriant which was hidden i from view of those on the road by a heavy growth of trees and here he resolved master cottons horse should be left to take care of itself it was not probable the tired animal would stray very far from where food could be had in such abundance and walter made no other preparation for the halt than to secrete the saddle and bridle in the thicket  returning to the landingstage of the ferryboat he waited impatiently for some signs of life on the waterfront  during fully half an hour he was forced to remain in idleness while he mentally reproached himself for not having taken the longest road and thereby arrived in boston without being forced to depend upon a boat to conclude the journey  more than once was he tempted to take possession of one of the small craft hauled up on the shore without the formality of asking the owners permission but the thought that he had already put himself in a position to be charged with theft deterred him from such a lawless proceeding  then just as the day was beginning to break a boat filled with sailors rowed up to the landing all the occupants save one disembarked without paying any attention to the idle boy who was watching them intently and the little craft was being pushed off when walter cried  if you are going back to boston i will gladly work the oars to pay for my passage  can you row  as well as you  then come aboard and let me see how quickly you can pull to the other shore  the young messenger did not require a second invitation  he gave the boat a vigorous push with his foot as he clambered over the bow and the man in charge had no reason to complain of his skill at the oars  if you want work you should buy a boat and ply your trade as a waterman the sailor said when the short voyage had come to an end and walter leaped ashore impatient to conclude the mission with which he had been intrusted  i want work that will pay he said halting for an instant but i dont intend to find it as a boatman can you tell me where master paul revere lives  do you mean the lieutenanthim as has set up for a goldsmith  the very one  and you count on goin into a shop instead of pullin boats eh ill wager youre a sailor who has given his captain the slip  i have never been beyond the sight of land neither do i care to work in a shop but i have business which admits of no delay and if you will give me the information i shall be very grateful  do you know where north square is  i have never been in boston before  then inquire of the first one you see it is not far  walter waited to hear no more but ran swiftly on in the direction he supposed north square might lay and a kindly fortune guided his footsteps for when he had an opportunity to ask the desired question he was within a few paces of his destination  master reveres shop was not yet opened but the young messenger had little difficulty in arousing the household and a few moments later he was standing in a room which although not furnished with any pretension to elegance was more rich in ornamentation than walter had ever fancied could be found  master revere did not keep him waiting very long he had received too many visitors at unseemly hours to make any delay and the sun had but just risen when walters mission was accomplished  you have come in good time young sir master revere said when the boy had repeated the message  the ship on which the stamp distributor for the province of new hampshire sailed from london arrived last evening i will see him at once and before noon you shall take to your friends such information as i have to give in the meanwhile you will eat breakfast and then my eldest son shall act as host unless you prefer to sleep for you have been travelling all night  i can sleep later sir but now that i am in boston i would like to see the city  so you shall you will find much that is fair and comely to look upon but beneath all the air of bravery is the disquietude of oppression and the sense of wrongs yet to be wiped out  in the province from which i have come we believe the remedy for oppression to be among ourselves sir walter replied modestly  so it is lad and may you be one not lacking in wholesome love for your country when the time for action arrives  i fear a boy like me will be of but little service  the boys may be men before the time for stirring deeds shall come master revere said much as if speaking to himself and then he added quickly you will break your fast with me  walter was not accustomed to such a meal as was speedily placed before him but the novelty of his surroundings did not prevent him from doing full justice to the food  when the master of the house set out to perform the duty expected of him by his friends in portsmouth young john took charge of the guest and from that time until nearly noon walter feasted his eyes upon such wonders as he had never even dreamed about  his first visit was to the magnificent building presented to the city by peter faneuil and then to that elm at the head of essex street beneath the branches of which the association known as the sons of liberty had sprung into existence  here young revere told him what had occurred during the month of august when on the tree he was then gazing at had been found hanging an effigy of andrew oliver his majestys distributor of stamps for the province of massachusetts and a boot symbolical of lord bute with satan peeping out of it as he displayed a copy of the stamp act john also described the scenes when the more lawless members of the community destroyed the building which had been erected as the office for the sale of stamps and the dwelling of the lieutenant governor was sacked  does your father believe it is by such a course we can be relieved of oppression walter asked in surprise as john revere concluded his story with an account of the violence offered to several others of the kings officers  by no means he was among those who gave public expressions of regret that such deeds should have been done  then young revere told of the townmeeting which was held immediately following the scenes of violence and by the time he had concluded the boys were on north square again where master revere was ready to deliver the message walter was to take back to portsmouth i have seen master george messerve he said and believe he fully sympathizes with us he has already publicly resigned the office of stamp distributor and i doubt not will be found on our side when the decisive moment comes  walter understood that with the message given was an intimation for him to depart and although he could have done full justice to a dinner he took his leave without delay  there is no question but that master revere would have been more than willing to both feed the young messenger and provide him with sufficient funds to pay his passage across to charlestown in the ferryboat had he any idea that walter was penniless the boy made no explanations and his host could not but believe he was fully and properly prepared for the long journey before him  walter did not have as good fortune on his return as in the morning when he arrived at the shore he saw several boats going to and fro but the afternoon was considerably more than half spent before he succeeded in finding a boatman who would allow him to work his passage  then when he finally landed on the opposite shore an hour was spent in searching for the horse which had wandered into the woods and by the time the boy was ready to begin the return journey the sun hung low in the sky  it will be another nightride he muttered as he leaped into the saddle i did hope to reach salem early in the evening and so i might have done had i been possessed of enough money to pay my ferriage master revere would have given it to me but i could not tell him that i who had been received into the ranks of the sons of liberty had not so much as a shilling  he was comparatively fresh when he drew rein in front of master cottons stable shortly before midnight and although the time could well have been spent in slumber he devoted an hour to caring for the weary steed who had borne him so bravely  to awaken master cotton was not a portion of walters plan that gentleman had shown himself to be of such a timid nature that the young messenger believed he would pot be pleased at receiving any information therefore as soon as the horse had been cared for he started out of salem on foot intending to make himself a bed on the ground when he should be within shelter of the woods  as he walked rapidly on in the cool night air feeling refreshed because of the opportunity of stretching his legs after sitting in the saddle so long the desire for slumber fled from his eyes there was no reason why he should halt until he felt drowsy again and he continued on thinking alternately of what he had accomplished of the mill he hoped at some future time to see erected on the small tract of land bordering the pascataqua river which his father had bequeathed him and of the taxes to be paid by some means within twentyfour hours of his arrival  with so much to occupy his mind he forgot his weariness and the hours went by without his being aware of the passage of time  when he first realized how near he was to the starting point of his long journey a rosy light in the east told of the coming sun and he marveled that the night had gone so quickly  half an hour later as the knowledge of distance traversed brought with it weariness and he was about to seek a thicket where his slumbers would not be disturbed a noise as of some one approaching brought him to a full stop  in another instant he recognized the form of his friend stephen kidder in the distance and he ran toward him crying  what brings you here at this hour stephen  i left home at midnight to meet you  meet me it would have been easier to have waited i there until i arrived  it is to prevent your arrival that i have come and stephen had very much the appearance of a bearer of evil tidings  what is the matter why do you look so glum is my mother well  yes but sorrowing  tell me what has happened  your cattle and horses have been sold by the sheriff  how can that be it is not fortyeight hours since they were attached  that is true but yet they have been sold samuel haines is at the bottom of the mischief and he it was who bought them he is now declaring you shall be arrested for stealing his horse and master mccleary sent me to warn you not to come home until the matter can be arranged  not go home walter repeated like one bewildered where then shall i go  your mother bade me ask you why you did not visit the land on the pascataqua it is not likely you would be searched for there and i should be able to find you whenever it might be necessary  walter was silent a few moments as if trying to under stand all that had befallen him and then said slowly  haines would never dare to have me arrested he took me prisoner unlawfully and i had a right to make my escape if possible  that is very true yet because you are one of the sons of liberty master mccleary thinks an arrest will surely follow  is it not safe for me to see my mother a few moments  she herself told me to warn you against coming that halfbreed jim has been seen near the farm twice since yesterday noon and he can be there for no other purpose than to give notice of your arrival  but stephen i cant go up the pascataqua without some preparation i must at least have my musket and ammunition otherwise i would stand a good chance of starving to death  i have arranged for that portion of the business your knapsack well filled by your mother and everything you may need during a few weeks in the woods is hidden a couple of miles down the road i brought the things as far away from the farm as i thought necessary and then left them in the bushes     chapter iv  on the pascataqua   twentyfour hours after stephen kidder had warned walter neal against returning to portsmouth the latter was skirting the west bank of the pascataqua river within sight of the tract of land whereon he hoped to see at some day a gristmill owned by himself  when stephen selected such goods as he thought walter might need during his enforced retreat he did not neglect anything which would possibly be useful to the fugitive and the result was that when the young messenger started through the pathless forest his load was so heavy as to retard his progress very decidedly  therefore it was that on the following morning he had not yet arrived at his proposed destination although it was but a comparatively short distance from portsmouth  he had slept in the woods where night overtook him and at the first faint light of day was making a frugal breakfast of the bread and cheese sent by his mother  when the gloom of night had been dispersed by the heralds of the approaching sun walter was at that point on the river from which he could see the landmarks of his tract and the knowledge that he was about to enter on his own possessions served to cheer his drooping spirits  if it is necessary to skulk around here in the woods to avoid being seen by sam haines there is no reason why i should not make the most of my time he said to himself as hope began to spring up once more in his breast there is little chance i shall be able to raise any money for the mill now when i have been defrauded of a goodly portion of my poor possessions but i can at least make preparations for the day when i shall be in a position to carry out my plans it is better to work than remain idle  it was the first time since he took leave of his friend stephen that the mental burden had been lightened and now he pressed forward eagerly impatient to begin the work resolved upon  there was very much which he could do toward making ready for the erection of that wishedfor mill and he felt confident the labour would not be useless although performed so far in advance of the building operations  with this idea in mind his first care was to select the most advantageous spot for a mill and to this end he deposited his burden on the shore of the river where it could readily be found again after which he set about inspecting the property  he spent several hours in this work and had fully decided upon the location for the building when he was startled by hearing what sounded very like a human voice among the underbrush a short distance from the shore  with his gun held ready for instant use in case any danger threatened he went cautiously in the direction from which the noise appeared to have come and after a brief time threw aside the weapon with an exclamation of dismay  in a dense portion of the forest where were several aged trees partially decayed at their base he dimly saw the figure of a man apparently pinned to the ground by the heavy branches of a fallen hemlock  he was sufficiently versed in woodcraft to understand that the unfortunate had either felled a tree which had fallen upon him or passed beneath one of the giants of the forest at the precise moment when its rotten trunk gave way under the burden of the enormous top  a low moan from the sufferer told he was yet alive and at the same time proclaimed that relief must soon come if death was to be cheated of its prey  hold out a few minutes longer friend walter cried cheerily i must have an axe before i can do very much toward getting you free from that timber  there was no reply the poor wretchs strength was nearly exhausted and the boy understood that he must work with all possible speed if he would save a human life  it seems that my coming here may be of more use than simply hiding from sam haines he cried as he ran with all speed toward the spot where the goods had been left i have been grumbling because stephen brought an axe instead of a hatchet but now i should be able to do very little without it  ten minutes later he was chopping furiously at the imprisoning branches using due care to prevent additional injury to the helpless man and when so much of the foliage had been cut away as to give him a clear view of what was beneath he exclaimed in surprise  an indian what could have brought him so near the town  then he forgot the colour of the sufferer thought not of what his kind had done in the way of savage cruelty to helpless women and children but devoted all his strength and energies to releasing him  the wretch was so nearly dead as to be unable to render any assistance to his wouldbe rescuer and at least half an hour elapsed before walter could drag him from beneath the heavy weight which had so nearly deprived him of life  when this work was accomplished it seemed to have been in vain so far as saving life was concerned but fortunately walter did not cease his efforts dragging the apparently lifeless body to the river he applied such restoratives as were at hand and after a short time had the satisfaction of seeing the red man open his eyes  better not try he said as the indian attempted to speak you have had such a squeezing as would discourage a bear and it will take some time to get over it luckily i havent much of anything to do except take care of you and ill warrant we shall soon have you around as well as ever so far as i can make out no bones have been broken though i doubt if you could go through the same experience again and come out anywhere near whole  there was nothing more he could do to relieve the sufferer and after cautioning him to remain quiet walter set about putting up some kind of a shelter against the elements  a leanto of brush was soon erected and in one corner the boy made a bed of fir boughs upon which he placed the sufferer who after the first attempt made no effort to speak  walter divided with the indian his store of bread and cheese and had the satisfaction of seeing the latter eat heartily  i reckon youre all right if you can get away with as much food as a well person and its time i did something toward laying in a stock of provisions will you stay here while i go after game there are partridges enough even though deer should be shy  i wait the indian said with a sigh as of relief and the boy gun in hand plunged into the thicket  the result of this first hunting excursion was half a dozen plump birds and walter had seen such signs as told he would have but little difficulty in bagging a deer on the following morning  during the remainder of the day walter acted as nurse and cook but never once did the indian speak  next morning before the sun appeared he was out to replenish the larder returning with the hindquarters of a deer and when a plentiful supply of steaks from these had been broiled over the coals the indian ate like one in perfect health  youll do now i reckon it doesnt stand to reason that you feel like moving around very much therefore you shall stay here while i go to work  then he set about making the foundations for a mill that might never be completed and when it was so dark that he could no longer see to work he felt satisfied with the progress made  the indian had cooked supper and the boy showed that he appreciated the culinary efforts rude though they were  you know jim albert  this question was asked when an hour had been spent in almost perfect silence by the occupants of the leanto and the boy was startled both by the name and the voice  yes i know him walter replied grimly thinking of the part played in his capture by the halfbreed  big rascal  youre right i know it isnt just the thing to give way to revengeful thoughts but some day that scoundrel shall answer to me for what has been done if he and sam haines had remained where they belonged i wouldnt be here hiding as if i really was a thief  the indian did not continue the conversation although walter gave him every encouragement and at an early hour the tired boy sought the repose to be found in slumber  when he set out for work next morning the indian accompanied him and during the day laboured faithfully hewing trees or gathering rocks which were to form the foundation of the proposed mill  i didnt fancy having an indian for a companion at first but it begins to look as if finding him under that tree would be a fortunate thing for me we are getting this place into shape very fast and when it is possible for me to raise the money it wont be necessary to spend very much time making ready for the more serious portion of the work  during the week which followed with the exception of the sabbath the two laboured industriously save at such tittle as one or the other spent in hunting and walter could see the outlines of the structure he intended one day to build  a large pile of rocks had been rolled together to form the lower walls huge timbers were hewn and roughly squared for the framework and a road from the riverbank to the highway four miles distant was blazed a goodly portion of the way  during all this time while he had laboured as industriously as if it was some project of his own the indian remained comparatively silent he had told the rescuer his name was sewatis that he was a member of the penobscot tribe and acquainted with jim albert but never a word regarding the reason for being in that vicinity  there had been no scarcity of food the forest teemed with game and if the labourers fancied deer bear or birds it was only necessary to go a short distance from the encampment in order to get it  almost unconsciously walter had explained to his assistant what it was he hoped to do there had been many times when it seemed positively necessary he should speak with some one and to the silent indian the boy talked freely it was as if thinking aloud because no reply was made unless one was absolutely required and it is quite possible the young messenger would have been greatly surprised had some one been there to tell him he had confided more fully in sewatis than in any other person except his mother  more than once had walter suggested that there was no reason why the indian should remain if he had business elsewhere  i suppose you think because i pulled you from under that tree you must stay here and work but it is all a mistake you have already repaid me tenfold and i dont want you to believe there is any necessity of stopping with me  me wait sewatis would say whenever the conversation touched upon this subject and by the end of a week walter would have felt decidedly lonely without his silent companion  theres one thing about it the boy said once when the indian had refused to leave him while you are here i feel as if i could learn at any time how matters are at home it wouldnt be much of a task for you to go into portsmouth  sewatis made a gesture which signified that such a journey would be as nothing  i think you had better go and see my mother presently of course she wont be worrying about me for she knows i am able to take care of myself but at the same time it will give her some satisfaction to know what i am doing you could find my mother  sewatis nodded  and it wouldnt be too hard work for you to tell her what we have done  another nod and something very like a smile on the silent indians lips  if you dont open your mouth to her any oftener than you do to me you might stay on the farm a year without her knowing what we have been doing  i tell all make heap much talk  then well start you off about day after tomorrow how long would you want for the journey  go today back tomorrow  of course you understand it wouldnt do to say a word about me to jim albert or anyone whom he knows  jim albert rascali fix him  but you mustnt get into trouble while you are there sewatis or i shouldnt see you back again very soon the white men wouldnt allow any fighting in town and there is no reason why you should settle with jim albert on my account  i fix him sewatis repeated and walter began to fancy it might not be prudent to send the indian into the town however eager he was to learn what master mccleary had done in his behalf  he argued the matter for some time with his companion receiving only the same reply and then abandoned the attempt  it is certain sewatis wont tell many secrets whoever he may meet or whatever trouble he may get into therefore i need feel no anxiety on that score perhaps it will be as well to let him go and take the chances of his not meeting the halfbreed  the next day was the sabbath and the two remained in camp doing nothing save to prepare the meals  next morning walter set about hewing timber and sewatis was sent into the forest after game for the larder was not as well filled as it should be  the indian was absent the greater portion of the day and when he returned walter was half a mile from the camp up the river  whats the matter the boy asked as the indian approached suddenly looking disturbed  white man come down shore huntin for trail  walter dropped his axe in dismay he could think of but one reason why any person should seek him and that was to arrest him for stealing samuel hainess horse  they mustnt see me he muttered go back to the camp that they may think it is you who has been doing this work and i win strike off into the forest  sewatis handed walter the gun and silently turned to retrace his steps     chapter v  stephen kidder   walters first impulse was to bury himself in the depths of the forest and he had already started toward the denser portion when the thought occurred to him that he was reasonably safe in the vicinity of the camp where he would be able to learn when the newcomer retraced his steps  if it is a white man ill guarantee to keep out of his way and yet remain near enough to hear what may be said he muttered to himself as he halted suddenly and then moved cautiously toward the leanto  after ten minutes had elapsed he could distinguish the sound of voices and a few seconds later he was running at full speed toward the person from whom he had previously been trying to escape  he recognized the speakers tones and knew stephen kidder had come to pay a visit or bring the cheering news that he might return  am i to go back to town he cried as he came into the cleared space wherein the camp had been built and then seeing sewatis standing in a threatening attitude in front of the shanty he added this is a friend of mine make him welcome  the indian obeyed by moving quickly out of sight among the foliage and he had hardly disappeared when the two clasped each others hands in a caressing way as stephen said  i wish i had come to bid you go home but master mccleary says you must have patience yet a little longer haines still threatens to have you arrested and the sons of liberty are more obnoxious than ever in the eyes of those who pay homage to the king   would governor wentworth who has so often spoken in a friendly tone to me allow an act of injustice such as my arrest would be for i simply sought to escape from him who held me unlawfully  the members of the council are not in accord with the new ideas and master mccleary believes they might allow haines who has no slight influence among them to do as he desires  let it be so then when did you see my mother last  yesterday  and she is well  well and contented that you should be here she is cared for by your friends in town and prefers that you remain until the winter comes rather than venture back to be thrown into prison  you say she is cared for  master mccleary attends to it that she wants for nothing she is now with his mother the crops have been harvested and there is no longer reason why anyone should stay on the farm there have been brave doings in town since you left and unless the sons of liberty are all imprisoned it looks as if we might some day be freed from the heavy burden of taxes  tell me everything and walter threw himself on the ground in front of the camp looking positively happy now he had been assured his mother did not suffer because of his absence  in the first place the new hampshire gazette appeared with a heavy mourning border on the day before the stamp act was to go into effect and master mccleary read aloud to the people on the street the article calling upon those who would be free men to resist this most unjust tax if so many of the best citizens had not been abroad that night i believe the governor would have called the guards out but there were too many prominent men mingled with the throng to make such a proceeding safe or possible on the first day of november the church bells were tolled as if for a funeral and when a large crowd had gathered near samuel leavitts store a figure called the goddess of liberty was brought out on a bier with thomas pickering john jones jotham lewis and nehemiah yartridge acting as pallbearers  all the people on the streets myself among the number followed the procession to where a grave had been dug and when the image was about to be buried jotham lewis called out that he thought he perceived some signs of life in liberty with that the statue was carried back to master leavitts store and master mccleary addressed the assembled throng saying that if the goddess could be restored to health her sons were the ones to do it he was greeted with mighty cheers such as must have been heard even at the governors house and when the tumult had died away master george messerve declared that he did not intend to accept the office the king had bestowed upon him he then delivered his commission and instructions to the sons of liberty and next morning all who are known as belonging to that association marched around the town carrying the parchments like a banner on the point of a sword  master messerve then took his oath before justice claget that he would not attempt to issue stamps and the commission was given to the captain of the saucy mary who is sworn to deliver it up to the commissioners of the stamp office in london immediately upon his arrival in england you see matters have changed considerably since the day you started out to deliver a message to master revere  if i had only been there walter exclaimed when stephen ceased speaking from sheer lack of breath  you would not have seen much of the bravery i fear the sons of liberty could not attempt to prevent your being made a prisoner on the charge of stealing however well they understand the case or that would as master mccleary says be too much like trying to overthrow all law and order whereas they profess only to battle against injustice  what is injustice if not imprisoning me on such a charge  you understand what i mean walter haines does not think for a moment that you would be declared guilty but by making the arrest he can have revenge since you must lay in jail some time before being brought to trial  yes yes i understand it all but there are times when i feel bitterly the necessity of remaining in hiding as if i was in fact a criminal have you any more news  a messenger from boston told of effigies of certain persons being burned or hung on the gallows and from the reports i think it safe to say there has been quite as much excitement in that city over the stamp act as in portsmouth people who a few weeks ago denounced the sons of liberty as seditious persons now speak of them with respect saving as in the case of haines and his following master leavitt declares the time has arrived when the province of new hampshire shall rule herself and that unless the king shows a more friendly disposition he will lose his possessions in america but of course anything of that kind cannot happen  greater deeds have been done  but not by a few people against so mighty a king i am afraid we shall all be made to suffer because of what has already been done against his majestys commands  if the people can prevent the use of stamps they can do very much more but we wont talk of such matters now it is enough that i have with me a friend with whom i can speak and i must make the most of your company while you are here  then suppose you begin by telling me where you found the indian  walter gave his friend a detailed account of all that had happened since the two parted in the woods ten days previous and concluded by showing him what progress had been made toward the erection of the mill  stephen was astonished because of the amount of work which had been performed and said laughingly  indeed i begin to think samuel haines did you a favour when he made it necessary for you to hide in this place at the rate you have been labouring the mill will be in working order within a month  it would for a certainty if i had the necessary materials which can only be procured with money i truly believe sewatis and i could do very nearly the whole of the task  theres no question about it shall you try to frame the building  yes so far as to get the timbers hewn but we could not make shift to raise it without assistance and what lumber we have in shape will not be hurt by seasoning although i do not use it for two years now let me show you where i propose to locate the road in order best to accommodate those living this side of portsmouth  stephen was more interested in the progress of walters work than in the stirring events he had just been describing and the remainder of the day was spent by the two young men in discussing every detail connected with the proposed mill  shortly before nightfall sewatis returned to camp with a fine buck and prepared the evening meal after his own fashion which was certainly a fashion not to be despised  it was stephens intention to return to portsmouth on the following morning and the friends sat around the campfire until a late hour that evening walter had many messages to send to his mother and master mccleary and if the messenger remembered them all his memory must have been prodigious  finally the young men crept into the leanto where sewatis lay apparently sleeping and very shortly after they had stretched themselves out on the fragrant fir boughs their eyes were closed in slumber  then if a spectator had been in the vicinity would have been witnessed a singular scene  soon after the heavy breathing of the white men told that they were in the land of dreams sewatis rose to a sitting posture listened intently although nothing could be heard save the cries of the nightbirds and the usual sounds of a forest when the mantle of darkness has fallen  the indian lay down again but even as his head touched the fir he began to slip softly toward the fire until his body was outside the shelter of the leanto then he rolled over and over until the bushes hid him completely and no sound came to tell of his whereabouts  ten minutes after he disappeared a face peered from amid the foliage and the odour of rum might have been detected upon the air  the sleepers were suddenly awakened by a crashing amid the underbrush and as they leaped to their feet awake and on the alert in an instant walter cried  look out there dont shoot one of those is sewatis but who is he struggling with  at that moment the combatants rolled toward the fire in such a manner that the faces of both could be seen and stephen cried  its jim albert look out for yourself walter he has come here for mischief  and he seems to be getting about as much as he wants walter replied grimly as he darted forward to assist sewatis in case it should become necessary  the indian did not require aid for before either of the boys could have interfered he was uppermost clutching jim albert by the throat so vigorously that the latters tongue was protruding from his mouth  dont kill him dont kill him walter shouted  not yet big rascal sewatis muttered as he deftly tied his blanket around the upper portion of the prisoners body in such a manner that the intruder was helpless to do anything save kick and that was not a pleasant form of exercise as he soon learned for the fire was so near that at the first attempt his toes were buried among the glowing coals  after that painful experience the prisoner remained quiet and in a few seconds sewatis had him trussed hand and foot like a chicken ready for roasting  me fix him heap big rascal the captor exclaimed lying down once more as unconcernedly as if nothing out of the usual course of events had transpired  what do you suppose this fellow came here for stephen asked as if unable to surmise the reason for jim alberts presence  he is in the pay of sam haines and tracked you most likely in order to discover my hidingplace  if that had been the case he would have been in portsmouth again by this time  a sudden thought came to walter and bending over the prisoner quickly he searched under his greasy belt  that is why he came the boy cried as he leaped to his feet holding a parchment in his hand the halfbreed had undertaken to arrest me and here is his warrant  not until stephen had examined the document carefully was he satisfied the statement was correct and then he said holding the parchment over the fire  we can dispose of this easily enough but what shall be done with jim is more than i can decide  before he could drop the document from his fingers sewatis leaped from his couch seized the warrant and went back to his slumbers saying as he did so  heap big rascal me keep talkinskin  we shall have to let the indian take care of jim and his belongings whether we want to or not walter said with a mournful smile the whole affair shows me however that i am not secure from sam haines even here in the woods he has found one messenger and can readily get another  now dont despair your red friend has some scheme in his head or im mistaken he has taken such good care of the fellow that we neednt worry about him and if i am to leave this place at daylight its time i got some sleep  stephen resumed his place on the bed and walter followed his example but not to rest  he had believed himself free from all pursuit while he remained in the forest and during the past hour had been shown how vain was that idea  the stillness of the night the soothing sounds of the foliage moved to and fro by the gentle wind soon lulled him to sleep despite his anxiety and when he next opened his eyes the sun was shining directly upon him through the leaves but neither sewatis nor the prisoner could be seen  walter leaped to his feet searched to and fro several moments in vain and then found a trail leading eastward across the river  sewatis had returned to his own tribe and with him had gone however unwillingly james albert and the warrant for the young messengers arrest     chapter vi  sewatis   stephen was naturally surprised when on being awakened he was informed of the departure of sewatis with the prisoner but he did not regard it as a matter of any very great importance save as it indicated that the disreputable halfbreed would not probably be seen in portsmouth again  most likely jim albert did some wrong to the members of sewatiss tribe and that is why the old fellow hung around here waiting for just such a chance as he finally got i dont see why we should trouble our heads about it  i am sorry sewatis has gone in addition to being of great assistance to me he was a companion and now i shall be entirely alone  in that way it has worked you an injury stephen replied carelessly but on the other hand you need not fear the halfbreed will hunt you down again in behalf of sam haines which is more than a fair offset  walter made no reply a sensation of utter loneliness such as he never before experienced had come over him and he would have been better pleased to know james albert was seeking an opportunity to arrest him providing that by such a change in the situation of affairs sewatis had remained  it was useless to give words to his troubles however and he did his best to appear contented lest stephen should carry to his mother the report that her son had lost courage  walter prepared the morning meal stephen did full justice to it and then made ready to take his departure  i will come again within a week or ten days what shall i bring  powder if you can buy it for me on credit  i fancy master mccleary will provide you with plenty  say to my mother that i suffer for nothing save the opportunity to see her she knows full well what other words i would speak if she were here  with a hearty clasp of the hands the two friends i separated stephen to make his way through the forest ten miles or more and walter to resume the labour which might prove useless  the wouldbe miller found it very difficult to continue at his task during that day more than once he almost decided to remain idle until word should come that he was at liberty to return home but then he remembered the goal he had set for himself and laboured more industriously than before  it was no longer possible now he was alone to move the larger logs and all he could do was to hew them into shape without an attempt to remove the timbers to the site of the mill  the days passed slowly and wearily the sabbath seemed to have in it three times the usual number of hours he indulged in hunting only when it became absolutely necessary he should have food for the supply of powder bid fair to be exhausted before the time set for stephens return  a week elapsed and the young exile grew more cheerful his friend must soon come as for sewatis walter did not believe he would ever see him again  at the close of the eighth day when the solitary supper had been cooked and eaten more as one performs an important duty than something to be enjoyed walter was lying on the bed of boughs dreaming of the time he could return home without fear of an unjust arrest when a shadow came between his eyes and the fire  springing up in alarm he seized the musket which stood where it could be reached handily and made ready to defend himself for it seemed certain sam haines or one of his emissaries had come to carry him to jail  sewatis stood before him  one would have said that the indian had been absent but a few moments and was wholly at a joss to understand the look of surprise on the boys face  i thought you were never coming back walter cried in a tone of most intense relief  come to see mill the indian replied as he seated himself and began to eat a deersteak which had been left near the fire  i am beginning to fear you will never see one of mine the boy said despondently i have been foolish enough to think i could borrow as much as would be needed while money is so scarce in this province  build mill next day sewatis said more indistinctly than usual because his mouth was full of meat  walter understood the indian to mean that he would continue the work on the morrow and was not particularly interested in the proposed labour for during the time he had been alone the possibility of ever getting a sufficient capital seemed an obstacle which could not be surmounted  what did you do with jim albert  big rascal jim gone castine never come back  castine eh well you took him far enough away at all events  heap rascal fetch heap money and sewatis drew from beneath his blanket a bag which on being opened proved to be filled with gold pieces hundred pound more jim worth alive  it was some time before walter could understand the indians meaning and then the thought came that he had heard some one say the halfbreed came to portsmouth from the penobscot river  do you mean that there was a price set on jims head he asked eagerly  hundred pound and sewatis held up the bag once more now build mill  but i have nothing to do with that walter cried as the indian pushed the money toward him  build mill  but i surely cant do it with your money you must understand that  why  because ityou know i couldnt  would from white man  that is different if master mccleary or master leavitt would lend it to me taking a mortgage to secure themselves  sewatis pushed his bag toward walter once more and when the latter shook his head as if to refuse the loan or gift which ever it might be called the indian rose to his feet pulling his blanket more closely around him  what is the matter where are you going  sewatis pointed toward the east and moved slowly away  come back walter cried entreatingly come back and help me as you did before  build mill and the indian touched the bag of money with his foot  do you mean that you wont stay unless i use that gold  sewatis nodded  suppose i did take it  the indian seated himself as if to show he would remain  it was fully an hour before walter spoke again and during that time he pondered over the matter in all its bearings it seemed much like taking an undue advantage of sewatis to use his money and yet there could be no question but that he was pained when it was refused  i dont know why the fact of his being an indian should prevent me from accepting the offer the boy said to himself i would be perfectly willing to receive a loan from master leavitt who has never shown half the friendship for me this red man has  sewatis watched him intently and finally pushed the bag nearer  yes i will take it walter said decidedly it is only to be loaned and until i can pay it back you shall have half the profits of the business  sewatis nodded in approbation  and you are to stay here with me  all time now i call injuns  walter was wholly at a loss to understand the meaning of this remark until sewatis rose to his feet uttering a cry that might well have been mistaken for a nightowl  in response to it half a dozen red men each carrying a burden came out from among the trees and depositing their heavy loads in the leanto seated themselves before the fire in silence  sewatis motioned for walter to look at that which had been brought and while the latter wonderingly obeyed he cut from the haunch of venison a sufficient number of steaks to serve as a hearty meal for the newcomers  the boys surprise may be imagined when he discovered that each of the packages was made up of furs and he understood that the value of the whole lot greatly exceeded the amount of money in the bag  big mill sewatis said in a tone of satisfaction and then he turned his attention to his followers leaving walter to speculate upon the good fortune which had come to him so unexpectedly  the indians remained in camp during that night and at daybreak after a breakfast of venison all save sewatis departed  never before had walter worked as he did on the day succeeding the indians return it was a perfect fever of industry superinduced by the knowledge that there was now nothing to prevent the consummation of his desires save that which could be done by hands  his companion appeared as before the coming of jim albert with a single exception and that was at the close of the fatiguing days work when he pointed to a slight elevation overlooking the site of the proposed mill and said quietly  sewatis build house there  so you shall and between the two of us i reckon we can run the business as it should be  two days more the boy and his friend worked during every moment of daylight and then came stephen kidder  master mccleary is just behind me he cried before walter could greet him  master mccleary why has he come is there more danger for me  you are free to go to portsmouth this day samuel haines has sailed for england and there is little chance he will ever return  before walter could realize the full bearing which hainess departure would have upon his own affairs andrew mccleary came into view  it is a brave spot my lad and you have done well to choose it master leavitt gives me great encouragement in regard to advancing the money but stipulates that he shall be made a partner in the enterprise you to pay him interest on the entire amount until your debt of onehalf is discharged  i shall not need his money for i already have a partner who neither demands interest nor a portion of the profits walter replied laughingly and then he told his now mystified friends of what sewatis had done  mccleary insisted upon taking the indian by the hand as he praised him but not a word either
