the talking oak  from the original in the collection of austin m purves esqure philadelphia     preface  the author has long been of opinion that many of the classical myths were capable of being rendered into very capital reading for children in the little volume here offered to the public he has worked up half a dozen of them with this end in view a great freedom of treatment was necessary to his plan but it will be observed by every one who attempts to render these legends malleable in his intellectual furnace that they are marvellously independent of all temporary modes and circumstances they remain essentially the same after changes that would affect the identity of almost anything else  he does not therefore plead guilty to a sacrilege in having sometimes shaped anew as his fancy dictated the forms that have been hallowed by an antiquity of two or three thousand years no epoch of time can claim a copyright in these immortal fables they seem never to have been made and certainly so long as man exists they can never perish but by their indestructibility itself they are legitimate subjects for every age to clothe with its own garniture of manners and sentiment and to imbue with its own morality in the present version they may have lost much of their classical aspect or at all events the author has not been careful to preserve it and have perhaps assumed a gothic or romantic guise  in performing this pleasant taskfor it has been really a task fit for hot weather and one of the most agreeable of a literary kind which he ever undertookthe author has not always thought it necessary to write downward in order to meet the comprehension of children he has generally suffered the theme to soar whenever such was its tendency and when he himself was buoyant enough to follow without an effort children possess an unestimated sensibility to whatever is deep or high in imagination or feeling so long as it is simple likewise it is only the artificial and the complex that bewilder them  lenox july 15 1851     contents   a wonder book for girls and boys   the gorgons head  the golden touch  the paradise of children  the three golden apples  the miraculous

quest of the golden fleece     a wonder book     the gorgons head   tanglewood porch  introductory to the gorgons head  beneath the porch of the countryseat called tanglewood one fine autumnal morning was assembled a merry party of little folks with a tall youth in the midst of them they had planned a nutting expedition and were impatiently waiting for the mists to roll up the hillslopes and for the sun to pour the warmth of the indian summer over the fields and pastures and into the nooks of the manycolored woods there was a prospect of as fine a day as ever gladdened the aspect of this beautiful and comfortable world as yet however the morning mist filled up the whole length and breadth of the valley above which on a gently sloping eminence the mansion stood  this body of white vapor extended to within less than a hundred yards of the house it completely hid everything beyond that distance except a few ruddy or yellow treetops which here and there emerged and were glorified by the early sunshine as was likewise the broad surface of the mist four or five miles off to the southward rose the summit of monument mountain and seemed to be floating on a cloud some fifteen miles farther away in the same direction appeared the loftier dome of taconic looking blue and indistinct and hardly so substantial as the vapory sea that almost rolled over it the nearer hills which bordered the valley were half submerged and were specked with little cloudwreaths all the way to their tops on the whole there was so much cloud and so little solid earth that it had the effect of a vision  the children abovementioned being as full of life as they could hold kept overflowing from the porch of tanglewood and scampering along the gravelwalk or rushing across the dewy herbage of the lawn i can hardly tell how many of these small people there were not less than nine or ten however nor more than a dozen of all sorts sizes and ages whether girls or boys they were brothers sisters and cousins together with a few of their young acquaintances who had been invited by mr and mrs pringle to spend some of this delightful weather with their own children at tanglewood i am afraid to tell you their names or even to give them any names which other children have ever been called by because to my certain knowledge authors sometimes get themselves into great trouble by accidentally giving the names of real persons to the characters in their books for this reason i mean to call them primrose periwinkle sweet fern dandelion blue eye clover huckleberry cowslip squashblossom milkweed plantain and buttercup although to be sure such titles might better suit a group of fairies than a company of earthly children  it is not to be supposed that these little folks were to be permitted by their careful fathers and mothers uncles aunts or grandparents to stray abroad into the woods and fields without the guardianship of some particularly grave and elderly person oh no indeed in the first sentence of my book you will recollect that i spoke of a tall youth standing in the midst of the children his nameand i shall let you know his real name because he considers it a great honor to have told the stories that are here to be printedhis name was eustace bright he was a student at williams college and had reached i think at this period the venerable age of eighteen years so that he felt quite like a grandfather towards periwinkle dandelion huckleberry squashblossom milkweed and the rest who were only half or a third as venerable as he a trouble in his eyesight such as many students think it necessary to have nowadays in order to prove their diligence at their books had kept him from college a week or two after the beginning of the term but for my part i have seldom met with a pair of eyes that looked as if they could see farther or better than those of eustace bright  this learned student was slender and rather pale as all yankee students are but yet of a healthy aspect and as light and active as if he had wings to his shoes by the by being much addicted to wading through streamlets and across meadows he had put on cowhide boots for the expedition he wore a linen blouse a cloth cap and a pair of green spectacles which he had assumed probably less for the preservation of his eyes than for the dignity that they imparted to his countenance in either case however he might as well have let them alone for huckleberry a mischievous little elf crept behind eustace as he sat on the steps of the porch snatched the spectacles from his nose and clapped them on her own and as the student forgot to take them back they fell off into the grass and lay there till the next spring  now eustace bright you must know had won great fame among the children as a narrator of wonderful stories and though he sometimes pretended to be annoyed when they teased him for more and more and always for more yet i really doubt whether he liked anything quite so well as to tell them you might have seen his eyes twinkle therefore when clover sweet fern cowslip buttercup and most of their playmates besought him to relate one of his stories while they were waiting for the mist to clear up  yes cousin eustace said primrose who was a bright girl of twelve with laughing eyes and a nose that turned up a little the morning is certainly the best time for the stories with which you so often tire out our patience we shall be in less danger of hurting your feelings by falling asleep at the most interesting pointsas little cowslip and i did last night  naughty primrose cried cowslip a child of six years old i did not fall asleep and i only shut my eyes so as to see a picture of what cousin eustace was telling about his stories are good to hear at night because we can dream about them asleep and good in the morning too because then we can dream about them awake so i hope he will tell us one this very minute  thank you my little cowslip said eustace certainly you shall have the best story i can think of if it were only for defending me so well from that naughty primrose but children i have already told you so many fairy tales that i doubt whether there is a single one which you have not heard at least twice over i am afraid you will fall asleep in reality if i repeat any of them again  no no no cried blue eye periwinkle plantain and half a dozen others we like a story all the better for having heard it two or three times before  and it is a truth as regards children that a story seems often to deepen its mark in their interest not merely by two or three but by numberless repetitions but eustace bright in the exuberance of his resources scorned to avail himself of an advantage which an older storyteller would have been glad to grasp at  it would be a great pity said he if a man of my learning to say nothing of original fancy could not find a new story every day year in and year out for children such as you i will tell you one of the nursery tales that were made for the amusement of our great old grandmother the earth when she was a child in frock and pinafore there are a hundred such and it is a wonder to me that they have not long ago been put into picturebooks for little girls and boys but instead of that old graybearded grandsires pore over them in musty volumes of greek and puzzle themselves with trying to find out when and how and for what they were made  well well well well cousin eustace cried all the children at once talk no more about your stories but begin  sit down then every soul of you said eustace bright and be all as still as so many mice at the slightest interruption whether from great naughty primrose little dandelion or any other i shall bite the story short off between my teeth and swallow the untold part but in the first place do any of you know what a gorgon is  i do said primrose  then hold your tongue rejoined eustace who had rather she would have known nothing about the matter hold all your tongues and i shall tell you a sweet pretty story of a gorgons head  and so he did as you may begin to read on the next page working up his sophomorical erudition with a good deal of tact and incurring great obligations to professor anthon he nevertheless disregarded all classical authorities whenever the vagrant audacity of his imagination impelled him to do so   the gorgons head  perseus was the son of dana√´ who was the daughter of a king and when perseus was a very little boy some wicked people put his mother and himself into a chest and set them afloat upon the sea the wind blew freshly and drove the chest away from the shore and the uneasy billows tossed it up and down while dana√´ clasped her child closely to her bosom and dreaded that some big wave would dash its foamy crest over them both the chest sailed on however and neither sank nor was upset until when night was coming it floated so near an island that it got entangled in a fishermans nets and was drawn out high and dry upon the sand the island was called seriphus and it was reigned over by king polydectes who happened to be the fishermans brother  this fisherman i am glad to tell you was an exceedingly humane and upright man he showed great kindness to dana√´ and her little boy and continued to befriend them until perseus had grown to be a handsome youth very strong and active and skilful in the use of arms long before this time king polydectes had seen the two strangersthe mother and her childwho had come to his dominions in a floating chest as he was not good and kind like his brother the fisherman but extremely wicked he resolved to send perseus on a dangerous enterprise in which he would probably be killed and then to do some great mischief to dana√´ herself so this badhearted king spent a long while in considering what was the most dangerous thing that a young man could possibly undertake to perform at last having hit upon an enterprise that promised to turn out as fatally as he desired he sent for the youthful perseus  the young man came to the palace and found the king sitting upon his throne  perseus said king polydectes smiling craftily upon him you are grown up a fine young man you and your good mother have received a great deal of kindness from myself as well as from my worthy brother the fisherman and i suppose you would not be sorry to repay some of it  please your majesty answered perseus i would willingly risk my life to do so  well then continued the king still with a cunning smile on his lips i have a little adventure to propose to you and as you are a brave and enterprising youth you will doubtless look upon it as a great piece of good luck to have so rare an opportunity of distinguishing yourself you must know my good perseus i think of getting married to the beautiful princess hippodamia and it is customary on these occasions to make the bride a present of some farfetched and elegant curiosity i have been a little perplexed i must honestly confess where to obtain anything likely to please a princess of her exquisite taste but this morning i flatter myself i have thought of precisely the article  and can i assist your majesty in obtaining it cried perseus eagerly  you can if you are as brave a youth as i believe you to be replied king polydectes with the utmost graciousness of manner the bridal gift which i have set my heart on presenting to the beautiful hippodamia is the head of the gorgon medusa with the snaky locks and i depend on you my dear perseus to bring it to me so as i am anxious to settle affairs with the princess the sooner you go in quest of the gorgon the better i shall be pleased  i will set out tomorrow morning answered perseus  pray do so my gallant youth rejoined the king and perseus in cutting off the gorgons head be careful to make a clean stroke so as not to injure its appearance you must bring it home in the very best condition in order to suit the exquisite taste of the beautiful princess hippodamia  perseus left the palace but was scarcely out of hearing before polydectes burst into a laugh being greatly amused wicked king that he was to find how readily the young man fell into the snare the news quickly spread abroad that perseus had undertaken to cut off the head of medusa with the snaky locks everybody was rejoiced for most of the inhabitants of the island were as wicked as the king himself and would have liked nothing better than to see some enormous mischief happen to dana√´ and her son the only good man in this unfortunate island of seriphus appears to have been the fisherman as perseus walked along therefore the people pointed after him and made mouths and winked to one another and ridiculed him as loudly as they dared  ho ho cried they medusas snakes will sting him soundly  now there were three gorgons alive at that period and they were the most strange and terrible monsters that had ever been since the world was made or that have been seen in after days or that are likely to be seen in all time to come i hardly know what sort of creature or hobgoblin to call them they were three sisters and seem to have borne some distant resemblance to women but were really a very frightful and mischievous species of dragon it is indeed difficult to imagine what hideous beings these three sisters were why instead of locks of hair if you can believe me they had each of them a hundred enormous snakes growing on their heads all alive twisting wriggling curling and thrusting out their venomous tongues with forked stings at the end the teeth of the gorgons were terribly long tusks their hands were made of brass and their bodies were all over scales which if not iron were something as hard and impenetrable they had wings too and exceedingly splendid ones i can assure you for every feather in them was pure bright glittering burnished gold and they looked very dazzlingly no doubt when the gorgons were flying about in the sunshine  but when people happened to catch a glimpse of their glittering brightness aloft in the air they seldom stopped to gaze but ran and hid themselves as speedily as they could you will think perhaps that they were afraid of being stung by the serpents that served the gorgons instead of hairor of having their heads bitten off by their ugly tusksor of being torn all to pieces by their brazen claws well to be sure these were some of the dangers but by no means the greatest nor the most difficult to avoid for the worst thing about these abominable gorgons was that if once a poor mortal fixed his eyes full upon one of their faces he was certain that very instant to be changed from warm flesh and blood into cold and lifeless stone  thus as you will easily perceive it was a very dangerous adventure that the wicked king polydectes had contrived for this innocent young man perseus himself when he had thought over the matter could not help seeing that he had very little chance of coming safely through it and that he was far more likely to become a stone image than to bring back the head of medusa with the snaky locks for not to speak of other difficulties there was one which it would have puzzled an older man than perseus to get over not only must he fight with and slay this goldenwinged ironscaled longtusked brazenclawed snakyhaired monster but he must do it with his eyes shut or at least without so much as a glance at the enemy with whom he was contending else while his arm was lifted to strike he would stiffen into stone and stand with that uplifted arm for centuries until time and the wind and weather should crumble him quite away this would be a very sad thing to befall a young man who wanted to perform a great many brave deeds and to enjoy a great deal of happiness in this bright and beautiful world  so disconsolate did these thoughts make him that perseus could not bear to tell his mother what he had undertaken to do he therefore took his shield girded on his sword and crossed over from the island to the mainland where he sat down in a solitary place and hardly refrained from shedding tears  but while he was in this sorrowful mood he heard a voice close beside him  perseus said the voice why are you sad  he lifted his head from his hands in which he had hidden it and behold all alone as perseus had supposed himself to be there was a stranger in the solitary place it was a brisk intelligent and remarkably shrewdlooking young man with a cloak over his shoulders an odd sort of cap on his head a strangely twisted staff in his hand and a short and very crooked sword hanging by his side he was exceedingly light and active in his figure like a person much accustomed to gymnastic exercises and well able to leap or run above all the stranger had such a cheerful knowing and helpful aspect though it was certainly a little mischievous into the bargain that perseus could not help feeling his spirits grow livelier as he gazed at him besides being really a courageous youth he felt greatly ashamed that anybody should have found him with tears in his eyes like a timid little schoolboy when after all there might be no occasion for despair so perseus wiped his eyes and answered the stranger pretty briskly putting on as brave a look as he could  i am not so very sad said he only thoughtful about an adventure that i have undertaken  oho answered the stranger well tell me all about it and possibly i may be of service to you i have helped a good many young men through adventures that looked difficult enough beforehand perhaps you may have heard of me i have more names than one but the name of quicksilver suits me as well as any other tell me what the trouble is and we will talk the matter over and see what can be done  the strangers words and manner put perseus into quite a different mood from his former one he resolved to tell quicksilver all his difficulties since he could not easily be worse off than he already was and very possibly his new friend might give him some advice that would turn out well in the end so he let the stranger know in few words precisely what the case washow that king polydectes wanted the head of medusa with the snaky locks as a bridal gift for the beautiful princess hippodamia and how that he had undertaken to get it for him but was afraid of being turned into stone  and that would be a great pity said quicksilver with his mischievous smile you would make a very handsome marble statue it is true and it would be a considerable number of centuries before you crumbled away but on the whole one would rather be a young man for a few years than a stone image for a great many  oh far rather exclaimed perseus with the tears again standing in his eyes and besides what would my dear mother do if her beloved son were turned into a stone  well well let us hope that the affair will not turn out so very badly replied quicksilver in an encouraging tone i am the very person to help you if anybody can my sister and myself will do our utmost to bring you safe through the adventure ugly as it now looks  your sister repeated perseus  yes my sister said the stranger she is very wise i promise you and as for myself i generally have all my wits about me such as they are if you show yourself bold and cautious and follow our advice you need not fear being a stone image yet awhile but first of all you must polish your shield till you can see your face in it as distinctly as in a mirror  this seemed to perseus rather an odd beginning of the adventure for he thought it of far more consequence that the shield should be strong enough to defend him from the gorgons brazen claws than that it should be bright enough to show him the reflection of his face however concluding that quicksilver knew better than himself he immediately set to work and scrubbed the shield with so much diligence and goodwill that it very quickly shone like the moon at harvesttime quicksilver looked at it with a smile and nodded his approbation then taking off his own short and crooked sword he girded it about perseus instead of the one which he had before worn  no sword but mine will answer your purpose observed he the blade has a most excellent temper and will cut through iron and brass as easily as through the slenderest twig and now we will set out the next thing is to find the three gray women who will tell us where to find the nymphs  the three gray women cried perseus to whom this seemed only a new difficulty in the path of his adventure pray who may the three gray women be i never heard of them before  they are three very strange old ladies said quicksilver laughing they have but one eye among them and only one tooth moreover you must find them out by starlight or in the dusk of the evening for they never show themselves by the light either of the sun or moon  but said perseus why should i waste my time with these three gray women would it not be better to set out at once in search of the terrible gorgons  no no answered his friend there are other things to be done before you can find your way to the gorgons there is nothing for it but to hunt up these old ladies and when we meet with them you may be sure that the gorgons are not a great way off come let us be stirring  perseus by this time felt so much confidence in his companions sagacity that he made no more objections and professed himself ready to begin the adventure immediately they accordingly set out and walked at a pretty brisk pace so brisk indeed that perseus found it rather difficult to keep up with his nimble friend quicksilver to say the truth he had a singular idea that quicksilver was furnished with a pair of winged shoes which of course helped him along marvellously and then too when perseus looked sideways at him out of the corner of his eye he seemed to see wings on the side of his head although if he turned a full gaze there were no such things to be perceived but only an odd kind of cap but at all events the twisted staff was evidently a great convenience to quicksilver and enabled him to proceed so fast that perseus though a remarkably active young man began to be out of breath  here cried quicksilver at lastfor he knew well enough rogue that he was how hard perseus found it to keep pace with himtake you the staff for you need it a great deal more than i are there no better walkers than yourself in the island of seriphus  i could walk pretty well said perseus glancing slyly at his companions feet if i had only a pair of winged shoes  we must see about getting you a pair answered quicksilver  but the staff helped perseus along so bravely that he no longer felt the slightest weariness in fact the stick seemed to be alive in his hand and to lend some of its life to perseus he and quicksilver now walked onward at their ease talking very sociably together and quicksilver told so many pleasant stories about his former adventures and how well his wits had served him on various occasions that perseus began to think him a very wonderful person he evidently knew the world and nobody is so charming to a young man as a friend who has that kind of knowledge perseus listened the more eagerly in the hope of brightening his own wits by what he heard  at last he happened to recollect that quicksilver had spoken of a sister who was to lend her assistance in the adventure which they were now bound upon  where is she he inquired shall we not meet her soon  all at the proper time said his companion but this sister of mine you must understand is quite a different sort of character from myself she is very grave and prudent seldom smiles never laughs and makes it a rule not to utter a word unless she has something particularly profound to say neither will she listen to any but the wisest conversation  dear me ejaculated perseus i shall be afraid to say a syllable  she is a very accomplished person i assure you continued quicksilver and has all the arts and sciences at her fingers ends in short she is so immoderately wise that many people call her wisdom personified but to tell you the truth she has hardly vivacity enough for my taste and i think you would scarcely find her so pleasant a travelling companion as myself she has her good points nevertheless and you will find the benefit of them in your encounter with the gorgons  by this time it had grown quite dusk they were now come to a very wild and desert place overgrown with shaggy bushes and so silent and solitary that nobody seemed ever to have dwelt or journeyed there all was waste and desolate in the gray twilight which grew every moment more obscure perseus looked about him rather disconsolately and asked quicksilver whether they had a great deal farther to go  hist hist whispered his companion make no noise this is just the time and place to meet the three gray women be careful that they do not see you before you see them for though they have but a single eye among the three it is as sharpsighted as half a dozen common eyes  but what must i do asked perseus when we meet them  quicksilver explained to perseus how the three gray women managed with their one eye they were in the habit it seems of changing it from one to another as if it had been a pair of spectacles orwhich would have suited them bettera quizzingglass when one of the three had kept the eye a certain time she took it out of the socket and passed it to one of her sisters whose turn it might happen to be and who immediately clapped it into her own head and enjoyed a peep at the visible world thus it will easily be understood that only one of the three gray women could see while the other two were in utter darkness and moreover at the instant when the eye was passing from hand to hand neither of the poor old ladies was able to see a wink i have heard of a great many strange things in my day and have witnessed not a few but none it seems to me that can compare with the oddity of these three gray women all peeping through a single eye  so thought perseus likewise and was so astonished that he almost fancied his companion was joking with him and that there were no such old women in the world  you will soon find whether i tell the truth or no observed quicksilver hark hush hist hist there they come now  perseus looked earnestly through the dusk of the evening and there sure enough at no great distance off he descried the three gray women the light being so faint he could not well make out what sort of figures they were only he discovered that they had long gray hair and as they came nearer he saw that two of them had but the empty socket of an eye in the middle of their foreheads but in the middle of the third sisters forehead there was a very large bright and piercing eye which sparkled like a great diamond in a ring and so penetrating did it seem to be that perseus could not help thinking it must possess the gift of seeing in the darkest midnight just as perfectly as at noonday the sight of three persons eyes was melted and collected into that single one  thus the three old dames got along about as comfortably upon the whole as if they could all see at once she who chanced to have the eye in her forehead led the other two by the hands peeping sharply about her all the while insomuch that perseus dreaded lest she should see right through the thick clump of bushes behind which he and quicksilver had hidden themselves my stars it was positively terrible to be within reach of so very sharp an eye  but before they reached the clump of bushes one of the three gray women spoke  sister sister scarecrow cried she you have had the eye long enough it is my turn now  let me keep it a moment longer sister nightmare answered scarecrow i thought i had a glimpse of something behind that thick bush  well and what of that retorted nightmare peevishly cant i see into a thick bush as easily as yourself the eye is mine as well as yours and i know the use of it as well as you or may be a little better i insist upon taking a peep immediately  but here the third sister whose name was shakejoint began to complain and said that it was her turn to have the eye and that scarecrow and nightmare wanted to keep it all to themselves to end the dispute old dame scarecrow took the eye out of her forehead and held it forth in her hand  take it one of you cried she and quit this foolish quarrelling for my part i shall be glad of a little thick darkness take it quickly however or i must clap it into my own head again  accordingly both nightmare and shakejoint put out their hands groping eagerly to snatch the eye out of the hand of scarecrow but being both alike blind they could not easily find where scarecrows hand was and scarecrow being now just as much in the dark as shakejoint and nightmare could not at once meet either of their hands in order to put the eye into it thus as you will see with half an eye my wise little auditors these good old dames had fallen into a strange perplexity for though the eye shone and glistened like a star as scarecrow held it out yet the gray women caught not the least glimpse of its light and were all three in utter darkness from too impatient a desire to see  quicksilver was so much tickled at beholding shakejoint and nightmare both groping for the eye and each finding fault with scarecrow and one another that he could scarcely help laughing aloud  now is your time he whispered to perseus quick quick before they can clap the eye into either of their heads rush out upon the old ladies and snatch it from scarecrows hand  in an instant while the three gray women were still scolding each other perseus leaped from behind the clump of bushes and made himself master of the prize the marvellous eye as he held it in his hand shone very brightly and seemed to look up into his face with a knowing air and an expression as if it would have winked had it been provided with a pair of eyelids for that purpose but the gray women knew nothing of what had happened and each supposing that one of her sisters was in possession of the eye they began their quarrel anew at last as perseus did not wish to put these respectable dames to greater inconvenience than was really necessary he thought it right to explain the matter  my good ladies said he pray do not be angry with one another if anybody is in fault it is myself for i have the honor to hold your very brilliant and excellent eye in my own hand  you you have our eye and who are you screamed the three gray women all in a breath for they were terribly frightened of course at hearing a strange voice and discovering that their eyesight had got into the hands of they could not guess whom oh what shall we do sisters what shall we do we are all in the dark give us our eye give us our one precious solitary eye you have two of your own give us our eye  tell them whispered quicksilver to perseus that they shall have back the eye as soon as they direct you where to find the nymphs who have the flying slippers the magic wallet and the helmet of darkness  my dear good admirable old ladies said perseus addressing the gray women there is no occasion for putting yourselves into such a fright i am by no means a bad young man you shall have back your eye safe and sound and as bright as ever the moment you tell me where to find the nymphs  the nymphs goodness me sisters what nymphs does he mean screamed scarecrow there are a great many nymphs people say some that go a hunting in the woods and some that live inside of trees and some that have a comfortable home in fountains of water we know nothing at all about them we are three unfortunate old souls that go wandering about in the dusk and never had but one eye amongst us and that one you have stolen away oh give it back good strangerwhoever you are give it back  all this while the three gray women were groping with their outstretched hands and trying their utmost to get hold of perseus but he took good care to keep out of their reach  my respectable dames said hefor his mother had taught him always to use the greatest civilityi hold your eye fast in my hand and shall keep it safely for you until you please to tell me where to find these nymphs the nymphs i mean who keep the enchanted wallet the flying slippers and the what is itthe helmet of invisibility  mercy on us sisters what is the young man talking about exclaimed scarecrow nightmare and shakejoint one to another with great appearance of astonishment a pair of flying slippers quoth he his heels would quickly fly higher than his head if he were silly enough to put them on and a helmet of invisibility how could a helmet make him invisible unless it were big enough for him to hide under it and an enchanted wallet what sort of a contrivance may that be i wonder no no good stranger we can tell you nothing of these marvellous things you have two eyes of your own and we have but a single one amongst us three you can find out such wonders better than three blind old creatures like us  perseus hearing them talk in this way began really to think that the gray women knew nothing of the matter and as it grieved him to have put them to so much trouble he was just on the point of restoring their eye and asking pardon for his rudeness in snatching it away but quicksilver caught his hand  dont let them make a fool of you said he these three gray women are the only persons in the world that can tell you where to find the nymphs and unless you get that information you will never succeed in cutting off the head of medusa with the snaky locks keep fast hold of the eye and all will go well  as it turned out quicksilver was in the right there are but few things that people prize so much as they do their eyesight and the gray women valued their single eye as highly as if it had been half a dozen which was the number they ought to have had finding that there was no other way of recovering it they at last told perseus what he wanted to know no sooner had they done so than he immediately and with the utmost respect clapped the eye into the vacant socket in one of their foreheads thanked them for their kindness and bade them farewell before the young man was out of hearing however they had got into a new dispute because he happened to have given the eye to scarecrow who had already taken her turn of it when their trouble with perseus commenced  it is greatly to be feared that the three gray women were very much in the habit of disturbing their mutual harmony by bickerings of this sort which was the more pity as they could not conveniently do without one another and were evidently intended to be inseparable companions as a general rule i would advise all people whether sisters or brothers old or young who chance to have but one eye amongst them to cultivate forbearance and not all insist upon peeping through it at once  quicksilver and perseus in the mean time were making the best of their way in quest of the nymphs the old dames had given them such particular directions that they were not long in finding them out they proved to be very different persons from nightmare shakejoint and scarecrow for instead of being old they were young and beautiful and instead of one eye amongst the sisterhood each nymph had two exceedingly bright eyes of her own with which she looked very kindly at perseus they seemed to be acquainted with quicksilver and when he told them the adventure which perseus had undertaken they made no difficulty about giving him the valuable articles that were in their custody in the first place they brought out what appeared to be a small purse made of deer skin and curiously embroidered and bade him be sure and keep it safe this was the magic wallet the nymphs next produced a pair of shoes or slippers or sandals with a nice little pair of wings at the heel of each  put them on perseus said quicksilver you will find yourself as lightheeled as you can desire for the remainder of our journey  so perseus proceeded to put one of the slippers on while he laid the other on the ground by his side unexpectedly however this other slipper spread its wings fluttered up off the ground and would probably have flown away if quicksilver had not made a leap and luckily caught it in the air  be more careful said he as he gave it back to perseus it would frighten the birds up aloft if they should see a flying slipper amongst them  when perseus had got on both of these wonderful slippers he was altogether too buoyant to tread on earth making a step or two lo and behold upward he popped into the air high above the heads of quicksilver and the nymphs and found it very difficult to clamber down again winged slippers and all such highflying contrivances are seldom quite easy to manage until one grows a little accustomed to them quicksilver laughed at his companions involuntary activity and told him that he must not be in so desperate a hurry but must wait for the invisible helmet  the goodnatured nymphs had the helmet with its dark tuft of waving plumes all in readiness to put upon his head and now there happened about as wonderful an incident as anything that i have yet told you the instant before the helmet was put on there stood perseus a beautiful young man with golden ringlets and rosy cheeks the crooked sword by his side and the brightly polished shield upon his arma figure that seemed all made up of courage sprightliness and glorious light but when the helmet had descended over his white brow there was no longer any perseus to be seen nothing but empty air even the helmet that covered him with its invisibility had vanished  where are you perseus asked quicksilver  why here to be sure answered perseus very quietly although his voice seemed to come out of the transparent atmosphere just where i was a moment ago dont you see me  no indeed answered his friend you are hidden under the helmet but if i cannot see you neither can the gorgons follow me therefore and we will try your dexterity in using the winged slippers  with these words quicksilvers cap spread its wings as if his head were about to fly away from his shoulders but his whole figure rose lightly into the air and perseus followed by the time they had ascended a few hundred feet the young man began to feel what a delightful thing it was to leave the dull earth so far beneath him and to be able to flit about like a bird  it was now deep night perseus looked upward and saw the round bright silvery moon and thought that he should desire nothing better than to soar up thither and spend his life there then he looked downward again and saw the earth with its seas and lakes and the silver courses of its rivers and its snowy mountainpeaks and the breadth of its fields and the dark cluster of its woods and its cities of white marble and with the moonshine sleeping over the whole scene it was as beautiful as the moon or any star could be and among other objects he saw the island of seriphus where his dear mother was sometimes he and quicksilver approached a cloud that at a distance looked as if it were made of fleecy silver although when they plunged into it they found themselves chilled and moistened with gray mist so swift was their flight however that in an instant they emerged from the cloud into the moonlight again once a highsoaring eagle flew right against the invisible perseus the bravest sights were the meteors that gleamed suddenly out as if a bonfire had been kindled in the sky and made the moonshine pale for as much as a hundred miles around them  as the two companions flew onward perseus fancied that he could hear the rustle of a garment close by his side and it was on the side opposite to the one where he beheld quicksilver yet only quicksilver was visible  whose garment is this inquired perseus that keeps rustling close beside me in the breeze  oh it is my sisters answered quicksilver she is coming along with us as i told you she would we could do nothing without the help of my sister you have no idea how wise she is she has such eyes too why she can see you at this moment just as distinctly as if you were not invisible and ill venture to say she will be the first to discover the gorgons  by this time in their swift voyage through the air they had come within sight of the great ocean and were soon flying over it far beneath them the waves tossed themselves tumultuously in midsea or rolled a white surfline upon the long beaches or foamed against the rocky cliffs with a roar that was thunderous in the lower world although it became a gentle murmur like the voice of a baby half asleep before it reached the ears of perseus just then a voice spoke in the air close by him it seemed to be a womans voice and was melodious though not exactly what might be called sweet but grave and mild  perseus said the voice there are the gorgons  where exclaimed perseus i cannot see them  on the shore of that island beneath you replied the voice a pebble dropped from your hand would strike in the midst of them  i told you she would be the first to discover them said quicksilver to perseus and there they are  straight downward two or three thousand feet below him perseus perceived a small island with the sea breaking into white foam all around its rocky shore except on one side where there was a beach of snowy sand he descended towards it and looking earnestly at a cluster or heap of brightness at the foot of a precipice of black rocks behold there were the terrible gorgons they lay fast asleep soothed by the thunder of the sea for it required a tumult that would have deafened everybody else to lull such fierce creatures into slumber the moonlight glistened on their steely scales and on their golden wings which drooped idly over the sand their brazen claws horrible to look at were thrust out and clutched the wavebeaten fragments of rock while the sleeping gorgons dreamed of tearing some poor mortal all to pieces the snakes that served them instead of hair seemed likewise to be asleep although now and then one would writhe and lift its head and thrust out its forked tongue emitting a drowsy hiss and then let itself subside among its sister snakes  the gorgons were more like an awful gigantic kind of insectimmense goldenwinged beetles or dragonflies or things of that sortat once ugly and beautifulthan like anything else only that they were a thousand and a million times as big and with all this there was something partly human about them too luckily for perseus their faces were completely hidden from him by the posture in which they lay for had he but looked one instant at them he would have fallen heavily out of the air an image of senseless stone  now whispered quicksilver as he hovered by the side of perseusnow is your time to do the deed be quick or if one of the gorgons should awake you are too late  which shall i strike at asked perseus drawing his sword and descending a little lower they all three look alike all three have snaky locks which of the three is medusa  it must be understood that medusa was the only one of these dragonmonsters whose head perseus could possibly cut off as for the other two let him have the sharpest sword that ever was forged and he might have hacked away by the hour together without doing them the least harm  be cautious said the calm voice which had before spoken to him one of the gorgons is stirring in her sleep and is just about to turn over that is medusa do not look at her the sight would turn you to stone look at the reflection of her face and figure in the bright mirror of your shield  perseus now understood quicksilvers motive for so earnestly exhorting him to polish his shield in its surface he could safely look at the reflection of the gorgons face and there it wasthat terrible countenancemirrored in the brightness of the shield with the moonlight falling over it and displaying all its horror the snakes whose venomous natures could not altogether sleep kept twisting themselves over the forehead it was the fiercest and most horrible face that ever was seen or imagined and yet with a strange fearful and savage kind of beauty in it the eyes were closed and the gorgon was still in a deep slumber but there was an unquiet expression disturbing her features as if the monster was troubled with an ugly dream she gnashed her white tusks and dug into the sand with her brazen claws  the snakes too seemed to feel medusas dream and to be made more restless by it they twined themselves into tumultuous knots writhed fiercely and uplifted a hundred hissing heads without opening their eyes  now now whispered quicksilver who was growing impatient make a dash at the monster  but be calm said the grave melodious voice at the young mans side look in your shield as you fly downward and take care that you do not miss your first stroke  perseus flew cautiously downward still keeping his eyes on medusas face as reflected in his shield the nearer he came the more terrible did the snaky visage and metallic body of the monster grow at last when he found himself hovering over her within arms length perseus uplifted his sword while at the same instant each separate snake upon the gorgons head stretched threateningly upward and medusa unclosed her eyes but she awoke too late the sword was sharp the stroke fell like a lightningflash and the head of the wicked medusa tumbled from her body  admirably done cried quicksilver make haste and clap the head into your magic wallet  to the astonishment of perseus the small embroidered wallet which he had hung about his neck and which had hitherto been no bigger than a purse grew all at once large enough to contain medusas head as quick as thought he snatched it up with the snakes still writhing upon it and thrust it in  your task is done said the calm voice now fly for the other gorgons will do their utmost to take vengeance for medusas death  it was indeed necessary to take flight for perseus had not done the deed so quietly but that the clash of his sword and the hissing of the snakes and the thump of medusas head as it tumbled upon the seabeaten sand awoke the other two monsters there they sat for an instant sleepily rubbing their eyes with their brazen fingers while all the snakes on their heads reared themselves on end with surprise and with venomous malice against they knew not what but when the gorgons saw the scaly carcass of medusa headless and her golden wings all ruffled and half spread out on the sand it was really awful to hear what yells and screeches they set up and then the snakes they sent forth a hundredfold hiss with one consent and medusas snakes answered them out of the magic wallet  no sooner were the gorgons broad awake than they hurtled upward into the air brandishing their brass talons gnashing their horrible tusks and flapping their huge wings so wildly that some of the golden feathers were shaken out and floated down upon the shore and there perhaps those very feathers lie scattered till this day up rose the gorgons as i tell you staring horribly about in hopes of turning somebody to stone had perseus looked them in the face or had he fallen into their clutches his poor mother would never have kissed her boy again but he took good care to turn his eyes another way and as he wore the helmet of invisibility the gorgons knew not in what direction to follow him nor did he fail to make the best use of the winged slippers by soaring upward a perpendicular mile or so at that height when the screams of those abominable creatures sounded faintly beneath him he made a straight course for the island of seriphus in order to carry medusas head to king polydectes  i have no time to tell you of several marvellous things that befell perseus on his way homeward such as his killing a hideous seamonster just as it was on the point of devouring a beautiful maiden nor how he changed an enormous giant into a mountain of stone merely by showing him the head of the gorgon if you doubt this latter story you may make a voyage to africa some day or other and see the very mountain which is still known by the ancient giants name  finally our brave perseus arrived at the island where he expected to see his dear mother but during his absence the wicked king had treated dana√´ so very ill that she was compelled to make her escape and had taken refuge in a temple where some good old priests were extremely kind to her these praiseworthy priests and the kindhearted fisherman who had first shown hospitality to dana√´ and little perseus when he found them afloat in the chest seem to have been the only persons on the island who cared about doing right all the rest of the people as well as king polydectes himself were remarkably illbehaved and deserved no better destiny than that which was now to happen  not finding his mother at home perseus went straight to the palace and was immediately ushered into the presence of the king polydectes was by no means rejoiced to see him for he had felt almost certain in his own evil mind that the gorgons would have torn the poor young man to pieces and have eaten him up out of the way however seeing him safely returned he put the best face he could upon the matter and asked perseus how he had succeeded  have you performed your promise inquired he have you brought me the head of medusa with the snaky locks if not young man it will cost you dear for i must have a bridal present for the beautiful princess hippodamia and there is nothing else that she would admire so much  yes please your majesty answered perseus in a quiet way as if it were no very wonderful deed for such a young man as he to perform i have brought you the gorgons head snaky locks and all  indeed pray let me see it quoth king polydectes it must be a very curious spectacle if all that travellers tell about it be true  your majesty is in the right replied perseus it is really an object that will be pretty certain to fix the regards of all who look at it and if your majesty think fit i would suggest that a holiday be proclaimed and that all your majestys subjects be summoned to behold this wonderful curiosity few of them i imagine have seen a gorgons head before and perhaps never may again  the king well knew that his subjects were an idle set of reprobates and very fond of sightseeing as idle persons usually are so he took the young mans advice and sent out heralds and messengers in all directions to blow the trumpet at the streetcorners and in the marketplaces and wherever two roads met and summon everybody to court thither accordingly came a great multitude of goodfornothing vagabonds all of whom out of pure love of mischief would have been glad if perseus had met with some illhap in his encounter with the gorgons if there were any better people in the island as i really hope there may have been although the story tells nothing about any such they stayed quietly at home minding their business and taking care of their little children most of the inhabitants at all events ran as fast as they could to the palace and shoved and pushed and elbowed one another in their eagerness to get near a balcony on which perseus showed himself holding the embroidered wallet in his hand  on a platform within full view of the balcony sat the mighty king polydectes amid his evil counsellors and with his flattering courtiers in a semicircle round about him monarch counsellors courtiers and subjects all gazed eagerly towards perseus  show us the head show us the head shouted the people and there was a fierceness in their cry as if they would tear perseus to pieces unless he should satisfy them with what he had to show show us the head of medusa with the snaky locks  a feeling of sorrow and pity came over the youthful perseus  o king polydectes cried he and ye many people i am very loath to show you the gorgons head  ah the villain and coward yelled the people more fiercely than before he is making game of us he has no gorgons head show us the head if you have it or we will take your own head for a football  the evil counsellors whispered bad advice in the kings ear the courtiers murmured with one consent that perseus had shown disrespect to their royal lord and master and the great king polydectes himself waved his hand and ordered him with the stern deep voice of authority on his peril to produce the head  show me the gorgons head or i will cut off your own  and perseus sighed  this instant repeated polydectes or you die  behold it then cried perseus in a voice like the blast of a trumpet  and suddenly holding up the head not an eyelid had time to wink before the wicked king polydectes his evil counsellors and all his fierce subjects were no longer anything but the mere images of a monarch and his people they were all fixed forever in the look and attitude of that moment at the first glimpse of the terrible head of medusa they whitened into marble and perseus thrust the head back into his wallet and went to tell his dear mother that she need no longer be afraid of the wicked king polydectes   tanglewood porch  after the story  was not that a very fine story asked eustace  oh yes yes cried cowslip clapping her hands  and those funny old women with only one eye amongst them i never heard of anything so strange  as to their one tooth which they shifted about observed primrose there was nothing so very wonderful in that i suppose it was a false tooth but think of your turning mercury into quicksilver and talking about his sister you are too ridiculous  and was she not his sister asked eustace bright if i had thought of it sooner i would have described her as a maiden lady who kept a pet owl  well at any rate said primrose your story seems to have driven away the mist  and indeed while the tale was going forward the vapors had been quite exhaled from the landscape a scene was now disclosed which the spectators might almost fancy as having been created since they had last looked in the direction where it lay about half a mile distant in the lap of the valley now appeared a beautiful lake which reflected a perfect image of its own wooded banks and of the summits of the more distant hills it gleamed in glassy tranquillity without the trace of a winged breeze on any part of its bosom beyond its farther shore was monument mountain in a recumbent position stretching almost across the valley eustace bright compared it to a huge headless sphinx wrapped in a persian shawl and indeed so rich and diversified was the autumnal foliage of its woods that the simile of the shawl was by no means too highcolored for the reality in the lower ground between tanglewood and the lake the clumps of trees and borders of woodland were chiefly goldenleaved or dusky brown as having suffered more from frost than the foliage on the hillsides  over all this scene there was a genial sunshine intermingled with a slight haze which made it unspeakably soft and tender oh what a day of indian summer was it going to be the children snatched their baskets and set forth with hop skip and jump and all sorts of frisks and gambols while cousin eustace proved his fitness to preside over the party by outdoing all their antics and performing several new capers which none of them could ever hope to imitate behind went a good old dog whose name was ben he was one of the most respectable and kindhearted of quadrupeds and probably felt it to be his duty not to trust the children away from their parents without some better guardian than this featherbrained eustace bright     the golden touch   shadow brook  introductory to the golden touch  at noon our juvenile party assembled in a dell through the depths of which ran a little brook the dell was narrow and its steep sides from the margin of the stream upward were thickly set with trees chiefly walnuts and chestnuts among which grew a few oaks and maples in the summer time the shade of so many clustering branches meeting and intermingling across the rivulet was deep enough to produce a noontide twilight hence came the name of shadow brook but now ever since autumn had crept into this secluded place all the dark verdure was changed to gold so that it really kindled up the dell instead of shading it the bright yellow leaves even had it been a cloudy day would have seemed to keep the sunlight among them and enough of them had fallen to strew all the bed and margin of the brook with sunlight too thus the shady nook where summer had cooled herself was now the sunniest spot anywhere to be found  the little brook ran along over its pathway of gold here pausing to form a pool in which minnows were darting to and fro and then it hurried onward at a swifter pace as if in haste to reach the lake and forgetting to look whither it went it tumbled over the root of a tree which stretched quite across its current you would have laughed to hear how noisily it babbled about this accident and even after it had run onward the brook still kept talking to itself as if it were in a maze it was wondersmitten i suppose at finding its dark dell so illuminated and at hearing the prattle and merriment of so many children so it stole away as quickly as it could and hid itself in the lake  in the dell of shadow brook eustace bright and his little friends had eaten their dinner they had brought plenty of good things from tanglewood in their baskets and had spread them out on the stumps of trees and on mossy trunks and had feasted merrily and made a very nice dinner indeed after it was over nobody felt like stirring  we will rest ourselves here said several of the children while cousin eustace tells us another of his pretty stories  cousin eustace had a good right to be tired as well as the children for he had performed great feats on that memorable forenoon dandelion clover cowslip and buttercup were almost most persuaded that he had winged slippers like those which the nymphs gave perseus so often had the student shown himself at the tiptop of a nuttree when only a moment before he had been standing on the ground and then what showers of walnuts had he sent rattling down upon their heads for their busy little hands to gather into the baskets in short he had been as active as a squirrel or a monkey and now flinging himself down on the yellow leaves seemed inclined to take a little rest  but children have no mercy nor consideration for anybodys weariness and if you had but a single breath left they would ask you to spend it in telling them a story  cousin eustace said cowslip that was a very nice story of the gorgons head do you think you could tell us another as good  yes child said eustace pulling the brim of his cap over his eyes as if preparing for a nap i can tell you a dozen as good or better if i choose  o primrose and periwinkle do you hear what he says cried cowslip dancing with delight cousin eustace is going to tell us a dozen better stories than that about the gorgons head  i did not promise you even one you foolish little cowslip said eustace half pettishly however i suppose you must have it this is the consequence of having earned a reputation i wish i were a great deal duller than i am or that i had never shown half the bright qualities with which nature has endowed me and then i might have my nap out in peace and comfort  but cousin eustace as i think i have hinted before was as fond of telling his stories as the children of hearing them his mind was in a free and happy state and took delight in its own activity and scarcely required any external impulse to set it at work  how different is this spontaneous play of the intellect from the trained diligence of maturer years when toil has perhaps grown easy by long habit and the days work may have become essential to the days comfort although the rest of the matter has bubbled away this remark however is not meant for the children to hear  without further solicitation eustace bright proceeded to tell the following really splendid story it had come into his mind as he lay looking upward into the depths of a tree and observing how the touch of autumn had transmuted every one of its green leaves into what resembled the purest gold and this change which we have all of us witnessed is as wonderful as anything that eustace told about in the story of midas   the golden touch  once upon a time there lived a very rich man and a king besides whose name was midas and he had a little daughter whom nobody but myself ever heard of and whose name i either never knew or have entirely forgotten so because i love odd names for little girls i choose to call her marygold  this king midas was fonder of gold than of anything else in the world he valued his royal crown chiefly because it was composed of that precious metal if he loved anything better or half so well it was the one little maiden who played so merrily around her fathers footstool but the more midas loved his daughter the more did he desire and seek for wealth he thought foolish man that the best thing he could possibly do for this dear child would be to bequeath her the immensest pile of yellow glistening coin that had ever been heaped together since the world was made thus he gave all his thoughts and all his time to this one purpose if ever he happened to gaze for an instant at the goldtinted clouds of sunset he wished that they were real gold and that they could be squeezed safely into his strong box when little marygold ran to meet him with a bunch of buttercups and dandelions he used to say poh poh child if these flowers were as golden as they look they would be worth the plucking  and yet in his earlier days before he was so entirely possessed of this insane desire for riches king midas had shown a great taste for flowers he had planted a garden in which grew the biggest and beautifullest and sweetest roses that any mortal ever saw or smelt these roses were still growing in the garden as large as lovely and as fragrant as when midas used to pass whole hours in gazing at them and inhaling their perfume but now if he looked at them at all it was only to calculate how much the garden would be worth if each of the innumerable rosepetals were a thin plate of gold and though he once was fond of music in spite of an idle story about his ears which were said to resemble those of an ass the only music for poor midas now was the chink of one coin against another  at length as people always grow more and more foolish unless they take care to grow wiser and wiser midas had got to be so exceedingly unreasonable that he could scarcely bear to see or touch any object that was not gold he made it his custom therefore to pass a large portion of every day in a dark and dreary apartment under ground at the basement of his palace it was here that he kept his wealth to this dismal holefor it was little better than a dungeonmidas betook himself whenever he wanted to be particularly happy here after carefully locking the door he would take a bag of gold coin or a gold cup as big as a washbowl or a heavy golden bar or a peckmeasure of golddust and bring them from the obscure corners of the room into the one bright and narrow sunbeam that fell from the dungeonlike window he valued the sunbeam for no other reason but that his treasure would not shine without its help and then would he reckon over the coins in the bag toss up the bar and catch it as it came down sift the golddust through his fingers look at the funny image of his own face as reflected in the burnished circumference of the cup and whisper to himself o midas rich king midas what a happy man art thou but it was laughable to see how the image of his face kept grinning at him out of the polished surface of the cup it seemed to be aware of his foolish behavior and to have a naughty inclination to make fun of him  midas called himself a happy man but felt that he was not yet quite so happy as he might be the very tiptop of enjoyment would never be reached unless the whole world were to become his treasureroom and be filled with yellow metal which should be all his own  now i need hardly remind such wise little people as you are that in the old old times when king midas was alive a great many things came to pass which we should consider wonderful if they were to happen in our own day and country and on the other hand a great many things take place nowadays which seem not only wonderful to us but at which the people of old times would have stared their eyes out on the whole i regard our own times as the strangest of the two but however that may be i must go on with my story  midas was enjoying himself in his treasureroom one day as usual when he perceived a shadow fall over the heaps of gold and looking suddenly up what should he behold but the figure of a stranger standing in the bright and narrow sunbeam it was a young man with a cheerful and ruddy face whether it was that the imagination of king midas threw a yellow tinge over everything or whatever the cause might be he could not help fancying that the smile with which the stranger regarded him had a kind of golden radiance in it certainly although his figure intercepted the sunshine there was now a brighter gleam upon all the piledup treasures than before even the remotest corners had their share of it and were lighted up when the stranger smiled as with tips of flame and sparkles of fire  as midas knew that he had carefully turned the key in the lock and that no mortal strength could possibly break into his treasureroom he of course concluded that his visitor must be something more than mortal it is no matter about telling you who he was in those days when the earth was comparatively a new affair it was supposed to be often the resort of beings endowed with supernatural power and who used to interest themselves in the joys and sorrows of men women and children half playfully and half seriously midas had met such beings before now and was not sorry to meet one of them again the strangers aspect indeed was so goodhumored and kindly if not beneficent that it would have been unreasonable to suspect him of intending any mischief it was far more probable that he came to do midas a favor and what could that favor be unless to multiply his heaps of treasure  the stranger gazed about the room and when his lustrous smile had glistened upon all the golden objects that were there he turned again to midas  you are a wealthy man friend midas he observed i doubt whether any other four walls on earth contain so much gold as you have contrived to pile up in this room  i have done pretty wellpretty well answered midas in a discontented tone but after all it is but a trifle when you consider that it has taken me my whole life to get it together if one could live a thousand years he might have time to grow rich  what exclaimed the stranger then you are not satisfied  midas shook his head  and pray what would satisfy you asked the stranger merely for the curiosity of the thing i should be glad to know  midas paused and meditated he felt a presentiment that this stranger with such a golden lustre in his goodhumored smile had come hither with both the power and the purpose of gratifying his utmost wishes now therefore was the fortunate moment when he had but to speak and obtain whatever possible or seemingly impossible thing it might come into his head to ask so he thought and thought and thought and heaped up one golden mountain upon another in his imagination without being able to imagine them big enough at last a bright idea occurred to king midas it seemed really as bright as the glistening metal which he loved so much  raising his head he looked the lustrous stranger in the face  well midas observed his visitor i see that you have at length hit upon something that will satisfy you tell me your wish  it is only this replied midas i am weary of collecting my treasures with so much trouble and beholding the heap so diminutive after i have done my best i wish everything that i touch to be changed to gold  the strangers smile grew so very broad that it seemed to fill the room like an outburst of the sun gleaming into a shadowy dell where the yellow autumnal leavesfor so looked the lumps and particles of goldlie strewn in the glow of light  the golden touch exclaimed he you certainly deserve credit friend midas for striking out so brilliant a conception but are you quite sure that this will satisfy you  how could it fail said midas  and will you never regret the possession of it  what could induce me asked midas i ask nothing else to render me perfectly happy  be it as you wish then replied the stranger waving his hand in token of farewell tomorrow at sunrise you will find yourself gifted with the golden touch  the figure of the stranger then became exceedingly bright and midas involuntarily closed his eyes on opening them again he beheld only one yellow sunbeam in the room and all around him the glistening of the precious metal which he had spent his life in hoarding up  whether midas slept as usual that night the story does not say asleep or awake however his mind was probably in the state of a childs to whom a beautiful new plaything has been promised in the morning at any rate day had hardly peeped over the hills when king midas was broad awake and stretching his arms out of bed began to touch the objects that were within reach he was anxious to prove whether the golden touch had really come according to the strangers promise so he laid his finger on a chair by the bedside and on various other things but was grievously disappointed to perceive that they remained of exactly the same substance as before indeed he felt very much afraid that he had only dreamed about the lustrous stranger or else that the latter had been making game of him and what a miserable affair would it be if after all his hopes midas must content himself with what little gold he could scrape together by ordinary means instead of creating it by a touch  all this while it was only the gray of the morning with but a streak of brightness along the edge of the sky where midas could not see it he lay in a very disconsolate mood regretting the downfall of his hopes and kept growing sadder and sadder until the earliest sunbeam shone through the window and gilded the ceiling over his head it seemed to midas that this bright yellow sunbeam was reflected in rather a singular way on the white covering of the bed looking more closely what was his astonishment and delight when he found that this linen fabric had been transmuted to what seemed a woven texture of the purest and brightest gold the golden touch had come to him with the first sunbeam  midas started up in a kind of joyful frenzy and ran about the room grasping at everything that happened to be in his way he seized one of the bedposts and it became immediately a fluted golden pillar he pulled aside a windowcurtain in order to admit a clear spectacle of the wonders which he was performing and the tassel grew heavy in his handa mass of gold he took up a book from the table at his first touch it assumed the appearance of such a splendidly bound and giltedged volume as one often meets with nowadays but on running his fingers through the leaves behold it was a bundle of thin golden plates in which all the wisdom of the book had grown illegible he hurriedly put on his clothes and was enraptured to see himself in a magnificent suit of gold cloth which retained its flexibility and softness although it burdened him a little with its weight he drew out his handkerchief which little marygold had hemmed for him that was likewise gold with the dear childs neat and pretty stitches running all along the border in gold thread  somehow or other this last transformation did not quite please king midas he would rather that his little daughters handiwork should have remained just the same as when she climbed his knee and put it into his hand  but it was not worth while to vex himself about a trifle midas now took his spectacles from his pocket and put them on his nose in order that he might see more distinctly what he was about in those days spectacles for common people had not been invented but were already worn by kings else how could midas have had any to his great perplexity however excellent as the glasses were he discovered that he could not possibly see through them but this was the most natural thing in the world for on taking them off the transparent crystals turned out to be plates of yellow metal and of course were worthless as spectacles though valuable as gold it struck midas as rather inconvenient that with all his wealth he could never again be rich enough to own a pair of serviceable spectacles  it is no great matter nevertheless said he to himself very philosophically we cannot expect any great good without its being accompanied with some small inconvenience the golden touch is worth the sacrifice of a pair of spectacles at least if not of ones very eyesight my own eyes will serve for ordinary purposes and little marygold will soon be old enough to read to me  wise king midas was so exalted by his good fortune that the palace seemed not sufficiently spacious to contain him he therefore went down stairs and smiled on observing that the balustrade of the staircase became a bar of burnished gold as his hand passed over it in his descent he lifted the doorlatch it was brass only a moment ago but golden when his fingers quitted it and emerged into the garden here as it happened he found a great number of beautiful roses in full bloom and others in all the stages of lovely bud and blossom very delicious was their fragrance in the morning breeze their delicate blush was one of the fairest sights in the world so gentle so modest and so full of sweet tranquillity did these roses seem to be  but midas knew a way to make them far more precious according to his way of thinking than roses had ever been before so he took great pains in going from bush to bush and exercised his magic touch most indefatigably until every individual flower and bud and even the worms at the heart of some of them were changed to gold by the time this good work was completed king midas was summoned to breakfast and as the morning air had given him an excellent appetite he made haste back to the palace  what was usually a kings breakfast in the days of midas i really do not know and cannot stop now to investigate to the best of my belief however on this particular morning the breakfast consisted of hot cakes some nice little brook trout roasted potatoes fresh boiled eggs and coffee for king midas himself and a bowl of bread and milk for his daughter marygold at all events this is a breakfast fit to set before a king and whether he had it or not king midas could not have had a better  little marygold had not yet made her appearance her father ordered her to be called and seating himself at table awaited the childs coming in order to begin his own breakfast to do midas justice he really loved his daughter and loved her so much the more this morning on account of the good fortune which had befallen him it was not a great while before he heard her coming along the passageway crying bitterly this circumstance surprised him because marygold was one of the cheerfullest little people whom you would see in a summers day and hardly shed a thimbleful of tears in a twelvemonth when midas heard her sobs he determined to put little marygold into better spirits by an agreeable surprise so leaning across the table he touched his daughters bowl which was a china one with pretty figures all around it and transmuted it to gleaming gold  meanwhile marygold slowly and disconsolately opened the door and showed herself with her apron at her eyes still sobbing as if her heart would break  how now my little lady cried midas pray what is the matter with you this bright morning  marygold without taking the apron from her eyes held out her hand in which was one of the roses which midas had so recently transmuted  beautiful exclaimed her father and what is there in this magnificent golden rose to make you cry  ah dear father answered the child as well as her sobs would let her it is not beautiful but the ugliest flower that ever grew as soon as i was dressed i ran into the garden to gather some roses for you because i know you like them and like them the better when gathered by your little daughter but oh dear dear me what do you think has happened such a misfortune all the beautiful roses that smelled so sweetly and had so many lovely blushes are blighted and spoilt they are grown quite yellow as you see this one and have no longer any fragrance what can have been the matter with them  poh my dear little girlpray dont cry about it said midas who was ashamed to confess that he himself had wrought the change which so greatly afflicted her sit down and eat your bread and milk you will find it easy enough to exchange a golden rose like that which will last hundreds of years for an ordinary one which would wither in a day  i dont care for such roses as this cried marygold tossing it contemptuously away it has no smell and the hard petals prick my nose  the child now sat down to table but was so occupied with her grief for the blighted roses that she did not even notice the wonderful transmutation of her china bowl perhaps this was all the better for marygold was accustomed to take pleasure in looking at the queer figures and strange trees and houses that were painted on the circumference of the bowl and these ornaments were now entirely lost in the yellow hue of the metal  midas meanwhile had poured out a cup of coffee and as a matter of course the coffeepot whatever metal it may have been when he took it up was gold when he set it down he thought to himself that it was rather an extravagant style of splendor in a king of his simple habits to breakfast off a service of gold and began to be puzzled with the difficulty of keeping his treasures safe the cupboard and the kitchen would no longer be a secure place of deposit for articles so valuable as golden bowls and coffeepots  amid these thoughts he lifted a spoonful of coffee to his lips and sipping it was astonished to perceive that the instant his lips touched the liquid it became molten gold and the next moment hardened into a lump  ha exclaimed midas rather aghast  what is the matter father asked little marygold gazing at him with the tears still standing in her eyes  nothing child nothing said midas eat your milk before it gets quite cold  he took one of the nice little trouts on his plate and by way of experiment touched its tail with his finger to his horror it was immediately transmuted from an admirably fried brooktrout into a goldfish though not one of those goldfishes which people often keep in glass globes as ornaments for the parlor no but it was really a metallic fish and looked as if it had been very cunningly made by the nicest goldsmith in the world its little bones were now golden wires its fins and tail were thin plates of gold and there were the marks of the fork in it and all the delicate frothy appearance of a nicely fried fish exactly imitated in metal a very pretty piece of work as you may suppose only king midas just at that moment would much rather have had a real trout in his dish than this elaborate and valuable imitation of one  i dont quite see thought he to himself how i am to get any breakfast  he took one of the smokinghot cakes and had scarcely broken it when to his cruel mortification though a moment before it had been of the whitest wheat it assumed the yellow hue of indian meal to say the truth if it had really been a hot indian cake midas would have prized it a good deal more than he now did when its solidity and increased weight made him too bitterly sensible that it was gold almost in despair he helped himself to a boiled egg which immediately underwent a change similar to those of the trout and the cake the egg indeed might have been mistaken for one of those which the famous goose in the storybook was in the habit of laying but king midas was the only goose that had had anything to do with the matter  well this is a quandary thought he leaning back in his chair and looking quite enviously at little marygold who was now eating her bread and milk with great satisfaction such a costly breakfast before me and nothing that can be eaten  hoping that by dint of great dispatch he might avoid what he now felt to be a considerable inconvenience king midas next snatched a hot potato and attempted to cram it into his mouth and swallow it in a hurry but the golden touch was too nimble for him he found his mouth full not of mealy potato but of solid metal which so burnt his tongue that he roared aloud and jumping up from the table began to dance and stamp about the room both with pain and affright  father dear father cried little marygold who was a very affectionate child pray what is the matter have you burnt your mouth  ah dear child groaned midas dolefully i dont know what is to become of your poor father  and truly my dear little folks did you ever hear of such a pitiable case in all your lives here was literally the richest breakfast that could be set before a king and its very richness made it absolutely good for nothing the poorest laborer sitting down to his crust of bread and cup of water was far better off than king midas whose delicate food was really worth its weight in gold and what was to be done already at breakfast midas was excessively hungry would he be less so by dinnertime and how ravenous would be his appetite for supper which must undoubtedly consist of the same sort of indigestible dishes as those now before him how many days think you would he survive a continuance of this rich fare  these reflections so troubled wise king midas that he began to doubt whether after all riches are the one desirable thing in the world or even the most desirable but this was only a passing thought so fascinated was midas with the glitter of the yellow metal that he would still have refused to give up the golden touch for so paltry a consideration as a breakfast just imagine what a price for one meals victuals it would have been the same as paying millions and millions of money and as many millions more as would take forever to reckon up for some fried trout an egg a potato a hot cake and a cup of coffee  it would be quite too dear thought midas  nevertheless so great was his hunger and the perplexity of his situation that he again groaned aloud and very grievously too our pretty marygold could endure it no longer she sat a moment gazing at her father and trying with all the might of her little wits to find out what was the matter with him then with a sweet and sorrowful impulse to comfort him she started from her chair and running to midas threw her arms affectionately about his knees he bent down and kissed her he felt that his little daughters love was worth a thousand times more than he had gained by the golden touch  my precious precious marygold cried he  but marygold made no answer  alas what had he done how fatal was the gift which the stranger bestowed the moment the lips of midas touched marygolds forehead a change had taken place her sweet rosy face so full of affection as it had been assumed a glittering yellow color with yellow teardrops congealing on her cheeks her beautiful brown ringlets took the same tint her soft and tender little form grew hard and inflexible within her fathers encircling arms oh terrible misfortune the victim of his insatiable desire for wealth little marygold was a human child no longer but a golden statue  yes there she was with the questioning look of love grief and pity hardened into her face it was the prettiest and most woful sight that ever mortal saw all the features and tokens of marygold were there even the beloved little dimple remained in her golden chin but the more perfect was the resemblance the greater was the fathers agony at beholding this golden image which was all that was left him of a daughter it had been a favorite phrase of midas whenever he felt particularly fond of the child to say that she was worth her weight in gold and now the phrase had become literally true and now at last when it was too late he felt how infinitely a warm and tender heart that loved him exceeded in value all the wealth that could be piled up betwixt the earth and sky  it would be too sad a story if i were to tell you how midas in the fulness of all his gratified desires began to wring his hands and bemoan himself and how he could neither bear to look at marygold nor yet to look away from her except when his eyes were fixed on the image he could not possibly believe that she was changed to gold but stealing another glance there was the precious little figure with a yellow teardrop on its yellow cheek and a look so piteous and tender that it seemed as if that very expression must needs soften the gold and make it flesh again this however could not be so midas had only to wring his hands and to wish that he were the poorest man in the wide world if the loss of all his wealth might bring back the faintest rosecolor to his dear childs face  while he was in this tumult of despair he suddenly beheld a stranger standing near the door midas bent down his head without speaking for he recognized the same figure which had appeared to him the day before in the treasureroom and had bestowed on him this disastrous faculty of the golden touch the strangers countenance still wore a smile which seemed to shed a yellow lustre all about the room and gleamed on little marygolds image and on the other objects that had been transmuted by the touch of midas  well friend midas said the stranger pray how do you succeed with the golden touch  midas shook his head  i am very miserable said he  very miserable indeed exclaimed the stranger and how happens that have i not faithfully kept my promise with you have you not everything that your heart desired  gold is not everything answered midas and i have lost all that my heart really cared for  ah so you have made a discovery since yesterday observed the stranger let us see then which of these two things do you think is really worth the mostthe gift of the golden touch or one cup of clear cold water  o blessed water exclaimed midas it will never moisten my parched throat again  the golden touch continued the stranger or a crust of bread  a piece of bread answered midas is worth all the gold on earth  the golden touch asked the stranger or your own little marygold warm soft and loving as she was an hour ago  oh my child my dear child cried poor midas wringing his hands i would not have given that one small dimple in her chin for the power of changing this whole big earth into a solid lump of gold  you are wiser than you were king midas said the stranger looking seriously at him your own heart i perceive has not been entirely changed from flesh to gold were it so your case would indeed be desperate but you appear to be still capable of understanding that the commonest things such as lie within everybodys grasp are more valuable than the riches which so many mortals sigh and struggle after tell me now do you sincerely desire to rid yourself of this golden touch  it is hateful to me replied midas  a fly settled on his nose but immediately fell to the floor for it too had become gold midas shuddered  go then said the stranger and plunge into the river that glides past the bottom of your garden take likewise a vase of the same water and sprinkle it over any object that you may desire to change back again from gold into its former substance if you do this in earnestness and sincerity it may possibly repair the mischief which your avarice has occasioned  king midas bowed low and when he lifted his head the lustrous stranger had vanished  you will easily believe that midas lost no time in snatching up a great earthen pitcher but alas me it was no longer earthen after he touched it and hastening to the riverside as he scampered along and forced his way through the shrubbery it was positively marvellous to see how the foliage turned yellow behind him as if the autumn had been there and nowhere else on reaching the rivers brink he plunged headlong in without waiting so much as to pull off his shoes  poof poof poof snorted king midas as his head emerged out of the water well this is really a refreshing bath and i think it must have quite washed away the golden touch and now for filling my pitcher  as he dipped the pitcher into the water it gladdened his very heart to see it change from gold into the same good honest earthen vessel which it had been before he touched it he was conscious also of a change within himself a cold hard and heavy weight seemed to have gone out of his bosom no doubt his heart had been gradually losing its human substance and transmuting itself into insensible metal but had now softened back again into flesh perceiving a violet that grew on the bank of the river midas touched it with his finger and was overjoyed to find that the delicate flower retained its purple hue instead of undergoing a yellow blight the curse of the golden touch had therefore really been removed from him  king midas hastened back to the palace and i suppose the servants knew not what to make of it when they saw their royal master so carefully bringing home an earthen pitcher of water but that water which was to undo all the mischief that his folly had wrought was more precious to midas than an ocean of molten gold could have been the first thing he did as you need hardly be told was to sprinkle it by handfuls over the golden figure of little marygold  no sooner did it fall on her than you would have laughed to see how the rosy color came back to the dear childs cheek and how she began to sneeze and sputterand how astonished she was to find herself dripping wet and her father still throwing more water over her  pray do not dear father cried she see how you have wet my nice frock which i put on only this morning  for marygold did not know that she had been a little golden statue nor could she remember anything that had happened since the moment when she ran with outstretched arms to comfort poor king midas  her father did not think it necessary to tell his beloved child how very foolish he had been but contented himself with showing how much wiser he had now grown for this purpose he led little marygold into the garden where he sprinkled all the remainder of the water over the rosebushes and with such good effect that above five thousand roses recovered their beautiful bloom there were two circumstances however which as long as he lived used to put king midas in mind of the golden touch one was that the sands of the river sparkled like gold the other that little marygolds hair had now a golden tinge which he had never observed in it before she had been transmuted by the effect of his kiss this change of hue was really an improvement and made marygolds hair richer than in her babyhood  when king midas had grown quite an old man and used to trot marygolds children on his knee he was fond of telling them this marvellous story pretty much as i have now told it to you and then would he stroke their glossy ringlets and tell them that their hair likewise had a rich shade of gold which they had inherited from their mother  and to tell you the truth my precious little folks quoth king midas diligently trotting the children all the while ever since that morning i have hated the very sight of all other gold save this   shadow brook  after the story  well children inquired eustace who was very fond of eliciting a definite opinion from his auditors did you ever in all your lives listen to a better story than this of the golden touch  why as to the story of king midas said saucy primrose it was a famous one thousands of years before mr eustace bright came into the world and will continue to be so as long after he quits it but some people have what we may call the leaden touch and make everything dull and heavy that they lay their fingers upon  you are a smart child primrose to be not yet in your teens said eustace taken rather aback by the piquancy of her criticism but you well know in your naughty little heart that i have burnished the old gold of midas all over anew and have made it shine as it never shone before and then that figure of marygold do you perceive no nice workmanship in that and how finely i have brought out and deepened the moral what say you sweet fern dandelion clover periwinkle would any of you after hearing this story be so foolish as to desire the faculty of changing things to gold  i should like said periwinkle a girl of ten to have the power of turning everything to gold with my right forefinger but with my left forefinger i should want the power of changing it back again if the first change did not please me and i know what i would do this very afternoon  pray tell me said eustace  why answered periwinkle i would touch every one of these golden leaves on the trees with my left forefinger and make them all green again so that we might have the summer back at once with no ugly winter in the mean time  o periwinkle cried eustace bright there you are wrong and would do a great deal of mischief were i midas i would make nothing else but just such golden days as these over and over again all the year throughout my best thoughts always come a little too late why did not i tell you how old king midas came to america and changed the dusky autumn such as it is in other countries into the burnished beauty which it here puts on he gilded the leaves of the great volume of nature  cousin eustace said sweet fern a good little boy who was always making particular inquiries about the precise height of giants and the littleness of fairies how big was marygold and how much did she weigh after she was turned to gold  she was about as tall as you are replied eustace and as gold is very heavy she weighed at least two thousand pounds and might have been coined into thirty or forty thousand gold dollars i wish primrose were worth half as much come little people let us clamber out of the dell and look about us  they did so the sun was now an hour or two beyond its noontide mark and filled the great hollow of the valley with its western radiance so that it seemed to be brimming with mellow light and to spill it over the surrounding hillsides like golden wine out of a bowl it was such a day that you could not help saying of it there never was such a day before although yesterday was just such a day and tomorrow will be just such another ah but there are very few of them in a twelvemonths circle it is a remarkable peculiarity of these october days that each of them seems to occupy a great deal of space although the sun rises rather tardily at that season of the year and goes to bed as little children ought at sober six oclock or even earlier we cannot therefore call the days long but they appear somehow or other to make up for their shortness by their breadth and when the cool night comes we are conscious of having enjoyed a big armful of life since morning  come children come cried eustace bright more nuts more nuts more nuts fill all your baskets and at christmas time i will crack them for you and tell you beautiful stories  so away they went all of them in excellent spirits except little dandelion who i am sorry to tell you had been sitting on a chestnutbur and was stuck as full as a pincushion of its prickles dear me how uncomfortably he must have felt     the paradise of children   tanglewood playroom  introductory to the paradise of children  the golden days of october passed away as so many other octobers have and brown november likewise and the greater part of chill december too at last came merry christmas and eustace bright along with it making it all the merrier by his presence and the day after his arrival from college there came a mighty snowstorm up to this time the winter had held back and had given us a good many mild days which were like smiles upon its wrinkled visage the grass had kept itself green in sheltered places such as the nooks of southern hillslopes and along the lee of the stone fences it was but a week or two ago and since the beginning of the month that the children had found a dandelion in bloom on the margin of shadow brook where it glides out of the dell  but no more green grass and dandelions now this was such a snowstorm twenty miles of it might have been visible at once between the windows of tanglewood and the dome of taconic had it been possible to see so far among the eddying drifts that whitened all the atmosphere it seemed as if the hills were giants and were flinging monstrous handfuls of snow at one another in their enormous sport so thick were the fluttering snowflakes that even the trees midway down the valley were hidden by them the greater part of the time sometimes it is true the little prisoners of tanglewood could discern a dim outline of monument mountain and the smooth whiteness of the frozen lake at its base and the black or gray tracts of woodland in the nearer landscape but these were merely peeps through the tempest  nevertheless the children rejoiced greatly in the snowstorm they had already made acquaintance with it by tumbling heels over head into its highest drifts and flinging snow at one another as we have just fancied the berkshire mountains to be doing and now they had come back to their spacious playroom which was as big as the great drawingroom and was lumbered with all sorts of playthings large and small the biggest was a rockinghorse that looked like a real pony and there was a whole family of wooden waxen plaster and china dolls besides ragbabies and blocks enough to build bunker hill monument and ninepins and balls and humming tops and battledores and gracesticks and skippingropes and more of such valuable property than i could tell of in a printed page but the children liked the snowstorm better than them all it suggested so many brisk enjoyments for tomorrow and all the remainder of the winter the sleighride the slides down hill into the valley the snowimages that were to be shaped out the snowfortresses that were to be built and the snowballing to be carried on  so the little folks blessed the snowstorm and were glad to see it come thicker and thicker and watched hopefully the long drift that was piling itself up in the avenue and was already higher than any of their heads  why we shall be blocked up till spring cried they with the hugest delight what a pity that the house is too high to be quite covered up the little red house down yonder will be buried up to its eaves  you silly children what do you want of more snow asked eustace who tired of some novel that he was skimming through had strolled into the playroom it has done mischief enough already by spoiling the only skating that i could hope for through the winter we shall see nothing more of the lake till april and this was to have been my first day upon it dont you pity me primrose  oh to be sure answered primrose laughing but for your comfort we will listen to another of your old stories such as you told us under the porch and down in the hollow by shadow brook perhaps i shall like them better now when there is nothing to do than while there were nuts to be gathered and beautiful weather to enjoy  hereupon periwinkle clover sweet fern and as many others of the little fraternity and cousinhood as were still at tanglewood gathered about eustace and earnestly besought him for a story the student yawned stretched himself and then to the vast admiration of the small people skipped three times back and forth over the top of a chair in order as he explained to them to set his wits in motion  well well children said he after these preliminaries since you insist and primrose has set her heart upon it i will see what can be done for you and that you may know what happy days there were before snowstorms came into fashion i will tell you a story of the oldest of all old times when the world was as new as sweet ferns brannew hummingtop there was then but one season in the year and that was the delightful summer and but one age for mortals and that was childhood  i never heard of that before said primrose  of course you never did answered eustace it shall be a story of what nobody but myself ever dreamed ofa paradise of childrenand how by the naughtiness of just such a little imp as primrose here it all came to nothing  so eustace bright sat down in the chair which he had just been skipping over took cowslip upon his knee ordered silence throughout the auditory and began a story about a sad naughty child whose name was pandora and about her playfellow epimetheus you may read it word for word in the pages that come next   the paradise of children  long long ago when this old world was in its tender infancy there was a child named epimetheus who never had either father or mother and that he might not be lonely another child fatherless and motherless like himself was sent from a far country to live with him and be his playfellow and helpmate her name was pandora  the first thing that pandora saw when she entered the cottage where epimetheus dwelt was a great box and almost the first question which she put to him after crossing the threshold was this  epimetheus what have you in that box  my dear little pandora answered epimetheus that is a secret and you must be kind enough not to ask any questions about it the box was left here to be kept safely and i do not myself know what it contains  but who gave it to you asked pandora and where did it come from  that is a secret too replied epimetheus  how provoking exclaimed pandora pouting her lip i wish the great ugly box were out of the way  oh come dont think of it any more cried epimetheus let us run out of doors and have some nice play with the other children  it is thousands of years since epimetheus and pandora were alive and the world nowadays is a very different sort of thing from what it was in their time then everybody was a child there needed no fathers and mothers to take care of the children because there was no danger nor trouble of any kind and no clothes to be mended and there was always plenty to eat and drink whenever a child wanted his dinner he found it growing on a tree and if he looked at the tree in the morning he could see the expanding blossom of that nights supper or at eventide he saw the tender bud of tomorrows breakfast it was a very pleasant life indeed no labor to be done no tasks to be studied nothing but sports and dances and sweet voices of children talking or carolling like birds or gushing out in merry laughter throughout the livelong day  what was most wonderful of all the children never quarrelled among themselves neither had they any crying fits nor since time first began had a single one of these little mortals ever gone apart into a corner and sulked oh what a good time was that to be alive in the truth is those ugly little winged monsters called troubles which are now almost as numerous as mosquitoes had never yet been seen on the earth it is probable that the very greatest disquietude which a child had ever experienced was pandoras vexation at not being able to discover the secret of the mysterious box  this was at first only the faint shadow of a trouble but every day it grew more and more substantial until before a great while the cottage of epimetheus and pandora was less sunshiny than those of the other children  whence can the box have come pandora continually kept saying to herself and to epimetheus and what in the world can be inside of it  always talking about this box said epimetheus at last for he had grown extremely tired of the subject i wish dear pandora you would try to talk of something else come let us go and gather some ripe figs and eat them under the trees for our supper and i know a vine that has the sweetest and juiciest grapes you ever tasted  always talking about grapes and figs cried pandora pettishly  illustration pandora  well then said epimetheus who was a very goodtempered child like a multitude of children in those days let us run out and have a merry time with our playmates  i am tired of merry times and dont care if i never have any more answered our pettish little pandora and besides i never do have any this ugly box i am so taken up with thinking about it all the time i insist upon your telling me what is inside of it  as i have already said fifty times over i do not know replied epimetheus getting a little vexed how then can i tell you what is inside  you might open it said pandora looking sideways at epimetheus and then we could see for ourselves  pandora what are you thinking of exclaimed epimetheus  and his face expressed so much horror at the idea of looking into a box which had been confided to him on the condition of his never opening it that pandora thought it best not to suggest it any more still however she could not help thinking and talking about the box  at least said she you can tell me how it came here  it was left at the door replied epimetheus just before you came by a person who looked very smiling and intelligent and who could hardly forbear laughing as he put it down he was dressed in an odd kind of a cloak and had on a cap that seemed to be made partly of feathers so that it looked almost as if it had wings  what sort of a staff had he asked pandora  oh the most curious staff you ever saw cried epimetheus it was like two serpents twisting around a stick and was carved so naturally that i at first thought the serpents were alive  i know him said pandora thoughtfully nobody else has such a staff it was quicksilver and he brought me hither as well as the box no doubt he intended it for me and most probably it contains pretty dresses for me to wear or toys for you and me to play with or something very nice for us both to eat  perhaps so answered epimetheus turning away but until quicksilver comes back and tells us so we have neither of us any right to lift the lid of the box  what a dull boy he is muttered pandora as epimetheus left the cottage i do wish he had a little more enterprise  for the first time since her arrival epimetheus had gone out without asking pandora to accompany him he went to gather figs and grapes by himself or to seek whatever amusement he could find in other society than his little playfellows he was tired to death of hearing about the box and heartily wished that quicksilver or whatever was the messengers name had left it at some other childs door where pandora would never have set eyes on it so perseveringly as she did babble about this one thing the box the box and nothing but the box it seemed as if the box were bewitched and as if the cottage were not big enough to hold it without pandoras continually stumbling over it and making epimetheus stumble over it likewise and bruising all four of their shins  well it was really hard that poor epimetheus should have a box in his ears from morning till night especially as the little people of the earth were so unaccustomed to vexations in those happy days that they knew not how to deal with them thus a small vexation made as much disturbance then as a far bigger one would in our own times  after epimetheus was gone pandora stood gazing at the box she had called it ugly above a hundred times but in spite of all that she had said against it it was positively a very handsome article of furniture and would have been quite an ornament to any room in which it should be placed it was made of a beautiful kind of wood with dark and rich veins spreading over its surface which was so highly polished that little pandora could see her face in it as the child had no other lookingglass it is odd that she did not value the box merely on this account  the edges and corners of the box were carved with most wonderful skill around the margin there were figures of graceful men and women and the prettiest children ever seen reclining or sporting amid a profusion of flowers and foliage and these various objects were so exquisitely represented and were wrought together in such harmony that flowers foliage and human beings seemed to combine into a wreath of mingled beauty but here and there peeping forth from behind the carved foliage pandora once or twice fancied that she saw a face not so lovely or something or other that was disagreeable and which stole the beauty out of all the rest nevertheless on looking more closely and touching the spot with her finger she could discover nothing of the kind some face that was really beautiful had been made to look ugly by her catching a sideway glimpse at it  the most beautiful face of all was done in what is called high relief in the centre of the lid there was nothing else save the dark smooth richness of the polished wood and this one face in the centre with a garland of flowers about its brow pandora had looked at this face a great many times and imagined that the mouth could smile if it liked or be grave when it chose the same as any living mouth the features indeed all wore a very lively and rather mischievous expression which looked almost as if it needs must burst out of the carved lips and utter itself in words  had the mouth spoken it would probably have been something like this  do not be afraid pandora what harm can there be in opening the box never mind that poor simple epimetheus you are wiser than he and have ten times as much spirit open the box and see if you do not find something very pretty  the box i had almost forgotten to say was fastened not by a lock nor by any other such contrivance but by a very intricate knot of gold cord there appeared to be no end to this knot and no beginning never was a knot so cunningly twisted nor with so many ins and outs which roguishly defied the skilfullest fingers to disentangle them and yet by the very difficulty that there was in it pandora was the more tempted to examine the knot and just see how it was made two or three times already she had stooped over the box and taken the knot between her thumb and forefinger but without positively trying to undo it  i really believe said she to herself that i begin to see how it was done nay perhaps i could tie it up again after undoing it there would be no harm in that surely even epimetheus would not blame me for that i need not open the box and should not of course without the foolish boys consent even if the knot were untied  it might have been better for pandora if she had had a little work to do or anything to employ her mind upon so as not to be so constantly thinking of this one subject but children led so easy a life before any troubles came into the world that they had really a great deal too much leisure they could not be forever playing at hideandseek among the flowershrubs or at blindmansbuff with garlands over their eyes or at whatever other games had been found out while mother earth was in her babyhood when life is all sport toil is the real play there was absolutely nothing to do a little sweeping and dusting about the cottage i suppose and the gathering of fresh flowers which were only too abundant everywhere and arranging them in vasesand poor little pandoras days work was over and then for the rest of the day there was the box  after all i am not quite sure that the box was not a blessing to her in its way it supplied her with such a variety of ideas to think of and to talk about whenever she had anybody to listen when she was in goodhumor she could admire the bright polish of its sides and the rich border of beautiful faces and foliage that ran all around it or if she chanced to be illtempered she could give it a push or kick it with her naughty little foot and many a kick did the boxbut it was a mischievous box as we shall see and deserved all it gotmany a kick did it receive but certain it is if it had not been for the box our activeminded little pandora would not have known half so well how to spend her time as she now did  for it was really an endless employment to guess what was inside what could it be indeed just imagine my little hearers how busy your wits would be if there were a great box in the house which as you might have reason to suppose contained something new and pretty for your christmas or newyears gifts do you think that you should be less curious than pandora if you were left alone with the box might you not feel a little tempted to lift the lid but you would not do it oh fie no no only if you thought there were toys in it it would be so very hard to let slip an opportunity of taking just one peep i know not whether pandora expected any toys for none had yet begun to be made probably in those days when the world itself was one great plaything for the children that dwelt upon it but pandora was convinced that there was something very beautiful and valuable in the box and therefore she felt just as anxious to take a peep as any of these little girls here around me would have felt and possibly a little more so but of that i am not quite so certain  on this particular day however which we have so long been talking about her curiosity grew so much greater than it usually was that at last she approached the box she was more than half determined to open it if she could ah naughty pandora  first however she tried to lift it it was heavy quite too heavy for the slender strength of a child like pandora she raised one end of the box a few inches from the floor and let it fall again with a pretty loud thump a moment afterwards she almost fancied that she heard something stir inside of the box she applied her ear as closely as possible and listened positively there did seem to be a kind of stifled murmur within or was it merely the singing in pandoras ears or could it be the beating of her heart the child could not quite satisfy herself whether she had heard anything or no but at all events her curiosity was stronger than ever  as she drew back her head her eyes fell upon the knot of gold cord  it must have been a very ingenious person who tied this knot said pandora to herself but i think i could untie it nevertheless i am resolved at least to find the two ends of the cord  so she took the golden knot in her fingers and pried into its intricacies as sharply as she could almost without intending it or quite knowing what she was about she was soon busily engaged in attempting to undo it meanwhile the bright sunshine came through the open window as did likewise the merry voices of the children playing at a distance and perhaps the voice of epimetheus among them pandora stopped to listen what a beautiful day it was would it not be wiser if she were to let the troublesome knot alone and think no more about the box but run and join her little playfellows and be happy  all this time however her fingers were half unconsciously busy with the knot and happening to glance at the flowerwreathed face on the lid of the enchanted box she seemed to perceive it slyly grinning at her  that face looks very mischievous thought pandora i wonder whether it smiles because i am doing wrong i have the greatest mind in the world to run away  but just then by the merest accident she gave the knot a kind of a twist which produced a wonderful result the gold cord untwined itself as if by magic and left the box without a fastening  this is the strangest thing i ever knew said pandora what will epimetheus say and how can i possibly tie it up again  she made one or two attempts to restore the knot but soon found it quite beyond her skill it had disentangled itself so suddenly that she could not in the least remember how the strings had been doubled into one another and when she tried to recollect the shape and appearance of the knot it seemed to have gone entirely out of her mind nothing was to be done therefore but to let the box remain as it was until epimetheus should come in  but said pandora when he finds the knot untied he will know that i have done it how shall i make him believe that i have not looked into the box  and then the thought came into her naughty little heart that since she would be suspected of having looked into the box she might just as well do so at once oh very naughty and very foolish pandora you should have thought only of doing what was right and of leaving undone what was wrong and not of what your playfellow epimetheus would have said or believed and so perhaps she might if the enchanted face on the lid of the box had not looked so bewitchingly persuasive at her and if she had not seemed to hear more distinctly than before the murmur of small voices within she could not tell whether it was fancy or no but there was quite a little tumult of whispers in her earor else it was her curiosity that whispered  let us out dear pandorapray let us out we will be such nice pretty playfellows for you only let us out  what can it be thought pandora is there something alive in the box wellyesi am resolved to take just one peep only one peep and then the lid shall be shut down as safely as ever there cannot possibly be any harm in just one little peep  but it is now time for us to see what epimetheus was doing  this was the first time since his little playmate had come to dwell with him that he had attempted to enjoy any pleasure in which she did not partake but nothing went right nor was he nearly so happy as on other days he could not find a sweet grape or a ripe fig if epimetheus had a fault it was a little too much fondness for figs or if ripe at all they were overripe and so sweet as to be cloying there was no mirth in his heart such as usually made his voice gush out of its own accord and swell the merriment of his companions in short he grew so uneasy and discontented that the other children could not imagine what was the matter with epimetheus neither did he himself know what ailed him any better than they did for you must recollect that at the time we are speaking of it was everybodys nature and constant habit to be happy the world had not yet learned to be otherwise not a single soul or body since these children were first sent to enjoy themselves on the beautiful earth had ever been sick or out of sorts  at length discovering that somehow or other he put a stop to all the play epimetheus judged it best to go back to pandora who was in a humor better suited to his own but with a hope of giving her pleasure he gathered some flowers and made them into a wreath which he meant to put upon her head the flowers were very lovelyroses and lilies and orangeblossoms and a great many more which left a trail of fragrance behind as epimetheus carried them along and the wreath was put together with as much skill as could reasonably be expected of a boy the fingers of little girls it has always appeared to me are the fittest to twine flowerwreaths but boys could do it in those days rather better than they can now  and here i must mention that a great black cloud had been gathering in the sky for some time past although it had not yet overspread the sun but just as epimetheus reached the cottage door this cloud began to intercept the sunshine and thus to make a sudden and sad obscurity  he entered softly for he meant if possible to steal behind pandora and fling the wreath of flowers over her head before she should be aware of his approach but as it happened there was no need of his treading so very lightly he might have trod as heavily as he pleasedas heavily as a grown manas heavily i was going to say as an elephantwithout much probability of pandoras hearing his footsteps she was too intent upon her purpose at the moment of his entering the cottage the naughty child had put her hand to the lid and was on the point of opening the mysterious box epimetheus beheld her if he had cried out pandora would probably have withdrawn her hand and the fatal mystery of the box might never have been known  but epimetheus himself although he said very little about it had his own share of curiosity to know what was inside perceiving that pandora was resolved to find out the secret he determined that his playfellow should not be the only wise person in the cottage and if there were anything pretty or valuable in the box he meant to take half of it to himself thus after all his sage speeches to pandora about restraining her curiosity epimetheus turned out to be quite as foolish and nearly as much in fault as she so whenever we blame pandora for what happened we must not forget to shake our heads at epimetheus likewise  as pandora raised the lid the cottage grew very dark and dismal for the black cloud had now swept quite over the sun and seemed to have buried it alive there had for a little while past been a low growling and muttering which all at once broke into a heavy peal of thunder but pandora heeding nothing of all this lifted the lid nearly upright and looked inside it seemed as if a sudden swarm of winged creatures brushed past her taking flight out of the box while at the same instant she heard the voice of epimetheus with a lamentable tone as if he were in pain  oh i am stung cried he i am stung naughty pandora why have you opened this wicked box  pandora let fall the lid and starting up looked about her to see what had befallen epimetheus the thundercloud had so darkened the room that she could not very clearly discern what was in it but she heard a disagreeable buzzing as if a great many huge flies or gigantic mosquitoes or those insects which we call dorbugs and pinchingdogs were darting about and as her eyes grew more accustomed to the imperfect light she saw a crowd of ugly little shapes with bats wings looking abominably spiteful and armed with terribly long stings in their tails it was one of these that had stung epimetheus nor was it a great while before pandora herself began to scream in no less pain and affright than her playfellow and making a vast deal more hubbub about it an odious little monster had settled on her forehead and would have stung her i know not how deeply if epimetheus had not run and brushed it away  now if you wish to know what these ugly things might be which had made their escape out of the box i must tell you that they were the whole family of earthly troubles there were evil passions there were a great many species of cares there were more than a hundred and fifty sorrows there were diseases in a vast number of miserable and painful shapes there were more kinds of naughtiness than it would be of any use to talk about in short everything that has since afflicted the souls and bodies of mankind had been shut up in the mysterious box and given to epimetheus and pandora to be kept safely in order that the happy children of the world might never be molested by them had they been faithful to their trust all would have gone well no grown person would ever have been sad nor any child have had cause to shed a single tear from that hour until this moment  butand you may see by this how a wrong act of any one mortal is a calamity to the whole worldby pandoras lifting the lid of that miserable box and by the fault of epimetheus too in not preventing her these troubles have obtained a foothold among us and do not seem very likely to be driven away in a hurry for it was impossible as you will easily guess that the two children should keep the ugly swarm in their own little cottage on the contrary the first thing that they did was to fling open the doors and windows in hopes of getting rid of them and sure enough away flew the winged troubles all abroad and so pestered and tormented the small people everywhere about that none of them so much as smiled for many days afterwards and what was very singular all the flowers and dewy blossoms on earth not one of which had hitherto faded now began to droop and shed their leaves after a day or two the children moreover who before seemed immortal in their childhood now grew older day by day and came soon to be youths and maidens and men and women by and by and aged people before they dreamed of such a thing  meanwhile the naughty pandora and hardly less naughty epimetheus remained in their cottage both of them had been grievously stung and were in a good deal of pain which seemed the more intolerable to them because it was the very first pain that had ever been felt since the world began of course they were entirely unaccustomed to it and could have no idea what it meant besides all this they were in exceedingly bad humor both with themselves and with one another in order to indulge it to the utmost epimetheus sat down sullenly in a corner with his back towards pandora while pandora flung herself upon the floor and rested her head on the fatal and abominable box she was crying bitterly and sobbing as if her heart would break  suddenly there was a gentle little tap on the inside of the lid  what can that be cried pandora lifting her head  but either epimetheus had not heard the tap or was too much out of humor to notice it at any rate he made no answer  you are very unkind said pandora sobbing anew not to speak to me  again the tap it sounded like the tiny knuckles of a fairys hand knocking lightly and playfully on the inside of the box  who are you asked pandora with a little of her former curiosity who are you inside of this naughty box  a sweet little voice spoke from within  only lift the lid and you shall see  no no answered pandora again beginning to sob i have had enough of lifting the lid you are inside of the box naughty creature and there you shall stay there are plenty of your ugly brothers and sisters already flying about the world you need never think that i shall be so foolish as to let you out  she looked towards epimetheus as she spoke perhaps expecting that he would commend her for her wisdom but the sullen boy only muttered that she was wise a little too late  ah said the sweet little voice again you had much better let me out i am not like those naughty creatures that have stings in their tails they are no brothers and sisters of mine as you would see at once if you were only to get a glimpse of me come come my pretty pandora i am sure you will let me out  and indeed there was a kind of cheerful witchery in the tone that made it almost impossible to refuse anything which this little voice asked pandoras heart had insensibly grown lighter at every word that came from within the box epimetheus too though still in the corner had turned half round and seemed to be in rather better spirits than before  my dear epimetheus cried pandora have you heard this little voice  yes to be sure i have answered he but in no very goodhumor as yet and what of it  shall i lift the lid again asked pandora  just as you please said epimetheus you have done so much mischief already that perhaps you may as well do a little more one other trouble in such a swarm as you have set adrift about the world can make no very great difference  you might speak a little more kindly murmured pandora wiping her eyes  ah naughty boy cried the little voice within the box in an arch and laughing tone he knows he is longing to see me come my dear pandora lift up the lid i am in a great hurry to comfort you only let me have some fresh air and you shall soon see that matters are not quite so dismal as you think them  epimetheus exclaimed pandora come what may i am resolved to open the box  and as the lid seems very heavy cried epimetheus running across the room i will help you  so with one consent the two children again lifted the lid out flew a sunny and smiling little personage and hovered about the room throwing a light wherever she went have you never made the sunshine dance into dark corners by reflecting it from a bit of lookingglass well so looked the winged cheerfulness of this fairylike stranger amid the gloom of the cottage she flew to epimetheus and laid the least touch of her finger on the inflamed spot where the trouble had stung him and immediately the anguish of it was gone then she kissed pandora on the forehead and her hurt was cured likewise  after performing these good offices the bright stranger fluttered sportively over the childrens heads and looked so sweetly at them that they both began to think it not so very much amiss to have opened the box since otherwise their cheery guest must have been kept a prisoner among those naughty imps with stings in their tails  pray who are you beautiful creature inquired pandora  i am to be called hope answered the sunshiny figure and because i am such a cheery little body i was packed into the box to make amends to the human race for that swarm of ugly troubles which was destined to be let loose among them never fear we shall do pretty well in spite of them all  your wings are colored like the rainbow exclaimed pandora how very beautiful  yes they are like the rainbow said hope because glad as my nature is i am partly made of tears as well as smiles  and will you stay with us asked epimetheus forever and ever  as long as you need me said hope with her pleasant smileand that will be as long as you live in the worldi promise never to desert you there may come times and seasons now and then when you will think that i have utterly vanished but again and again and again when perhaps you least dream of it you shall see the glimmer of my wings on the ceiling of your cottage yes my dear children and i know something very good and beautiful that is to be given you hereafter  oh tell us they exclaimedtell us what it is  do not ask me replied hope putting her finger on her rosy mouth but do not despair even if it should never happen while you live on this earth trust in my promise for it is true  we do trust you cried epimetheus and pandora both in one breath  and so they did and not only they but so has everybody trusted hope that has since been alive and to tell you the truth i cannot help being gladthough to be sure it was an uncommonly naughty thing for her to dobut i cannot help being glad that our foolish pandora peeped into the box no doubtno doubtthe troubles are still flying about the world and have increased in multitude rather than lessened and are a very ugly set of imps and carry most venomous stings in their tails i have felt them already and expect to feel them more as i grow older but then that lovely and lightsome little figure of hope what in the world could we do without her hope spiritualizes the earth hope makes it always new and even in the earths best and brightest aspect hope shows it to be only the shadow of an infinite bliss hereafter   tanglewood playroom  after the story  primrose asked eustace pinching her ear how do you like my little pandora dont you think her the exact picture of yourself but you would not have hesitated half so long about opening the box  then i should have been well punished for my naughtiness retorted primrose smartly for the first thing to pop out after the lid was lifted would have been mr eustace bright in the shape of a trouble  cousin eustace said sweet fern did the box hold all the trouble that has ever come into the world  every mite of it answered eustace this very snowstorm which has spoiled my skating was packed up there  and how big was the box asked sweet fern  why perhaps three feet long said eustace two feet wide and two feet and a half high  ah said the child you are making fun of me cousin eustace i know there is not trouble enough in the world to fill such a great box as that as for the snowstorm it is no trouble at all but a pleasure so it could not have been in the box  hear the child cried primrose with an air of superiority how little he knows about the troubles of this world poor fellow he will be wiser when he has seen as much of life as i have  so saying she began to skip the rope  meantime the day was drawing towards its close out of doors the scene certainly looked dreary there was a gray drift far and wide through the gathering twilight the earth was as pathless as the air and the bank of snow over the steps of the porch proved that nobody had entered or gone out for a good many hours past had there been only one child at the window of tanglewood gazing at this wintry prospect it would perhaps have made him sad but half a dozen children together though they cannot quite turn the world into a paradise may defy old winter and all his storms to put them out of spirits eustace bright moreover on the spur of the moment invented several new kinds of play which kept them all in a roar of merriment till bedtime and served for the next stormy day besides     the three golden apples   tanglewood fireside  introductory to the three golden apples  the snowstorm lasted another day but what became of it afterwards i cannot possibly imagine at any rate it entirely cleared away during the night and when the sun arose the next morning it shone brightly down on as bleak a tract of hillcountry here in berkshire as could be seen anywhere in the world the frostwork had so covered the windowpanes that it was hardly possible to get a glimpse at the scenery outside but while waiting for breakfast the small populace of tanglewood had scratched peepholes with their fingernails and saw with vast delight thatunless it were one or two bare patches on a precipitous hillside or the gray effect of the snow intermingled with the black pine forestall nature was as white as a sheet how exceedingly pleasant and to make it all the better it was cold enough to nip ones nose short off if people have but life enough in them to bear it there is nothing that so raises the spirits and makes the blood ripple and dance so nimbly like a brook down the slope of a hill as a bright hard frost  no sooner was breakfast over than the whole party well muffled in furs and woollens floundered forth into the midst of the snow well what a day of frosty sport was this they slid down hill into the valley a hundred times nobody knows how far and to make it all the merrier upsetting their sledges and tumbling head over heels quite as often as they came safely to the bottom and once eustace bright took periwinkle sweet fern and squashblossom on the sledge with him by way of insuring a safe passage and down they went full speed but behold halfway down the sledge hit against a hidden stump and flung all four of its passengers into a heap and on gathering themselves up there was no little squashblossom to be found why what could have become of the child and while they were wondering and staring about up started squashblossom out of a snowbank with the reddest face you ever saw and looking as if a large scarlet flower had suddenly sprouted up in midwinter then there was a great laugh  when they had grown tired of sliding down hill eustace set the children to digging a cave in the biggest snowdrift that they could find unluckily just as it was completed and the party had squeezed themselves into the hollow down came the roof upon their heads and buried every soul of them alive the next moment up popped all their little heads out of the ruins and the tall students head in the midst of them looking hoary and venerable with the snowdust that had got amongst his brown curls and then to punish cousin eustace for advising them to dig such a tumbledown cavern the children attacked him in a body and so bepelted him with snowballs that he was fain to take to his heels  so he ran away and went into the woods and thence to the margin of shadow brook where he could hear the streamlet grumbling along under great overhanging banks of snow and ice which would scarcely let it see the light of day there were adamantine icicles glittering around all its little cascades thence he strolled to the shore of the lake and beheld a white untrodden plain before him stretching from his own feet to the foot of monument mountain and it being now almost sunset eustace thought that he had never beheld anything so fresh and beautiful as the scene he was glad that the children were not with him for their lively spirits and tumbleabout activity would quite have chased away his higher and graver mood so that he would merely have been merry as he had already been the whole day long and would not have known the loveliness of the winter sunset among the hills  when the sun was fairly down our friend eustace went home to eat his supper after the meal was over he betook himself to the study with a purpose i rather imagine to write an ode or two or three sonnets or verses of some kind or other in praise of the purple and golden clouds which he had seen around the setting sun but before he had hammered out the very first rhyme the door opened and primrose and periwinkle made their appearance  go away children i cant be troubled with you now cried the student looking over his shoulder with the pen between his fingers what in the world do you want here i thought you were all in bed  hear him periwinkle trying to talk like a grown man said primrose and he seems to forget that i am now thirteen years old and may sit up almost as late as i please but cousin eustace you must put off your airs and come with us to the drawingroom the children have talked so much about your stories that my father wishes to hear one of them in order to judge whether they are likely to do any mischief  poh poh primrose exclaimed the student rather vexed i dont believe i can tell one of my stories in the presence of grown people besides your father is a classical scholar not that i am much afraid of his scholarship neither for i doubt not it is as rusty as an old caseknife by this time but then he will be sure to quarrel with the admirable nonsense that i put into these stories out of my own head and which makes the great charm of the matter for children like yourself no man of fifty who has read the classical myths in his youth can possibly understand my merit as a reinventor and improver of them  all this may be very true said primrose but come you must my father will not open his book nor will mamma open the piano till you have given us some of your nonsense as you very correctly call it so be a good boy and come along  whatever he might pretend the student was rather glad than otherwise on second thoughts to catch at the opportunity of proving to mr pringle what an excellent faculty he had in modernizing the myths of ancient times until twenty years of age a young man may indeed be rather bashful about showing his poetry and his prose but for all that he is pretty apt to think that these very productions would place him at the tiptop of literature if once they could be known accordingly without much more resistance eustace suffered primrose and periwinkle to drag him into the drawingroom  it was a large handsome apartment with a semicircular window at one end in the recess of which stood a marble copy of greenoughs angel and child on one side of the fireplace there were many shelves of books gravely but richly bound the white light of the astrallamp and the red glow of the bright coalfire made the room brilliant and cheerful and before the fire in a deep armchair sat mr pringle looking just fit to be seated in such a chair and in such a room he was a tall and quite a handsome gentleman with a bald brow and was always so nicely dressed that even eustace bright never liked to enter his presence without at least pausing at the threshold to settle his shirtcollar but now as primrose had hold of one of his hands and periwinkle of the other he was forced to make his appearance with a roughandtumble sort of look as if he had been rolling all day in a snowbank and so he had  mr pringle turned towards the student benignly enough but in a way that made him feel how uncombed and unbrushed he was and how uncombed and unbrushed likewise were his mind and thoughts  eustace said mr pringle with a smile i find that you are producing a great sensation among the little public of tanglewood by the exercise of your gifts of narrative primrose here as the little folks choose to call her and the rest of the children have been so loud in praise of your stories that mrs pringle and myself are really curious to hear a specimen it would be so much the more gratifying to myself as the stories appear to be an attempt to render the fables of classical antiquity into the idiom of modern fancy and feeling at least so i judge from a few of the incidents which have come to me at second hand  you are not exactly the auditor that i should have chosen sir observed the student for fantasies of this nature  possibly not replied mr pringle i suspect however that a young authors most useful critic is precisely the one whom he would be least apt to choose pray oblige me therefore  sympathy methinks should have some little share in the critics qualifications murmured eustace bright however sir if you will find patience i will find stories but be kind enough to remember that i am addressing myself to the imagination and sympathies of the children not to your own  accordingly the student snatched hold of the first theme which presented itself it was suggested by a plate of apples that he happened to spy on the mantelpiece   the three golden apples  did you ever hear of the golden apples that grew in the garden of the hesperides ah those were such apples as would bring a great price by the bushel if any of them could be found growing in the orchards of nowadays but there is not i suppose a graft of that wonderful fruit on a single tree in the wide world not so much as a seed of those apples exists any longer  and even in the old old halfforgotten times before the garden of the hesperides was overrun with weeds a great many people doubted whether there could be real trees that bore apples of solid gold upon their branches all had heard of them but nobody remembered to have seen any children nevertheless used to listen openmouthed to stories of the golden appletree and resolved to discover it when they should be big enough adventurous young men who desired to do a braver thing than any of their fellows set out in quest of this fruit many of them returned no more none of them brought back the apples no wonder that they found it impossible to gather them it is said that there was a dragon beneath the tree with a hundred terrible heads fifty of which were always on the watch while the other fifty slept  in my opinion it was hardly worth running so much risk for the sake of a solid golden apple had the apples been sweet mellow and juicy indeed that would be another matter there might then have been some sense in trying to get at them in spite of the hundredheaded dragon  but as i have already told you it was quite a common thing with young persons when tired of too much peace and rest to go in search of the garden of the hesperides and once the adventure was undertaken by a hero who had enjoyed very little peace or rest since he came into the world at the time of which i am going to speak he was wandering through the pleasant land of italy with a mighty club in his hand and a bow and quiver slung across his shoulders he was wrapt in the skin of the biggest and fiercest lion that ever had been seen and which he himself had killed and though on the whole he was kind and generous and noble there was a good deal of the lions fierceness in his heart as he went on his way he continually inquired whether that were the right road to the famous garden but none of the country people knew anything about the matter and many looked as if they would have laughed at the question if the stranger had not carried so very big a club  so he journeyed on and on still making the same inquiry until at last he came to the brink of a river where some beautiful young women sat twining wreaths of flowers  can you tell me pretty maidens asked the stranger whether this is the right way to the garden of the hesperides  the young women had been having a fine time together weaving the flowers into wreaths and crowning one anothers heads and there seemed to be a kind of magic in the touch of their fingers that made the flowers more fresh and dewy and of brighter hues and sweeter fragrance while they played with them than even when they had been growing on their native stems but on hearing the strangers question they dropped all their flowers on the grass and gazed at him with astonishment  the garden of the hesperides cried one we thought mortals had been weary of seeking it after so many disappointments and pray adventurous traveller what do you want there  illustration atlas  a certain king who is my cousin replied he has ordered me to get him three of the golden apples  most of the young men who go in quest of these apples observed another of the damsels desire to obtain them for themselves or to present them to some fair maiden whom they love do you then love this king your cousin so very much  perhaps not replied the stranger sighing he has often been severe and cruel to me but it is my destiny to obey him  and do you know asked the damsel who had first spoken that a terrible dragon with a hundred heads keeps watch under the golden appletree  i know it well answered the stranger calmly but from my cradle upwards it has been my business and almost my pastime to deal with serpents and dragons  the young women looked at his massive club and at the shaggy lions skin which he wore and likewise at his heroic limbs and figure and they whispered to each other that the stranger appeared to be one who might reasonably expect to perform deeds far beyond the might of other men but then the dragon with a hundred heads what mortal even if he possessed a hundred lives could hope to escape the fangs of such a monster so kindhearted were the maidens that they could not bear to see this brave and handsome traveller attempt what was so very dangerous and devote himself most probably to become a meal for the dragons hundred ravenous mouths  go back cried they allgo back to your own home your mother beholding you safe and sound will shed tears of joy and what can she do more should you win ever so great a victory no matter for the golden apples no matter for the king your cruel cousin we do not wish the dragon with the hundred heads to eat you up  the stranger seemed to grow impatient at these remonstrances he carelessly lifted his mighty club and let it fall upon a rock that lay half buried in the earth near by with the force of that idle blow the great rock was shattered all to pieces it cost the stranger no more effort to achieve this feat of a giants strength than for one of the young maidens to touch her sisters rosy cheek with a flower  do you not believe said he looking at the damsels with a smile that such a blow would have crushed one of the dragons hundred heads  then he sat down on the grass and told them the story of his life or as much of it as he could remember from the day when he was first cradled in a warriors brazen shield while he lay there two immense serpents came gliding over the floor and opened their hideous jaws to devour him and he a baby of a few months old had griped one of the fierce snakes in each of his little fists and strangled them to death when he was but a stripling he had killed a huge lion almost as big as the one whose vast and shaggy hide he now wore upon his shoulders the next thing that he had done was to fight a battle with an ugly sort of monster called a hydra which had no less than nine heads and exceedingly sharp teeth in every one  but the dragon of the hesperides you know observed one of the damsels has a hundred heads  nevertheless replied the stranger i would rather fight two such dragons than a single hydra for as fast as i cut off a head two others grew in its place and besides there was one of the heads that could not possibly be killed but kept biting as fiercely as ever long after it was cut off so i was forced to bury it under a stone where it is doubtless alive to this very day but the hydras body and its eight other heads will never do any further mischief  the damsels judging that the story was likely to last a good while had been preparing a repast of bread and grapes that the stranger might refresh himself in the intervals of his talk they took pleasure in helping him to this simple food and now and then one of them would put a sweet grape between her rosy lips lest it should make him bashful to eat alone  the traveller proceeded to tell how he had chased a very swift stag for a twelvemonth together without ever stopping to take breath and had at last caught it by the antlers and carried it home alive and he had fought with a very odd race of people half horses and half men and had put them all to death from a sense of duty in order that their ugly figures might never be seen any more besides all this he took to himself great credit for having cleaned out a stable  do you call that a wonderful exploit asked one of the young maidens with a smile any clown in the country has done as much  had it been an ordinary stable replied the stranger i should not have mentioned it but this was so gigantic a task that it would have taken me all my life to perform it if i had not luckily thought of turning the channel of a river through the stabledoor that did the business in a very short time  seeing how earnestly his fair auditors listened he next told them how he had shot some monstrous birds and had caught a wild bull alive and let him go again and had tamed a number of very wild horses and had conquered hippolyta the warlike queen of the amazons he mentioned likewise that he had taken off hippolytas enchanted girdle and had given it to the daughter of his cousin the king  was it the girdle of venus inquired the prettiest of the damsels which makes women beautiful  no answered the stranger it had formerly been the swordbelt of mars and it can only make the wearer valiant and courageous  an old swordbelt cried the damsel tossing her head then i should not care about having it  you are right said the stranger  going on with his wonderful narrative he informed the maidens that as strange an adventure as ever happened was when he fought with geryon the sixlegged man this was a very odd and frightful sort of figure as you may well believe any person looking at his tracks in the sand or snow would suppose that three sociable companions had been walking along together on hearing his footsteps at a little distance it was no more than reasonable to judge that several people must be coming but it was only the strange man geryon clattering onward with his six legs  six legs and one gigantic body certainly he must have been a very queer monster to look at and my stars what a waste of shoeleather  when the stranger had finished the story of his adventures he looked around at the attentive faces of the maidens  perhaps you may have heard of me before said he modestly my name is hercules  we had already guessed it replied the maidens for your wonderful deeds are known all over the world we do not think it strange any longer that you should set out in quest of the golden apples of the hesperides come sisters let us crown the hero with flowers  then they flung beautiful wreaths over his stately head and mighty shoulders so that the lions skin was almost entirely covered with roses they took possession of his ponderous club and so entwined it about with the brightest softest and most fragrant blossoms that not a fingers breadth of its oaken substance could be seen it looked all like a huge bunch of flowers lastly they joined hands and danced around him chanting words which became poetry of their own accord and grew into a choral song in honor of the illustrious hercules  and hercules was rejoiced as any other hero would have been to know that these fair young girls had heard of the valiant deeds which it had cost him so much toil and danger to achieve but still he was not satisfied he could not think that what he had already done was worthy of so much honor while there remained any bold or difficult adventure to be undertaken  dear maidens said he when they paused to take breath now that you know my name will you not tell me how i am to reach the garden of the hesperides  ah must you go so soon they exclaimed youthat have performed so many wonders and spent such a toilsome lifecannot you content yourself to repose a little while on the margin of this peaceful river  hercules shook his head  i must depart now said he  we will then give you the best directions we can replied the damsels you must go to the seashore and find out the old one and compel him to inform you where the golden apples are to be found  the old one repeated hercules laughing at this odd name and pray who may the old one be  why the old man of the sea to be sure answered one of the damsels he has fifty daughters whom some people call very beautiful but we do not think it proper to be acquainted with them because they have seagreen hair and taper away like fishes you must talk with this old man of the sea he is a seafaring person and knows all about the garden of the hesperides for it is situated in an island which he is often in the habit of visiting  hercules then asked whereabouts the old one was most likely to be met with when the damsels had informed him he thanked them for all their kindnessfor the bread and grapes with which they had fed him the lovely flowers with which they had crowned him and the songs and dances wherewith they had done him honorand he thanked them most of all for telling him the right wayand immediately set forth upon his journey  but before he was out of hearing one of the maidens called after him  keep fast hold of the old one when you catch him cried she smiling and lifting her finger to make the caution more impressive do not be astonished at anything that may happen only hold him fast and he will tell you what you wish to know  hercules again thanked her and pursued his way while the maidens resumed their pleasant labor of making flowerwreaths they talked about the hero long after he was gone  we will crown him with the loveliest of our garlands said they when he returns hither with the three golden apples after slaying the dragon with a hundred heads  meanwhile hercules travelled constantly onward over hill and dale and through the solitary woods sometimes he swung his club aloft and splintered a mighty oak with a downright blow his mind was so full of the giants and monsters with whom it was the business of his life to fight that perhaps he mistook the great tree for a giant or a monster and so eager was hercules to achieve what he had undertaken that he almost regretted to have spent so much time with the damsels wasting idle breath upon the story of his adventures but thus it always is with persons who are destined to perform great things what they have already done seems less than nothing what they have taken in hand to do seems worth toil danger and life itself  persons who happened to be passing through the forest must have been affrighted to see him smite the trees with his great club with but a single blow the trunk was riven as by the stroke of lightning and the broad boughs came rustling and crashing down  hastening forward without ever pausing or looking behind he by and by heard the sea roaring at a distance at this sound he increased his speed and soon came to a beach where the great surfwaves tumbled themselves upon the hard sand in a long line of snowy foam at one end of the beach however there was a pleasant spot where some green shrubbery clambered up a cliff making its rocky face look soft and beautiful a carpet of verdant grass largely intermixed with sweetsmelling clover covered the narrow space between the bottom of the cliff and the sea and what should hercules espy there but an old man fast asleep  but was it really and truly an old man certainly at first sight it looked very like one but on closer inspection it rather seemed to be some kind of a creature that lived in the sea for on his legs and arms there were scales such as fishes have he was webfooted and webfingered after the fashion of a duck and his long beard being of a greenish tinge had more the appearance of a tuft of seaweed than of an ordinary beard have you never seen a stick of timber that has been long tossed about by the waves and has got all overgrown with barnacles and at last drifting ashore seems to have been thrown up from the very deepest bottom of the sea well the old man would have put you in mind of just such a wavetost spar but hercules the instant he set eyes on this strange figure was convinced that it could be no other than the old one who was to direct him on his way  yes it was the selfsame old man of the sea whom the hospitable maidens had talked to him about thanking his stars for the lucky accident of finding the old fellow asleep hercules stole on tiptoe towards him and caught him by the arm and leg  tell me cried he before the old one was well awake which is the way to the garden of the hesperides  as you may easily imagine the old man of the sea awoke in a fright but his astonishment could hardly have been greater than was that of hercules the next moment for all of a sudden the old one seemed to disappear out of his grasp and he found himself holding a stag by the fore and hind leg but still he kept fast hold then the stag disappeared and in its stead there was a seabird fluttering and screaming while hercules clutched it by the wing and claw but the bird could not get away immediately afterwards there was an ugly threeheaded dog which growled and barked at hercules and snapped fiercely at the hands by which he held him but hercules would not let him go in another minute instead of the threeheaded dog what should appear but geryon the sixlegged manmonster kicking at hercules with five of his legs in order to get the remaining one at liberty but hercules held on by and by no geryon was there but a huge snake like one of those which hercules had strangled in his babyhood only a hundred times as big and it twisted and twined about the heros neck and body and threw its tail high into the air and opened its deadly jaws as if to devour him outright so that it was really a very terrible spectacle but hercules was no whit disheartened and squeezed the great snake so tightly that he soon began to hiss with pain  you must understand that the old man of the sea though he generally looked so much like the wavebeaten figurehead of a vessel had the power of assuming any shape he pleased when he found himself so roughly seized by hercules he had been in hopes of putting him into such surprise and terror by these magical transformations that the hero would be glad to let him go if hercules had relaxed his grasp the old one would certainly have plunged down to the very bottom of the sea whence he would not soon have given himself the trouble of coming up in order to answer any impertinent questions ninetynine people out of a hundred i suppose would have been frightened out of their wits by the very first of his ugly shapes and would have taken to their heels at once for one of the hardest things in this world is to see the difference between real dangers and imaginary ones  but as hercules held on so stubbornly and only squeezed the old one so much the tighter at every change of shape and really put him to no small torture he finally thought it best to reappear in his own figure so there he was again a fishy scaly webfooted sort of personage with something like a tuft of seaweed at his chin  pray what do you want with me cried the old one as soon as he could take breath for it is quite a tiresome affair to go through so many false shapes why do you squeeze me so hard let me go this moment or i shall begin to consider you an extremely uncivil person  my name is hercules roared the mighty stranger and you will never get out of my clutch until you tell me the nearest way to the garden of the hesperides  when the old fellow heard who it was that had caught him he saw with half an eye that it would be necessary to tell him everything that he wanted to know the old one was an inhabitant of the sea you must recollect and roamed about everywhere like other seafaring people of course he had often heard of the fame of hercules and of the wonderful things that he was constantly performing in various parts of the earth and how determined he always was to accomplish whatever he undertook he therefore made no more attempts to escape but told the hero how to find the garden of the hesperides and likewise warned him of many difficulties which must be overcome before he could arrive thither  you must go on thus and thus said the old man of the sea after taking the points of the compass till you come in sight of a very tall giant who holds the sky on his shoulders and the giant if he happens to be in the humor will tell you exactly where the garden of the hesperides lies  and if the giant happens not to be in the humor remarked hercules balancing his club on the tip of his finger perhaps i shall find means to persuade him  thanking the old man of the sea and begging his pardon for having squeezed him so roughly the hero resumed his journey he met with a great many strange adventures which would be well worth your hearing if i had leisure to narrate them as minutely as they deserve  it was in this journey if i mistake not that he encountered a prodigious giant who was so wonderfully contrived by nature that every time he touched the earth he became ten times as strong as ever he had been before his name was ant√¶us you may see plainly enough that it was a very difficult business to fight with such a fellow for as often as he got a knockdown blow up he started again stronger fiercer and abler to use his weapons than if his enemy had let him alone thus the harder hercules pounded the giant with his club the further he seemed from winning the victory i have sometimes argued with such people but never fought with one the only way in which hercules found it possible to finish the battle was by lifting ant√¶us off his feet into the air and squeezing and squeezing and squeezing him until finally the strength was quite squeezed out of his enormous body  when this affair was finished hercules continued his travels and went to the land of egypt where he was taken prisoner and would have been put to death if he had not slain the king of the country and made his escape passing through the deserts of africa and going as fast as he could he arrived at last on the shore of the great ocean and here unless he could walk on the crests of the billows it seemed as if his journey must needs be at an end  nothing was before him save the foaming dashing measureless ocean but suddenly as he looked towards the horizon he saw something a great way off which he had not seen the moment before it gleamed very brightly almost as you may have beheld the round golden disk of the sun when it rises or sets over the edge of the world it evidently drew nearer for at every instant this wonderful object became larger and more lustrous at length it had come so nigh that hercules discovered it to be an immense cup or bowl made either of gold or burnished brass how it had got afloat upon the sea is more than i can tell you there it was at all events rolling on the tumultuous billows which tossed it up and down and heaved their foamy tops against its sides but without ever throwing their spray over the brim  i have seen many giants in my time thought hercules but never one that would need to drink his wine out of a cup like this  and true enough what a cup it must have been it was as largeas largebut in short i am afraid to say how immeasurably large it was to speak within bounds it was ten times larger than a great millwheel and all of metal as it was it floated over the heaving surges more lightly than an acorncup adown the brook the waves tumbled it onward until it grazed against the shore within a short distance of the spot where hercules was standing  as soon as this happened he knew what was to be done for he had not gone through so many remarkable adventures without learning pretty well how to conduct himself whenever anything came to pass a little out of the common rule it was just as clear as daylight that this marvellous cup had been set adrift by some unseen power and guided hitherward in order to carry hercules across the sea on his way to the garden of the hesperides accordingly without a moments delay he clambered over the brim and slid down on the inside where spreading out his lions skin he proceeded to take a little repose he had scarcely rested until now since he bade farewell to the damsels on the margin of the river the waves dashed with a pleasant and ringing sound against the circumference of the hollow cup it rocked lightly to and fro and the motion was so soothing that it speedily rocked hercules into an agreeable slumber  his nap had probably lasted a good while when the cup chanced to graze against a rock and in consequence immediately resounded and reverberated through its golden or brazen substance a hundred times as loudly as ever you heard a churchbell the noise awoke hercules who instantly started up and gazed around him wondering whereabouts he was he was not long in discovering that the cup had floated across a great part of the sea and was approaching the shore of what seemed to be an island and on that island what do you think he saw  no you will never guess it not if you were to try fifty thousand times it positively appears to me that this was the most marvellous spectacle that had ever been seen by hercules in the whole course of his wonderful travels and adventures it was a greater marvel than the hydra with nine heads which kept growing twice as fast as they were cut off greater than the sixlegged manmonster greater than ant√¶us greater than anything that was ever beheld by anybody before or since the days of hercules or than anything that remains to be beheld by travellers in all time to come it was a giant  but such an intolerably big giant a giant as tall as a mountain so vast a giant that the clouds rested about his midst like a girdle and hung like a hoary beard from his chin and flitted before his huge eyes so that he could neither see hercules nor the golden cup in which he was voyaging and most wonderful of all the giant held up his great hands and appeared to support the sky which so far as hercules could discern through the clouds was resting upon his head this does really seem almost too much to believe  meanwhile the bright cup continued to float onward and finally touched the strand just then a breeze wafted away the clouds from before the giants visage and hercules beheld it with all its enormous features eyes each of them as big as yonder lake a nose a mile long and a mouth of the same width it was a countenance terrible from its enormity of size but disconsolate and weary even as you may see the faces of many people nowadays who are compelled to sustain burdens above their strength what the sky was to the giant such are the cares of earth to those who let themselves be weighed down by them and whenever men undertake what is beyond the just measure of their abilities they encounter precisely such a doom as had befallen this poor giant  poor fellow he had evidently stood there a long while an ancient forest had been growing and decaying around his feet and oaktrees of six or seven centuries old had sprung from the acorn and forced themselves between his toes  the giant now looked down from the far height of his great eyes and perceiving hercules roared out in a voice that resembled thunder proceeding out of the cloud that had just flitted away from his face  who are you down at my feet there and whence do you come in that little cup  i am hercules thundered back the hero in a voice pretty nearly or quite as loud as the giants own and i am seeking for the garden of the hesperides  ho ho ho roared the giant in a fit of immense laughter that is a wise adventure truly  and why not cried hercules getting a little angry at the giants mirth do you think i am afraid of the dragon with a hundred heads  just at this time while they were talking together some black clouds gathered about the giants middle and burst into a tremendous storm of thunder and lightning causing such a pother that hercules found it impossible to distinguish a word only the giants immeasurable legs were to be seen standing up into the obscurity of the tempest and now and then a momentary glimpse of his whole figure mantled in a volume of mist he seemed to be speaking most of the time but his big deep rough voice chimed in with the reverberations of the thunderclaps and rolled away over the hills like them thus by talking out of season the foolish giant expended an incalculable quantity of breath to no purpose for the thunder spoke quite as intelligibly as he  at last the storm swept over as suddenly as it had come and there again was the clear sky and the weary giant holding it up and the pleasant sunshine beaming over his vast height and illuminating it against the background of the sullen thunderclouds so far above the shower had been his head that not a hair of it was moistened by the raindrops  when the giant could see hercules still standing on the seashore he roared out to him anew  i am atlas the mightiest giant in the world and i hold the sky upon my head  so i see answered hercules but can you show me the way to the garden of the hesperides  what do you want there asked the giant  i want three of the golden apples shouted hercules for my cousin the king  there is nobody but myself quoth the giant that can go to the garden of the hesperides and gather the golden apples if it were not for this little business of holding up the sky i would make half a dozen steps across the sea and get them for you  you are very kind replied hercules and cannot you rest the sky upon a mountain  none of them are quite high enough said atlas shaking his head but if you were to take your stand on the summit of that nearest one your head would be pretty nearly on a level with mine you seem to be a fellow of some strength what if you should take my burden on your shoulders while i do your errand for you  hercules as you must be careful to remember was a remarkably strong man and though it certainly requires a great deal of muscular power to uphold the sky yet if any mortal could be supposed capable of such an exploit he was the one nevertheless it seemed so difficult an undertaking that for the first time in his life he hesitated  is the sky very heavy he inquired  why not particularly so at first answered the giant shrugging his shoulders but it gets to be a little burdensome after a thousand years  and how long a time asked the hero will it take you to get the golden apples  oh that will be done in a few moments cried atlas i shall take ten or fifteen miles at a stride and be at the garden and back again before your shoulders begin to ache  well then answered hercules i will climb the mountain behind you there and relieve you of your burden  the truth is hercules had a kind heart of his own and considered that he should be doing the giant a favor by allowing him this opportunity for a ramble and besides he thought that it would be still more for his own glory if he could boast of upholding the sky than merely to do so ordinary a thing as to conquer a dragon with a hundred heads accordingly without more words the sky was shifted from the shoulders of atlas and placed upon those of hercules  when this was safely accomplished the first thing that the giant did was to stretch himself and you may imagine what a prodigious spectacle he was then next he slowly lifted one of his feet out of the forest that had grown up around it then the other then all at once he began to caper and leap and dance for joy at his freedom flinging himself nobody knows how high into the air and floundering down again with a shock that made the earth tremble then he laughedho ho howith a thunderous roar that was echoed from the mountains far and near as if they and the giant had been so many rejoicing brothers when his joy had a little subsided he stepped into the sea ten miles at the first stride which brought him midleg deep and ten miles at the second when the water came just above his knees and ten miles more at the third by which he was immersed nearly to his waist this was the greatest depth of the sea  hercules watched the giant as he still went onward for it was really a wonderful sight this immense human form more than thirty miles off half hidden in the ocean but with his upper half as tall and misty and blue as a distant mountain at last the gigantic shape faded entirely out of view and now hercules began to consider what he should do in case atlas should be drowned in the sea or if he were to be stung to death by the dragon with the hundred heads which guarded the golden apples of the hesperides if any such misfortune were to happen how could he ever get rid of the sky and by the by its weight began already to be a little irksome to his head and shoulders  i really pity the poor giant thought hercules if it wearies me so much in ten minutes how must it have wearied him in a thousand years  o my sweet little people you have no idea what a weight there was in that same blue sky which looks so soft and aerial above our heads and there too was the bluster of the wind and the chill and watery clouds and the blazing sun all taking their turns to make hercules uncomfortable he began to be afraid that the giant would never come back he gazed wistfully at the world beneath him and acknowledged to himself that it was a far happier kind of life to be a shepherd at the foot of a mountain than to stand on its dizzy summit and bear up the firmament with his might and main for of course as you will easily understand hercules had an immense responsibility on his mind as well as a weight on his head and shoulders why if he did not stand perfectly still and keep the sky immovable the sun would perhaps be put ajar or after nightfall a great many of the stars might be loosened from their places and shower down like fiery rain upon the peoples heads and how ashamed would the hero be if owing to his unsteadiness beneath its weight the sky should crack and show a great fissure quite across it  i know not how long it was before to his unspeakable joy he beheld the huge shape of the giant like a cloud on the faroff edge of the sea at his nearer approach atlas held up his hand in which hercules could perceive three magnificent golden apples as big as pumpkins all hanging from one branch  i am glad to see you again shouted hercules when the giant was within hearing so you have got the golden apples  certainly certainly answered atlas and very fair apples they are i took the finest that grew on the tree i assure you ah it is a beautiful spot that garden of the hesperides yes and the dragon with a hundred heads is a sight worth any mans seeing after all you had better have gone for the apples yourself  no matter replied hercules you have had a pleasant ramble and have done the business as well as i could i heartily thank you for your trouble and now as i have a long way to go and am rather in hasteand as the king my cousin is anxious to receive the golden appleswill you be kind enough to take the sky off my shoulders again  why as to that said the giant chucking the golden apples into the air twenty miles high or thereabouts and catching them as they came downas to that my good friend i consider you a little unreasonable cannot i carry the golden apples to the king your cousin much quicker than you could as his majesty is in such a hurry to get them i promise you to take my longest strides and besides i have no fancy for burdening myself with the sky just now  here hercules grew impatient and gave a great shrug of his shoulders it being now twilight you might have seen two or three stars tumble out of their places everybody on earth looked upward in affright thinking that the sky might be going to fall next  oh that will never do cried giant atlas with a great roar of laughter i have not let fall so many stars within the last five centuries by the time you have stood there as long as i did you will begin to learn patience  what shouted hercules very wrathfully do you intend to make me bear this burden forever  we will see about that one of these days answered the giant at all events you ought not to complain if you have to bear it the next hundred years or perhaps the next thousand i bore it a good while longer in spite of the backache well then after a thousand years if i happen to feel in the mood we may possibly shift about again you are certainly a very strong man and can never have a better opportunity to prove it posterity will talk of you i warrant it  pish a fig for its talk cried hercules with another hitch of his shoulders just take the sky upon your head one instant will you i want to make a cushion of my lions skin for the weight to rest upon it really chafes me and will cause unnecessary inconvenience in so many centuries as i am to stand here  thats no more than fair and ill do it quoth the giant for he had no unkind feeling towards hercules and was merely acting with a too selfish consideration of his own ease for just five minutes then ill take back the sky only for five minutes recollect i have no idea of spending another thousand years as i spent the last variety is the spice of life say i  ah the thickwitted old rogue of a giant he threw down the golden apples and received back the sky from the head and shoulders of hercules upon his own where it rightly belonged and hercules picked up the three golden apples that were as big or bigger than pumpkins and straightway set out on his journey homeward without paying the slightest heed to the thundering tones of the giant who bellowed after him to come back another forest sprang up around his feet and grew ancient there and again might be seen oaktrees of six or seven centuries old that had waxed thus aged betwixt his enormous toes  and there stands the giant to this day or at any rate there stands a mountain as tall as he and which bears his name and when the thunder rumbles about its summit we may imagine it to be the voice of giant atlas bellowing after hercules   tanglewood fireside  after the story   cousin eustace demanded sweet fern who had been sitting at the storytellers feet with his mouth wide open exactly how tall was this giant  o sweet fern sweet fern cried the student do you think i was there to measure him with a yardstick well if you must know to a hairsbreadth i suppose he might be from three to fifteen miles straight upward and that he might have seated himself on taconic and had monument mountain for a footstool  dear me ejaculated the good little boy with a contented sort of a grunt that was a giant sure enough and how long was his little finger  as long as from tanglewood to the lake said eustace  sure enough that was a giant repeated sweet fern in an ecstasy at the precision of these measurements and how broad i wonder were the shoulders of hercules  that is what i have never been able to find out answered the student but i think they must have been a great deal broader than mine or than your fathers or than almost any shoulders which one sees nowadays  i wish whispered sweet fern with his mouth close to the students ear that you would tell me how big were some of the oaktrees that grew between the giants toes  they were bigger said eustace than the great chestnuttree which stands beyond captain smiths house  eustace remarked mr pringle after some deliberation i find it impossible to express such an opinion of this story as will be likely to gratify in the smallest degree your pride of authorship pray let me advise you never more to meddle with a classical myth your imagination is altogether gothic and will inevitably gothicize everything that you touch the effect is like bedaubing a marble statue with paint this giant now how can you have ventured to thrust his huge disproportioned mass among the seemly outlines of grecian fable the tendency of which is to reduce even the extravagant within limits by its pervading elegance  i described the giant as he appeared to me replied the student rather piqued and sir if you would only bring your mind into such a relation with these fables as is necessary in order to remodel them you would see at once that an old greek had no more exclusive right to them than a modern yankee has they are the common property of the world and of all time the ancient poets remodelled them at pleasure and held them plastic in their hands and why should they not be plastic in my hands as well  mr pringle could not forbear a smile  and besides continued eustace the moment you put any warmth of heart any passion or affection any human or divine morality into a classic mould you make it quite another thing from what it was before my own opinion is that the greeks by taking possession of these legends which were the immemorial birthright of mankind and putting them into shapes of indestructible beauty indeed but cold and heartless have done all subsequent ages an incalculable injury  which you doubtless were born to remedy said mr pringle laughing outright well well go on but take my advice and never put any of your travesties on paper and as your next effort what if you should try your hand on some one of the legends of apollo  ah sir you propose it as an impossibility observed the student after a moments meditation and to be sure at first thought the idea of a gothic apollo strikes one rather ludicrously but i will turn over your suggestion in my mind and do not quite despair of success  during the above discussion the children who understood not a word of it had grown very sleepy and were now sent off to bed their drowsy babble was heard ascending the staircase while a northwestwind roared loudly among the treetops of tanglewood and played an anthem around the house eustace bright went back to the study and again endeavored to hammer out some verses but fell asleep between two of the rhymes     the miraculous pitcher   the hillside  introductory to the miraculous pitcher  and when and where do you think we find the children next no longer in the wintertime but in the merry month of may no longer in tanglewood playroom or at tanglewood fireside but more than halfway up a monstrous hill or a mountain as perhaps it would be better pleased to have us call it they had set out from home with the mighty purpose of climbing this high hill even to the very tiptop of its bald head to be sure it was not quite so high as chimborazo or mont blanc and was even a good deal lower than old graylock but at any rate it was higher than a thousand anthillocks or a million of molehills and when measured by the short strides of little children might be reckoned a very respectable mountain  and was cousin eustace with the party of that you may be certain else how could the book go on a step further he was now in the middle of the spring vacation and looked pretty much as we saw him four or five months ago except that if you gazed quite closely at his upper lip you could discern the funniest little bit of a mustache upon it setting aside this mark of mature manhood you might have considered cousin eustace just as much a boy as when you first became acquainted with him he was as merry as playful as goodhumored as light of foot and of spirits and equally a favorite with the little folks as he had always been this expedition up the mountain was entirely of his contrivance all the way up the steep ascent he had encouraged the elder children with his cheerful voice and when dandelion cowslip and squashblossom grew weary he had lugged them along alternately on his back in this manner they had passed through the orchards and pastures on the lower part of the hill and had reached the wood which extends thence towards its bare summit  the month of may thus far had been more amiable than it often is and this was as sweet and genial a day as the heart of man or child could wish in their progress up the hill the small people had found enough of violets blue and white and some that were as golden as if they had the touch of midas on them that sociablest of flowers the little houstonia was very abundant it is a flower that never lives alone but which loves its own kind and is always fond of dwelling with a great many friends and relatives around it sometimes you see a family of them covering a space no bigger than the palm of your hand and sometimes a large community whitening a whole tract of pasture and all keeping one another in cheerful heart and life  within the verge of the wood there were columbines looking more pale than red because they were so modest and had thought proper to seclude themselves too anxiously from the sun there were wild geraniums too and a thousand white blossoms of the strawberry the trailing arbutus was not yet quite out of bloom but it hid its precious flowers under the last years withered forestleaves as carefully as a motherbird hides its little young ones it knew i suppose how beautiful and sweetscented they were so cunning was their concealment that the children sometimes smelt the delicate richness of their perfume before they knew whence it proceeded  amid so much new life it was strange and truly pitiful to behold here and there in the fields and pastures the hoary periwigs of dandelions that had already gone to seed they had done with summer before the summer came within those small globes of winged seeds it was autumn now  well but we must not waste our valuable pages with any more talk about the springtime and wild flowers there is something we hope more interesting to be talked about if you look at the group of children you may see them all gathered around eustace bright who sitting on the stump of a tree seems to be just beginning a story the fact is the younger part of the troop have found out that it takes rather too many of their short strides to measure the long ascent of the hill cousin eustace therefore has decided to leave sweet fern cowslip squashblossom and dandelion at this point midway up until the return of the rest of the party from the summit and because they complain a little and do not quite like to stay behind he gives them some apples out of his pocket and proposes to tell them a very pretty story hereupon they brighten up and change their grieved looks into the broadest kind of smiles  as for the story i was there to hear it hidden behind a bush and shall tell it over to you in the pages that come next   the miraculous pitcher  one evening in times long ago old philemon and his old wife baucis sat at their cottagedoor enjoying the calm and beautiful sunset they had already eaten their frugal supper and intended now to spend a quiet hour or two before bedtime so they talked together about their garden and their cow and their bees and their grapevine which clambered over the cottagewall and on which the grapes were beginning to turn purple but the rude shouts of children and the fierce barking of dogs in the village near at hand grew louder and louder until at last it was hardly possible for baucis and philemon to hear each other speak  ah wife cried philemon i fear some poor traveller is seeking hospitality among our neighbors yonder and instead of giving him food and lodging they have set their dogs at him as their custom is  welladay answered old baucis i do wish our neighbors felt a little more kindness for their fellowcreatures and only think of bringing up their children in this naughty way and patting them on the head when they fling stones at strangers  those children will never come to any good said philemon shaking his white head to tell you the truth wife i should not wonder if some terrible thing were to happen to all the people in the village unless they mend their manners but as for you and me so long as providence affords us a crust of bread let us be ready to give half to any poor homeless stranger that may come along and need it  thats right husband said baucis so we will  these old folks you must know were quite poor and had to work pretty hard for a living old philemon toiled diligently in his garden while baucis was always busy with her distaff or making a little butter and cheese with their cows milk or doing one thing and another about the cottage their food was seldom anything but bread milk and vegetables with sometimes a portion of honey from their beehive and now and then a bunch of grapes that had ripened against the cottage wall but they were two of the kindest old people in the world and would cheerfully have gone without their dinners any day rather than refuse a slice of their brown loaf a cup of new milk and a spoonful of honey to the weary traveller who might pause before their door they felt as if such guests had a sort of holiness and that they ought therefore to treat them better and more bountifully than their own selves  their cottage stood on a rising ground at some short distance from a village which lay in a hollow valley that was about half a mile in breadth this valley in past ages when the world was new had probably been the bed of a lake there fishes had glided to and fro in the depths and waterweeds had grown along the margin and trees and hills had seen their reflected images in the broad and peaceful mirror but as the waters subsided men had cultivated the soil and built houses on it so that it was now a fertile spot and bore no traces of the ancient lake except a very small brook which meandered through the midst of the village and supplied the inhabitants with water the valley had been dry land so long that oaks had sprung up and grown great and high and perished with old age and been succeeded by others as tall and stately as the first never was there a prettier or more fruitful valley the very sight of the plenty around them should have made the inhabitants kind and gentle and ready to show their gratitude to providence by doing good to their fellowcreatures  but we are sorry to say the people of this lovely village were not worthy to dwell in a spot on which heaven had smiled so beneficently they were a very selfish and hardhearted people and had no pity for the poor nor sympathy with the homeless they would only have laughed had anybody told them that human beings owe a debt of love to one another because there is no other method of paying the debt of love and care which all of us owe to providence you will hardly believe what i am going to tell you these naughty people taught their children to be no better than themselves and used to clap their hands by way of encouragement when they saw the little boys and girls run after some poor stranger shouting at his heels and pelting him with stones they kept large and fierce dogs and whenever a traveller ventured to show himself in the village street this pack of disagreeable curs scampered to meet him barking snarling and showing their teeth then they would seize him by his leg or by his clothes just as it happened and if he were ragged when he came he was generally a pitiable object before he had time to run away this was a very terrible thing to poor travellers as you may suppose especially when they chanced to be sick or feeble or lame or old such persons if they once knew how badly these unkind people and their unkind children and curs were in the habit of behaving would go miles and miles out of their way rather than try to pass through the village again  what made the matter seem worse if possible was that when rich persons came in their chariots or riding on beautiful horses with their servants in rich liveries attending on them nobody could be more civil and obsequious than the inhabitants of the village they would take off their hats and make the humblest bows you ever saw if the children were rude they were pretty certain to get their ears boxed and as for the dogs if a single cur in the pack presumed to yelp his master instantly beat him with a club and tied him up without any supper this would have been all very well only it proved that the villagers cared much about the money that a stranger had in his pocket and nothing whatever for the human soul which lives equally in the beggar and the prince  so now you can understand why old philemon spoke so sorrowfully when he heard the shouts of the children and the barking of the dogs at the farther extremity of the village street there was a confused din which lasted a good while and seemed to pass quite through the breadth of the valley  i never heard the dogs so loud observed the good old man  nor the children so rude answered his good old wife  they sat shaking their heads one to another while the noise came nearer and nearer until at the foot of the little eminence on which their cottage stood they saw two travellers approaching on foot close behind them came the fierce dogs snarling at their very heels a little farther off ran a crowd of children who sent up shrill cries and flung stones at the two strangers with all their might once or twice the younger of the two men he was a slender and very active figure turned about and drove back the dogs with a staff which he carried in his hand his companion who was a very tall person walked calmly along as if disdaining to notice either the naughty children or the pack of curs whose manners the children seemed to imitate  both of the travellers were very humbly clad and looked as if they might not have money enough in their pockets to pay for a nights lodging and this i am afraid was the reason why the villagers had allowed their children and dogs to treat them so rudely  come wife said philemon to baucis let us go and meet these poor people no doubt they feel almost too heavyhearted to climb the hill  go you and meet them answered baucis while i make haste within doors and see whether we can get them anything for supper a comfortable bowl of bread and milk would do wonders towards raising their spirits  accordingly she hastened into the cottage philemon on his part went forward and extended his hand with so hospitable an aspect that there was no need of saying what nevertheless he did say in the heartiest tone imaginable  welcome strangers welcome  thank you replied the younger of the two in a lively kind of way notwithstanding his weariness and trouble this is quite another greeting than we have met with yonder in the village pray why do you live in such a bad neighborhood  ah observed old philemon with a quiet and benign smile providence put me here i hope among other reasons in order that i may make you what amends i can for the inhospitality of my neighbors  well said old father cried the traveller laughing and if the truth must be told my companion and myself need some amends those children the little rascals have bespattered us finely with their mudballs and one of the curs has torn my cloak which was ragged enough already but i took him across the muzzle with my staff and i think you may have heard him yelp even thus far off  philemon was glad to see him in such good spirits nor indeed would you have fancied by the travellers look and manner that he was weary with a long days journey besides being disheartened by rough treatment at the end of it he was dressed in rather an odd way with a sort of cap on his head the brim of which stuck out over both ears though it was a summer evening he wore a cloak which he kept wrapt closely about him perhaps because his under garments were shabby philemon perceived too that he had on a singular pair of shoes but as it was now growing dusk and as the old mans eyesight was none the sharpest he could not precisely tell in what the strangeness consisted one thing certainly seemed queer the traveller was so wonderfully light and active that it appeared as if his feet sometimes rose from the ground of their own accord or could only be kept down by an effort  i used to be lightfooted in my youth said philemon to the traveller but i always found my feet grow heavier towards nightfall  there is nothing like a good staff to help one along answered the stranger and i happen to have an excellent one as you see  this staff in fact was the oddestlooking staff that philemon had ever beheld it was made of olivewood and had something like a little pair of wings near the top two snakes carved in the wood were represented as twining themselves about the staff and were so very skilfully executed that old philemon whose eyes you know were getting rather dim almost thought them alive and that he could see them wriggling and twisting  a curious piece of work sure enough said he a staff with wings it would be an excellent kind of stick for a little boy to ride astride of  by this time philemon and his two guests had reached the cottage door  friends said the old man sit down and rest yourselves here on this bench my good wife baucis has gone to see what you can have for supper we are poor folks but you shall be welcome to whatever we have in the cupboard  the younger stranger threw himself carelessly on the bench letting his staff fall as he did so and here happened something rather marvellous though trifling enough too the staff seemed to get up from the ground of its own accord and spreading its little pair of wings it half hopped half flew and leaned itself against the wall of the cottage there it stood quite still except that the snakes continued to wriggle but in my private opinion old philemons eyesight had been playing him tricks again  before he could ask any questions the elder stranger drew his attention from the wonderful staff by speaking to him  was there not asked the stranger in a remarkably deep tone of voice a lake in very ancient times covering the spot where now stands yonder village  not in my day friend answered philemon and yet i am an old man as you see there were always the fields and meadows just as they are now and the old trees and the little stream murmuring through the midst of the valley my father nor his father before him ever saw it otherwise so far as i know and doubtless it will still be the same when old philemon shall be gone and forgotten  that is more than can be safely foretold observed the stranger and there was something very stern in his deep voice he shook his head too so that his dark and heavy curls were shaken with the movement since the inhabitants of yonder village have forgotten the affections and sympathies of their nature it were better that the lake should be rippling over their dwellings again  the traveller looked so stern that philemon was really almost frightened the more so that at his frown the twilight seemed suddenly to grow darker and that when he shook his head there was a roll as of thunder in the air  but in a moment afterwards the strangers face became so kindly and mild that the old man quite forgot his terror nevertheless he could not help feeling that this elder traveller must be no ordinary personage although he happened now to be attired so humbly and to be journeying on foot not that philemon fancied him a prince in disguise or any character of that sort but rather some exceedingly wise man who went about the world in this poor garb despising wealth and all worldly objects and seeking everywhere to add a mite to his wisdom this idea appeared the more probable because when philemon raised his eyes to the strangers face he seemed to see more thought there in one look than he could have studied out in a lifetime  while baucis was getting the supper the travellers both began to talk very sociably with philemon the younger indeed was extremely loquacious and made such shrewd and witty remarks that the good old man continually burst out alaughing and pronounced him the merriest fellow whom he had seen for many a day  pray my young friend said he as they grew familiar together what may i call your name  why i am very nimble as you see answered the traveller so if you call me quicksilver the name will fit tolerably well  quicksilver quicksilver repeated philemon looking in the travellers face to see if he were making fun of him it is a very odd name and your companion there has he as strange a one  you must ask the thunder to tell it you replied quicksilver putting on a mysterious look no other voice is loud enough  this remark whether it were serious or in jest might have caused philemon to conceive a very great awe of the elder stranger if on venturing to gaze at him he had not beheld so much beneficence in his visage but undoubtedly here was the grandest figure that ever sat so humbly beside a cottage door when the stranger conversed it was with gravity and in such a way that philemon felt irresistibly moved to tell him everything which he had most at heart this is always the feeling that people have when they meet with any one wise enough to comprehend all their good and evil and to despise not a tittle of it  but philemon simple and kindhearted old man that he was had not many secrets to disclose he talked however quite garrulously about the events of his past life in the whole course of which he had never been a score of miles from this very spot his wife baucis and himself had dwelt in the cottage from their youth upward earning their bread by honest labor always poor but still contented he told what excellent butter and cheese baucis made and how nice were the vegetables which he raised in his garden he said too that because they loved one another so very much it was the wish of both that death might not separate them but that they should die as they had lived together  as the stranger listened a smile beamed over his countenance and made its expression as sweet as it was grand  you are a good old man said he to philemon and you have a good old wife to be your helpmeet it is fit that your wish be granted  and it seemed to philemon just then as if the sunset clouds threw up a bright flash from the west and kindled a sudden light in the sky  baucis had now got supper ready and coming to the door began to make apologies for the poor fare which she was forced to set before her guests  had we known you were coming said she my good man and myself would have gone without a morsel rather than you should lack a better supper but i took the most part of todays milk to make cheese and our last loaf is already half eaten ah me i never feel the sorrow of being poor save when a poor traveller knocks at our door  all will be very well do not trouble yourself my good dame replied the elder stranger kindly an honest hearty welcome to a guest works miracles with the fare and is capable of turning the coarsest food to nectar and ambrosia  a welcome you shall have cried baucis and likewise a little honey that we happen to have left and a bunch of purple grapes besides  why mother baucis it is a feast exclaimed quicksilver laughing an absolute feast and you shall see how bravely i will play my part at it i think i never felt hungrier in my life  mercy on us whispered baucis to her husband if the young man has such a terrible appetite i am afraid there will not be half enough supper  they all went into the cottage  and now my little auditors shall i tell you something that will make you open your eyes very wide it is really one of the oddest circumstances in the whole story quicksilvers staff you recollect had set itself up against the wall of the cottage well when its master entered the door leaving this wonderful staff behind what should it do but immediately spread its little wings and go hopping and fluttering up the door steps tap tap went the staff on the kitchen floor nor did it rest until it had stood itself on end with the greatest gravity and decorum beside quicksilvers chair old philemon however as well as his wife was so taken up in attending to their guests that no notice was given to what the staff had been about  as baucis had said there was but a scanty supper for two hungry travellers in the middle of the table was the remnant of a brown loaf with a piece of cheese on one side of it and a dish of honeycomb on the other there was a pretty good bunch of grapes for each of the guests a moderately sized earthen pitcher nearly full of milk stood at a corner of the board and when baucis had filled two bowls and set them before the strangers only a little milk remained in the bottom of the pitcher alas it is a very sad business when a bountiful heart finds itself pinched and squeezed among narrow circumstances poor baucis kept wishing that she might starve for a week to come if it were possible by so doing to provide these hungry folks a more plentiful supper  and since the supper was so exceedingly small she could not help wishing that their appetites had not been quite so large why at their very first sitting down the travellers both drank off all the milk in their two bowls at a draught  a little more milk kind mother baucis if you please said quicksilver the day has been hot and i am very much athirst  now my dear people answered baucis in great confusion i am so sorry and ashamed but the truth is there is hardly a drop more milk in the pitcher o husband husband why didnt we go without our supper  why it appears to me cried quicksilver starting up from table and taking the pitcher by the handle it really appears to me that matters are not quite so bad as you represent them here is certainly more milk in the pitcher  so saying and to the vast astonishment of baucis he proceeded to fill not only his own bowl but his companions likewise from the pitcher that was supposed to be almost empty the good woman could scarcely believe her eyes she had certainly poured out nearly all the milk and had peeped in afterwards and seen the bottom of the pitcher as she set it down upon the table  but i am old thought baucis to herself and apt to be forgetful i suppose i must have made a mistake at all events the pitcher cannot help being empty now after filling the bowls twice over  what excellent milk observed quicksilver after quaffing the contents of the second bowl excuse me my kind hostess but i must really ask you for a little more  now baucis had seen as plainly as she could see anything that quicksilver had turned the pitcher upside down and consequently had poured out every drop of milk in filling the last bowl of course there could not possibly be any left however in order to let him know precisely how the case was she lifted the pitcher and made a gesture as if pouring milk into quicksilvers bowl but without the remotest idea that any milk would stream forth what was her surprise therefore when such an abundant cascade fell bubbling into the bowl that it was immediately filled to the brim and overflowed upon the table the two snakes that were twisted about quicksilvers staff but neither baucis nor philemon happened to observe this circumstance stretched out their heads and began to lap up the spilt milk  and then what a delicious fragrance the milk had it seemed as if philemons only cow must have pastured that day on the richest herbage that could be found anywhere in the world i only wish that each of you my beloved little souls could have a bowl of such nice milk at suppertime  and now a slice of your brown loaf mother baucis said quicksilver and a little of that honey  baucis cut him a slice accordingly and though the loaf when she and her husband ate of it had been rather too dry and crusty to be palatable it was now as light and moist as if but a few hours out of the oven tasting a crumb which had fallen on the table she found it more delicious than bread ever was before and could hardly believe that it was a loaf of her own kneading and baking yet what other loaf could it possibly be  but oh the honey i may just as well let it alone without trying to describe how exquisitely it smelt and looked its color was that of the purest and most transparent gold and it had the odor of a thousand flowers but of such flowers as never grew in an earthly garden and to seek which the bees must have flown high above the clouds the wonder is that after alighting on a flowerbed of so delicious fragrance and immortal bloom they should have been content to fly down again to their hive in philemons garden never was such honey tasted seen or smelt the perfume floated around the kitchen and made it so delightful that had you closed your eyes you would instantly have forgotten the low ceiling and smoky walls and have fancied yourself in an arbor with celestial honeysuckles creeping over it  although good mother baucis was a simple old dame she could not but think that there was something rather out of the common way in all that had been going on so after helping the guests to bread and honey and laying a bunch of grapes by each of their plates she sat down by philemon and told him what she had seen in a whisper  did you ever hear the like asked she  no i never did answered philemon with a smile and i rather think my dear old wife you have been walking about in a sort of a dream if i had poured out the milk i should have seen through the business at once there happened to be a little more in the pitcher than you thoughtthat is all  ah husband said baucis say what you will these are very uncommon people  well well replied philemon still smiling perhaps they are they certainly do look as if they had seen better days and i am heartily glad to see them making so comfortable a supper  each of the guests had now taken his bunch of grapes upon his plate baucis who rubbed her eyes in order to see the more clearly was of opinion that the clusters had grown larger and richer and that each separate grape seemed to be on the point of bursting with ripe juice it was entirely a mystery to her how such grapes could ever have been produced from the old stunted vine that climbed against the cottage wall  very admirable grapes these observed quicksilver as he swallowed one after another without apparently diminishing his cluster pray my good host whence did you gather them  from my own vine answered philemon you may see one of its branches twisting across the window yonder but wife and i never thought the grapes very fine ones  i never tasted better said the guest another cup of this delicious milk if you please and i shall then have supped better than a prince  this time old philemon bestirred himself and took up the pitcher for he was curious to discover whether there was any reality in the marvels which baucis had whispered to him he knew that his good old wife was incapable of falsehood and that she was seldom mistaken in what she supposed to be true but this was so very singular a case that he wanted to see into it with his own eyes on taking up the pitcher therefore he slyly peeped into it and was fully satisfied that it contained not so much as a single drop all at once however he beheld a little white fountain which gushed up from the bottom of the pitcher and speedily filled it to the brim with foaming and deliciously fragrant milk it was lucky that philemon in his surprise did not drop the miraculous pitcher from his hand  who are ye wonderworking strangers cried he even more bewildered than his wife had been  your guests my good philemon and your friends replied the elder traveller in his mild deep voice that had something at once sweet and aweinspiring in it give me likewise a cup of the milk and may your pitcher never be empty for kind baucis and yourself any more than for the needy wayfarer  the supper being now over the strangers requested to be shown to their place of repose the old people would gladly have talked with them a little longer and have expressed the wonder which they felt and their delight at finding the poor and meagre supper prove so much better and more abundant than they hoped but the elder traveller had inspired them with such reverence that they dared not ask him any questions and when philemon drew quicksilver aside and inquired how under the sun a fountain of milk could have got into an old earthen pitcher this latter personage pointed to his staff  there is the whole mystery of the affair quoth quicksilver and if you can make it out ill thank you to let me know i cant tell what to make of my staff it is always playing such odd tricks as this sometimes getting me a supper and quite as often stealing it away if i had any faith in such nonsense i should say the stick was bewitched  he said no more but looked so slyly in their faces that they rather fancied he was laughing at them the magic staff went hopping at his heels as quicksilver quitted the room when left alone the good old couple spent some little time in conversation about the events of the evening and then lay down on the floor and fell fast asleep they had given up their sleepingroom to the guests and had no other bed for themselves save these planks which i wish had been as soft as their own hearts  the old man and his wife were stirring betimes in the morning and the strangers likewise arose with the sun and made their preparations to depart philemon hospitably entreated them to remain a little longer until baucis could milk the cow and bake a cake upon the hearth and perhaps find them a few fresh eggs for breakfast the guests however seemed to think it better to accomplish a good part of their journey before the heat of the day should come on they therefore persisted in setting out immediately but asked philemon and baucis to walk forth with them a short distance and show them the road which they were to take  so they all four issued from the cottage chatting together like old friends it was very remarkable indeed how familiar the old couple insensibly grew with the elder traveller and how their good and simple spirits melted into his even as two drops of water would melt into the illimitable ocean and as for quicksilver with his keen quick laughing wits he appeared to discover every little thought that but peeped into their minds before they suspected it themselves they sometimes wished it is true that he had not been quite so quickwitted and also that he would fling away his staff which looked so mysteriously mischievous with the snakes always writhing about it but then again quicksilver showed himself so very goodhumored that they would have been rejoiced to keep him in their cottage staff snakes and all every day and the whole day long  ah me welladay exclaimed philemon when they had walked a little way from their door if our neighbors only knew what a blessed thing it is to show hospitality to strangers they would tie up all their dogs and never allow their children to fling another stone  it is a sin and shame for them to behave sothat it is cried good old baucis vehemently and i mean to go this very day and tell some of them what naughty people they are  i fear remarked quicksilver slyly smiling that you will find none of them at home  the elder travellers brow just then assumed such a grave stern and awful grandeur yet serene withal that neither baucis nor philemon dared to speak a word they gazed reverently into his face as if they had been gazing at the sky  when men do not feel towards the humblest stranger as if he were a brother said the traveller in tones so deep that they sounded like those of an organ they are unworthy to exist on earth which was created as the abode of a great human brotherhood  and by the by my dear old people cried quicksilver with the liveliest look of fun and mischief in his eyes where is this same village that you talk about on which side of us does it lie methinks i do not see it hereabouts  philemon and his wife turned towards the valley where at sunset only the day before they had seen the meadows the houses the gardens the clumps of trees the wide greenmargined street with children playing in it and all the tokens of business enjoyment and prosperity but what was their astonishment there was no longer any appearance of a village even the fertile vale in the hollow of which it lay had ceased to have existence in its stead they beheld the broad blue surface of a lake which filled the great basin of the valley from brim to brim and reflected the surrounding hills in its bosom with as tranquil an image as if it had been there ever since the creation of the world for an instant the lake remained perfectly smooth then a little breeze sprang up and caused the water to dance glitter and sparkle in the early sunbeams and to dash with a pleasant rippling murmur against the hither shore  the lake seemed so strangely familiar that the old couple were greatly perplexed and felt as if they could only have been dreaming about a village having lain there but the next moment they remembered the vanished dwellings and the faces and characters of the inhabitants far too distinctly for a dream the village had been there yesterday and now was gone  alas cried these kindhearted old people what has become of our poor neighbors  they exist no longer as men and women said the elder traveller in his grand and deep voice while a roll of thunder seemed to echo it at a distance there was neither use nor beauty in such a life as theirs for they never softened or sweetened the hard lot of mortality by the exercise of kindly affections between man and man they retained no image of the better life in their bosoms therefore the lake that was of old has spread itself forth again to reflect the sky  and as for those foolish people said quicksilver with his mischievous smile they are all transformed to fishes there needed but little change for they were already a scaly set of rascals and the coldestblooded beings in existence so kind mother baucis whenever you or your husband have an appetite for a dish of broiled trout he can throw in a line and pull out half a dozen of your old neighbors  all cried baucis shuddering i would not for the world put one of them on the gridiron  no added philemon making a wry face we could never relish them  as for you good philemon continued the elder travellerand you kind baucisyou with your scanty means have mingled so much heartfelt hospitality with your entertainment of the homeless stranger that the milk became an inexhaustible fount of nectar and the brown loaf and the honey were ambrosia thus the divinities have feasted at your board off the same viands that supply their banquets on olympus you have done well my dear old friends wherefore request whatever favor you have most at heart and it is granted  philemon and baucis looked at one another and theni know not which of the two it was who spoke but that one uttered the desire of both their hearts  let us live together while we live and leave the world at the same instant when we die for we have always loved one another  be it so replied the stranger with majestic kindness now look towards your cottage  they did so but what was their surprise on beholding a tall edifice of white marble with a wideopen portal occupying the spot where their humble residence had so lately stood  there is your home said the stranger beneficently smiling on them both exercise your hospitality in yonder palace as freely as in the poor hovel to which you welcomed us last evening  the old folks fell on their knees to thank him but behold neither he nor quicksilver was there  so philemon and baucis took up their residence in the marble palace and spent their time with vast satisfaction to themselves in making everybody jolly and comfortable who happened to pass that way the milkpitcher i must not forget to say retained its marvellous quality of being never empty when it was desirable to have it full whenever an honest goodhumored and freehearted guest took a draught from this pitcher he invariably found it the sweetest and most invigorating fluid that ever ran down his throat but if a cross and disagreeable curmudgeon happened to sip he was pretty certain to twist his visage into a hard knot and pronounce it a pitcher of sour milk  thus the old couple lived in their palace a great great while and grew older and older and very old indeed at length however there came a summer morning when philemon and baucis failed to make their appearance as on other mornings with one hospitable smile overspreading both their pleasant faces to invite the guests of overnight to breakfast the guests searched everywhere from top to bottom of the spacious palace and all to no purpose but after a great deal of perplexity they espied in front of the portal two venerable trees which nobody could remember to have seen there the day before yet there they stood with their roots fastened deep into the soil and a huge breadth of foliage overshadowing the whole front of the edifice one was an oak and the other a lindentree their boughsit was strange and beautiful to seewere intertwined together and embraced one another so that each tree seemed to live in the other trees bosom much more than in its own  while the guests were marvelling how these trees that must have required at least a century to grow could have come to be so tall and venerable in a single night a breeze sprang up and set their intermingled boughs astir and then there was a deep broad murmur in the air as if the two mysterious trees were speaking  i am old philemon murmured the oak  i am old baucis murmured the lindentree  but as the breeze grew stronger the trees both spoke at oncephilemon baucis baucis philemonas if one were both and both were one and talking together in the depths of their mutual heart it was plain enough to perceive that the good old couple had renewed their age and were now to spend a quiet and delightful hundred years or so philemon as an oak and baucis as a lindentree and oh what a hospitable shade did they fling around them whenever a wayfarer paused beneath it he heard a pleasant whisper of the leaves above his head and wondered how the sound should so much resemble words like these  welcome welcome dear traveller welcome  and some kind soul that knew what would have pleased old baucis and old philemon best built a circular seat around both their trunks where for a great while afterwards the weary and the hungry and the thirsty used to repose themselves and quaff milk abundantly out of the miraculous pitcher  and i wish for all our sakes that we had the pitcher here now  the hillside  after the story  how much did the pitcher hold asked sweet fern it did not hold quite a quart answered the student but you might keep pouring milk out of it till you should fill a hogshead if you pleased the truth is it would run on forever and not be dry even at midsummerwhich is more than can be said of yonder rill that goes babbling down the hillside  and what has become of the pitcher now inquired the little boy  it was broken i am sorry to say about twentyfive thousand years ago replied cousin eustace the people mended it as well as they could but though it would hold milk pretty well it was never afterwards known to fill itself of its own accord so you see it was no better than any other cracked earthen pitcher  what a pity cried all the children at once  the respectable dog ben had accompanied the party as did likewise a halfgrown newfoundland puppy who went by the name of bruin because he was just as black as a bear ben being elderly and of very circumspect habits was respectfully requested by cousin eustace to stay behind with the four little children in order to keep them out of mischief as for black bruin who was himself nothing but a child the student thought it best to take him along lest in his rude play with the other children he should trip them up and send them rolling and tumbling down the hill advising cowslip sweet fern dandelion and squashblossom to sit pretty still in the spot where he left them the student with primrose and the elder children began to ascend and were soon out of sight among the trees   the chim√Üra   baldsummit  introductory to the chim√¶ra  upward along the steep and wooded hillside went eustace bright and his companions the trees were not yet in full leaf but had budded forth sufficiently to throw an airy shadow while the sunshine filled them with green light there were mossgrown rocks half hidden among the old brown fallen leaves there were rotten treetrunks lying at full length where they had long ago fallen there were decayed boughs that had been shaken down by the wintry gales and were scattered everywhere about but still though these things looked so aged the aspect of the wood was that of the newest life for whichever way you turned your eyes something fresh and green was springing forth so as to be ready for the summer  at last the young people reached the upper verge of the wood and found themselves almost at the summit of the hill it was not a peak nor a great round ball but a pretty wide plain or tableland with a house and barn upon it at some distance that house was the home of a solitary family and oftentimes the clouds whence fell the rain and whence the snowstorm drifted down into the valley hung lower than this bleak and lonely dwellingplace  on the highest point of the hill was a heap of stones in the centre of which was stuck a long pole with a little flag fluttering at the end of it eustace led the children thither and bade them look around and see how large a tract of our beautiful world they could take in at a glance and their eyes grew wider as they looked  monument mountain to the southward was still in the centre of the scene but seemed to have sunk and subsided so that it was now but an undistinguished member of a large family of hills beyond it the taconic range looked higher and bulkier than before our pretty lake was seen with all its little bays and inlets and not that alone but two or three new lakes were opening their blue eyes to the sun several white villages each with its steeple were scattered about in the distance there were so many farmhouses with their acres of woodland pasture mowingfields and tillage that the children could hardly make room in their minds to receive all these different objects there too was tanglewood which they had hitherto thought such an important apex of the world it now occupied so small a space that they gazed far beyond it and on either side and searched a good while with all their eyes before discovering whereabout it stood  white fleecy clouds were hanging in the air and threw the dark spots of their shadow here and there over the landscape but by and by the sunshine was where the shadow had been and the shadow was somewhere else  far to the westward was a range of blue mountains which eustace bright told the children were the catskills among those misty hills he said was a spot where some old dutchmen were playing an everlasting game of ninepins and where an idle fellow whose name was rip van winkle had fallen asleep and slept twenty years at a stretch the children eagerly besought eustace to tell them all about this wonderful affair but the student replied that the story had been told once already and better than it ever could be told again and that nobody would have a right to alter a word of it until it should have grown as old as the gorgons head and the three golden apples and the rest of those miraculous legends  at least said periwinkle while we rest ourselves here and are looking about us you can tell us another of your own stories  yes cousin eustace cried primrose i advise you to tell us a story here take some lofty subject or other and see if your imagination will not come up to it perhaps the mountain air may make you poetical for once and no matter how strange and wonderful the story may be now that we are up among the clouds we can believe anything  can you believe asked eustace that there was once a winged horse  yes said saucy primrose but i am afraid you will never be able to catch him  for that matter primrose rejoined the student i might possibly catch pegasus and get upon his back too as well as a dozen other fellows that i know of at any rate here is a story about him and of all places in the world it ought certainly to be told upon a mountaintop  so sitting on the pile of stones while the children clustered themselves at its base eustace fixed his eyes on a white cloud that was sailing by and began as follows   the chim√¶ra  once in the old old times for all the strange things which i tell you about happened long before anybody can remember a fountain gushed out of a hillside in the marvellous land of greece and for aught i know after so many thousand years it is still gushing out of the very selfsame spot at any rate there was the pleasant fountain welling freshly forth and sparkling adown the hillside in the golden sunset when a handsome young man named bellerophon drew near its margin in his hand he held a bridle studded with brilliant gems and adorned with a golden bit seeing an old man and another of middle age and a little boy near the fountain and likewise a maiden who was dipping up some of the water in a pitcher he paused and begged that he might refresh himself with a draught  this is very delicious water he said to the maiden as he rinsed and filled her pitcher after drinking out of it will you be kind enough to tell me whether the fountain has any name  yes it is called the fountain of pirene answered the maiden and then she added my grandmother has told me that this clear fountain was once a beautiful woman and when her son was killed by the arrows of the huntress diana she melted all away into tears and so the water which you find so cool and sweet is the sorrow of that poor mothers heart  i should not have dreamed observed the young stranger that so clear a wellspring with its gush and gurgle and its cheery dance out of the shade into the sunlight had so much as one teardrop in its bosom and this then is pirene i thank you pretty maiden for telling me its name i have come from a faraway country to find this very spot  a middleaged country fellow he had driven his cow to drink out of the spring stared hard at young bellerophon and at the handsome bridle which he carried in his hand  the watercourses must be getting low friend in your part of the world remarked he if you come so far only to find the fountain of pirene but pray have you lost a horse i see you carry the bridle in your hand and a very pretty one it is with that double row of bright stones upon it if the horse was as fine as the bridle you are much to be pitied for losing him  i have lost no horse said bellerophon with a smile but i happen to be seeking a very famous one which as wise people have informed me must be found hereabouts if anywhere do you know whether the winged horse pegasus still haunts the fountain of pirene as he used to do in your forefathers days  but then the country fellow laughed  some of you my little friends have probably heard that this pegasus was a snowwhite steed with beautiful silvery wings who spent most of his time on the summit of mount helicon he was as wild and as swift and as buoyant in his flight through the air as any eagle that ever soared into the clouds there was nothing else like him in the world he had no mate he never had been backed or bridled by a master and for many a long year he led a solitary and a happy life  oh how fine a thing it is to be a winged horse sleeping at night as he did on a lofty mountaintop and passing the greater part of the day in the air pegasus seemed hardly to be a creature of the earth whenever he was seen up very high above peoples heads with the sunshine on his silvery wings you would have thought that he belonged to the sky and that skimming a little too low he had got astray among our mists and vapors and was seeking his way back again it was very pretty to behold him plunge into the fleecy bosom of a bright cloud and be lost in it for a moment or two and then break forth from the other side or in a sullen rainstorm when there was a gray pavement of clouds over the whole sky it would sometimes happen that the winged horse descended right through it and the glad light of the upper region would gleam after him in another instant it is true both pegasus and the pleasant light would be gone away together but any one that was fortunate enough to see this wondrous spectacle felt cheerful the whole day afterwards and as much longer as the storm lasted  in the summertime and in the beautifullest of weather pegasus often alighted on the solid earth and closing his silvery wings would gallop over hill and dale for pastime as fleetly as the wind oftener than in any other place he had been seen near the fountain of pirene drinking the delicious water or rolling himself upon the soft grass of the margin sometimes too but pegasus was very dainty in his food he would crop a few of the cloverblossoms that happened to be sweetest  to the fountain of pirene therefore peoples greatgrandfathers had been in the habit of going as long as they were youthful and retained their faith in winged horses in hopes of getting a glimpse at the beautiful pegasus but of late years he had been very seldom seen indeed there were many of the country folks dwelling within half an hours walk of the fountain who had never beheld pegasus and did not believe that there was any such creature in existence the country fellow to whom bellerophon was speaking chanced to be one of those incredulous persons  and that was the reason why he laughed  pegasus indeed cried he turning up his nose as high as such a flat nose could be turned uppegasus indeed a winged horse truly why friend are you in your senses of what use would wings be to a horse could he drag the plough so well think you to be sure there might be a little saving in the expense of shoes but then how would a man like to see his horse flying out of the stable windowyes or whisking him up above the clouds when he only wanted to ride to mill no no i dont believe in pegasus there never was such a ridiculous kind of a horsefowl made  i have some reason to think otherwise said bellerophon quietly  and then he turned to an old gray man who was leaning on a staff and listening very attentively with his head stretched forward and one hand at his ear because for the last twenty years he had been getting rather deaf  and what say you venerable sir inquired he in your younger days i should imagine you must frequently have seen the winged steed  ah young stranger my memory is very poor said the aged man when i was a lad if i remember rightly i used to believe there was such a horse and so did everybody else but nowadays i hardly know what to think and very seldom think about the winged horse at all if i ever saw the creature it was a long long while ago and to tell you the truth i doubt whether i ever did see him one day to be sure when i was quite a youth i remember seeing some hooftramps round about the brink of the fountain pegasus might have made those hoofmarks and so might some other horse  and have you never seen him my fair maiden asked bellerophon of the girl who stood with the pitcher on her head while this talk went on you certainly could see pegasus if anybody can for your eyes are very bright  once i thought i saw him replied the maiden with a smile and a blush it was either pegasus or a large white bird a very great way up in the air and one other time as i was coming to the fountain with my pitcher i heard a neigh oh such a brisk and melodious neigh as that was my very heart leaped with delight at the sound but it startled me nevertheless so that i ran home without filling my pitcher  that was truly a pity said bellerophon  and he turned to the child whom i mentioned at the beginning of the story and who was gazing at him as children are apt to gaze at strangers with his rosy mouth wide open  well my little fellow cried bellerophon playfully pulling one of his curls i suppose you have often seen the winged horse  that i have answered the child very readily i saw him yesterday and many times before  you are a fine little man said bellerophon drawing the child closer to him come tell me all about it  why replied the child i often come here to sail little boats in the fountain and to gather pretty pebbles out of its basin and sometimes when i look down into the water i see the image of the winged horse in the picture of the sky that is there i wish he would come down and take me on his back and let me ride him up to the moon but if i so much as stir to look at him he flies far away out of sight  and bellerophon put his faith in the child who had seen the image of pegasus in the water and in the maiden who had heard him neigh so melodiously rather than in the middleaged clown who believed only in carthorses or in the old man who had forgotten the beautiful things of his youth  therefore he haunted about the fountain of pirene for a great many days afterwards he kept continually on the watch looking upward at the sky or else down into the water hoping forever that he should see either the reflected image of the winged horse or the marvellous reality he held the bridle with its bright gems and golden bit always ready in his hand the rustic people who dwelt in the neighborhood and drove their cattle to the fountain to drink would often laugh at poor bellerophon and sometimes take him pretty severely to task they told him that an ablebodied young man like himself ought to have better business than to be wasting his time in such an idle pursuit they offered to sell him a horse if he wanted one and when bellerophon declined the purchase they tried to drive a bargain with him for his fine bridle  even the country boys thought him so very foolish that they used to have a great deal of sport about him and were rude enough not to care a fig although bellerophon saw and heard it one little urchin for example would play pegasus and cut the oddest imaginable capers by way of flying while one of his schoolfellows would scamper after him holding forth a twist of bulrushes which was intended to represent bellerophons ornamental bridle but the gentle child who had seen the picture of pegasus in the water comforted the young stranger more than all the naughty boys could torment him the dear little fellow in his playhours often sat down beside him and without speaking a word would look down into the fountain and up towards the sky with so innocent a faith that bellerophon could not help feeling encouraged  now you will perhaps wish to be told why it was that bellerophon had undertaken to catch the winged horse and we shall find no better opportunity to speak about this matter than while he is waiting for pegasus to appear  if i were to relate the whole of bellerophons previous adventures they might easily grow into a very long story it will be quite enough to say that in a certain country of asia a terrible monster called a chim√¶ra had made its appearance and was doing more mischief than could be talked about between now and sunset according to the best accounts which i have been able to obtain this chim√¶ra was nearly if not quite the ugliest and most poisonous creature and the strangest and unaccountablest and the hardest to fight with and the most difficult to run away from that ever came out of the earths inside it had a tail like a boaconstrictor its body was like i do not care what and it had three separate heads one of which was a lions the second a goats and the third an abominably great snakes and a hot blast of fire came flaming out of each of its three mouths being an earthly monster i doubt whether it had any wings but wings or no it ran like a goat and a lion and wriggled along like a serpent and thus contrived to make about as much speed as all the three together  illustration bellerophon by the fountain of pirene  oh the mischief and mischief and mischief that this naughty creature did with its flaming breath it could set a forest on fire or burn up a field of grain or for that matter a village with all its fences and houses it laid waste the whole country round about and used to eat up people and animals alive and cook them afterwards in the burning oven of its stomach mercy on us little children i hope neither you nor i will ever happen to meet a chim√¶ra  while the hateful beast if a beast we can anywise call it was doing all these horrible things it so chanced that bellerophon came to that part of the world on a visit to the king the kings name was iobates and lycia was the country which he ruled over bellerophon was one of the bravest youths in the world and desired nothing so much as to do some valiant and beneficent deed such as would make all mankind admire and love him in those days the only way for a young man to distinguish himself was by fighting battles either with the enemies of his country or with wicked giants or with troublesome dragons or with wild beasts when he could find nothing more dangerous to encounter king iobates perceiving the courage of his youthful visitor proposed to him to go and fight the chim√¶ra which everybody else was afraid of and which unless it should be soon killed was likely to convert lycia into a desert bellerophon hesitated not a moment but assured the king that he would either slay this dreaded chim√¶ra or perish in the attempt  but in the first place as the monster was so prodigiously swift he bethought himself that he should never win the victory by fighting on foot the wisest thing he could do therefore was to get the very best and fleetest horse that could anywhere be found and what other horse in all the world was half so fleet as the marvellous horse pegasus who had wings as well as legs and was even more active in the air than on the earth to be sure a great many people denied that there was any such horse with wings and said that the stories about him were all poetry and nonsense but wonderful as it appeared bellerophon believed that pegasus was a real steed and hoped that he himself might be fortunate enough to find him and once fairly mounted on his back he would be able to fight the chim√¶ra at better advantage  and this was the purpose with which he had travelled from lycia to greece and had brought the beautifully ornamented bridle in his hand it was an enchanted bridle if he could only succeed in putting the golden bit into the mouth of pegasus the winged horse would be submissive and would own bellerophon for his master and fly whithersoever he might choose to turn the rein  but indeed it was a weary and anxious time while bellerophon waited and waited for pegasus in hopes that he would come and drink at the fountain of pirene he was afraid lest king iobates should imagine that he had fled from the chim√¶ra it pained him too to think how much mischief the monster was doing while he himself instead of fighting with it was compelled to sit idly poring over the bright waters of pirene as they gushed out of the sparkling sand and as pegasus came thither so seldom in these latter years and scarcely alighted there more than once in a lifetime bellerophon feared that he might grow an old man and have no strength left in his arms nor courage in his heart before the winged horse would appear oh how heavily passes the time while an adventurous youth is yearning to do his part in life and to gather in the harvest of his renown how hard a lesson it is to wait our life is brief and how much of it is spent in teaching us only this  well was it for bellerophon that the gentle child had grown so fond of him and was never weary of keeping him company every morning the child gave him a new hope to put in his bosom instead of yesterdays withered one  dear bellerophon he would cry looking up hopefully into his face i think we shall see pegasus today  and at length if it had not been for the little boys unwavering faith bellerophon would have given up all hope and would have gone back to lycia and have done his best to slay the chim√¶ra without the help of the winged horse and in that case poor bellerophon would at least have been terribly scorched by the creatures breath and would most probably have been killed and devoured nobody should ever try to fight an earthborn chim√¶ra unless he can first get upon the back of an aerial steed  one morning the child spoke to bellerophon even more hopefully than usual  dear dear bellerophon cried he i know not why it is but i feel as if we should certainly see pegasus today  and all that day he would not stir a step from bellerophons side so they ate a crust of bread together and drank some of the water of the fountain in the afternoon there they sat and bellerophon had thrown his arm around the child who likewise had put one of his little hands into bellerophons the latter was lost in his own thoughts and was fixing his eyes vacantly on the trunks of the trees that overshadowed the fountain and on the grapevines that clambered up among their branches but the gentle child was gazing down into the water he was grieved for bellerophons sake that the hope of another day should be deceived like so many before it and two or three quiet teardrops fell from his eyes and mingled with what were said to be the many tears of pirene when she wept for her slain children  but when he least thought of it bellerophon felt the pressure of the childs little hand and heard a soft almost breathless whisper  see there dear bellerophon there is an image in the water  the young man looked down into the dimpling mirror of the fountain and saw what he took to be the reflection of a bird which seemed to be flying at a great height in the air with a gleam of sunshine on its snowy or silvery wings  what a splendid bird it must be said he and how very large it looks though it must really be flying higher than the clouds  it makes me tremble whispered the child i am afraid to look up into the air it is very beautiful and yet i dare only look at its image in the water dear bellerophon do you not see that it is no bird it is the winged horse pegasus  bellerophons heart began to throb he gazed keenly upward but could not see the winged creature whether bird or horse because just then it had plunged into the fleecy depths of a summer cloud it was but a moment however before the object reappeared sinking lightly down out of the cloud although still at a vast distance from the earth bellerophon caught the child in his arms and shrank back with him so that they were both hidden among the thick shrubbery which grew all around the fountain not that he was afraid of any harm but he dreaded lest if pegasus caught a glimpse of them he would fly far away and alight in some inaccessible mountaintop for it was really the winged horse after they had expected him so long he was coming to quench his thirst with the water of pirene  nearer and nearer came the aerial wonder flying in great circles as you may have seen a dove when about to alight downward came pegasus in those wide sweeping circles which grew narrower and narrower still as he gradually approached the earth the nigher the view of him the more beautiful he was and the more marvellous the sweep of his silvery wings at last with so light a pressure as hardly to bend the grass about the fountain or imprint a hooftramp in the sand of its margin he alighted and stooping his wild head began to drink he drew in the water with long and pleasant sighs and tranquil pauses of enjoyment and then another draught and another and another for nowhere in the world or up among the clouds did pegasus love any water as he loved this of pirene and when his thirst was slaked he cropped a few of the honeyblossoms of the clover delicately tasting them but not caring to make a hearty meal because the herbage just beneath the clouds on the lofty sides of mount helicon suited his palate better than this ordinary grass  after thus drinking to his hearts content and in his dainty fashion condescending to take a little food the winged horse began to caper to and fro and dance as it were out of mere idleness and sport there never was a more playful creature made than this very pegasus so there he frisked in a way that it delights me to think about fluttering his great wings as lightly as ever did a linnet and running little races half on earth and half in air and which i know not whether to call a flight or a gallop when a creature is perfectly able to fly he sometimes chooses to run just for the pastime of the thing and so did pegasus although it cost him some little trouble to keep his hoofs so near the ground bellerophon meanwhile holding the childs hand peeped forth from the shrubbery and thought that never was any sight so beautiful as this nor ever a horses eyes so wild and spirited as those of pegasus it seemed a sin to think of bridling him and riding on his back  once or twice pegasus stopped and snuffed the air pricking up his ears tossing his head and turning it on all sides as if he partly suspected some mischief or other seeing nothing however and hearing no sound he soon began his antics again  at lengthnot that he was weary but only idle and luxuriouspegasus folded his wings and lay down on the soft green turf but being too full of aerial life to remain quiet for many moments together he soon rolled over on his back with his four slender legs in the air it was beautiful to see him this one solitary creature whose mate had never been created but who needed no companion and living a great many hundred years was as happy as the centuries were long the more he did such things as mortal horses are accustomed to do the less earthly and the more wonderful he seemed bellerophon and the child almost held their breath partly from a delightful awe but still more because they dreaded lest the slightest stir or murmur should send him up with the speed of an arrowflight into the farthest blue of the sky  finally when he had had enough of rolling over and over pegasus turned himself about and indolently like any other horse put out his fore legs in order to rise from the ground and bellerophon who had guessed that he would do so darted suddenly from the thicket and leaped astride of his back  yes there he sat on the back of the winged horse  but what a bound did pegasus make when for the first time he felt the weight of a mortal man upon his loins a bound indeed before he had time to draw a breath bellerophon found himself five hundred feet aloft and still shooting upward while the winged horse snorted and trembled with terror and anger upward he went up up up until he plunged into the cold misty bosom of a cloud at which only a little while before bellerophon had been gazing and fancying it a very pleasant spot then again out of the heart of the cloud pegasus shot down like a thunderbolt as if he meant to dash both himself and his rider headlong against a rock then he went through about a thousand of the wildest caprioles that had ever been performed either by a bird or a horse  i cannot tell you half that he did he skimmed straight forward and sideways and backward he reared himself erect with his fore legs on a wreath of mist and his hind legs on nothing at all he flung out his heels behind and put down his head between his legs with his wings pointing right upward at about two miles height above the earth he turned a somerset so that bellerophons heels were where his head should have been and he seemed to look down into the sky instead of up he twisted his head about and looking bellerophon in the face with fire flashing from his eyes made a terrible attempt to bite him he fluttered his pinions so wildly that one of the silver feathers was shaken out and floating earthward was picked up by the child who kept it as long as he lived in memory of pegasus and bellerophon  but the latter who as you may judge was as good a horseman as ever galloped had been watching his opportunity and at last clapped the golden bit of the enchanted bridle between the winged steeds jaws no sooner was this done than pegasus became as manageable as if he had taken food all his life out of bellerophons hand to speak what i really feel it was almost a sadness to see so wild a creature grow suddenly so tame and pegasus seemed to feel it so likewise he looked round to bellerophon with the tears in his beautiful eyes instead of the fire that so recently flashed from them but when bellerophon patted his head and spoke a few authoritative yet kind and soothing words another look came into the eyes of pegasus for he was glad at heart after so many lonely centuries to have found a companion and a master  thus it always is with winged horses and with all such wild and solitary creatures if you can catch and overcome them it is the surest way to win their love  while pegasus had been doing his utmost to shake bellerophon off his back he had flown a very long distance and they had come within sight of a lofty mountain by the time the bit was in his mouth bellerophon had seen this mountain before and knew it to be helicon on the summit of which was the winged horses abode thither after looking gently into his riders face as if to ask leave pegasus now flew and alighting waited patiently until bellerophon should please to dismount the young man accordingly leaped from his steeds back but still held him fast by the bridle meeting his eyes however he was so affected by the gentleness of his aspect and by the thought of the free life which pegasus had heretofore lived that he could not bear to keep him a prisoner if he really desired his liberty  obeying this generous impulse he slipped the enchanted bridle off the head of pegasus and took the bit from his mouth  leave me pegasus said he either leave me or love me  in an instant the winged horse shot almost out of sight soaring straight upward from the summit of mount helicon being long after sunset it was now twilight on the mountaintop and dusky evening over all the country round about but pegasus flew so high that he overtook the departed day and was bathed in the upper radiance of the sun ascending higher and higher he looked like a bright speck and at last could no longer be seen in the hollow waste of the sky and bellerophon was afraid that he should never behold him more but while he was lamenting his own folly the bright speck reappeared and drew nearer and nearer until it descended lower than the sunshine and behold pegasus had come back after this trial there was no more fear of the winged horses making his escape he and bellerophon were friends and put loving faith in one another  that night they lay down and slept together with bellerophons arm about the neck of pegasus not as a caution but for kindness and they awoke at peep of day and bade one another good morning each in his own language  in this manner bellerophon and the wondrous steed spent several days and grew better acquainted and fonder of each other all the time they went on long aerial journeys and sometimes ascended so high that the earth looked hardly bigger thanthe moon they visited distant countries and amazed the inhabitants who thought that the beautiful young man on the back of the winged horse must have come down out of the sky a thousand miles a day was no more than an easy space for the fleet pegasus to pass over bellerophon was delighted with this kind of life and would have liked nothing better than to live always in the same way aloft in the clear atmosphere for it was always sunny weather up there however cheerless and rainy it might be in the lower region but he could not forget the horrible chim√¶ra which he had promised king iobates to slay so at last when he had become well accustomed to feats of horsemanship in the air and could manage pegasus with the least motion of his hand and had taught him to obey his voice he determined to attempt the performance of this perilous adventure  at daybreak therefore as soon as he unclosed his eyes he gently pinched the winged horses ear in order to arouse him pegasus immediately started from the ground and pranced about a quarter of a mile aloft and made a grand sweep around the mountaintop by way of showing that he was wide awake and ready for any kind of an excursion during the whole of this little flight he uttered a loud brisk and melodious neigh and finally came down at bellerophons side as lightly as ever you saw a sparrow hop upon a twig  well done dear pegasus well done my skyskimmer cried bellerophon fondly stroking the horses neck and now my fleet and beautiful friend we must break our fast today we are to fight the terrible chim√¶ra  as soon as they had eaten their morning meal and drank some sparkling water from a spring called hippocrene pegasus held out his head of his own accord so that his master might put on the bridle then with a great many playful leaps and airy caperings he showed his impatience to be gone while bellerophon was girding on his sword and hanging his shield about his neck and preparing himself for battle when everything was ready the rider mounted and as was his custom when going a long distance ascended five miles perpendicularly so as the better to see whither he was directing his course he then turned the head of pegasus towards the east and set out for lycia in their flight they overtook an eagle and came so nigh him before he could get out of their way that bellerophon might easily have caught him by the leg hastening onward at this rate it was still early in the forenoon when they beheld the lofty mountains of lycia with their deep and shaggy valleys if bellerophon had been told truly it was in one of those dismal valleys that the hideous chim√¶ra had taken up its abode  being now so near their journeys end the winged horse gradually descended with his rider and they took advantage of some clouds that were floating over the mountaintops in order to conceal themselves hovering on the upper surface of a cloud and peeping over its edge bellerophon had a pretty distinct view of the mountainous part of lycia and could look into all its shadowy vales at once at first there appeared to be nothing remarkable it was a wild savage and rocky tract of high and precipitous hills in the more level part of the country there were the ruins of houses that had been burnt and here and there the carcasses of dead cattle strewn about the pastures where they had been feeding  the chim√¶ra must have done this mischief thought bellerophon but where can the monster be  as i have already said there was nothing remarkable to be detected at first sight in any of the valleys and dells that lay among the precipitous heights of the mountains nothing at all unless indeed it were three spires of black smoke which issued from what seemed to be the mouth of a cavern and clambered sullenly into the atmosphere before reaching the mountaintop these three black smokewreaths mingled themselves into one the cavern was almost directly beneath the winged horse and his rider at the distance of about a thousand feet the smoke as it crept heavily upward had an ugly sulphurous stifling scent which caused pegasus to snort and bellerophon to sneeze so disagreeable was it to the marvellous steed who was accustomed to breathe only the purest air that he waved his wings and shot half a mile out of the range of this offensive vapor  but on looking behind him bellerophon saw something that induced him first to draw the bridle and then to turn pegasus about he made a sign which the winged horse understood and sunk slowly through the air until his hoofs were scarcely more than a mans height above the rocky bottom of the valley in front as far off as you could throw a stone was the caverns mouth with the three smokewreaths oozing out of it and what else did bellerophon behold there  there seemed to be a heap of strange and terrible creatures curled up within the cavern their bodies lay so close together that bellerophon could not distinguish them apart but judging by their heads one of these creatures was a huge snake the second a fierce lion and the third an ugly goat the lion and the goat were asleep the snake was broad awake and kept staring around him with a great pair of fiery eyes butand this was the most wonderful part of the matterthe three spires of smoke evidently issued from the nostrils of these three heads so strange was the spectacle that though bellerophon had been all along expecting it the truth did not immediately occur to him that here was the terrible threeheaded chim√¶ra he had found out the chim√¶ras cavern the snake the lion and the goat as he supposed them to be were not three separate creatures but one monster  the wicked hateful thing slumbering as two thirds of it were it still held in its abominable claws the remnant of an unfortunate lambor possibly but i hate to think so it was a dear little boywhich its three mouths had been gnawing before two of them fell asleep  all at once bellerophon started as from a dream and knew it to be the chim√¶ra pegasus seemed to know it at the same instant and sent forth a neigh that sounded like the call of a trumpet to battle at this sound the three heads reared themselves erect and belched out great flashes of flame before bellerophon had time to consider what to do next the monster flung itself out of the cavern and sprung straight towards him with its immense claws extended and its snaky tail twisting itself venomously behind if pegasus had not been as nimble as a bird both he and his rider would have been overthrown by the chimeras headlong rush and thus the battle have been ended before it was well begun but the winged horse was not to be caught so in the twinkling of an eye he was up aloft halfway to the clouds snorting with anger he shuddered too not with affright but with utter disgust at the loathsomeness of this poisonous thing with three heads  the chim√¶ra on the other hand raised itself up so as to stand absolutely on the tipend of its tail with its talons pawing fiercely in the air and its three heads spluttering fire at pegasus and his rider my stars how it roared and hissed and bellowed bellerophon meanwhile was fitting his shield on his arm and drawing his sword  now my beloved pegasus he whispered in the winged horses ear thou must help me to slay this insufferable monster or else thou shalt fly back to thy solitary mountainpeak without thy friend bellerophon for either the chim√¶ra dies or its three mouths shall gnaw this head of mine which has slumbered upon thy neck  pegasus whinnied and turning back his head rubbed his nose tenderly against his riders cheek it was his way of telling him that though he had wings and was an immortal horse yet he would perish if it were possible for immortality to perish rather than leave bellerophon behind  i thank you pegasus answered bellerophon now then let us make a dash at the monster  uttering these words he shook the bridle and pegasus darted down aslant as swift as the flight of an arrow right towards the chim√¶ras threefold head which all this time was poking itself as high as it could into the air as he came within armslength bellerophon made a cut at the monster but was carried onward by his steed before he could see whether the blow had been successful pegasus continued his course but soon wheeled round at about the same distance from the chim√¶ra as before bellerophon then perceived that he had cut the goats head of the monster almost off so that it dangled downward by the skin and seemed quite dead  but to make amends the snakes head and the lions head had taken all the fierceness of the dead one into themselves and spit flame and hissed and roared with a vast deal more fury than before  never mind my brave pegasus cried bellerophon with another stroke like that we will stop either its hissing or its roaring  and again he shook the bridle dashing aslantwise as before the winged horse made another arrowflight towards the chim√¶ra and bellerophon aimed another downright stroke at one of the two remaining heads as he shot by but this time neither he nor pegasus escaped so well as at first with one of its claws the chim√¶ra had given the young man a deep scratch in his shoulder and had slightly damaged the left wing of the flying steed with the other on his part bellerophon had mortally wounded the lions head of the monster insomuch that it now hung downward with its fire almost extinguished and sending out gasps of thick black smoke the snakes head however which was the only one now left was twice as fierce and venomous as ever before it belched forth shoots of fire five hundred yards long and emitted hisses so loud so harsh and so earpiercing that king iobates heard them fifty miles off and trembled till the throne shook under him  welladay thought the poor king the chim√¶ra is certainly coming to devour me  meanwhile pegasus had again paused in the air and neighed angrily while sparkles of a pure crystal flame darted out of his eyes how unlike the lurid fire of the chim√¶ra the aerial steeds spirit was all aroused and so was that of bellerophon  dost thou bleed my immortal horse cried the young man caring less for his own hurt than for the anguish of this glorious creature that ought never to have tasted pain the execrable chim√¶ra shall pay for this mischief with his last head  then he shook the bridle shouted loudly and guided pegasus not aslantwise as before but straight at the monsters hideous front so rapid was the onset that it seemed but a dazzle and a flash before bellerophon was at close gripes with his enemy  the chim√¶ra by this time after losing its second head had got into a redhot passion of pain and rampant rage it so flounced about half on earth and partly in the air that it was impossible to say which element it rested upon it opened its snakejaws to such an abominable width that pegasus might almost i was going to say have flown right down its throat wings outspread rider and all at their approach it shot out a tremendous blast of its fiery breath and enveloped bellerophon and his steed in a perfect atmosphere of flame singeing the wings of pegasus scorching off one whole side of the young mans golden ringlets and making them both far hotter than was comfortable from head to foot  but this was nothing to what followed  when the airy rush of the winged horse had brought him within the distance of a hundred yards the chim√¶ra gave a spring and flung its huge awkward venomous and utterly detestable carcass right upon poor pegasus clung round him with might and main and tied up its snaky tail into a knot up flew the aerial steed higher higher higher above the mountainpeaks above the clouds and almost out of sight of the solid earth but still the earthborn monster kept its hold and was borne upward along with the creature of light and air bellerophon meanwhile turning about found himself face to face with the ugly grimness of the chim√¶ras visage and could only avoid being scorched to death or bitten right in twain by holding up his shield over the upper edge of the shield he looked sternly into the savage eyes of the monster  but the chim√¶ra was so mad and wild with pain that it did not guard itself so well as might else have been the case perhaps after all the best way to fight a chim√¶ra is by getting as close to it as you can in its efforts to stick its horrible iron claws into its enemy the creature left its own breast quite exposed and perceiving this bellerophon thrust his sword up to the hilt into its cruel heart immediately the snaky tail untied its knot the monster let go its hold of pegasus and fell from that vast height downward while the fire within its bosom instead of being put out burned fiercer than ever and quickly began to consume the dead carcass thus it fell out of the sky all aflame and it being nightfall before it reached the earth was mistaken for a shooting star or a comet but at early sunrise some cottagers were going to their days labor and saw to their astonishment that several acres of ground were strewn with black ashes in the middle of a field there was a heap of whitened bones a great deal higher than a haystack nothing else was ever seen of the dreadful chim√¶ra  and when bellerophon had won the victory he bent forward and kissed pegasus while the tears stood in his eyes  back now my beloved steed said he back to the fountain of pirene  pegasus skimmed through the air quicker than ever he did before and reached the fountain in a very short time and there he found the old man leaning on his staff and the country fellow watering his cow and the pretty maiden filling her pitcher  i remember now quoth the old man i saw this winged horse once before when i was quite a lad but he was ten times handsomer in those days  i own a carthorse worth three of him said the country fellow if this pony were mine the first thing i should do would be to clip his wings  but the poor maiden said nothing for she had always the luck to be afraid at the wrong time so she ran away and let her pitcher tumble down and broke it  where is the gentle child asked bellerophon who used to keep me company and never lost his faith and never was weary of gazing into the fountain  here am i dear bellerophon said the child softly  for the little boy had spent day after day on the margin of pirene waiting for his friend to come back but when he perceived bellerophon descending through the clouds mounted on the winged horse he had shrunk back into the shrubbery he was a delicate and tender child and dreaded lest the old man and the country fellow should see the tears gushing from his eyes  thou hast won the victory said he joyfully running to the knee of bellerophon who still sat on the back of pegasus i knew thou wouldst  yes dear child replied bellerophon alighting from the winged horse but if thy faith had not helped me i should never have waited for pegasus and never have gone up above the clouds and never have conquered the terrible chim√¶ra thou my beloved little friend hast done it all and now let us give pegasus his liberty  so he slipped off the enchanted bridle from the head of the marvellous steed  be free forevermore my pegasus cried he with a shade of sadness in his tone be as free as thou art fleet  but pegasus rested his head on bellerophons shoulder and would not be persuaded to take flight  well then said bellerophon caressing the airy horse thou shalt be with me as long as thou wilt and we will go together forthwith and tell king iobates that the chim√¶ra is destroyed  then bellerophon embraced the gentle child and promised to come to him again and departed but in after years that child took higher flights upon the aerial steed than ever did bellerophon and achieved more honorable deeds than his friends victory over the chim√¶ra for gentle and tender as he was he grew to be a mighty poet   baldsummit  after the story  eustace bright told the legend of bellerophon with as much fervor and animation as if he had really been taking a gallop on the winged horse at the conclusion he was gratified to discern by the glowing countenances of his auditors how greatly they had been interested all their eyes were dancing in their heads except those of primrose in her eyes there were positively tears for she was conscious of something in the legend which the rest of them were not yet old enough to feel childs story as it was the student had contrived to breathe through it the ardor the generous hope and the imaginative enterprise of youth  i forgive you now primrose said he for all your ridicule of myself and my stories one tear pays for a great deal of laughter  well mr bright answered primrose wiping her eyes and giving him another of her mischievous smiles it certainly does elevate your ideas to get your head above the clouds i advise you never to tell another story unless it be as at present from the top of a mountain  or from the back of pegasus replied eustace laughing dont you think that i succeeded pretty well in catching that wonderful pony  it was so like one of your madcap pranks cried primrose clapping her hands i think i see you now on his back two miles high and with your head downward it is well that you have not really an opportunity of trying your horsemanship on any wilder steed than our sober davy or old hundred  illustration the fountain of pirene  from the original in the collection of austin m purves esqre philadelphia  for my part i wish i had pegasus here at this moment said the student i would mount him forthwith and gallop about the country within a circumference of a few miles making literary calls on my brother authors dr dewey would be within my reach at the foot of taconic in stockbridge yonder is mr james conspicuous to all the world on his mountainpile of history and romance longfellow i believe is not yet at the oxbow else the winged horse would neigh at the sight of him but here in lenox i should find our most truthful novelist who has made the scenery and life of berkshire all her own on the hither side of pittsfield sits herman melville shaping out the gigantic conception of his white whale while the gigantic shape of graylock looms upon him from his studywindow another bound of my flying steed would bring me to the door of holmes whom i mention last because pegasus would certainly unseat me the next minute and claim the poet as his rider  have we not an author for our next neighbor asked primrose that silent man who lives in the old red house near tanglewood avenue and whom we sometimes meet with two children at his side in the woods or at the lake i think i have heard of his having written a poem or a romance or an arithmetic or a schoolhistory or some other kind of a book  hush primrose hush exclaimed eustace in a thrilling whisper and putting his finger on his lip not a word about that man even on a hilltop if our babble were to reach his ears and happen not to please him he has but to fling a quire or two of paper into the stove and you primrose and i and periwinkle sweet fern squashblossom blue eye huckleberry clover cowslip plantain milkweed dandelion and buttercupyes and wise mr pringle with his unfavorable criticisms on my legends and poor mrs pringle toowould all turn to smoke and go whisking up the funnel our neighbor in the red house is a harmless sort of person enough for aught i know as concerns the rest of the world but something whispers to me that he has a terrible power over ourselves extending to nothing short of annihilation  and would tanglewood turn to smoke as well as we asked periwinkle quite appalled at the threatened destruction and what would become of ben and bruin  tanglewood would remain replied the student looking just as it does now but occupied by an entirely different family and ben and bruin would be still alive and would make themselves very comfortable with the bones from the dinnertable without ever thinking of the good times which they and we have had together  what nonsense you are talking exclaimed primrose  with idle chat of this kind the party had already begun to descend the hill and were now within the shadow of the woods primrose gathered some mountainlaurel the leaf of which though of last years growth was still as verdant and elastic as if the frost and thaw had not alternately tried their force upon its texture of these twigs of laurel she twined a wreath and took off the students cap in order to place it on his brow  nobody else is likely to crown you for your stories observed saucy primrose so take this from me  do not be too sure answered eustace looking really like a youthful poet with the laurel among his glossy curls that i shall not win other wreaths by these wonderful and admirable stories i mean to spend all my leisure during the rest of the vacation and throughout the summer term at college in writing them out for the press mr j t fields with whom i became acquainted when he was in berkshire last summer and who is a poet as well as a publisher will see their uncommon merit at a glance he will get them illustrated i hope by billings and will bring them before the world under the very best of auspices through the eminent house of ticknor  co in about five months from this moment i make no doubt of being reckoned among the lights of this age  poor boy said primrose half aside what a disappointment awaits him  descending a little lower bruin began to bark and was answered by the graver bowwow of the respectable ben they soon saw the good old dog keeping careful watch over dandelion sweet fern cowslip and squashblossom these little people quite recovered from their fatigue had set about gathering checkerberries and now came clambering to meet their playfellows thus reunited the whole party went down through luther butlers orchard and made the best of their way home to tanglewood     tanglewood tales  for girls and boys  being a second wonderbook     tanglewood tales     the wayside   introductory  a short time ago i was favored with a flying visit from my young friend eustace bright whom i had not before met with since quitting the breezy mountains of berkshire it being the winter vacation at his college eustace was allowing himself a little relaxation in the hope he told me of repairing the inroads which severe application to study had made upon his health and i was happy to conclude from the excellent physical condition in which i saw him that the remedy had already been attended with very desirable success he had now run up from boston by the noon train partly impelled by the friendly regard with which he is pleased to honor me and partly as i soon found on a matter of literary business  it delighted me to receive mr bright for the first time under a roof though a very humble one which i could really call my own nor did i fail as is the custom of landed proprietors all about the world to parade the poor fellow up and down over my half a dozen acres secretly rejoicing nevertheless that the disarray of the inclement season and particularly the six inches of snow then upon the ground prevented him from observing the ragged neglect of soil and shrubbery into which the place has lapsed it was idle however to imagine that an airy guest from monument mountain baldsummit and old graylock shaggy with primeval forests could see anything to admire in my poor little hillside with its growth of frail and insecteaten locusttrees eustace very frankly called the view from my hilltop tame and so no doubt it was after rough broken rugged headlong berkshire and especially the northern parts of the county with which his college residence had made him familiar but to me there is a peculiar quiet charm in these broad meadows and gentle eminences they are better than mountains because they do not stamp and stereotype themselves into the brain and thus grow wearisome with the same strong impression repeated day after day a few summer weeks among mountains a lifetime among green meadows and placid slopes with outlines forever new because continually fading out of the memorysuch would be my sober choice  i doubt whether eustace did not internally pronounce the whole thing a bore until i led him to my predecessors little ruined rustic summerhouse midway on the hillside it is a mere skeleton of slender decaying treetrunks with neither walls nor a roof nothing but a tracery of branches and twigs which the next wintry blast will be very likely to scatter in fragments along the terrace it looks and is as evanescent as a dream and yet in its rustic network of boughs it has somehow enclosed a hint of spiritual beauty and has become a true emblem of the subtile and ethereal mind that planned it i made eustace bright sit down on a snowbank which bad heaped itself over the mossy seat and gazing through the arched window opposite he acknowledged that the scene at once grew picturesque  simple as it looks said he this little edifice seems to be the work of magic it is full of suggestiveness and in its way is as good as a cathedral ah it would be just the spot for one to sit in of a summer afternoon and tell the children some more of those wild stories from the classic myths  it would indeed answered i the summerhouse itself so airy and so broken is like one of those old tales imperfectly remembered and these living branches of the baldwin appletree thrusting themselves so rudely in are like your unwarrantable interpolations but by the by have you added any more legends to the series since the publication of the wonder book  many more said eustace primrose periwinkle and the rest of them allow me no comfort of my life unless i tell them a story every day or two i have run away from home partly to escape the importunity of those little wretches but i have written out six of the new stories and have brought them for you to look over  are they as good as the first i inquired  better chosen and better handled replied eustace bright you will say so when you read them  possibly not i remarked i know from my own experience that an authors last work is always his best one in his own estimate until it quite loses the red heat of composition after that it falls into its true place quietly enough but let us adjourn to my study and examine these new stories it would hardly be doing yourself justice were you to bring me acquainted with them sitting here on this snowbank  so we descended the hill to my small old cottage and shut ourselves up in the southeastern room where the sunshine comes in warmly and brightly through the better half of a winters day eustace put his bundle of manuscript into my hands and i skimmed through it pretty rapidly trying to find out its merits and demerits by the touch of my fingers as a veteran storyteller ought to know how to do  it will be remembered that mr bright condescended to avail himself of my literary experience by constituting me editor of the wonder book as he had no reason to complain of the reception of that erudite work by the public he was now disposed to retain me in a similar position with respect to the present volume which he entitled tanglewood tales not as eustace hinted that there was any real necessity for my services as introductor inasmuch as his own name had become established in some good degree of favor with the literary world but the connection with myself he was kind enough to say had been highly agreeable nor was he by any means desirous as most people are of kicking away the ladder that had perhaps helped him to reach his present elevation my young friend was willing in short that the fresh verdure of his growing reputation should spread over my straggling and halfnaked boughs even as i have sometimes thought of training a vine with its broad leafiness and purple fruitage over the wormeaten posts and rafters of the rustic summerhouse i was not insensible to the advantages of his proposal and gladly assured him of my acceptance  merely from the titles of the stories i saw at once that the subjects were not less rich than those of the former volume nor did i at all doubt that mr brights audacity so far as that endowment might avail had enabled him to take full advantage of whatever capabilities they offered yet in spite of my experience of his free way of handling them i did not quite see i confess how he could have obviated all the difficulties in the way of rendering them presentable to children these old legends so brimming over with everything that is most abhorrent to our christianized moral sensesome of them so hideous others so melancholy and miserable amid which the greek tragedians sought their themes and moulded them into the sternest forms of grief that ever the world saw was such material the stuff that childrens playthings should be made of how were they to be purified how was the blessed sunshine to be thrown into them  but eustace told me that these myths were the most singular things in the world and that he was invariably astonished whenever he began to relate one by the readiness with which it adapted itself to the childish purity of his auditors the objectionable characteristics seem to be a parasitical growth having no essential connection with the original fable they fall away and are thought of no more the instant he puts his imagination in sympathy with the innocent little circle whose wideopen eyes are fixed so eagerly upon him thus the stories not by any strained effort of the narrators but in harmony with their inherent germ transform themselves and reassume the shapes which they might be supposed to possess in the pure childhood of the world when the first poet or romancer told these marvellous legends such is eustace brights opinion it was still the golden age evil had never yet existed and sorrow misfortune crime were mere shadows which the mind fancifully created for itself as a shelter against too sunny realities or at most but prophetic dreams to which the dreamer himself did not yield a waking credence children are now the only representatives of the men and women of that happy era and therefore it is that we must raise the intellect and fancy to the level of childhood in order to recreate the original myths  i let the youthful author talk as much and as extravagantly as he pleased and was glad to see him commencing life with such confidence in himself and his performances a few years will do all that is necessary towards showing him the truth in both respects meanwhile it is but right to say he does really appear to have overcome the moral objections against these fables although at the expense of such liberties with their structure as must be left to plead their own excuse without any help from me indeed except that there was a necessity for itand that the inner life of the legends cannot be come at save by making them entirely ones own propertythere is no defence to be made  eustace informed me that he had told his stories to the children in various situationsin the woods on the shore of the lake in the dell of shadow brook in the playroom at tanglewood fireside and in a magnificent palace of snow with ice windows which he helped his little friends to build his auditors were even more delighted with the contents of the present volume than with the specimens which have already been given to the world the classically learned mr pringle too had listened to two or three of the tales and censured them even more bitterly than he did the three golden apples so that what with praise and what with criticism eustace bright thinks that there is good hope of at least as much success with the public as in the case of the wonder book  i made all sorts of inquiries about the children not doubting that there would be great eagerness to hear of their welfare among some good little folks who have written to me to ask for another volume of myths they are all i am happy to say unless we except clover in excellent health and spirits primrose is now almost a young lady and eustace tells me is just as saucy as ever she pretends to consider herself quite beyond the age to be interested by such idle stories as these but for all that whenever a story is to be told primrose never fails to be one of the listeners and to make fun of it when finished periwinkle is very much grown and is expected to shut up her babyhouse and throw away her doll in a month or two more sweet fern has learned to read and write and has put on a jacket and pair of pantaloonsall of which improvements i am sorry for squashblossom blue eye plantain and buttercup have had the scarlet fever but came easily through it huckleberry milkweed and dandelion were attacked with the hoopingcough but bore it bravely and kept out of doors whenever the sun shone cowslip during the autumn had either the measles or some eruption that looked very much like it but was hardly sick a day poor clover has been a good deal troubled with her second teeth which have made her meagre in aspect and rather fractious in temper nor even when she smiles is the matter much mended since it discloses a gap just within her lips almost as wide as the barn door but all this will pass over and it is predicted that she will turn out a very pretty girl  as for mr bright himself he is now in his senior year at williams college and has a prospect of graduating with some degree of honorable distinction at the next commencement in his oration for the bachelors degree he gives me to understand he will treat of the classical myths viewed in the aspect of baby stories and has a great mind to discuss the expediency of using up the whole of ancient history for the same purpose i do not know what he means to do with himself after leaving college but trust that by dabbling so early with the dangerous and seductive business of authorship he will not be tempted to become an author by profession if so i shall be very sorry for the little that i have had to do with the matter in encouraging these first beginnings  i wish there were any likelihood of my soon seeing primrose periwinkle dandelion sweet fern clover plantain huckleberry milkweed cowslip buttercup blue eye and squashblossom again but as i do not know when i shall revisit tanglewood and as eustace bright probably will not ask me to edit a third wonder book the public of little folks must not expect to hear any more about those dear children from me heaven bless them and everybody else whether grown people or children      the wayside concord mass      march 13 1853     the minotaur   in the old city of troezene at the foot of a lofty mountain there lived a very long time ago a little boy named theseus his grandfather king pittheus was the sovereign of that country and was reckoned a very wise man so that theseus being brought up in the royal palace and being naturally a bright lad could hardly fail of profiting by the old kings instructions his mothers name was √Üthra as for his father the boy had never seen him but from his earliest remembrance √Üthra used to go with little theseus into a wood and sit down upon a mossgrown rock which was deeply sunk into the earth here she often talked with her son about his father and said that he was called √Ügeus and that he was a great king and ruled over attica and dwelt at athens which was as famous a city as any in the world theseus was very fond of hearing about king √Ügeus and often asked his good mother √Üthra why he did not come and live with them at troezene  ah my dear son answered √Üthra with a sigh a monarch has his people to take care of the men and women over whom he rules are in the place of children to him and he can seldom spare time to love his own children as other parents do your father will never be able to leave his kingdom for the sake of seeing his little boy  well but dear mother asked the boy why cannot i go to this famous city of athens and tell king √Ügeus that i am his son  that may happen by and by said √Üthra be patient and we shall see you are not yet big and strong enough to set out on such an errand  and how soon shall i be strong enough theseus persisted in inquiring  you are but a tiny boy as yet replied his mother see if you can lift this rock on which we are sitting  the little fellow had a great opinion of his own strength so grasping the rough protuberances of the rock he tugged and toiled amain and got himself quite out of breath without being able to stir the heavy stone it seemed to be rooted into the ground no wonder he could not move it for it would have taken all the force of a very strong man to lift it out of its earthy bed  his mother stood looking on with a sad kind of a smile on her lips and in her eyes to see the zealous and yet puny efforts of her little boy she could not help being sorrowful at finding him already so impatient to begin his adventures in the world  you see how it is my dear theseus said she you must possess far more strength than now before i can trust you to go to athens and tell king √Ügeus that you are his son but when you can lift this rock and show me what is hidden beneath it i promise you my permission to depart  often and often after this did theseus ask his mother whether it was yet time for him to go to athens and still his mother pointed to the rock and told him that for years to come he could not be strong enough to move it and again and again the rosycheeked and curlyheaded boy would tug and strain at the huge mass of stone striving child as he was to do what a giant could hardly have done without taking both of his great hands to the task meanwhile the rock seemed to be sinking farther and farther into the ground the moss grew over it thicker and thicker until at last it looked almost like a soft green seat with only a few gray knobs of granite peeping out the overhanging trees also shed their brown leaves upon it as often as the autumn came and at its base grew ferns and wild flowers some of which crept quite over its surface to all appearance the rock was as firmly fastened as any other portion of the earths substance  but difficult as the matter looked theseus was now growing up to be such a vigorous youth that in his own opinion the time would quickly come when he might hope to get the upper hand of this ponderous lump of stone  mother i do believe it has started cried he after one of his attempts the earth around it is certainly a little cracked  no no child his mother hastily answered it is not possible you can have moved it such a boy as you still are  nor would she be convinced although theseus showed her the place where he fancied that the stem of a flower had been partly uprooted by the movement of the rock but √Üthra sighed and looked disquieted for no doubt she began to be conscious that her son was no longer a child and that in a little while hence she must send him forth among the perils and troubles of the world  it was not more than a year afterwards when they were again sitting on the mosscovered stone √Üthra had once more told him the oftrepeated story of his father and how gladly he would receive theseus at his stately palace and how he would present him to his courtiers and the people and tell them that here was the heir of his dominions the eyes of theseus glowed with enthusiasm and he would hardly sit still to hear his mother speak  dear mother √Üthra he exclaimed i never felt half so strong as now i am no longer a child nor a boy nor a mere youth i feel myself a man it is now time to make one earnest trial to remove the stone  ah my dearest theseus replied his mother not yet not yet  yes mother said he resolutely the time has come  then theseus bent himself in good earnest to the task and strained every sinew with manly strength and resolution he put his whole brave heart into the effort he wrestled with the big and sluggish stone as if it had been a living enemy he heaved he lifted he resolved now to succeed or else to perish there and let the rock be his monument forever √Üthra stood gazing at him and clasped her hands partly with a mothers pride and partly with a mothers sorrow the great rock stirred yes it was raised slowly from the bedded moss and earth uprooting the shrubs and flowers along with it and was turned upon its side theseus had conquered  while taking breath he looked joyfully at his mother and she smiled upon him through her tears  yes theseus she said the time has come and you must stay no longer at my side see what king √Ügeus your royal father left for you beneath the stone when he lifted it in his mighty arms and laid it on the spot whence you have now removed it  theseus looked and saw that the rock had been placed over another slab of stone containing a cavity within it so that it somewhat resembled a roughly made chest or coffer of which the upper mass had served as the lid within the cavity lay a sword with a golden hilt and a pair of sandals  that was your fathers sword said √Üthra and those were his sandals when he went to be king of athens he bade me treat you as a child until you should prove yourself a man by lifting this heavy stone that task being accomplished you are to put on his sandals in order to follow in your fathers footsteps and to gird on his sword so that you may fight giants and dragons as king √Ügeus did in his youth  i will set out for athens this very day cried theseus  but his mother persuaded him to stay a day or two longer while she got ready some necessary articles for his journey when his grandfather the wise king pittheus heard that theseus intended to present himself at his fathers palace he earnestly advised him to get on board of a vessel and go by sea because he might thus arrive within fifteen miles of athens without either fatigue or danger  the roads are very bad by land quoth the venerable king and they are terribly infested with robbers and monsters a mere lad like theseus is not fit to be trusted on such a perilous journey all by himself no no let him go by sea  but when theseus heard of robbers and monsters he pricked up his ears and was so much the more eager to take the road along which they were to be met with on the third day therefore he bade a respectful farewell to his grandfather thanking him for all his kindness and after affectionately embracing his mother he set forth with a good many of her tears glistening on his cheeks and some if the truth must be told that had gushed out of his own eyes but he let the sun and wind dry them and walked stoutly on playing with the golden hilt of his sword and taking very manly strides in his fathers sandals  i cannot stop to tell you hardly any of the adventures that befell theseus on the road to athens it is enough to say that he quite cleared that part of the country of the robbers about whom king pittheus had been so much alarmed one of these bad people was named procrustes and he was indeed a terrible fellow and had an ugly way of making fun of the poor travellers who happened to fall into his clutches in his cavern he had a bed on which with great pretence of hospitality he invited his guests to lie down but if they happened to be shorter than the bed this wicked villain stretched them out by main force or if they were too long he lopped off their heads or feet and laughed at what he had done as an excellent joke thus however weary a man might be he never liked to lie in the bed of procrustes another of these robbers named scinis must likewise have been a very great scoundrel he was in the habit of flinging his victims off a high cliff into the sea and in order to give him exactly his deserts theseus tossed him off the very same place but if you will believe me the sea would not pollute itself by receiving such a bad person into its bosom neither would the earth having once got rid of him consent to take him back so that between the cliff and the sea scinis stuck fast in the air which was forced to bear the burden of his naughtiness  after these memorable deeds theseus heard of an enormous sow which ran wild and was the terror of all the farmers round about and as he did not consider himself above doing any good thing that came in his way he killed this monstrous creature and gave the carcass to the poor people for bacon the great sow had been an awful beast while ramping about the woods and fields but was a pleasant object enough when cut up into joints and smoking on i know not how many dinner tables  thus by the time he had reached his journeys end theseus had done many valiant deeds with his fathers goldenhilted sword and had gained the renown of being one of the bravest young men of the day his fame travelled faster than he did and reached athens before him as he entered the city he heard the inhabitants talking at the streetcorners and saying that hercules was brave and jason too and castor and pollux likewise but that theseus the son of their own king would turn out as great a hero as the best of them theseus took longer strides on hearing this and fancied himself sure of a magnificent reception at his fathers court since he came hither with fame to blow her trumpet before him and cry to king √Ügeus behold your son  he little suspected innocent youth that he was that here in this very athens where his father reigned a greater danger awaited him than any which he had encountered on the road yet this was the truth you must understand that the father of theseus though not very old in years was almost worn out with the cares of government and had thus grown aged before his time his nephews not expecting him to live a very great while intended to get all the power of the kingdom into their own hands but when they heard that theseus had arrived in athens and learned what a gallant young man he was they saw that he would not be at all the kind of person to let them steal away his fathers crown and sceptre which ought to be his own by right of inheritance thus these badhearted nephews of king √Ügeus who were the own cousins of theseus at once became his enemies a still more dangerous enemy was medea the wicked enchantress for she was now the kings wife and wanted to give the kingdom to her son medus instead of letting it be given to the son of √Üthra whom she hated  it so happened that the kings nephews met theseus and found out who he was just as he reached the entrance of the royal palace with all their evil designs against him they pretended to be their cousins best friends and expressed great joy at making his acquaintance they proposed to him that he should come into the kings presence as a stranger in order to try whether √Ügeus would discover in the young mans features any likeness either to himself or his mother √Üthra and thus recognize him for a son theseus consented for he fancied that his father would know him in a moment by the love that was in his heart but while he waited at the door the nephews ran and told king √Ügeus that a young man had arrived in athens who to their certain knowledge intended to put him to death and get possession of his royal crown  and he is now waiting for admission to your majestys presence added they  aha cried the old king on hearing this why he must be a very wicked young fellow indeed pray what would you advise me to do with him  in reply to this question the wicked medea put in her word as i have already told you she was a famous enchantress according to some stories she was in the habit of boiling old people in a large caldron under pretence of making them young again but king √Ügeus i suppose did not fancy such an uncomfortable way of growing young or perhaps was contented to be old and therefore would never let himself be popped into the caldron if there were time to spare from more important matters i should be glad to tell you of medeas fiery chariot drawn by winged dragons in which the enchantress used often to take an airing among the clouds this chariot in fact was the vehicle that first brought her to athens where she had done nothing but mischief ever since her arrival but these and many other wonders must be left untold and it is enough to say that medea amongst a thousand other bad things knew how to prepare a poison that was instantly fatal to whomsoever might so much as touch it with his lips  so when the king asked what he should do with theseus this naughty woman had an answer ready at her tongues end  leave that to me please your majesty she replied only admit this evilminded young man to your presence treat him civilly and invite him to drink a goblet of wine your majesty is well aware that i sometimes amuse myself with distilling very powerful medicines here is one of them in this small phial as to what it is made of that is one of my secrets of state do but let me put a single drop into the goblet and let the young man taste it and i will answer for it he shall quite lay aside the bad designs with which he comes hither  as she said this medea smiled but for all her smiling face she meant nothing less than to poison the poor innocent theseus before his fathers eyes and king √Ügeus like most other kings thought any punishment mild enough for a person who was accused of plotting against his life he therefore made little or no objection to medeas scheme and as soon as the poisonous wine was ready gave orders that the young stranger should be admitted into his presence the goblet was set on a table beside the kings throne and a fly meaning just to sip a little from the brim immediately tumbled into it dead observing this medea looked round at the nephews and smiled again  when theseus was ushered into the royal apartment the only object that he seemed to behold was the whitebearded old king there he sat on his magnificent throne a dazzling crown on his head and a sceptre in his hand his aspect was stately and majestic although his years and infirmities weighed heavily upon him as if each year were a lump of lead and each infirmity a ponderous stone and all were bundled up together and laid upon his weary shoulders the tears both of joy and sorrow sprang into the young mans eyes for he thought how sad it was to see his dear father so infirm and how sweet it would be to support him with his own youthful strength and to cheer him up with the alacrity of his loving spirit when a son takes his father into his warm heart it renews the old mans youth in a better way than by the heat of medeas magic caldron and this was what theseus resolved to do he could scarcely wait to see whether king √Ügeus would recognize him so eager was he to throw himself into his arms  advancing to the foot of the throne he attempted to make a little speech which he had been thinking about as he came up the stairs but he was almost choked by a great many tender feelings that gushed out of his heart and swelled into his throat all struggling to find utterance together and therefore unless he could have laid his full overbrimming heart into the kings hand poor theseus knew not what to do or say the cunning medea observed what was passing in the young mans mind she was more wicked at that moment than ever she had been before for and it makes me tremble to tell you of it she did her worst to turn all this unspeakable love with which theseus was agitated to his own ruin and destruction  does your majesty see his confusion she whispered in the kings ear he is so conscious of guilt that he trembles and cannot speak the wretch lives too long quick offer him the wine  now king √Ügeus had been gazing earnestly at the young stranger as he drew near the throne there was something he knew not what either in his white brow or in the fine expression of his mouth or in his beautiful and tender eyes that made him indistinctly feel as if he had seen this youth before as if indeed he had trotted him on his knee when a baby and had beheld him growing to be a stalwart man while he himself grew old but medea guessed how the king felt and would not suffer him to yield to these natural sensibilities although they were the voice of his deepest heart telling him as plainly as it could speak that here was his dear son and √Üthras son coming to claim him for a father the enchantress again whispered in the kings ear and compelled him by her witchcraft to see everything under a false aspect  he made up his mind therefore to let theseus drink off the poisoned wine  young man said he you are welcome i am proud to show hospitality to so heroic a youth do me the favor to drink the contents of this goblet it is brimming over as you see with delicious wine such as i bestow only on those who are worthy of it none is more worthy to quaff it than yourself  so saying king √Ügeus took the golden goblet from the table and was about to offer it to theseus but partly through his infirmities and partly because it seemed so sad a thing to take away this young mans life however wicked he might be and partly no doubt because his heart was wiser than his head and quaked within him at the thought of what he was going to dofor all these reasons the kings hand trembled so much that a great deal of the wine slopped over in order to strengthen his purpose and fearing lest the whole of the precious poison should be wasted one of his nephews now whispered to him  has your majesty any doubt of this strangers guilt there is the very sword with which he meant to slay you how sharp and bright and terrible it is quicklet him taste the wine or perhaps he may do the deed even yet  at these words √Ügeus drove every thought and feeling out of his breast except the one idea of how justly the young man deserved to be put to death he sat erect on his throne and held out the goblet of wine with a steady hand and bent on theseus a frown of kingly severity for after all he had too noble a spirit to murder even a treacherous enemy with a deceitful smile upon his face  drink said he in the stern tone with which he was wont to condemn a criminal to be beheaded you have well deserved of me such wine as this  theseus held out his hand to take the wine but before he touched it king √Ügeus trembled again his eyes had fallen on the goldhilted sword that hung at the young mans side he drew back the goblet  that sword he cried how came you by it  it was my fathers sword replied theseus with a tremulous voice these were his sandals my dear mother her name is √Üthra told me his story while i was yet a little child but it is only a month since i grew strong enough to lift the heavy stone and take the sword and sandals from beneath it and come to athens to seek my father  my son my son cried king √Ügeus flinging away the fatal goblet and tottering down from the throne to fall into the arms of theseus yes these are √Üthras eyes it is my son  i have quite forgotten what became of the kings nephews but when the wicked medea saw this new turn of affairs she hurried out of the room and going to her private chamber lost no time in setting her enchantments at work in a few moments she heard a great noise of hissing snakes outside of the chamber window and behold there was her fiery chariot and four huge winged serpents wriggling and twisting in the air flourishing their tails higher than the top of the palace and all ready to set off on an aerial journey medea stayed only long enough to take her son with her and to steal the crown jewels together with the kings best robes and whatever other valuable things she could lay hands on and getting into the chariot she whipped up the snakes and ascended high over the city  the king hearing the hiss of the serpents scrambled as fast as he could to the window and bawled out to the abominable enchantress never to come back the whole people of athens too who had run out of doors to see this wonderful spectacle set up a shout of joy at the prospect of getting rid of her medea almost bursting with rage uttered precisely such a hiss as one of her own snakes only ten times more venomous and spiteful and glaring fiercely out of the blaze of the chariot she shook her hands over the multitude below as if she were scattering a million of curses among them in so doing however she unintentionally let fall about five hundred diamonds of the first water together with a thousand great pearls and two thousand emeralds rubies sapphires opals and topazes to which she had helped herself out of the kings strongbox all these came pelting down like a shower of manycolored hailstones upon the heads of grown people and children who forthwith gathered them up and carried them back to the palace but king √Ügeus told them that they were welcome to the whole and to twice as many more if he had them for the sake of his delight at finding his son and losing the wicked medea and indeed if you had seen how hateful was her last look as the flaming chariot flew upward you would not have wondered that both king and people should think her departure a good riddance  and now prince theseus was taken into great favor by his royal father the old king was never weary of having him sit beside him on his throne which was quite wide enough for two and of hearing him tell about his dear mother and his childhood and his many boyish efforts to lift the ponderous stone theseus however was much too brave and active a young man to be willing to spend all his time in relating things which had already happened his ambition was to perform other and more heroic deeds which should be better worth telling in prose and verse nor had he been long in athens before he caught and chained a terrible mad bull and made a public show of him greatly to the wonder and admiration of good king √Ügeus and his subjects but pretty soon he undertook an affair that made all his foregone adventures seem like mere boys play the occasion of it was as follows  one morning when prince theseus awoke he fancied that he must have had a very sorrowful dream and that it was still running in his mind even now that his eyes were open for it appeared as if the air was full of a melancholy wail and when he listened more attentively he could hear sobs and groans and screams of woe mingled with deep quiet sighs which came from the kings palace and from the streets and from the temples and from every habitation in the city and all these mournful noises issuing out of thousands of separate hearts united themselves into the one great sound of affliction which bad startled theseus from slumber he put on his clothes as quickly as he could not forgetting his sandals and goldhilted sword and hastening to the king inquired what it all meant  alas my son quoth king √Ügeus heaving a long sigh here is a very lamentable matter in hand this is the wofullest anniversary in the whole year it is the day when we annually draw lots to see which of the youths and maidens of athens shall go to be devoured by the horrible minotaur  the minotaur exclaimed prince theseus and like a brave young prince as he was he put his hand to the hilt of his sword what kind of a monster may that be is it not possible at the risk of ones life to slay him  but king √Ügeus shook his venerable head and to convince theseus that it was quite a hopeless case he gave him an explanation of the whole affair it seems that in the island of crete there lived a certain dreadful monster called a minotaur which was shaped partly like a man and partly like a bull and was altogether such a hideous sort of a creature that it is really disagreeable to think of him if he were suffered to exist at all it should have been on some desert island or in the duskiness of some deep cavern where nobody would ever be tormented by his abominable aspect but king minos who reigned over crete laid out a vast deal of money in building a habitation for the minotaur and took great care of his health and comfort merely for mischiefs sake a few years before this time there had been a war between the city of athens and the island of crete in which the athenians were beaten and compelled to beg for peace no peace could they obtain however except on condition that they should send seven young men and seven maidens every year to be devoured by the pet monster of the cruel king minos for three years past this grievous calamity had been borne and the sobs and groans and shrieks with which the city was now filled were caused by the peoples woe because the fatal day had come again when the fourteen victims were to be chosen by lot and the old people feared lest their sons or daughters might be taken and the youths and damsels dreaded lest they themselves might be destined to glut the ravenous maw of that detestable manbrute  but when theseus heard the story he straightened himself up so that he seemed taller than ever before and as for his face it was indignant despiteful bold tender and compassionate all in one look  let the people of athens this year draw lots for only six young men instead of seven said he i will myself be the seventh and let the minotaur devour me if he can  o my dear son cried king √Ügeus why should you expose yourself to this horrible fate you are a royal prince and have a right to hold yourself above the destinies of common men  it is because i am a prince your son and the rightful heir of your kingdom that i freely take upon me the calamity of your subjects answered theseus and you my father being king over this people and answerable to heaven for their welfare are bound to sacrifice what is dearest to you rather than that the son or daughter of the poorest citizen should come to any harm  the old king shed tears and besought theseus not to leave him desolate in his old age more especially as he had but just begun to know the happiness of possessing a good and valiant son theseus however felt that he was in the right and therefore would not give up his resolution but he assured his father that he did not intend to be eaten up unresistingly like a sheep and that if the minotaur devoured him it should not be without a battle for his dinner and finally since he could not help it king √Ügeus consented to let him go so a vessel was got ready and rigged with black sails and theseus with six other young men and seven tender and beautiful damsels came down to the harbor to embark a sorrowful multitude accompanied them to the shore there was the poor old king too leaning on his sons arm and looking as if his single heart held all the grief of athens  just as prince theseus was going on board his father bethought himself of one last word to say  my beloved son said he grasping the princes hand you observe that the sails of this vessel are black as indeed they ought to be since it goes upon a voyage of sorrow and despair now being weighed down with infirmities i know not whether i can survive till the vessel shall return but as long as i do live i shall creep daily to the top of yonder cliff to watch if there be a sail upon the sea and dearest theseus if by some happy chance you should escape the jaws of the minotaur then tear down those dismal sails and hoist others that shall be bright as the sunshine beholding them on the horizon myself and all the people will know that you are coming back victorious and will welcome you with such a festal uproar as athens never heard before  theseus promised that he would do so then going on board the mariners trimmed the vessels black sails to the wind which blew faintly off the shore being pretty much made up of the sighs that everybody kept pouring forth on this melancholy occasion but by and by when they had got fairly out to sea there came a stiff breeze from the northwest and drove them along as merrily over the whitecapped waves as if they had been going on the most delightful errand imaginable and though it was a sad business enough i rather question whether fourteen young people without any old persons to keep them in order could continue to spend the whole time of the voyage in being miserable there had been some few dances upon the undulating deck i suspect and some hearty bursts of laughter and other such unseasonable merriment among the victims before the high blue mountains of crete began to show themselves among the faroff clouds that sight to be sure made them all very grave again  theseus stood among the sailors gazing eagerly towards the land although as yet it seemed hardly more substantial than the clouds amidst which the mountains were looming up once or twice he fancied that he saw a glare of some bright object a long way off flinging a gleam across the waves  did you see that flash of light he inquired of the master of the vessel  no prince but i have seen it before answered the master it came from talus i suppose  as the breeze came fresher just then the master was busy with trimming his sails and had no more time to answer questions but while the vessel flew faster and faster towards crete theseus was astonished to behold a human figure gigantic in size which appeared to be striding with a measured movement along the margin of the island it stepped from cliff to cliff and sometimes from one headland to another while the sea foamed and thundered on the shore beneath and dashed its jets of spray over the giants feet what was still more remarkable whenever the sun shone on this huge figure it flickered and glimmered its vast countenance too had a metallic lustre and threw great flashes of splendor through the air the folds of its garments moreover instead of waving in the wind fell heavily over its limbs as if woven of some kind of metal  the nigher the vessel came the more theseus wondered what this immense giant could be and whether it actually had life or no for though it walked and made other lifelike motions there yet was a kind of jerk in its gait which together with its brazen aspect caused the young prince to suspect that it was no true giant but only a wonderful piece of machinery the figure looked all the more terrible because it carried an enormous brass club on its shoulder  what is this wonder theseus asked of the master of the vessel who was now at leisure to answer him  it is talus the man of brass said the master  and is he a live giant or a brazen image asked theseus  that truly replied the master is the point which has always perplexed me some say indeed that this talus was hammered out for king minos by vulcan himself the skilfullest of all workers in metal but who ever saw a brazen image that had sense enough to walk round an island three times a day as this giant walks round the island of crete challenging every vessel that comes nigh the shore and on the other hand what living thing unless his sinews were made of brass would not be weary of marching eighteen hundred miles in the twentyfour hours as talus does without ever sitting down to rest he is a puzzler take him how you will  still the vessel went bounding onward and now theseus could hear the brazen clangor of the giants footsteps as he trod heavily upon the seabeaten rocks some of which were seen to crack and crumble into the foamy waves beneath his weight as they approached the entrance of the port the giant straddled clear across it with a foot firmly planted on each headland and uplifting his club to such a height that its buttend was hidden in a cloud he stood in that formidable posture with the sun gleaming all over his metallic surface there seemed nothing else to be expected but that the next moment he would fetch his great club down slam bang and smash the vessel into a thousand pieces without heeding how many innocent people he might destroy for there is seldom any mercy in a giant you know and quite as little in a piece of brass clockwork but just when theseus and his companions thought the blow was coming the brazen lips unclosed themselves and the figure spoke  whence come you strangers  and when the ringing voice ceased there was just such a reverberation as you may have heard within a great church bell for a moment or two after the stroke of the hammer  from athens shouted the master in reply  on what errand thundered the man of brass  and he whirled his club aloft more threateningly than ever as if he were about to smite them with a thunderstroke right amidships because athens so little while ago had been at war with crete  we bring the seven youths and the seven maidens answered the master to be devoured by the minotaur  pass cried the brazen giant  that one loud word rolled all about the sky while again there was a booming reverberation within the figures breast the vessel glided between the headlands of the port and the giant resumed his march in a few moments this wondrous sentinel was far away flashing in the distant sunshine and revolving with immense strides around the island of crete as it was his neverceasing task to do  no sooner had they entered the harbor than a party of the guards of king minos came down to the waterside and took charge of the fourteen young men and damsels surrounded by these armed warriors prince theseus and his companions were led to the kings palace and ushered into his presence now minos was a stern and pitiless king if the figure that guarded crete was made of brass then the monarch who ruled over it might be thought to have a still harder metal in his breast and might have been called a man of iron he bent his shaggy brows upon the poor athenian victims any other mortal beholding their fresh and tender beauty and their innocent looks would have felt himself sitting on thorns until he had made every soul of them happy by bidding them go free as the summer wind but this immitigable minos cared only to examine whether they were plump enough to satisfy the minotaurs appetite for my part i wish he had himself been the only victim and the monster would have found him a pretty tough one  one after another king minos called these pale frightened youths and sobbing maidens to his footstool gave them each a poke in the ribs with his sceptre to try whether they were in good flesh or no and dismissed them with a nod to his guards but when his eyes rested on theseus the king looked at him more attentively because his face was calm and brave  young man asked he with his stern voice are you not appalled at the certainty of being devoured by this terrible minotaur  i have offered my life in a good cause answered theseus and therefore i give it freely and gladly but thou king minos art thou not thyself appalled who year after year hast perpetrated this dreadful wrong by giving seven innocent youths and as many maidens to be devoured by a monster dost thou not tremble wicked king to turn thine eyes inward on thine own heart sitting there on thy golden throne and in thy robes of majesty i tell thee to thy face king minos thou art a more hideous monster than the minotaur himself  aha do you think me so cried the king laughing in his cruel way tomorrow at breakfasttime you shall have an opportunity of judging which is the greater monster the minotaur or the king take them away guards and let this freespoken youth be the minotaurs first morsel  near the kings throne though i had no time to tell you so before stood his daughter ariadne she was a beautiful and tenderhearted maiden and looked at these poor doomed captives with very different feelings from those of the ironbreasted king minos she really wept indeed at the idea of how much human happiness would be needlessly thrown away by giving so many young people in the first bloom and rose blossom of their lives to be eaten up by a creature who no doubt would have preferred a fat ox or even a large pig to the plumpest of them and when she beheld the brave spirited figure of prince theseus bearing himself so calmly in his terrible peril she grew a hundred times more pitiful than before as the guards were taking him away she flung herself at the kings feet and besought him to set all the captives free and especially this one young man  peace foolish girl answered king minos what hast thou to do with an affair like this it is a matter of state policy and therefore quite beyond thy weak comprehension go water thy flowers and think no more of these athenian caitiffs whom the minotaur shall as certainly eat up for breakfast as i will eat a partridge for my supper  so saying the king looked cruel enough to devour theseus and all the rest of the captives himself had there been no minotaur to save him the trouble as he would not hear another word in their favor the prisoners were now led away and clapped into a dungeon where the jailer advised them to go to sleep as soon as possible because the minotaur was in the habit of calling for breakfast early the seven maidens and six of the young men soon sobbed themselves to slumber but theseus was not like them he felt conscious that he was wiser and braver and stronger than his companions and that therefore he had the responsibility of all their lives upon him and must consider whether there was no way to save them even in this last extremity so he kept himself awake and paced to and fro across the gloomy dungeon in which they were shut up  just before midnight the door was softly unbarred and the gentle ariadne showed herself with a torch in her hand  are you awake prince theseus she whispered  yes answered theseus with so little time to live i do not choose to waste any of it in sleep  then follow me said ariadne and tread softly  what had become of the jailer and the guards theseus never knew but however that might be ariadne opened all the doors and led him forth from the darksome prison into the pleasant moonlight  theseus said the maiden you can now get on board your vessel and sail away for athens  no answered the young man i will never leave crete unless i can first slay the minotaur and save my poor companions and deliver athens from this cruel tribute  i knew that this would be your resolution said ariadne come then with me brave theseus here is your own sword which the guards deprived you of you will need it and pray heaven you may use it well  then she led theseus along by the hand until they came to a dark shadow grove where the moonlight wasted itself on the tops of the trees without shedding hardly so much as a glimmering beam upon their pathway after going a good way through this obscurity they reached a high marble wall which was overgrown with creeping plants that made it shaggy with their verdure the wall seemed to have no door nor any windows but rose up lofty and massive and mysterious and was neither to be clambered over nor so far as theseus could perceive to be passed through nevertheless ariadne did but press one of her soft little fingers against a particular block of marble and though it looked as solid as any other part of the wall it yielded to her touch disclosing an entrance just wide enough to admit them they crept through and the marble stone swung back into its place  we are now said ariadne in the famous labyrinth which d√¶dalus built before he made himself a pair of wings and flew away from our island like a bird that d√¶dalus was a very cunning workman but of all his artful contrivances this labyrinth is the most wondrous were we to take but a few steps from the doorway we might wander about all our lifetime and never find it again yet in the very centre of this labyrinth is the minotaur and theseus you must go thither to seek him  but how shall i ever find him asked theseus if the labyrinth so bewilders me as you say it will  just as he spoke they heard a rough and very disagreeable roar which greatly resembled the lowing of a fierce bull but yet had some sort of sound like the human voice theseus even fancied a rude articulation in it as if the creature that uttered it were trying to shape his hoarse breath into words it was at some distance however and he really could not tell whether it sounded most like a bulls roar or a mans harsh voice  that is the minotaurs noise whispered ariadne closely grasping the hand of theseus and pressing one of her own hands to her heart which was all in a tremble you must follow that sound through the windings of the labyrinth and by and by you will find him stay take the end of this silken string i will hold the other end and then if you win the victory it will lead you again to this spot farewell brave theseus  so the young man took the end of the silken string in his left hand and his goldhilted sword ready drawn from its scabbard in the other and trod boldly into the inscrutable labyrinth how this labyrinth was built is more than i can tell you but so cunningly contrived a mizmaze was never seen in the world before nor since there can be nothing else so intricate unless it were the brain of a man like d√¶dalus who planned it or the heart of any ordinary man which last to be sure is ten times as great a mystery as the labyrinth of crete theseus had not taken five steps before he lost sight of ariadne and in five more his head was growing dizzy but still he went on now creeping through a low arch now ascending a flight of steps now in one crooked passage and now in another with here a door opening before him and there one banging behind until it really seemed as if the walls spun round and whirled him round along with them and all the while through these hollow avenues now nearer now farther off again resounded the cry of the minotaur and the sound was so fierce so cruel so ugly so like a bulls roar and withal so like a human voice and yet like neither of them that the brave heart of theseus grew sterner and angrier at every step for he felt it an insult to the moon and sky and to our affectionate and simple mother earth that such a monster should have the audacity to exist  as he passed onward the clouds gathered over the moon and the labyrinth grew so dusky that theseus could no longer discern the bewilderment through which he was passing he would have felt quite lost and utterly hopeless of ever again walking in a straight path if every little while he had not been conscious of a gentle twitch at the silken cord then he knew that the tenderhearted ariadne was still holding the other end and that she was fearing for him and hoping for him and giving him just as much of her sympathy as if she were close by his side oh indeed i can assure you there was a vast deal of human sympathy running along that slender thread of silk but still he followed the dreadful roar of the minotaur which now grew louder and louder and finally so very loud that theseus fully expected to come close upon him at every new zigzag and wriggle of the path and at last in an open space at the very centre of the labyrinth he did discern the hideous creature  sure enough what an ugly monster it was only his horned head belonged to a bull and yet somehow or other he looked like a bull all over preposterously waddling on his hind legs or if you happened to view him in another way he seemed wholly a man and all the more monstrous for being so and there he was the wretched thing with no society no companion no kind of a mate living only to do mischief and incapable of knowing what affection means theseus hated him and shuddered at him and yet could not but be sensible of some sort of pity and all the more the uglier and more detestable the creature was for he kept striding to and fro in a solitary frenzy of rage continually emitting a hoarse roar which was oddly mixed up with halfshaped words and after listening awhile theseus understood that the minotaur was saying to himself how miserable he was and how hungry and how he hated everybody and how he longed to eat up the human race alive  ah the bullheaded villain and o my good little people you will perhaps see one of these days as i do now that every human being who suffers anything evil to get into his nature or to remain there is a kind of minotaur an enemy of his fellowcreatures and separated from all good companionship as this poor monster was  was theseus afraid by no means my dear auditors what a hero like theseus afraid not had the minotaur had twenty bull heads instead of one bold as he was however i rather fancy that it strengthened his valiant heart just at this crisis to feel a tremulous twitch at the silken cord which he was still holding in his left hand it was as if ariadne were giving him all her might and courage and much as he already had and little as she had to give it made his own seem twice as much and to confess the honest truth he needed the whole for now the minotaur turning suddenly about caught sight of theseus and instantly lowered his horribly sharp horns exactly as a mad bull does when he means to rush against an enemy at the same time he belched forth a tremendous roar in which there was something like the words of human language but all disjointed and shakento pieces by passing through the gullet of a miserably enraged brute  theseus could only guess what the creature intended to say and that rather by his gestures than his words for the minotaurs horns were sharper than his wits and of a great deal more service to him than his tongue but probably this was the sense of what he uttered  ah wretch of a human being ill stick my horns through you and toss you fifty feet high and eat you up the moment you come down  come on then and try it was all that theseus deigned to reply for he was far too magnanimous to assault his enemy with insolent language  without more words on either side there ensued the most awful fight between theseus and the minotaur that ever happened beneath the sun or moon i really know not how it might have turned out if the monster in his first headlong rush against theseus had not missed him by a hairsbreadth and broken one of his horns short off against the stone wall on this mishap he bellowed so intolerably that a part of the labyrinth tumbled down and all the inhabitants of crete mistook the noise for an uncommonly heavy thunderstorm smarting with the pain he galloped around the open space in so ridiculous a way that theseus laughed at it long afterwards though not precisely at the moment after this the two antagonists stood valiantly up to one another and fought sword to horn for a long while at last the minotaur made a run at theseus grazed his left side with his horn and flung him down and thinking that he had stabbed him to the heart he cut a great caper in the air opened his bull mouth from ear to ear and prepared to snap his head off but theseus by this time had leaped up and caught the monster off his guard fetching a swordstroke at him with all his force he hit him fair upon the neck and made his bull head skip six yards from his human body which fell down flat upon the ground  so now the battle was ended immediately the moon shone out as brightly as if all the troubles of the world and all the wickedness and the ugliness that infest human life were past and gone forever and theseus as he leaned on his sword taking breath felt another twitch of the silken cord for all through the terrible encounter he had held it fast in his left hand eager to let ariadne know of his success he followed the guidance of the thread and soon found himself at the entrance of the labyrinth  thou hast slain the monster cried ariadne clasping her hands  thanks to thee dear ariadne answered theseus i return victorious  then said ariadne we must quickly summon thy friends and get them and thyself on board the vessel before dawn if morning finds thee here my father will avenge the minotaur  to make my story short the poor captives were awakened and hardly knowing whether it was not a joyful dream were told of what theseus had done and that they must set sail for athens before daybreak hastening down to the vessel they all clambered on board except prince theseus who lingered behind them on the strand holding ariadnes hand clasped in his own  dear maiden said he thou wilt surely go with us thou art too gentle and sweet a child for such an ironhearted father as king minos he cares no more for thee than a granite rock cares for the little flower that grows in one of its crevices but my father king √Ügeus and my dear mother √Üthra and all the fathers and mothers in athens and all the sons and daughters too will love and honor thee as their benefactress come with us then for king minos will be very angry when he knows what thou hast done  now some lowminded people who pretend to tell the story of theseus and ariadne have the face to say that this royal and honorable maiden did really flee away under cover of the night with the young stranger whose life she had preserved they say too that prince theseus who would have died sooner than wrong the meanest creature in the world ungratefully deserted ariadne on a solitary island where the vessel touched on its voyage to athens but had the noble theseus heard these falsehoods he would have served their slanderous authors as he served the minotaur here is what ariadne answered when the brave prince of athens besought her to accompany him  no theseus the maiden said pressing his hand and then drawing back a step or two i cannot go with you my father is old and has nobody but myself to love him hard as you think his heart is it would break to lose me at first king minos will be angry but he will soon forgive his only child and by and by he will rejoice i know that no more youths and maidens must come from athens to be devoured by the minotaur i have saved you theseus as much for my fathers sake as for your own farewell heaven bless you  all this was so true and so maidenlike and was spoken with so sweet a dignity that theseus would have blushed to urge her any longer nothing remained for him therefore but to bid ariadne an affectionate farewell and go on board the vessel and set sail  in a few moments the white foam was boiling up before their prow as prince theseus and his companions sailed out of the harbor with a whistling breeze behind them talus the brazen giant on his neverceasing sentinels march happened to be approaching that part of the coast and they saw him by the glimmering of the moonbeams on his polished surface while he was yet a great way off as the figure moved like clockwork however and could neither hasten his enormous strides nor retard them he arrived at the port when they were just beyond the reach of his club nevertheless straddling from headland to headland as his custom was talus attempted to strike a blow at the vessel and overreaching himself tumbled at full length into the sea which splashed high over his gigantic shape as when an iceberg turns a somerset there he lies yet and whoever desires to enrich himself by means of brass had better go thither with a divingbell and fish up talus  on the homeward voyage the fourteen youths and damsels were in excellent spirits as you will easily suppose they spent most of their time in dancing unless when the sidelong breeze made the deck slope too much in due season they came within sight of the coast of attica which was their native country but here i am grieved to tell you happened a sad misfortune  you will remember what theseus unfortunately forgot that his father king √Ügeus had enjoined it upon him to hoist sunshine sails instead of black ones in case he should overcome the minotaur and return victorious in the joy of their success however and amidst the sports dancing and other merriment with which these young folks wore away the time they never once thought whether their sails were black white or rainbow colored and indeed left it entirely to the mariners whether they had any sails at all thus the vessel returned like a raven with the same sable wings that had wafted her away but poor king √Ügeus day after day infirm as he was had clambered to the summit of a cliff that overhung the sea and there sat watching for prince theseus homeward bound and no sooner did he behold the fatal blackness of the sails than he concluded that his dear son whom he loved so much and felt so proud of had been eaten by the minotaur he could not bear the thought of living any longer so first flinging his crown and sceptre into the sea useless bawbles that they were to him now king √Ügeus merely stooped forward and fell headlong over the cliff and was drowned poor soul in the waves that foamed at its base  this was melancholy news for prince theseus who when he stepped ashore found himself king of all the country whether he would or no and such a turn of fortune was enough to make any young man feel very much out of spirits however he sent for his dear mother to athens and by taking her advice in matters of state became a very excellent monarch and was greatly beloved by his people     the pygmies   a great while ago when the world was full of wonders there lived an earthborn giant named ant√¶us and a million or more of curious little earthborn people who were called pygmies this giant and these pygmies being children of the same mother that is to say our good old grandmother earth were all brethren and dwelt together in a very friendly and affectionate manner far far off in the middle of hot africa the pygmies were so small and there were so many sandy deserts and such high mountains between them and the rest of mankind that nobody could get a peep at them oftener than once in a hundred years as for the giant being of a very lofty stature it was easy enough to see him but safest to keep out of his sight  among the pygmies i suppose if one of them grew to the height of six or eight inches he was reckoned a prodigiously tall man it must have been very pretty to behold their little cities with streets two or three feet wide paved with the smallest pebbles and bordered by habitations about as big as a squirrels cage the kings palace attained to the stupendous magnitude of periwinkles babyhouse and stood in the centre of a spacious square which could hardly have been covered by our hearthrug their principal temple or cathedral was as lofty as yonder bureau and was looked upon as a wonderfully sublime and magnificent edifice all these structures were built neither of stone nor wood they were neatly plastered together by the pygmy workmen pretty much like birdsnests out of straw feathers eggshells and other small bits of stuff with stiff clay instead of mortar and when the hot sun had dried them they were just as snug and comfortable as a pygmy could desire  the country round about was conveniently laid out in fields the largest of which was nearly of the same extent as one of sweet ferns flowerbeds here the pygmies used to plant wheat and other kinds of grain which when it grew up and ripened overshadowed these tiny people as the pines and the oaks and the walnut and chestnuttrees overshadow you and me when we walk in our own tracts of woodland at harvesttime they were forced to go with their little axes and cut down the grain exactly as a woodcutter makes a clearing in the forest and when a stalk of wheat with its overburdened top chanced to come crashing down upon an unfortunate pygmy it was apt to be a very sad affair if it did not smash him all to pieces at least i am sure it must have made the poor little fellows head ache and oh my stars if the fathers and mothers were so small what must the children and babies have been a whole family of them might have been put to bed in a shoe or have crept into an old glove and played at hideandseek in its thumb and fingers you might have hidden a yearold baby under a thimble  now these funny pygmies as i told you before had a giant for their neighbor and brother who was bigger if possible than they were little he was so very tall that he carried a pinetree which was eight feet through the butt for a walkingstick it took a farsighted pygmy i can assure you to discern his summit without the help of a telescope and sometimes in misty weather they could not see his upper half but only his long legs which seemed to be striding about by themselves but at noonday in a clear atmosphere when the sun shone brightly over him the giant ant√¶us presented a very grand spectacle there he used to stand a perfect mountain of a man with his great countenance smiling down upon his little brothers and his one vast eye which was as big as a cartwheel and placed right in the centre of his forehead giving a friendly wink to the whole nation at once  the pygmies loved to talk with ant√¶us and fifty times a day one or another of them would turn up his head and shout through the hollow of his fists halloo brother ant√¶us how are you my good fellow and when the small distant squeak of their voices reached his ear the giant would make answer pretty well brother pygmy i thank you in a thunderous roar that would have shaken down the walls of their strongest temple only that it came from so far aloft  it was a happy circumstance that ant√¶us was the pygmy peoples friend for there was more strength in his little finger than in ten million of such bodies as theirs if he had been as illnatured to them as he was to everybody else he might have beaten down their biggest city at one kick and hardly have known that he did it with the tornado of his breath he could have stripped the roofs from a hundred dwellings and sent thousands of the inhabitants whirling through the air he might have set his immense foot upon a multitude and when he took it up again there would have been a pitiful sight to be sure but being the son of mother earth as they likewise were the giant gave them his brotherly kindness and loved them with as big a love as it was possible to feel for creatures so very small and on their parts the pygmies loved ant√¶us with as much affection as their tiny hearts could hold he was always ready to do them any good offices that lay in his power as for example when they wanted a breeze to turn their windmills the giant would set all the sails agoing with the mere natural respiration of his lungs when the sun was too hot he often sat himself down and let his shadow fall over the kingdom from one frontier to the other and as for matters in general he was wise enough to let them alone and leave the pygmies to manage their own affairswhich after all is about the best thing that great people can do for little ones  in short as i said before ant√¶us loved the pygmies and the pygmies loved ant√¶us the giants life being as long as his body was large while the lifetime of a pygmy was but a span this friendly intercourse had been going on for innumerable generations and ages it was written about in the pygmy histories and talked about in their ancient traditions the most venerable and whitebearded pygmy had never heard of a time even in his greatest of grandfathers days when the giant was not their enormous friend once to be sure as was recorded on an obelisk three feet high erected on the place of the catastrophe ant√¶us sat down upon about five thousand pygmies who were assembled at a military review but this was one of those unlucky accidents for which nobody is to blame so that the small folks never took it to heart and only requested the giant to be careful forever afterwards to examine the acre of ground where he intended to squat himself  it is a very pleasant picture to imagine ant√¶us standing among the pygmies like the spire of the tallest cathedral that ever was built while they ran about like pismires at his feet and to think that in spite of their difference in size there were affection and sympathy between them and him indeed it has always seemed to me that the giant needed the little people more than the pygmies needed the giant for unless they had been his neighbors and wellwishers and as we may say his playfellows ant√¶us would not have had a single friend in the world no other being like himself had ever been created no creature of his own size had ever talked with him in thunderlike accents face to face when he stood with his head among the clouds he was quite alone and had been so for hundreds of years and would be so forever even if he had met another giant ant√¶us would have fancied the world not big enough for two such vast personages and instead of being friends with him would have fought him till one of the two was killed but with the pygmies he was the most sportive and humorous and merryhearted and sweettempered old giant that ever washed his face in a wet cloud  his little friends like all other small people had a great opinion of their own importance and used to assume quite a patronizing air towards the giant  poor creature they said one to another he has a very dull time of it all by himself and we ought not to grudge wasting a little of our precious time to amuse him he is not half so bright as we are to be sure and for that reason he needs us to look after his comfort and happiness let us be kind to the old fellow why if mother earth had not been very kind to ourselves we might all have been giants too  on all their holidays the pygmies had excellent sport with ant√¶us he often stretched himself out at full length on the ground where he looked like the long ridge of a hill and it was a good hours walk no doubt for a shortlegged pygmy to journey from head to foot of the giant he would lay down his great hand flat on the grass and challenge the tallest of them to clamber upon it and straddle from finger to finger so fearless were they that they made nothing of creeping in among the folds of his garments when his head lay sidewise on the earth they would march boldly up and peep into the great cavern of his mouth and take it all as a joke as indeed it was meant when ant√¶us gave a sudden snap with his jaws as if he were going to swallow fifty of them at once you would have laughed to see the children dodging in and out among his hair or swinging from his beard it is impossible to tell half of the funny tricks that they played with their huge comrade but i do not know that anything was more curious than when a party of boys were seen running races on his forehead to try which of them could get first round the circle of his one great eye it was another favorite feat with them to march along the bridge of his nose and jump down upon his upper lip  if the truth must be told they were sometimes as troublesome to the giant as a swarm of ants or mosquitoes especially as they had a fondness for mischief and liked to prick his skin with their little swords and lances to see how thick and tough it was but ant√¶us took it all kindly enough although once in a while when he happened to be sleepy he would grumble out a peevish word or two like the muttering of a tempest and ask them to have done with their nonsense a great deal oftener however he watched their merriment and gambols until his huge heavy clumsy wits were completely stirred up by them and then would he roar out such a tremendous volume of immeasurable laughter that the whole nation of pygmies had to put their hands to their ears else it would certainly have deafened them  ho ho ho quoth the giant shaking his mountainous sides what a funny thing it is to be little if i were not ant√¶us i should like to be a pygmy just for the jokes sake  the pygmies had but one thing to trouble them in the world they were constantly at war with the cranes and had always been so ever since the longlived giant could remember from time to time very terrible battles had been fought in which sometimes the little men won the victory and sometimes the cranes according to some historians the pygmies used to go to the battle mounted on the backs of goats and rams but such animals as these must have been far too big for pygmies to ride upon so that i rather suppose they rode on squirrelback or rabbitback or ratback or perhaps got upon hedgehogs whose prickly quills would be very terrible to the enemy however this might be and whatever creatures the pygmies rode upon i do not doubt that they made a formidable appearance armed with sword and spear and bow and arrow blowing their tiny trumpet and shouting their little warcry they never failed to exhort one another to fight bravely and recollect that the world had its eyes upon them although in simple truth the only spectator was the giant ant√¶us with his one great stupid eye in the middle of his forehead  when the two armies joined battle the cranes would rush forward flapping their wings and stretching out their necks and would perhaps snatch up some of the pygmies crosswise in their beaks whenever this happened it was truly an awful spectacle to see those little men of might kicking and sprawling in the air and at last disappearing down the cranes long crooked throat swallowed up alive a hero you know must hold himself in readiness for any kind of fate and doubtless the glory of the thing was a consolation to him even in the cranes gizzard if ant√¶us observed that the battle was going hard against his little allies he generally stopped laughing and ran with milelong strides to their assistance flourishing his club aloft and shouting at the cranes who quacked and croaked and retreated as fast as they could then the pygmy army would march homeward in triumph attributing the victory entirely to their own valor and to the warlike skill and strategy of whomsoever happened to be captain general and for a tedious while afterwards nothing would be heard of but grand processions and public banquets and brilliant illuminations and shows of waxwork with likenesses of the distinguished officers as small as life  in the abovedescribed warfare if a pygmy chanced to pluck out a cranes tailfeather it proved a very great feather in his cap once or twice if you will believe me a little man was made chief ruler of the nation for no other merit in the world than bringing home such a feather  but i have now said enough to let you see what a gallant little people these were and how happily they and their forefathers for nobody knows how many generations had lived with the immeasurable giant ant√¶us in the remaining part of the story i shall tell you of a far more astonishing battle than any that was fought between the pygmies and the cranes  one day the mighty ant√¶us was lolling at full length among his little friends his pinetree walkingstick lay on the ground close by his side his head was in one part of the kingdom and his feet extended across the boundaries of another part and he was taking whatever comfort he could get while the pygmies scrambled over him and peeped into his cavernous mouth and played among his hair sometimes for a minute or two the giant dropped asleep and snored like the rush of a whirlwind during one of these little bits of slumber a pygmy chanced to climb upon his shoulder and took a view around the horizon as from the summit of a hill and he beheld something a long way off which made him rub the bright specks of his eyes and look sharper than before at first he mistook it for a mountain and wondered how it had grown up so suddenly out of the earth but soon he saw the mountain move as it came nearer and nearer what should it turn out to be but a human shape not so big as ant√¶us it is true although a very enormous figure in comparison with pygmies and a vast deal bigger than the men whom we see nowadays  when the pygmy was quite satisfied that his eyes had not deceived him he scampered as fast as his legs would carry him to the giants ear and stooping over its cavity shouted lustily into it  halloo brother ant√¶us get up this minute and take your pinetree walkingstick in your hand here comes another giant to have a tussle with you  poh poh grumbled ant√¶us only half awake none of your nonsense my little fellow dont you see im sleepy there is not a giant on earth for whom i would take the trouble to get up  but the pygmy looked again and now perceived that the stranger was coming directly towards the prostrate form of ant√¶us with every step he looked less like a blue mountain and more like an immensely large man he was soon so nigh that there could be no possible mistake about the matter there he was with the sun flaming on his golden helmet and flashing from his polished breastplate he had a sword by his side and a lions skin over his back and on his right shoulder he carried a club which looked bulkier and heavier than the pinetree walkingstick of ant√¶us  by this time the whole nation of pygmies had seen the new wonder and a million of them set up a shout all together so that it really made quite an audible squeak  get up ant√¶us bestir yourself you lazy old giant here comes another giant as strong as you are to fight with you  nonsense nonsense growled the sleepy giant ill have my nap out  still the stranger drew nearer and now the pygmies could plainly discern that if his stature were less lofty than the giants yet his shoulders were even broader and in truth what a pair of shoulders they must have been as i told you a long while ago they once upheld the sky the pygmies being ten times as vivacious as their great numskull of a brother could not abide the giants slow movements and were determined to have him on his feet so they kept shouting to him and even went so far as to prick him with their swords  get up get up get up they cried up with you lazy bones the strange giants club is bigger than your own his shoulders are the broadest and we think him the stronger of the two  ant√¶us could not endure to have it said that any mortal was half so mighty as himself this latter remark of the pygmies pricked him deeper than their swords and sitting up in rather a sulky humor he gave a gape of several yards wide rubbed his eye and finally turned his stupid head in the direction whither his little friends were eagerly pointing  no sooner did he set eye on the stranger than leaping on his feet and seizing his walkingstick he strode a mile or two to meet him all the while brandishing the sturdy pinetree so that it whistled through the air  who are you thundered the giant and what do you want in my dominions  there was one strange thing about ant√¶us of which i have not yet told you lest hearing of so many wonders all in a lump you might not believe much more than half of them you are to know then that whenever this redoubtable giant touched the ground either with his hand his foot or any other part of his body he grew stronger than ever he had been before the earth you remember was his mother and was very fond of him as being almost the biggest of her children and so she took this method of keeping him always in full vigor some persons affirm that he grew ten times stronger at every touch others say that it was only twice as strong but only think of it whenever ant√¶us took a walk supposing it were but ten miles and that he stepped a hundred yards at a stride you may try to cipher out how much mightier he was on sitting down again than when he first started and whenever he flung himself on the earth to take a little repose even if he got up the very next instant he would be as strong as exactly ten just such giants as his former self it was well for the world that ant√¶us happened to be of a sluggish disposition and liked ease better than exercise for if he had frisked about like the pygmies and touched the earth as often as they did he would long ago have been strong enough to pull down the sky about peoples ears but these great lubberly fellows resemble mountains not only in bulk but in their disinclination to move  any other mortal man except the very one whom ant√¶us had now encountered would have been half frightened to death by the giants ferocious aspect and terrible voice but the stranger did not seem at all disturbed he carelessly lifted his club and balanced it in his hand measuring ant√¶us with his eye from head to foot not as if wondersmitten at his stature but as if he had seen a great many giants before and this was by no means the biggest of them in fact if the giant had been no bigger than the pygmies who stood pricking up their ears and looking and listening to what was going forward the stranger could not have been less afraid of him  who are you i say roared ant√¶us again whats your name why do you come hither speak you vagabond or ill try the thickness of your skull with my walkingstick  you are a very discourteous giant answered the stranger quietly and i shall probably have to teach you a little civility before we part as for my name it is hercules i have come hither because this is my most convenient road to the garden of the hesperides whither i am going to get three of the golden apples for king eurystheus  caitiff you shall go no farther bellowed ant√¶us putting on a grimmer look than before for he had heard of the mighty hercules and hated him because he was said to be so strong neither shall you go back whence you came  how will you prevent me asked hercules from going whither i please  by hitting you a rap with this pinetree here shouted ant√¶us scowling so that he made himself the ugliest monster in africa i am fifty times stronger than you and now that i stamp my foot upon the ground i am five hundred times stronger i am ashamed to kill such a puny little dwarf as you seem to be i will make a slave of you and you shall likewise be the slave of my brethren here the pygmies so throw down your club and your other weapons and as for that lions skin i intend to have a pair of gloves made of it  come and take it off my shoulders then answered hercules lifting his club  then the giant grinning with rage strode towerlike towards the stranger ten times strengthened at every step and fetched a monstrous blow at him with his pinetree which hercules caught upon his club and being more skilful than ant√¶us he paid him back such a rap upon the sconce that down tumbled the great lumbering manmountain flat upon the ground the poor little pygmies who really never dreamed that anybody in the world was half so strong as their brother ant√¶us were a good deal dismayed at this but no sooner was the giant down than up he bounced again with tenfold might and such a furious visage as was horrible to behold he aimed another blow at hercules but struck awry being blinded with wrath and only hit his poor innocent mother earth who groaned and trembled at the stroke his pinetree went so deep into the ground and stuck there so fast that before ant√¶us could get it out hercules brought down his club across his shoulders with a mighty thwack which made the giant roar as if all sorts of intolerable noises had come screeching and rumbling out of his immeasurable lungs in that one cry away it went over mountains and valleys and for aught i know was heard on the other side of the african deserts  as for the pygmies their capital city was laid in ruins by the concussion and vibration of the air and though there was uproar enough without their help they all set up a shriek out of three millions of little throats fancying no doubt that they swelled the giants bellow by at least ten times as much meanwhile ant√¶us had scrambled upon his feet again and pulled his pinetree out of the earth and all aflame with fury and more outrageously strong than ever he ran at hercules and brought down another blow  this time rascal shouted he you shall not escape me  but once more hercules warded off the stroke with his club and the giants pinetree was shattered into a thousand splinters most of which flew among the pygmies and did them more mischief than i like to think about before ant√¶us could get out of the way hercules let drive again and gave him another knockdown blow which sent him heels over head but served only to increase his already enormous and insufferable strength as for his rage there is no telling what a fiery furnace it had now got to be his one eye was nothing but a circle of red flame having now no weapons but his fists he doubled them up each bigger than a hogshead smote one against the other and danced up and down with absolute frenzy flourishing his immense arms about as if he meant not merely to kill hercules but to smash the whole world to pieces  come on roared this thundering giant let me hit you but one box on the ear and youll never have the headache again  now hercules though strong enough as you already know to hold the sky up began to be sensible that he should never win the victory if he kept on knocking ant√¶us down for by and by if he hit him such hard blows the giant would inevitably by the help of his mother earth become stronger than the mighty hercules himself so throwing down his club with which he had fought so many dreadful battles the hero stood ready to receive his antagonist with naked arms  step forward cried he since ive broken your pinetree well try which is the better man at a wrestlingmatch  aha then ill soon satisfy you shouted the giant for if there was one thing on which he prided himself more than another it was his skill in wrestling villain ill fling you where you can never pick yourself up again  on came ant√¶us hopping and capering with the scorching heat of his rage and getting new vigor wherewith to wreak his passion every time he hopped but hercules you must understand was wiser than this numskull of a giant and had thought of a way to fight himhuge earthborn monster that he wasand to conquer him too in spite of all that his mother earth could do for him watching his opportunity as the mad giant made a rush at him hercules caught him round the middle with both hands lifted him high into the air and held him aloft overhead  just imagine it my dear little friends what a spectacle it must have been to see this monstrous fellow sprawling in the air face downward kicking out his long legs and wriggling his whole vast body like a baby when its father holds it at armslength toward the ceiling  but the most wonderful thing was that as soon as ant√¶us was fairly off the earth he began to lose the vigor which he had gained by touching it hercules very soon perceived that his troublesome enemy was growing weaker both because he struggled and kicked with less violence and because the thunder of his big voice subsided into a grumble the truth was that unless the giant touched mother earth as often as once in five minutes not only his overgrown strength but the very breath of his life would depart from him hercules had guessed this secret and it may be well for us all to remember it in case we should ever have to fight a battle with a fellow like ant√¶us for these earthborn creatures are only difficult to conquer on their own ground but may easily be managed if we can contrive to lift them into a loftier and purer region so it proved with the poor giant whom i am really sorry for notwithstanding his uncivil way of treating strangers who came to visit him  when his strength and breath were quite gone hercules gave his huge body a toss and flung it about a mile off where it fell heavily and lay with no more motion than a sandhill it was too late for the giants mother earth to help him now and i should not wonder if his ponderous bones were lying on the same spot to this very day and were mistaken for those of an uncommonly large elephant  but alas me what a wailing did the poor little pygmies set up when they saw their enormous brother treated in this terrible manner if hercules heard their shrieks however he took no notice and perhaps fancied them only the shrill plaintive twittering of small birds that had been frightened from their nests by the uproar of the battle between himself and ant√¶us indeed his thoughts had been so much taken up with the giant that he had never once looked at the pygmies nor even knew that there was such a funny little nation in the world and now as he had travelled a good way and was also rather weary with his exertions in the fight he spread out his lions skin on the ground and reclining himself upon it fell fast asleep  as soon as the pygmies saw hercules preparing for a nap they nodded their little heads at one another and winked with their little eyes and when his deep regular breathing gave them notice that he was asleep they assembled together in an immense crowd spreading over a space of about twentyseven feet square one of their most eloquent orators and a valiant warrior enough besides though hardly so good at any other weapon as he was with his tongue climbed upon a toadstool and from that elevated position addressed the multitude his sentiments were pretty much as follows or at all events something like this was probably the upshot of his speech  tall pygmies and mighty little men you and all of us have seen what a public calamity has been brought to pass and what an insult has here been offered to the majesty of our nation yonder lies ant√¶us our great friend and brother slain within our territory by a miscreant who took him at disadvantage and fought him if fighting it can be called in a way that neither man nor giant nor pygmy ever dreamed of fighting until this hour and adding a grievous contumely to the wrong already done us the miscreant has now fallen asleep as quietly as if nothing were to be dreaded from our wrath it behooves you fellowcountrymen to consider in what aspect we shall stand before the world and what will be the verdict of impartial history should we suffer these accumulated outrages to go unavenged  ant√¶us was our brother born of that same beloved parent to whom we owe the thews and sinews as well as the courageous hearts which made him proud of our relationship he was our faithful ally and fell fighting as much for our national rights and immunities as for his own personal ones we and our forefathers have dwelt in friendship with him and held affectionate intercourse as man to man through immemorial generations you remember how often our entire people have reposed in his great shadow and how our little ones have played at hideandseek in the tangles of his hair and how his mighty footsteps have familiarly gone to and fro among us and never trodden upon any of our toes and there lies this dear brotherthis sweet and amiable friendthis brave and faithful allythis virtuous giantthis blameless and excellent ant√¶usdead dead silent powerless a mere mountain of clay forgive my tears nay i behold your own were we to drown the world with them could the world blame us  but to resume shall we my countrymen suffer this wicked stranger to depart unharmed and triumph in his treacherous victory among distant communities of the earth shall we not rather compel him to leave his bones here on our soil by the side of our slain brothers bones so that while one skeleton shall remain as the everlasting monument of our sorrow the other shall endure as long exhibiting to the whole human race a terrible example of pygmy vengeance such is the question i put it to you in full confidence of a response that shall be worthy of our national character and calculated to increase rather than diminish the glory which our ancestors have transmitted to us and which we ourselves have proudly vindicated in our welfare with the cranes  the orator was here interrupted by a burst of irrepressible enthusiasm every individual pygmy crying out that the national honor must be preserved at all hazards he bowed and making a gesture for silence wound up his harangue in the following admirable manner  it only remains for us then to decide whether we shall carry on the war in our national capacityone united people against a common enemyor whether some champion famous in former fights shall be selected to defy the slayer of our brother ant√¶us to single combat in the latter case though not unconscious that there may be taller men among you i hereby offer myself for that enviable duty and believe me dear countrymen whether i live or die the honor of this great country and the fame bequeathed us by our heroic progenitors shall suffer no diminution in my hands never while i can wield this sword of which i now fling away the scabbardnever never never even if the crimson hand that slew the great ant√¶us shall lay me prostrate like him on the soil which i give my life to defend  so saying this valiant pygmy drew out his weapon which was terrible to behold being as long as the blade of a penknife and sent the scabbard whirling over the heads of the multitude his speech was followed by an uproar of applause as its patriotism and selfdevotion unquestionably deserved and the shouts and clapping of hands would have been greatly prolonged had they not been rendered quite inaudible by a deep respiration vulgarly called a snore from the sleeping hercules  it was finally decided that the whole nation of pygmies should set to work to destroy hercules not be it understood from any doubt that a single champion would be capable of putting him to the sword but because he was a public enemy and all were desirous of sharing in the glory of his defeat there was a debate whether the national honor did not demand that a herald should be sent with a trumpet to stand over the ear of hercules and after blowing a blast right into it to defy him to the combat by formal proclamation but two or three venerable and sagacious pygmies well versed in state affairs gave it as their opinion that war already existed and that it was their rightful privilege to take the enemy by surprise moreover if awakened and allowed to get upon his feet hercules might happen to do them a mischief before he could be beaten down again for as these sage counsellors remarked the strangers club was really very big and had rattled like a thunderbolt against the skull of ant√¶us so the pygmies resolved to set aside all foolish punctilios and assail their antagonist at once  accordingly all the fighting men of the nation took their weapons and went boldly up to hercules who still lay fast asleep little dreaming of the harm which the pygmies meant to do him a body of twenty thousand archers marched in front with their little bows all ready and the arrows on the string the same number were ordered to clamber upon hercules some with spades to dig his eyes out and others with bundles of hay and all manner of rubbish with which they intended to plug up his mouth and nostrils so that he might perish for lack of breath these last however could by no means perform their appointed duty inasmuch as the enemys breath rushed out of his nose in an obstreperous hurricane and whirlwind which blew the pygmies away as fast as they came nigh it was found necessary therefore to hit upon some other method of carrying on the war  after holding a council the captains ordered their troops to collect sticks straws dry weeds and whatever combustible stuff they could find and make a pile of it heaping it high around the head of hercules as a great many thousand pygmies were employed in this task they soon brought together several bushels of inflammatory matter and raised so tall a heap that mounting on its summit they were quite upon a level with the sleepers face the archers meanwhile were stationed within bowshot with orders to let fly at hercules the instant that he stirred everything being in readiness a torch was applied to the pile which immediately burst into flames and soon waxed hot enough to roast the enemy had he but chosen to lie still a pygmy you know though so very small might set the world on fire just as easily as a giant could so that this was certainly the very best way of dealing with their foe provided they could have kept him quiet while the conflagration was going forward  but no sooner did hercules begin to be scorched than up he started with his hair in a red blaze  whats all this he cried bewildered with sleep and staring about him as if he expected to see another giant  at that moment the twenty thousand archers twanged their bowstrings and the arrows came whizzing like so many winged mosquitoes right into the face of hercules but i doubt whether more than half a dozen of them punctured the skin which was remarkably tough as you know the skin of a hero has good need to be  villain shouted all the pygmies at once you have killed the giant ant√¶us our great brother and the ally of our nation we declare bloody war against you and will slay you on the spot  surprised at the shrill piping of so many little voices hercules after putting out the conflagration of his hair gazed all round about but could see nothing at last however looking narrowly on the ground he espied the innumerable assemblage of pygmies at his feet he stooped down and taking up the nearest one between his thumb and finger set him on the palm of his left hand and held him at a proper distance for examination it chanced to be the very identical pygmy who had spoken from the top of the toadstool and had offered himself as a champion to meet hercules in single combat  what in the world my little fellow ejaculated hercules may you be  i am your enemy answered the valiant pygmy in his mightiest squeak you have slain the enormous ant√¶us our brother by the mothers side and for ages the faithful ally of our illustrious nation we are determined to put you to death and for my own part i challenge you to instant battle on equal ground  hercules was so tickled with the pygmys big words and warlike gestures that he burst into a great explosion of laughter and almost dropped the poor little mite of a creature off the palm of his hand through the ecstasy and convulsion of his merriment  upon my word cried he i thought i had seen wonders before todayhydras with nine heads stags with golden horns sixlegged men threeheaded dogs giants with furnaces in their stomachs and nobody knows what besides but here on the palm of my hand stands a wonder that outdoes them all your body my little friend is about the size of an ordinary mans finger pray how big may your soul be  as big as your own said the pygmy  hercules was touched with the little mans dauntless courage and could not help acknowledging such a brotherhood with him as one hero feels for another  my good little people said he making a low obeisance to the grand nation not for all the world would i do an intentional injury to such brave fellows as you your hearts seem to me so exceedingly great that upon my honor i marvel how your small bodies can contain them i sue for peace and as a condition of it will take five strides and be out of your kingdom at the sixth goodby i shall pick my steps carefully for fear of treading upon some fifty of you without knowing it ha ha ha ho ho ho for once hercules acknowledges himself vanquished  some writers say that hercules gathered up the whole race of pygmies in his lions skin and carried them home to greece for the children of king eurystheus to play with but this is a mistake he left them one and all within their own territory where for aught i can tell their descendants are alive to the present day building their little houses cultivating their little fields spanking their little children waging their little warfare with the cranes doing their little business whatever it may be and reading their little histories of ancient times in those histories perhaps it stands recorded that a great many centuries ago the valiant pygmies avenged the death of the giant ant√¶us by scaring away the mighty hercules     the dragons teeth   cadmus phoenix and cilix the three sons of king agenor and their little sister europa who was a very beautiful child were at play together near the seashore in their fathers kingdom of phoenicia they had rambled to some distance from the palace where their parents dwelt and were now in a verdant meadow on one side of which lay the sea all sparkling and dimpling in the sunshine and murmuring gently against the beach the three boys were very happy gathering flowers and twining them into garlands with which they adorned the little europa seated on the grass the child was almost hidden under an abundance of buds and blossoms whence her rosy face peeped merrily out and as cadmus said was the prettiest of all the flowers  just then there came a splendid butterfly fluttering along the meadow and cadmus phoenix and cilix set off in pursuit of it crying out that it was a flower with wings europa who was a little wearied with playing all day long did not chase the butterfly with her brothers but sat still where they had left her and closed her eyes for a while she listened to the pleasant murmur of the sea which was like a voice saying hush and bidding her go to sleep but the pretty child if she slept at all could not have slept more than a moment when she heard something trample on the grass not far from her and peeping out from the heap of flowers beheld a snowwhite bull  and whence could this bull have come europa and her brothers had been a long time playing in the meadow and had seen no cattle nor other living thing either there or on the neighboring hills  illustration cadmus sowing the dragons teeth  brother cadmus cried europa starting up out of the midst of the roses and lilies phoenix cilix where are you all help help come and drive away this bull  but her brothers were too far off to hear especially as the fright took away europas voice and hindered her from calling very loudly so there she stood with her pretty mouth wide open as pale as the white lilies that were twisted among the other flowers in her garlands  nevertheless it was the suddenness with which she had perceived the bull rather than anything frightful in his appearance that caused europa so much alarm on looking at him more attentively she began to see that he was a beautiful animal and even fancied a particularly amiable expression in his face as for his breaththe breath of cattle you know is always sweetit was as fragrant as if he had been grazing on no other food than rosebuds or at least the most delicate of cloverblossoms never before did a bull have such bright and tender eyes and such smooth horns of ivory as this one and the bull ran little races and capered sportively around the child so that she quite forgot how big and strong he was and from the gentleness and playfulness of his actions soon came to consider him as innocent a creature as a pet lamb  thus frightened as she at first was you might by and by have seen europa stroking the bulls forehead with her small white hand and taking the garlands off her own head to hang them on his neck and ivory horns then she pulled up some blades of grass and he ate them out of her hand not as if he were hungry but because he wanted to be friends with the child and took pleasure in eating what she had touched well my stars was there ever such a gentle sweet pretty and amiable creature as this bull and ever such a nice playmate for a little girl  when the animal saw for the bull had so much intelligence that it is really wonderful to think of when he saw that europa was no longer afraid of him he grew overjoyed and could hardly contain himself for delight he frisked about the meadow now here now there making sprightly leaps with as little effort as a bird expends in hopping from twig to twig indeed his motion was as light as if he were flying through the air and his hoofs seemed hardly to leave their print in the grassy soil over which he trod with his spotless hue he resembled a snowdrift wafted along by the wind once be galloped so far away that europa feared lest she might never see him again so setting up her childish voice she called him back  come back pretty creature she cried here is a nice cloverblossom  and then it was delightful to witness the gratitude of this amiable bull and how he was so full of joy and thankfulness that he capered higher than ever he came running and bowed his head before europa as if he knew her to be a kings daughter or else recognized the important truth that a little girl is everybodys queen and not only did the bull bend his neck he absolutely knelt down at her feet and made such intelligent nods and other inviting gestures that europa understood what he meant just as well as if he had put it in so many words  come dear child was what he wanted to say let me give you a ride on my back  at the first thought of such a thing europa drew back but then she considered in her wise little head that there could be no possible harm in taking just one gallop on the back of this docile and friendly animal who would certainly set her down the very instant she desired it and how it would surprise her brothers to see her riding across the green meadow and what merry times they might have either taking turns for a gallop or clambering on the gentle creature all four children together and careering round the field with shouts of laughter that would be heard as far off as king agenors palace  i think i will do it said the child to herself  and indeed why not she cast a glance around and caught a glimpse of cadmus phoenix and cilix who were still in pursuit of the butterfly almost at the other end of the meadow it would be the quickest way of rejoining them to get upon the white bulls back she came a step nearer to him therefore andsociable creature that he washe showed so much joy at this mark of her confidence that the child could not find it in her heart to hesitate any longer making one bound for this little princess was as active as a squirrel there sat europa on the beautiful bull holding an ivory horn in each hand lest she should fall off  softly pretty bull softly she said rather frightened at what she had done do not gallop too fast  having got the child on his back the animal gave a leap into the air and came down so like a feather that europa did not know when his hoofs touched the ground he then began a race to that part of the flowery plain where her three brothers were and where they had just caught their splendid butterfly europa screamed with delight and phoenix cilix and cadmus stood gaping at the spectacle of their sister mounted on a white bull not knowing whether to be frightened or to wish the same good luck for themselves the gentle and innocent creature for who could possibly doubt that he was so pranced round among the children as sportively as a kitten europa all the while looked down upon her brothers nodding and laughing but yet with a sort of stateliness in her rosy little face as the bull wheeled about to take another gallop across the meadow the child waved her hand and said goodby playfully pretending that she was now bound on a distant journey and might not see her brothers again for nobody could tell how long  goodby shouted cadmus phoenix and cilix all in one breath  but together with her enjoyment of the sport there was still a little remnant of fear in the childs heart so that her last look at the three boys was a troubled one and made them feel as if their dear sister were really leaving them forever and what do you think the snowy bull did next why he set off as swift as the wind straight down to the seashore scampered across the sand took an airy leap and plunged right in among the foaming billows the white spray rose in a shower over him and little europa and fell spattering down upon the water  then what a scream of terror did the poor child send forth the three brothers screamed manfully likewise and ran to the shore as fast as their legs would carry them with cadmus at their head but it was too late when they reached the margin of the sand the treacherous animal was already far away in the wide blue sea with only his snowy head and tail emerging and poor little europa between them stretching out one hand towards her dear brothers while she grasped the bulls ivory horn with the other and there stood cadmus phoenix and cilix gazing at this sad spectacle through their tears until they could no longer distinguish the bulls snowy head from the whitecapped billows that seemed to boil up out of the seas depths around him nothing more was ever seen of the white bullnothing more of the beautiful child  this was a mournful story as you may well think for the three boys to carry home to their parents king agenor their father was the ruler of the whole country but he loved his little daughter europa better than his kingdom or than all his other children or than anything else in the world therefore when cadmus and his two brothers came crying home and told him how that a white bull had carried off their sister and swam with her over the sea the king was quite beside himself with grief and rage although it was now twilight and fast growing dark he bade them set out instantly in search of her  never shall you see my face again he cried unless you bring me back my little europa to gladden me with her smiles and her pretty ways begone and enter my presence no more till you come leading her by the hand  as king agenor said this his eyes flashed fire for he was a very passionate king and he looked so terribly angry that the poor boys did not even venture to ask for their suppers but slunk away out of the palace and only paused on the steps a moment to consult whither they should go first while they were standing there all in dismay their mother queen telephassa who happened not to be by when they told the story to the king came hurrying after them and said that she too would go in quest of her daughter  oh no mother cried the boys the night is dark and there is no knowing what troubles and perils we may meet with  alas my dear children answered poor queen telephassa weeping bitterly that is only another reason why i should go with you if i should lose you too as well as my little europa what would become of me  and let me go likewise said their playfellow thasus who came running to join them  thasus was the son of a seafaring person in the neighborhood he had been brought up with the young princes and was their intimate friend and loved europa very much so they consented that he should accompany them the whole party therefore set forth together cadmus phoenix cilix and thasus clustered round queen telephassa grasping her skirts and begging her to lean upon their shoulders whenever she felt weary in this manner they went down the palace steps and began a journey which turned out to be a great deal longer than they dreamed of the last that they saw of king agenor he came to the door with a servant holding a torch beside him and called after them into the gathering darkness  remember never ascend these steps again without the child  never sobbed queen telephassa and the three brothers and thasus answered never never never never  and they kept their word year after year king agenor sat in the solitude of his beautiful palace listening in vain for their returning footsteps hoping to hear the familiar voice of the queen and the cheerful talk of his sons and their playfellow thasus entering the door together and the sweet childish accents of little europa in the midst of them but so long a time went by that at last if they had really come the king would not have known that this was the voice of telephassa and these the younger voices that used to make such joyful echoes when the children were playing about the palace we must now leave king agenor to sit on his throne and must go along with queen telephassa and her four youthful companions  they went on and on and travelled a long way and passed over mountains and rivers and sailed over seas here and there and everywhere they made continual inquiry if any person could tell them what had become of europa the rustic people of whom they asked this question paused a little while from their labors in the field and looked very much surprised they thought it strange to behold a woman in the garb of a queen for telephassa in her haste had forgotten to take off her crown and her royal robes roaming about the country with four lads around her on such an errand as this seemed to be but nobody could give them any tidings of europa nobody had seen a little girl dressed like a princess and mounted on a snowwhite bull which galloped as swiftly as the wind  i cannot tell you how long queen telephassa and cadmus phoenix and cilix her three sons and thasus their playfellow went wandering along the highways and bypaths or through the pathless wildernesses of the earth in this manner but certain it is that before they reached any place of rest their splendid garments were quite worn out they all looked very much travelstained and would have had the dust of many countries on their shoes if the streams through which they had waded had not washed it all away when they had been gone a year telephassa threw away her crown because it chafed her forehead  it has given me many a headache said the poor queen and it cannot cure my heartache  as fast as their princely robes got torn and tattered they exchanged them for such mean attire as ordinary people wore by and by they came to have a wild and homeless aspect so that you would sooner have taken them for a gypsy family than a queen and three princes and a young nobleman who had once a palace for their home and a train of servants to do their bidding the four boys grew up to be tall young men with sunburnt faces each of them girded on a sword to defend themselves against the perils of the way when the husbandmen at whose farmhouses they sought hospitality needed their assistance in the harvestfield they gave it willingly and queen telephassa who had done no work in her palace save to braid silk threads with golden ones came behind them to bind the sheaves if payment was offered they shook their heads and only asked for tidings of europa  there are bulls enough in my pasture the old farmer would reply but i never heard of one like this you tell me of a snowwhite bull with a little princess on his back ho ho i ask your pardon good folks but there was never such a sight seen hereabouts  at last when his upper lip began to have the down on it phoenix grew weary of rambling hither and thither to no purpose so one day when they happened to be passing through a pleasant and solitary tract of country he sat himself down on a heap of moss  i can go no farther said phoenix it is a mere foolish waste of life to spend it as we do in always wandering up and down and never coming to any home at nightfall our sister is lost and never will be found she probably perished in the sea or to whatever shore the white bull may have carried her it is now so many years ago that there would be neither love nor acquaintance between us should we meet again my father has forbidden us to return to his palace so i shall build me a hut of branches and dwell here  well son phoenix said telephassa sorrowfully you have grown to be a man and must do as you judge best but for my part i will still go in quest of my poor child  and we three will go along with you cried cadmus and cilix and their faithful friend thasus  but before setting out they all helped phoenix to build a habitation when completed it was a sweet rural bower roofed overhead with an arch of living boughs inside there were two pleasant rooms one of which had a soft heap of moss for a bed while the other was furnished with a rustic seat or two curiously fashioned out of the crooked roots of trees so comfortable and homelike did it seem that telephassa and her three companions could not help sighing to think that they must still roam about the world instead of spending the remainder of their lives in some such cheerful abode as they had here built for phoenix but when they bade him farewell phoenix shed tears and probably regretted that he was no longer to keep them company  however he had fixed upon an admirable place to dwell in and by and by there came other people who chanced to have no homes and seeing how pleasant a spot it was they built themselves huts in the neighborhood of phoenixs habitation thus before many years went by a city had grown up there in the centre of which was seen a stately palace of marble wherein dwelt phoenix clothed in a purple robe and wearing a golden crown upon his head for the inhabitants of the new city finding that he had royal blood in his veins had chosen him to be their king the very first decree of state which king phoenix issued was that if a maiden happened to arrive in the kingdom mounted on a snowwhite bull and calling herself europa his subjects should treat her with the greatest kindness and respect and immediately bring her to the palace you may see by this that phoenixs conscience never quite ceased to trouble him for giving up the quest of his dear sister and sitting himself down to be comfortable while his mother and her companions went onward  but often and often at the close of a weary days journey did telephassa and cadmus cilix and thasus remember the pleasant spot in which they had left phoenix it was a sorrowful prospect for these wanderers that on the morrow they must again set forth and that after many nightfalls they would perhaps be no nearer the close of their toilsome pilgrimage than now these thoughts made them all melancholy at times but appeared to torment cilix more than the rest of the party at length one morning when they were taking their staffs in hand to set out he thus addressed them  my dear mother and you good brother cadmus and my friend thasus methinks we are like people in a dream there is no substance in the life which we are leading it is such a dreary length of time since the white bull carried off my sister europa that i have quite forgotten how she looked and the tones of her voice and indeed almost doubt whether such a little girl ever lived in the world and whether she once lived or no i am convinced that she no longer survives and that therefore it is the merest folly to waste our own lives and happiness in seeking her were we to find her she would now be a woman grown and would look upon us all as strangers so to tell you the truth i have resolved to take up my abode here and i entreat you mother brother and friend to follow my example  not i for one said telephassa although the poor queen firmly as she spoke was so travelworn that she could hardly put her foot to the groundnot i for one in the depths of my heart little europa is still the rosy child who ran to gather flowers so many years ago she has not grown to womanhood nor forgotten me at noon at night journeying onward sitting down to rest her childish voice is always in my ears calling mother mother stop here who may there is no repose for me  nor for me said cadmus while my dear mother pleases to go onward  and the faithful thasus too was resolved to bear them company they remained with cilix a few days however and helped him to build a rustic bower resembling the one which they had formerly built for phoenix  when they were bidding him farewell cilix burst into tears and told his mother that it seemed just as melancholy a dream to stay there in solitude as to go onward if she really believed that they would ever find europa he was willing to continue the search with them even now but telephassa bade him remain there and be happy if his own heart would let him so the pilgrims took their leave of him and departed and were hardly out of sight before some other wandering people came along that way and saw cilixs habitation and were greatly delighted with the appearance of the place there being abundance of unoccupied ground in the neighborhood these strangers built huts for themselves and were soon joined by a multitude of new settlers who quickly formed a city in the middle of it was seen a magnificent palace of colored marble on the balcony of which every noontide appeared cilix in a long purple robe and with a jewelled crown upon his head for the inhabitants when they found out that he was a kings son had considered him the fittest of all men to be a king himself  one of the first acts of king cilixs government was to send out an expedition consisting of a grave ambassador and an escort of bold and hardy young men with orders to visit the principal kingdoms of the earth and inquire whether a young maiden had passed through those regions galloping swiftly on a white bull it is therefore plain to my mind that cilix secretly blamed himself for giving up the search for europa as long as he was able to put one foot before the other  as for telephassa and cadmus and the good thasus it grieves me to think of them still keeping up that weary pilgrimage the two young men did their best for the poor queen helping her over the rough places often carrying her across rivulets in their faithful arms and seeking to shelter her at nightfall even when they themselves lay on the ground sad sad it was to hear them asking of every passerby if he had seen europa so long after the white bull had carried her away but though the gray years thrust themselves between and made the childs figure dim in their remembrance neither of these truehearted three ever dreamed of giving up the search  one morning however poor thasus found that he had sprained his ankle and could not possibly go a step farther  after a few days to be sure said he mournfully i might make shift to hobble along with a stick but that would only delay you and perhaps hinder you from finding dear little europa after all your pains and trouble do you go forward therefore my beloved companions and leave me to follow as i may  thou hast been a true friend dear thasus said queen telephassa kissing his forehead being neither my son nor the brother of our lost europa thou hast shown thyself truer to me and her than phoenix and cilix did whom we have left behind us without thy loving help and that of my son cadmus my limbs could not have borne me half so far as this now take thy rest and be at peace forand it is the first time i have owned it to myselfi begin to question whether we shall ever find my beloved daughter in this world  saying this the poor queen shed tears because it was a grievous trial to the mothers heart to confess that her hopes were growing faint from that day forward cadmus noticed that she never travelled with the same alacrity of spirit that had heretofore supported her her weight was heavier upon his arm  before setting out cadmus helped thasus build a bower while telephassa being too infirm to give any great assistance advised them how to fit it up and furnish it so that it might be as comfortable as a hut of branches could thasus however did not spend all his days in this green bower for it happened to him as to phoenix and cilix that other homeless people visited the spot and liked it and built themselves habitations in the neighborhood so here in the course of a few years was another thriving city with a red freestone palace in the centre of it where thasus sat upon a throne doing justice to the people with a purple robe over his shoulders a sceptre in his hand and a crown upon his head the inhabitants had made him king not for the sake of any royal blood for none was in his veins but because thasus was an upright truehearted and courageous man and therefore fit to rule  but when the affairs of his kingdom were all settled king thasus laid aside his purple robe and crown and sceptre and bade his worthiest subject distribute justice to the people in his stead then grasping the pilgrims staff that had supported him so long he set forth again hoping still to discover some hoofmark of the snowwhite bull some trace of the vanished child he returned after a lengthened absence and sat down wearily upon his throne to his latest hour nevertheless king thasus showed his truehearted remembrance of europa by ordering that a fire should always be kept burning in his palace and a bath steaming hot and food ready to be served up and a bed with snowwhite sheets in case the maiden should arrive and require immediate refreshment and though europa never came the good thasus had the blessings of many a poor traveller who profited by the food and lodging which were meant for the little playmate of the kings boyhood  telephassa and cadmus were now pursuing their weary way with no companion but each other the queen leaned heavily upon her sons arm and could walk only a few miles a day but for all her weakness and weariness she would not be persuaded to give up the search it was enough to bring tears into the eyes of bearded men to hear the melancholy tone with which she inquired of every stranger whether he could tell her any news of the lost child  have you seen a little girlno no i mean a young maiden of full growthpassing by this way mounted on a snowwhite bull which gallops as swiftly as the wind  we have seen no such wondrous sight the people would reply and very often taking cadmus aside they whispered to him is this stately and sadlooking woman your mother surely she is not in her right mind and you ought to take her home and make her comfortable and do your best to get this dream out of her fancy  it is no dream said cadmus everything else is a dream save that  but one day telephassa seemed feebler than usual and leaned almost her whole weight on the arm of cadmus and walked more slowly than ever before at last they reached a solitary spot where she told her son that she must needs lie down and take a good long rest  a good long rest she repeated looking cadmus tenderly in the facea good long rest thou dearest one  as long as you please dear mother answered cadmus  telephassa bade him sit down on the turf beside her and then she took his hand  my son said she fixing her dim eyes most lovingly upon him this rest that i speak of will be very long indeed you must not wait till it is finished dear cadmus you do not comprehend me you must make a grave here and lay your mothers weary frame into it my pilgrimage is over  cadmus burst into tears and for a long time refused to believe that his dear mother was now to be taken from him but telephassa reasoned with him and kissed him and at length made him discern that it was better for her spirit to pass away out of the toil the weariness the grief and disappointment which had burdened her on earth ever since the child was lost he therefore repressed his sorrow and listened to her last words  dearest cadmus said she thou hast been the truest son that mother ever had and faithful to the last who else would have borne with my infirmities as thou hast it is owing to thy care thou tenderest child that my grave was not dug long years ago in some valley or on some hillside that lies far far behind us it is enough thou shalt wander no more on this hopeless search but when thou hast laid thy mother in the earth then go my son to delphi and inquire of the oracle what thou shalt do next  o mother mother cried cadmus couldst thou but have seen my sister before this hour  it matters little now answered telephassa and there was a smile upon her face i go to the better world and sooner or later shall find my daughter there  i will not sadden you my little hearers with telling how telephassa died and was buried but will only say that her dying smile grew brighter instead of vanishing from her dead face so that cadmus felt convinced that at her very first step into the better world she had caught europa in her arms he planted some flowers on his mothers grave and left them to grow there and make the place beautiful when he should be far away  after performing this last sorrowful duty he set forth alone and took the road towards the famous oracle of delphi as telephassa had advised him on his way thither he still inquired of most people whom he met whether they had seen europa for to say the truth cadmus had grown so accustomed to ask the question that it came to his lips as readily as a remark about the weather he received various answers some told him one thing and some another among the rest a mariner affirmed that many years before in a distant country he had heard a rumor about a white bull which came swimming across the sea with a child on his back dressed up in flowers that were blighted by the seawater he did not know what had become of the child or the bull and cadmus suspected indeed by a queer twinkle in the mariners eyes that he was putting a joke upon him and had never really heard anything about the matter  poor cadmus found it more wearisome to travel alone than to bear all his dear mothers weight while she had kept him company his heart you will understand was now so heavy that it seemed impossible sometimes to carry it any farther but his limbs were strong and active and well accustomed to exercise he walked swiftly along thinking of king agenor and queen telephassa and his brothers and the friendly thasus all of whom he had left behind him at one point of his pilgrimage or another and never expected to see them any more full of these remembrances he came within sight of a lofty mountain which the people thereabouts told him was called parnassus on the slope of mount parnassus was the famous delphi whither cadmus was going  this delphi was supposed to be the very midmost spot of the whole world the place of the oracle was a certain cavity in the mountainside over which when cadmus came thither he found a rude bower of branches it reminded him of those which he had helped to build for phoenix and cilix and afterwards for thasus in later times when multitudes of people came from great distances to put questions to the oracle a spacious temple of marble was erected over the spot but in the days of cadmus as i have told you there was only this rustic bower with its abundance of green foliage and a tuft of shrubbery that ran wild over the mysterious hole in the hillside  when cadmus had thrust a passage through the tangled boughs and made his way into the bower he did not at first discern the halfhidden cavity but soon he felt a cold stream of air rushing out of it with so much force that it shook the ringlets on his cheek pulling away the shrubbery which clustered over the hole he bent forward and spoke in a distinct but reverential tone as if addressing some unseen personage inside of the mountain  sacred oracle of delphi said he whither shall i go next in quest of my dear sister europa  there was at first a deep silence and then a rushing sound or a noise like a long sigh proceeding out of the interior of the earth this cavity you must know was looked upon as a sort of fountain of truth which sometimes gushed out in audible words although for the most part these words were such a riddle that they might just as well have stayed at the bottom of the hole but cadmus was more fortunate than many others who went to delphi in search of truth by and by the rushing noise began to sound like articulate language it repeated over and over again the following sentence which after all was so like the vague whistle of a blast of air that cadmus really did not quite know whether it meant anything or not  seek her no more seek her no more seek her no more  what then shall i do asked cadmus  for ever since he was a child you know it had been the great object of his life to find his sister from the very hour that he left following the butterfly in the meadow near his fathers palace he had done his best to follow europa over land and sea and now if he must give up the search he seemed to have no more business in the world  but again the sighing gust of air grew into something like a hoarse voice  follow the cow it said follow the cow follow the cow  and when these words had been repeated until cadmus was tired of hearing them especially as he could not imagine what cow it was or why he was to follow her the gusty hole gave vent to another sentence  where the stray cow lies down there is your home  these words were pronounced but a single time and died away into a whisper before cadmus was fully satisfied that he had caught the meaning he put other questions but received no answer only the gust of wind sighed continually out of the cavity and blew the withered leaves rustling along the ground before it  did there really come any words out of the hole thought cadmus or have i been dreaming all this while  he turned away from the oracle and thought himself no wiser than when he came thither caring little what might happen to him he took the first path that offered itself and went along at a sluggish pace for having no object in view nor any reason to go one way more than another it would certainly have been foolish to make haste whenever he met anybody the old question was at his tongues end  have you seen a beautiful maiden dressed like a kings daughter and mounted on a snowwhite bull that gallops as swiftly as the wind  but remembering what the oracle had said he only half uttered the words and then mumbled the rest indistinctly and from his confusion people must have imagined that this handsome young man had lost his wits  i know not how far cadmus had gone nor could he himself have told you when at no great distance before him he beheld a brindled cow she was lying down by the wayside and quietly chewing her cud nor did she take any notice of the young man until he had approached pretty nigh then getting leisurely upon her feet and giving her head a gentle toss she began to move along at a moderate pace often pausing just long enough to crop a mouthful of grass cadmus loitered behind whistling idly to himself and scarcely noticing the cow until the thought occurred to him whether this could possibly be the animal which according to the oracles response was to serve him for a guide but he smiled at himself for fancying such a thing he could not seriously think that this was the cow because she went along so quietly behaving just like any other cow evidently she neither knew nor cared so much as a wisp of hay about cadmus and was only thinking how to get her living along the wayside where the herbage was green and fresh perhaps she was going home to be milked  cow cow cow cried cadmus hey brindle hey stop my good cow  he wanted to come up with the cow so as to examine her and see if she would appear to know him or whether there were any peculiarities to distinguish her from a thousand other cows whose only business is to fill the milkpail and sometimes kick it over but still the brindled cow trudged on whisking her tail to keep the flies away and taking as little notice of cadmus as she well could if he walked slowly so did the cow and seized the opportunity to graze if he quickened his pace the cow went just so much the faster and once when cadmus tried to catch her by running she threw out her heels stuck her tail straight on end and set off at a gallop looking as queerly as cows generally do while putting themselves to their speed  when cadmus saw that it was impossible to come up with her he walked on moderately as before the cow too went leisurely on without looking behind wherever the grass was greenest there she nibbled a mouthful or two where a brook glistened brightly across the path there the cow drank and breathed a comfortable sigh and drank again and trudged onward at the pace that best suited herself and cadmus  i do believe thought cadmus that this may be the cow that was foretold me if it be the one i suppose she will lie down somewhere hereabouts  whether it were the oracular cow or some other one it did not seem reasonable that she should travel a great way farther so whenever they reached a particularly pleasant spot on a breezy hillside or in a sheltered vale or flowery meadow on the shore of a calm lake or along the bank of a clear stream cadmus looked eagerly around to see if the situation would suit him for a home but still whether he liked the place or no the brindled cow never offered to lie down on she went at the quiet pace of a cow going homeward to the barnyard and every moment cadmus expected to see a milkmaid approaching with a pail or a herdsman running to head the stray animal and turn her back towards the pasture but no milkmaid came no herdsman drove her back and cadmus followed the stray brindle till he was almost ready to drop down with fatigue  o brindled cow cried he in a tone of despair do you never mean to stop  he had now grown too intent on following her to think of lagging behind however long the way and whatever might be his fatigue indeed it seemed as if there were something about the animal that bewitched people several persons who happened to see the brindled cow and cadmus following behind began to trudge after her precisely as he did cadmus was glad of somebody to converse with and therefore talked very freely to these good people he told them all his adventures and how he had left king agenor in his palace and phoenix at one place and cilix at another and thasus at a third and his dear mother queen telephassa under a flowery sod so that now he was quite alone both friendless and homeless he mentioned likewise that the oracle had bidden him be guided by a cow and inquired of the strangers whether they supposed that this brindled animal could be the one  why tis a very wonderful affair answered one of his new companions i am pretty well acquainted with the ways of cattle and i never knew a cow of her own accord to go so far without stopping if my legs will let me ill never leave following the beast till she lies down  nor i said a second  nor i cried a third if she goes a hundred miles farther im determined to see the end of it  the secret of it was you must know that the cow was an enchanted cow and that without their being conscious of it she threw some of her enchantment over everybody that took so much as half a dozen steps behind her they could not possibly help following her though all the time they fancied themselves doing it of their own accord the cow was by no means very nice in choosing her path so that sometimes they had to scramble over rocks or wade through mud and mire and were all in a terribly bedraggled condition and tired to death and very hungry into the bargain what a weary business it was  but still they kept trudging stoutly forward and talking as they went the strangers grew very fond of cadmus and resolved never to leave him but to help him build a city wherever the cow might lie down in the centre of it there should be a noble palace in which cadmus might dwell and be their king with a throne a crown and sceptre a purple robe and everything else that a king ought to have for in him there was the royal blood and the royal heart and the head that knew how to rule  while they were talking of these schemes and beguiling the tediousness of the way with laying out the plan of the new city one of the company happened to look at the cow  joy joy cried he clapping his hands brindle is going to lie down  they all looked and sure enough the cow had stopped and was staring leisurely about her as other cows do when on the point of lying down and slowly slowly did she recline herself on the soft grass first bending her fore legs and then crouching her hind ones when cadmus and his companions came up with her there was the brindled cow taking her ease chewing her cud and looking them quietly in the face as if this was just the spot she had been seeking for and as if it were all a matter of course  this then said cadmus gazing around him this is to be my home  it was a fertile and lovely plain with great trees flinging their sunspeckled shadows over it and hills fencing it in from the rough weather at no great distance they beheld a river gleaming in the sunshine a home feeling stole into the heart of poor cadmus he was very glad to know that here he might awake in the morning without the necessity of pulling on his dusty sandals to travel farther and farther the days and the years would pass over him and find him still in this pleasant spot if he could have had his brothers with him and his friend thasus and could have seen his dear mother under a roof of his own he might here have been happy after all their disappointments some day or other too his sister europa might have come quietly to the door of his home and smiled round upon the familiar faces but indeed since there was no hope of regaining the friends of his boyhood or ever seeing his dear sister again cadmus resolved to make himself happy with these new companions who had grown so fond of him while following the cow  yes my friends said he to them this is to be our home here we will build our habitations the brindled cow which has led us hither will supply us with milk we will cultivate the neighboring soil and lead an innocent and happy life  his companions joyfully assented to this plan and in the first place being very hungry and thirsty they looked about them for the means of providing a comfortable meal not far off they saw a tuft of trees which appeared as if there might be a spring of water beneath them they went thither to fetch some leaving cadmus stretched on the ground along with the brindled cow for now that he had found a place of rest it seemed as if all the weariness of his pilgrimage ever since he left king agenors palace had fallen upon him at once but his new friends had not long been gone when he was suddenly startled by cries shouts and screams and the noise of a terrible struggle and in the midst of it all a most awful hissing which went right through his ears like a rough saw  running towards the tuft of trees he beheld the head and fiery eyes of an immense serpent or dragon with the widest jaws that ever a dragon had and a vast many rows of horribly sharp teeth before cadmus could reach the spot this pitiless reptile had killed his poor companions and was busily devouring them making but a mouthful of each man  it appears that the fountain of water was enchanted and that the dragon had been set to guard it so that no mortal might ever quench his thirst there as the neighboring inhabitants carefully avoided the spot it was now a long time not less than a hundred years or thereabouts since the monster had broken his fast and as was natural enough his appetite had grown to be enormous and was not half satisfied by the poor people whom he had just eaten up when he caught sight of cadmus therefore he set up another abominable hiss and flung back his immense jaws until his mouth looked like a great red cavern at the farther end of which were seen the legs of his last victim whom he had hardly had time to swallow  but cadmus was so enraged at the destruction of his friends that he cared neither for the size of the dragons jaws nor for his hundreds of sharp teeth drawing his sword he rushed at the monster and flung himself right into his cavernous mouth this bold method of attacking him took the dragon by surprise for in fact cadmus had leaped so far down into his throat that the rows of terrible teeth could not close upon him nor do him the least harm in the world thus though the struggle was a tremendous one and though the dragon shattered the tuft of trees into small splinters by the lashing of his tail yet as cadmus was all the while slashing and stabbing at his very vitals it was not long before the scaly wretch bethought himself of slipping away he had not gone his length however when the brave cadmus gave him a swordthrust that finished the battle and creeping out of the gateway of the creatures jaws there he beheld him still wriggling his vast bulk although there was no longer life enough in him to harm a little child  but do not you suppose that it made cadmus sorrowful to think of the melancholy fate which had befallen those poor friendly people who had followed the cow along with him it seemed as if he were doomed to lose everybody whom he loved or to see them perish in one way or another and here he was after all his toils and troubles in a solitary place with not a single human being to help him build a hut  what shall i do cried he aloud it were better for me to have been devoured by the dragon as my poor companions were  cadmus said a voicebut whether it came from above or below him or whether it spoke within his own breast the young man could not tellcadmus pluck out the dragons teeth and plant them in the earth  this was a strange thing to do nor was it very easy i should imagine to dig out all those deeprooted fangs from the dead dragons jaws but cadmus toiled and tugged and after pounding the monstrous head almost to pieces with a great stone he at last collected as many teeth as might have filled a bushel or two the next thing was to plant them this likewise was a tedious piece of work especially as cadmus was already exhausted with killing the dragon and knocking his head to pieces and had nothing to dig the earth with that i know of unless it were his swordblade finally however a sufficiently large tract of ground was turned up and sown with this new kind of seed although half of the dragons teeth still remained to be planted some other day  cadmus quite out of breath stood leaning upon his sword and wondering what was to happen next he had waited but a few moments when he began to see a sight which was as great a marvel as the most marvellous thing i ever told you about  the sun was shining slantwise over the field and showed all the moist dark soil just like any other newly planted piece of ground all at once cadmus fancied he saw something glisten very brightly first at one spot then at another and then at a hundred and a thousand spots together soon he perceived them to be the steel heads of spears sprouting up everywhere like so many stalks of grain and continually growing taller and taller next appeared a vast number of bright swordblades thrusting themselves up in the same way a moment afterwards the whole surface of the ground was broken up by a multitude of polished brass helmets coming up like a crop of enormous beans so rapidly did they grow that cadmus now discerned the fierce countenance of a man beneath every one in short before he had time to think what a wonderful affair it was he beheld an abundant harvest of what looked like human beings armed with helmets and breastplates shields swords and spears and before they were well out of the earth they brandished their weapons and clashed them one against another seeming to think little while as they had yet lived that they had wasted too much of life without a battle every tooth of the dragon had produced one of these sons of deadly mischief  up sprouted also a great many trumpeters and with the first breath that they drew they put their brazen trumpets to their lips and sounded a tremendous and earshattering blast so that the whole space just now so quiet and solitary reverberated with the clash and clang of arms the bray of warlike music and the shouts of angry men so enraged did they all look that cadmus fully expected them to put the whole world to the sword how fortunate would it be for a great conqueror if he could get a bushel of the dragons teeth to sow  cadmus said the same voice which he had before heard throw a stone into the midst of the armed men  so cadmus seized a large stone and flinging it into the middle of the earth army saw it strike the breastplate of a gigantic and fiercelooking warrior immediately on feeling the blow he seemed to take it for granted that somebody had struck him and uplifting his weapon he smote his next neighbor a blow that cleft his helmet asunder and stretched him on the ground in an instant those nearest the fallen warrior began to strike at one another with their swords and stab with their spears the confusion spread wider and wider each man smote down his brother and was himself smitten down before he had time to exult in his victory the trumpeters all the while blew their blasts shriller and shriller each soldier shouted a battlecry and often fell with it on his lips it was the strangest spectacle of causeless wrath and of mischief for no good end that had ever been witnessed but after all it was neither more foolish nor more wicked than a thousand battles that have since been fought in which men have slain their brothers with just as little reason as these children of the dragons teeth it ought to be considered too that the dragon people were made for nothing else whereas other mortals were born to love and help one another  well this memorable battle continued to rage until the ground was strewn with helmeted heads that had been cut off of all the thousands that began the fight there were only five left standing these now rushed from different parts of the field and meeting in the middle of it clashed their swords and struck at each others hearts as fiercely as ever  cadmus said the voice again bid those five warriors sheathe their swords they will help you to build the city  without hesitating an instant cadmus stepped forward with the aspect of a king and a leader and extending his drawn sword amongst them spoke to the warriors in a stern and commanding voice  sheathe your weapons said he  and forthwith feeling themselves bound to obey him the five remaining sons of the dragons teeth made him a military salute with their swords returned them to the scabbards and stood before cadmus in a rank eyeing him as soldiers eye their captain while awaiting the word of command  these five men had probably sprung from the biggest of the dragons teeth and were the boldest and strongest of the whole army they were almost giants indeed and had good need to be so else they never could have lived through so terrible a fight they still had a very furious look and if cadmus happened to glance aside would glare at one another with fire flashing out of their eyes it was strange too to observe how the earth out of which they had so lately grown was incrusted here and there on their bright breastplates and even begrimed their faces just as you may have seen it clinging to beets and carrots when pulled out of their native soil cadmus hardly knew whether to consider them as men or some odd kind of vegetable although on the whole he concluded that there was human nature in them because they were so fond of trumpets and weapons and so ready to shed blood  they looked him earnestly in the face waiting for his next order and evidently desiring no other employment than to follow him from one battlefield to another all over the wide world but cadmus was wiser than these earthborn creatures with the dragons fierceness in them and knew better how to use their strength and hardihood  come said he you are sturdy fellows make yourselves useful quarry some stones with those great swords of yours and help me to build a city  the five soldiers grumbled a little and muttered that it was their business to overthrow cities not to build them up but cadmus looked at them with a stern eye and spoke to them in a tone of authority so that they knew him for their master and never again thought of disobeying his commands they set to work in good earnest and toiled so diligently that in a very short time a city began to make its appearance at first to be sure the workmen showed a quarrelsome disposition like savage beasts they would doubtless have done one another a mischief if cadmus had not kept watch over them and quelled the fierce old serpent that lurked in their hearts when he saw it gleaming out of their wild eyes but in course of time they got accustomed to honest labor and had sense enough to feel that there was more true enjoyment in living in peace and doing good to ones neighbor than in striking at him with a twoedged sword it may not be too much to hope that the rest of mankind will by and by grow as wise and peaceable as these five earthbegrimed warriors who sprang from the dragons teeth  and now the city was built and there was a home in it for each of the workmen but the palace of cadmus was not yet erected because they had left it till the last meaning to introduce all the new improvements of architecture and make it very commodious as well as stately and beautiful after finishing the rest of their labors they all went to bed betimes in order to rise in the gray of the morning and get at least the foundation of the edifice laid before nightfall but when cadmus arose and took his way toward the site where the palace was to be built followed by his five sturdy workmen marching all in a row what do you think he saw  what should it be but the most magnificent palace that had ever been seen in the world it was built of marble and other beautiful kinds of stone and rose high into the air with a splendid dome and portico along the front and carved pillars and everything else that befitted the habitation of a mighty king it had grown up out of the earth in almost as short a time as it had taken the armed host to spring from the dragons teeth and what made the matter more strange no seed of this stately edifice had ever been planted  when the five workmen beheld the dome with the morning sunshine making it look golden and glorious they gave a great shout  long live king cadmus they cried in his beautiful palace  and the new king with his five faithful followers at his heels shouldering their pickaxes and marching in a rank for they still had a soldierlike sort of behavior as their nature was ascended the palace steps halting at the entrance they gazed through a long vista of lofty pillars that were ranged from end to end of a great hall at the farther extremity of this hall approaching slowly towards him cadmus beheld a female figure wonderfully beautiful and adorned with a royal robe and a crown of diamonds over her golden ringlets and the richest necklace that ever a queen wore his heart thrilled with delight he fancied it his longlost sister europa now grown to womanhood coming to make him happy and to repay him with her sweet sisterly affection for all those weary wanderings in quest of her since he left king agenors palacefor the tears that he had shed on parting with phoenix and cilix and thasusfor the heartbreakings that had made the whole world seem dismal to him over his dear mothers grave  but as cadmus advanced to meet the beautiful stranger he saw that her features were unknown to him although in the little time that it required to tread along the hall he had already felt a sympathy twixt himself and her  no cadmus said the same voice that had spoken to him in the field of the armed men this is not that dear sister europa whom you have sought so faithfully all over the wide world this is harmonia a daughter of the sky who is given you instead of sister and brothers and friend and mother you will find all those dear ones in her alone  so king cadmus dwelt in the palace with his new friend harmonia and found a great deal of comfort in his magnificent abode but would doubtless have found as much if not more in the humblest cottage by the wayside before many years went by there was a group of rosy little children but how they came thither has always been a mystery to me sporting in the great hall and on the marble steps of the palace and running joyfully to meet king cadmus when affairs of state left him at leisure to play with them they called him father and queen harmonia mother the five old soldiers of the dragons teeth grew very fond of these small urchins and were never weary of showing them how to shoulder sticks flourish wooden swords and march in military order blowing a penny trumpet or beating an abominable rubadub upon a little drum  but king cadmus lest there should be too much of the dragons tooth in his childrens disposition used to find time from his kingly duties to teach them their a b cwhich he invented for their benefit and for which many little people i am afraid are not half so grateful to him as they ought to be     circes palace   some of you have heard no doubt of the wise king ulysses and how he went to the siege of troy and how after that famous city was taken and burned he spent ten long years in trying to get back again to his own little kingdom of ithaca at one time in the course of this weary voyage he arrived at an island that looked very green and pleasant but the name of which was unknown to him for only a little while before he came thither he had met with a terrible hurricane or rather a great many hurricanes at once which drove his fleet of vessels into a strange part of the sea where neither himself nor any of his mariners had ever sailed this misfortune was entirely owing to the foolish curiosity of his shipmates who while ulysses lay asleep had untied some very bulky leathern bags in which they supposed a valuable treasure to be concealed but in each of these stout bags king √Üolus the ruler of the winds had tied up a tempest and had given it to ulysses to keep in order that he might be sure of a favorable passage homeward to ithaca and when the strings were loosened forth rushed the whistling blasts like air out of a blown bladder whitening the sea with foam and scattering the vessels nobody could tell whither  immediately after escaping from this peril a still greater one had befallen him scudding before the hurricane he reached a place which as he afterwards found was called l√¶strygonia where some monstrous giants had eaten up many of his companions and had sunk every one of his vessels except that in which he himself sailed by flinging great masses of rock at them from the cliffs along the shore after going through such troubles as these you cannot wonder that king ulysses was glad to moor his tempestbeaten bark in a quiet cove of the green island which i began with telling you about but he had encountered so many dangers from giants and oneeyed cyclopes and monsters of the sea and land that he could not help dreading some mischief even in this pleasant and seemingly solitary spot for two days therefore the poor weatherworn voyagers kept quiet and either stayed on board of their vessel or merely crept along under cliffs that bordered the shore and to keep themselves alive they dug shellfish out of the sand and sought for any little rill of fresh water that might be running towards the sea  before the two days were spent they grew very weary of this kind of life for the followers of king ulysses as you will find it important to remember were terrible gormandizers and pretty sure to grumble if they missed their regular meals and their irregular ones besides their stock of provisions was quite exhausted and even the shellfish began to get scarce so that they had now to choose between starving to death or venturing into the interior of the island where perhaps some huge threeheaded dragon or other horrible monster had his den such misshapen creatures were very numerous in those days and nobody ever expected to make a voyage or take a journey without running more or less risk of being devoured by them  but king ulysses was a bold man as well as a prudent one and on the third morning he determined to discover what sort of a place the island was and whether it were possible to obtain a supply of food for the hungry mouths of his companions so taking a spear in his hand he clambered to the summit of a cliff and gazed round about him at a distance towards the centre of the island he beheld the stately towers of what seemed to be a palace built of snowwhite marble and rising in the midst of a grove of lofty trees the thick branches of these trees stretched across the front of the edifice and more than half concealed it although from the portion which he saw ulysses judged it to be spacious and exceedingly beautiful and probably the residence of some great nobleman or prince a blue smoke went curling up from the chimney and was almost the pleasantest part of the spectacle to ulysses for from the abundance of this smoke it was reasonable to conclude that there was a good fire in the kitchen and that at dinnertime a plentiful banquet would be served up to the inhabitants of the palace and to whatever guests might happen to drop in  illustration circes palace  with so agreeable a prospect before him ulysses fancied that he could not do better than to go straight to the palace gate and tell the master of it that there was a crew of poor shipwrecked mariners not far off who had eaten nothing for a day or two save a few clams and oysters and would therefore be thankful for a little food and the prince or nobleman must be a very stingy curmudgeon to be sure if at least when his own dinner was over he would not bid them welcome to the broken victuals from the table  pleasing himself with this idea king ulysses had made a few steps in the direction of the palace when there was a great twittering and chirping from the branch of a neighboring tree a moment afterwards a bird came flying towards him and hovered in the air so as almost to brush his face with its wings it was a very pretty little bird with purple wings and body and yellow legs and a circle of golden feathers round his neck and on its head a golden tuft which looked like a kings crown in miniature ulysses tried to catch the bird but it fluttered nimbly out of his reach still chirping in a piteous tone as if it could have told a lamentable story had it only been gifted with human language and when he attempted to drive it away the bird flew no farther than the bough of the next tree and again came fluttering about his head with its doleful chirp as soon as he showed a purpose of going forward  have you anything to tell me little bird asked ulysses  and he was ready to listen attentively to whatever the bird might communicate for at the siege of troy and elsewhere he had known such odd things to happen that he would not have considered it much out of the common run had this little feathered creature talked as plainly as himself  peep said the bird peep peep peweep and nothing else would it say but only peep peep peweep in a melancholy cadence over and over and over again as often as ulysses moved forward however the bird showed the greatest alarm and did its best to drive him back with the anxious flutter of its purple wings its unaccountable behavior made him conclude at last that the bird knew of some danger that awaited him and which must needs be very terrible beyond all question since it moved even a little fowl to feel compassion for a human being so he resolved for the present to return to the vessel and tell his companions what he had seen  this appeared to satisfy the bird as soon as ulysses turned back it ran up the trunk of a tree and began to pick insects out of the bark with its long sharp bill for it was a kind of woodpecker you must know and had to get its living in the same manner as other birds of that species but every little while as it pecked at the bark of the tree the purple bird bethought itself of some secret sorrow and repeated its plaintive note of peep peep peweep  on his way to the shore ulysses had the good luck to kill a large stag by thrusting his spear into its back taking it on his shoulders for he was a remarkably strong man he lugged it along with him and flung it down before his hungry companions i have already hinted to you what gormandizers some of the comrades of king ulysses were from what is related of them i reckon that their favorite diet was pork and that they had lived upon it until a good part of their physical substance was swines flesh and their tempers and dispositions were very much akin to the hog a dish of venison however was no unacceptable meal to them especially after feeding so long on oysters and clams so beholding the dead stag they felt of its ribs in a knowing way and lost no time in kindling a fire of driftwood to cook it the rest of the day was spent in feasting and if these enormous eaters got up from table at sunset it was only because they could not scrape another morsel off the poor animals bones  the next morning their appetites were as sharp as ever they looked at ulysses as if they expected him to clamber up the cliff again and come back with another fat deer upon his shoulders instead of setting out however he summoned the whole crew together and told them it was in vain to hope that he could kill a stag every day for their dinner and therefore it was advisable to think of some other mode of satisfying their hunger  now said he when i was on the cliff yesterday i discovered that this island is inhabited at a considerable distance from the shore stood a marble palace which appeared to be very spacious and had a great deal of smoke curling out of one of its chimneys  aha muttered some of his companions smacking their lips that smoke must have come from the kitchen fire there was a good dinner on the spit and no doubt there will be as good a one today  but continued the wise ulysses you must remember my good friends our misadventure in the cavern of oneeyed polyphemus the cyclops instead of his ordinary milk diet did he not eat up two of our comrades for his supper and a couple more for breakfast and two at his supper again methinks i see him yet the hideous monster scanning us with that great red eye in the middle of his forehead to single out the fattest and then again only a few days ago did we not fall into the hands of the king of the l√¶strygons and those other horrible giants his subjects who devoured a great many more of us than are now left to tell you the truth if we go to yonder palace there can be no question that we shall make our appearance at the dinnertable but whether seated as guests or served up as food is a point to be seriously considered  either way murmured some of the hungriest of the crew it will be better than starvation particularly if one could be sure of being well fattened beforehand and daintily cooked afterwards  that is a matter of taste said king ulysses and for my own part neither the most careful fattening nor the daintiest of cookery would reconcile me to being dished at last my proposal is therefore that we divide ourselves into two equal parties and ascertain by drawing lots which of the two shall go to the palace and beg for food and assistance if these can be obtained all is well if not and if the inhabitants prove as inhospitable as polyphemus or the l√¶strygons then there will but half of us perish and the remainder may set sail and escape  as nobody objected to this scheme ulysses proceeded to count the whole band and found that there were fortysix men including himself he then numbered off twentytwo of them and put eurylochus who was one of his chief officers and second only to himself in sagacity at their head ulysses took command of the remaining twentytwo men in person then taking off his helmet he put two shells into it on one of which was written go and on the other stay another person now held the helmet while ulysses and eurylochus drew out each a shell and the word go was found written on that which eurylochus had drawn in this manner it was decided that ulysses and his twentytwo men were to remain at the seaside until the other party should have found out what sort of treatment they might expect at the mysterious palace as there was no help for it eurylochus immediately set forth at the head of his twentytwo followers who went off in a very melancholy state of mind leaving their friends in hardly better spirits than themselves  no sooner had they clambered up the cliff than they discerned the tall marble towers of the palace ascending as white as snow out of the lovely green shadow of the trees which surrounded it a gush of smoke came from a chimney in the rear of the edifice this vapor rose high in the air and meeting with a breeze was wafted seaward and made to pass over the heads of the hungry mariners when peoples appetites are keen they have a very quick scent for anything savory in the wind  that smoke comes from the kitchen cried one of them turning up his nose as high as he could and snuffing eagerly and as sure as im a halfstarved vagabond i smell roast meat in it  pig roast pig said another ah the dainty little porker my mouth waters for him  let us make haste cried the others or we shall be too late for the good cheer  but scarcely had they made half a dozen steps from the edge of the cliff when a bird came fluttering to meet them it was the same pretty little bird with the purple wings and body the yellow legs the golden collar round its neck and the crownlike tuft upon its head whose behavior had so much surprised ulysses it hovered about eurylochus and almost brushed his face with its wings  peep peep peweep chirped the bird  so plaintively intelligent was the sound that it seemed as if the little creature were going to break its heart with some mighty secret that it had to tell and only this one poor note to tell it with  my pretty bird said eurylochusfor he was a wary person and let no token of harm escape his noticemy pretty bird who sent you hither and what is the message which you bring  peep peep peweep replied the bird very sorrowfully  then it flew towards the edge of the cliff and looked round at them as if exceedingly anxious that they should return whence they came eurylochus and a few of the others were inclined to turn back they could not help suspecting that the purple bird must be aware of something mischievous that would befall them at the palace and the knowledge of which affected its airy spirit with a human sympathy and sorrow but the rest of the voyagers snuffing up the smoke from the palace kitchen ridiculed the idea of returning to the vessel one of them more brutal than his fellows and the most notorious gormandizer in the whole crew said such a cruel and wicked thing that i wonder the mere thought did not turn him into a wild beast in shape as he already was in his nature  this troublesome and impertinent little fowl said he would make a delicate titbit to begin dinner with just one plump morsel melting away between the teeth if he comes within my reach ill catch him and give him to the palace cook to be roasted on a skewer  the words were hardly out of his mouth before the purple bird flew away crying peep peep peweep more dolorously than ever  that bird remarked eurylochus knows more than we do about what awaits us at the palace  come on then cried his comrades and well soon know as much as he does  the party accordingly went onward through the green and pleasant wood every little while they caught new glimpses of the marble palace which looked more and more beautiful the nearer they approached it they soon entered a broad pathway which seemed to be very neatly kept and which went winding along with streaks of sunshine falling across it and specks of light quivering among the deepest shadows that fell from the lofty trees it was bordered too with a great many sweetsmelling flowers such as the mariners had never seen before so rich and beautiful they were that if the shrubs grew wild here and were native in the soil then this island was surely the flowergarden of the whole earth or if transplanted from some other clime it must have been from the happy islands that lay towards the golden sunset  there has been a great deal of pains foolishly wasted on these flowers observed one of the company and i tell you what he said that you may keep in mind what gormandizers they were for my part if i were the owner of the palace i would bid my gardener cultivate nothing but savory potherbs to make a stuffing for roast meat or to flavor a stew with  well said cried the others but ill warrant you theres a kitchengarden in the rear of the palace  at one place they came to a crystal spring and paused to drink at it for want of liquor which they liked better looking into its bosom they beheld their own faces dimly reflected but so extravagantly distorted by the gush and motion of the water that each one of them appeared to be laughing at himself and all his companions so ridiculous were these images of themselves indeed that they did really laugh aloud and could hardly be grave again as soon as they wished and after they had drank they grew still merrier than before  it has a twang of the winecask in it said one smacking his lips  make haste cried his fellows well find the winecask itself at the palace and that will be better than a hundred crystal fountains  then they quickened their pace and capered for joy at the thought of the savory banquet at which they hoped to be guests but eurylochus told them that he felt as if he were walking in a dream  if i am really awake continued he then in my opinion we are on the point of meeting with some stranger adventure than any that befell us in the cave of polyphemus or among the gigantic maneating l√¶strygons or in the windy palace of king √Üolus which stands on a brazenwalled island this kind of dreamy feeling always comes over me before any wonderful occurrence if you take my advice you will turn back  no no answered his comrades snuffing the air in which the scent from the palace kitchen was now very perceptible we would not turn back though we were certain that the king of the l√¶strygons as big as a mountain would sit at the head of the table and huge polyphemus the oneeyed cyclops at its foot  at length they came within full sight of the palace which proved to be very large and lofty with a great number of airy pinnacles upon its roof though it was now midday and the sun shone brightly over the marble front yet its snowy whiteness and its fantastic style of architecture made it look unreal like the frostwork on a windowpane or like the shapes of castles which one sees among the clouds by moonlight but just then a puff of wind brought down the smoke of the kitchen chimney among them and caused each man to smell the odor of the dish that he liked best and after scenting it they thought everything else moonshine and nothing real save this palace and save the banquet that was evidently ready to be served up in it  so they hastened their steps towards the portal but had not got halfway across the wide lawn when a pack of lions tigers and wolves came bounding to meet them the terrified mariners started back expecting no better fate than to be torn to pieces and devoured to their surprise and joy however these wild beasts merely capered around them wagging their tails offering their heads to be stroked and patted and behaving just like so many wellbred housedogs when they wish to express their delight at meeting their master or their masters friends the biggest lion licked the feet of eurylochus and every other lion and every wolf and tiger singled out one of his twoandtwenty followers whom the beast fondled as if he loved him better than a beefbone  but for all that eurylochus imagined that he saw something fierce and savage in their eyes nor would he have been surprised at any moment to feel the big lions terrible claws or to see each of the tigers make a deadly spring or each wolf leap at the throat of the man whom he had fondled their mildness seemed unreal and a mere freak but their savage nature was as true as their teeth and claws  nevertheless the men went safely across the lawn with the wild beasts frisking about them and doing no manner of harm although as they mounted the steps of the palace you might possibly have heard a low growl particularly from the wolves as if they thought it a pity after all to let the strangers pass without so much as tasting what they were made of  eurylochus and his followers now passed under a lofty portal and looked through the open doorway into the interior of the palace the first thing that they saw was a spacious hall and a fountain in the middle of it gushing up towards the ceiling out of a marble basin and falling back into it with a continual plash the water of this fountain as it spouted upward was constantly taking new shapes not very distinctly but plainly enough for a nimble fancy to recognize what they were now it was the shape of a man in a long robe the fleecy whiteness of which was made out of the fountains spray now it was a lion or a tiger or a wolf or an ass or as often as anything else a hog wallowing in the marble basin as if it were his sty it was either magic or some very curious machinery that caused the gushing waterspout to assume all these forms but before the strangers had time to look closely at this wonderful sight their attention was drawn off by a very sweet and agreeable sound a womans voice was singing melodiously in another room of the palace and with her voice was mingled the noise of a loom at which she was probably seated weaving a rich texture of cloth and intertwining the high and low sweetness of her voice into a rich tissue of harmony  by and by the song came to an end and then all at once there were several feminine voices talking airily and cheerfully with now and then a merry burst of laughter such as you may always hear when three or four young women sit at work together  what a sweet song that was exclaimed one of the voyagers  too sweet indeed answered eurylochus shaking his head yet it was not so sweet as the song of the sirens those birdlike damsels who wanted to tempt us on the rocks so that our vessel might be wrecked and our bones left whitening along the shore  but just listen to the pleasant voices of those maidens and that buzz of the loom as the shuttle passes to and fro said another comrade what a domestic household homelike sound it is ah before that weary siege of troy i used to hear the buzzing loom and the womens voices under my own roof shall i never hear them again nor taste those nice little savory dishes which my dearest wife knew how to serve up  tush we shall fare better here said another but how innocently those women are babbling together without guessing that we overhear them and mark that richest voice of all so pleasant and familiar but which yet seems to have the authority of a mistress among them let us show ourselves at once what harm can the lady of the palace and her maidens do to mariners and warriors like us  remember said eurylochus that it was a young maiden who beguiled three of our friends into the palace of the king of the l√¶strygons who ate up one of them in the twinkling of an eye  no warning or persuasion however had any effect on his companions they went up to a pair of foldingdoors at the farther end of the hall and throwing them wide open passed into the next room eurylochus meanwhile had stepped behind a pillar in the short moment while the foldingdoors opened and closed again he caught a glimpse of a very beautiful woman rising from the loom and coming to meet the poor weatherbeaten wanderers with a hospitable smile and her hand stretched out in welcome there were four other young women who joined their hands and danced merrily forward making gestures of obeisance to the strangers they were only less beautiful than the lady who seemed to be their mistress yet eurylochus fancied that one of them had seagreen hair and that the closefitting bodice of a second looked like the bark of a tree and that both the others had something odd in their aspect although he could not quite determine what it was in the little while that he had to examine them  the foldingdoors swung quickly back and left him standing behind the pillar in the solitude of the outer hall there eurylochus waited until he was quite weary and listened eagerly to every sound but without hearing anything that could help him to guess what had become of his friends footsteps it is true seemed to be passing and repassing in other parts of the palace then there was a clatter of silver dishes or golden ones which made him imagine a rich feast in a splendid banquetinghall but by and by he heard a tremendous grunting and squealing and then a sudden scampering like that of small hard hoofs over a marble floor while the voices of the mistress and her four handmaidens were screaming all together in tones of anger and derision eurylochus could not conceive what had happened unless a drove of swine had broken into the palace attracted by the smell of the feast chancing to cast his eyes at the fountain he saw that it did not shift its shape as formerly nor looked either like a longrobed man or a lion a tiger a wolf or an ass it looked like nothing but a hog which lay wallowing in the marble basin and filled it from brim to brim  but we must leave the prudent eurylochus waiting in the outer hall and follow his friends into the inner secrecy of the palace as soon as the beautiful woman saw them she arose from the loom as i have told you and came forward smiling and stretching out her hand she took the hand of the foremost among them and bade him and the whole party welcome  you have been long expected my good friends said she i and my maidens are well acquainted with you although you do not appear to recognize us look at this piece of tapestry and judge if your faces must not have been familiar to us  so the voyagers examined the web of cloth which the beautiful woman had been weaving in her loom and to their vast astonishment they saw their own figures perfectly represented in different colored threads it was a lifelike picture of their recent adventures showing them in the cave of polyphemus and how they had put out his one great moony eye while in another part of the tapestry they were untying the leathern bags puffed out with contrary winds and farther on they beheld themselves scampering away from the gigantic king of the l√¶strygons who had caught one of them by the leg lastly there they were sitting on the desolate shore of this very island hungry and downcast and looking ruefully at the bare bones of the stag which they devoured yesterday this was as far as the work had yet proceeded but when the beautiful woman should again sit down at her loom she would probably make a picture of what had since happened to the strangers and of what was now going to happen  you see she said that i know all about your troubles and you cannot doubt that i desire to make you happy for as long a time as you may remain with me for this purpose my honored guests i have ordered a banquet to be prepared fish fowl and flesh roasted and in luscious stews and seasoned i trust to all your tastes are ready to be served up if your appetites tell you it is dinnertime then come with me to the festal saloon  at this kind invitation the hungry mariners were quite overjoyed and one of them taking upon himself to be spokesman assured their hospitable hostess that any hour of the day was dinnertime with them whenever they could get flesh to put in the pot and fire to boil it with so the beautiful woman led the way and the four maidens one of them had seagreen hair another a bodice of oak bark a third sprinkled a shower of waterdrops from her fingers ends and the fourth had some other oddity which i have forgotten all these followed behind and hurried the guests along until they entered a magnificent saloon it was built in a perfect oval and lighted from a crystal dome above around the walls were ranged twoandtwenty thrones overhung by canopies of crimson and gold and provided with the softest of cushions which were tasselled and fringed with gold cord each of the strangers was invited to sit down and there they were twoandtwenty stormbeaten mariners in worn and tattered garb sitting on twoandtwenty canopied thrones so rich and gorgeous that the proudest monarch had nothing more splendid in his stateliest hall  then you might have seen the guests nodding winking with one eye and leaning from one throne to another to communicate their satisfaction in hoarse whispers  our good hostess has made kings of us all said one ha do you smell the feast ill engage it will be fit to set before twoandtwenty kings  i hope said another it will be mainly good substantial joints sirloins spareribs and hinder quarters without too many kickshaws if i thought the good lady would not take it amiss i should call for a fat slice of fried bacon to begin with  ah the gluttons and gormandizers you see how it was with them in the loftiest seats of dignity on royal thrones they could think of nothing but their greedy appetite which was the portion of their nature that they shared with wolves and swine so that they resembled those vilest of animals far more than they did kingsif indeed kings were what they ought to be  but the beautiful woman now clapped her hands and immediately there entered a train of twoandtwenty servingmen bringing dishes of the richest food all hot from the kitchen fire and sending up such a steam that it hung like a cloud below the crystal dome of the saloon an equal number of attendants brought great flagons of wine of various kinds some of which sparkled as it was poured out and went bubbling down the throat while of other sorts the purple liquor was so clear that you could see the wrought figures at the bottom of the goblet while the servants supplied the twoandtwenty guests with food and drink the hostess and her four maidens went from one throne to another exhorting them to eat their fill and to quaff wine abundantly and thus to recompense themselves at this one banquet for the many days when they had gone without a dinner but whenever the mariners were not looking at them which was pretty often as they looked chiefly into the basins and platters the beautiful woman and her damsels turned aside and laughed even the servants as they knelt down to present the dishes might be seen to grin and sneer while the guests were helping themselves to the offered dainties  and once in a while the strangers seemed to taste something that they did not like  here is an odd kind of a spice in this dish said one i cant say it quite suits my palate down it goes however  send a good draught of wine down your throat said his comrade on the next throne that is the stuff to make this sort of cookery relish well though i must needs say the wine has a queer taste too but the more i drink of it the better i like the flavor  whatever little fault they might find with the dishes they sat at dinner a prodigiously long while and it would really have made you ashamed to see how they swilled down the liquor and gobbled up the food they sat on golden thrones to be sure but they behaved like pigs in a sty and if they had had their wits about them they might have guessed that this was the opinion of their beautiful hostess and her maidens it brings a blush into my face to reckon up in my own mind what mountains of meat and pudding and what gallons of wine these twoandtwenty guzzlers and gormandizers ate and drank they forgot all about their homes and their wives and children and all about ulysses and everything else except this banquet at which they wanted to keep feasting forever but at length they began to give over from mere incapacity to hold any more  that last bit of fat is too much for me said one  and i have not room for another morsel said his next neighbor heaving a sigh what a pity my appetite is as sharp as ever  in short they all left off eating and leaned back on their thrones with such a stupid and helpless aspect as made them ridiculous to behold when their hostess saw this she laughed aloud so did her four damsels so did the twoandtwenty serving men that bore the dishes and their twoandtwenty fellows that poured out the wine and the louder they all laughed the more stupid and helpless did the twoandtwenty gormandizers look then the beautiful woman took her stand in the middle of the saloon and stretching out a slender rod it had been all the while in her hand although they never noticed it till this moment she turned it from one guest to another until each had felt it pointed at himself beautiful as her face was and though there was a smile on it it looked just as wicked and mischievous as the ugliest serpent that ever was seen and fatwitted as the voyagers had made themselves they began to suspect that they had fallen into the power of an evilminded enchantress  wretches cried she you have abused a ladys hospitality and in this princely saloon your behavior has been suited to a hogpen you are already swine in everything but the human form which you disgrace and which i myself should be ashamed to keep a moment longer were you to share it with me but it will require only the slightest exercise of magic to make the exterior conform to the hoggish disposition assume your proper shapes gormandizers and begone to the sty  uttering these last words she waved her wand and stamping her foot imperiously each of the guests was struck aghast at beholding instead of his comrades in human shape oneandtwenty hogs sitting on the same number of golden thrones each man as he still supposed himself to be essayed to give a cry of surprise but found that he could merely grunt and that in a word he was just such another beast as his companions it looked so intolerably absurd to see hogs on cushioned thrones that they made haste to wallow down upon all fours like other swine they tried to groan and beg for mercy but forthwith emitted the most awful grunting and squealing that ever came out of swinish throats they would have wrung their hands in despair but attempting to do so grew all the more desperate for seeing themselves squatted on their hams and pawing the air with their fore trotters dear me what pendulous ears they had what little red eyes half buried in fat and what long snouts instead of grecian noses  but brutes as they certainly were they yet had enough of human nature in them to be shocked at their own hideousness and still intending to groan they uttered a viler grunt and squeal than before so harsh and earpiercing it was that you would have fancied a butcher was sticking his knife into each of their throats or at the very least that somebody was pulling every hog by his funny little twist of a tail  begone to your sty cried the enchantress giving them some smart strokes with her wand and then she turned to the servingmen drive out these swine and throw down some acorns for them to eat  the door of the saloon being flung open the drove of hogs ran in all directions save the right one in accordance with their hoggish perversity but were finally driven into the back yard of the palace it was a sight to bring tears into ones eyes and i hope none of you will be cruel enough to laugh at it to see the poor creatures go snuffing along picking up here a cabbage leaf and there a turniptop and rooting their noses in the earth for whatever they could find in their sty moreover they behaved more piggishly than the pigs that had been born so for they bit and snorted at one another put their feet in the trough and gobbled up their victuals in a ridiculous hurry and when there was nothing more to be had they made a great pile of themselves among some unclean straw and fell fast asleep if they had any human reason left it was just enough to keep them wondering when they should be slaughtered and what quality of bacon they should make  meantime as i told you before eurylochus had waited and waited and waited in the entrancehall of the palace without being able to comprehend what had befallen his friends at last when the swinish uproar resounded through the palace and when he saw the image of a hog in the marble basin he thought it best to hasten back to the vessel and inform the wise ulysses of these marvellous occurrences so he ran as fast as he could down the steps and never stopped to draw breath till he reached the shore  why do you come alone asked king ulysses as soon as he saw him where are your twoandtwenty comrades  at these questions eurylochus burst into tears  alas cried he i greatly fear that we shall never see one of their faces again  then he told ulysses all that had happened as far as he knew it and added that he suspected the beautiful woman to be a vile enchantress and the marble palace magnificent as it looked to be only a dismal cavern in reality as for his companions he could not imagine what had become of them unless they had been given to the swine to be devoured alive at this intelligence all the voyagers were greatly affrighted but ulysses lost no time in girding on his sword and hanging his bow and quiver over his shoulders and taking his spear in his right hand when his followers saw their wise leader making these preparations they inquired whither he was going and earnestly besought him not to leave them  you are our king cried they and what is more you are the wisest man in the whole world and nothing but your wisdom and courage can get us out of this danger if you desert us and go to the enchanted palace you will suffer the same fate as our poor companions and not a soul of us will ever see our dear ithaca again  as i am your king answered ulysses and wiser than any of you it is therefore the more my duty to see what has befallen our comrades and whether anything can yet be done to rescue them wait for me here until tomorrow if i do not then return you must hoist sail and endeavor to find your way to our native land for my part i am answerable for the fate of these poor mariners who have stood by my side in battle and been so often drenched to the skin along with me by the same tempestuous surges i will either bring them back with me or perish  had his followers dared they would have detained him by force but king ulysses frowned sternly on them and shook his spear and bade them stop him at their peril seeing him so determined they let him go and sat down on the sand as disconsolate a set of people as could be waiting and praying for his return  it happened to ulysses just as before that when he had gone a few steps from the edge of the cliff the purple bird came fluttering towards him crying peep peep peweep and using all the art it could to persuade him to go no farther  what mean you little bird cried ulysses you are arrayed like a king in purple and gold and wear a golden crown upon your head is it because i too am a king that you desire so earnestly to speak with me if you can talk in human language say what you would have me do  peep answered the purple bird very dolorously peep peep peweep  certainly there lay some heavy anguish at the little birds heart and it was a sorrowful predicament that he could not at least have the consolation of telling what it was but ulysses had no time to waste in trying to get at the mystery he therefore quickened his pace and had gone a good way along the pleasant woodpath when there met him a young man of very brisk and intelligent aspect and clad in a rather singular garb he wore a short cloak and a sort of cap that seemed to be furnished with a pair of wings and from the lightness of his step you would have supposed that there might likewise be wings on his feet to enable him to walk still better for he was always on one journey or another he carried a winged staff around which two serpents were wriggling and twisting in short i have said enough to make you guess that it was quicksilver and ulysses who knew him of old and had learned a great deal of his wisdom from him recognized him in a moment  whither are you going in such a hurry wise ulysses asked quicksilver do you not know that this island is enchanted the wicked enchantress whose name is circe the sister of king √Üetes dwells in the marble palace which you see yonder among the trees by her magic arts she changes every human being into the brute beast or fowl whom he happens most to resemble  that little bird which met me at the edge of the cliff exclaimed ulysses was he a human being once  yes answered quicksilver he was once a king named picus and a pretty good sort of a king too only rather too proud of his purple robe and his crown and the golden chain about his neck so he was forced to take the shape of a gaudyfeathered bird the lions and wolves and tigers who will come running to meet you in front of the palace were formerly fierce and cruel men resembling in their dispositions the wild beasts whose forms they now rightfully wear  and my poor companions said ulysses have they undergone a similar change through the arts of this wicked circe  you well know what gormandizers they were replied quicksilver and rogue that he was he could not help laughing at the joke so you will not be surprised to hear that they have all taken the shapes of swine if circe had never done anything worse i really should not think her so very much to blame  but can i do nothing to help them inquired ulysses  it will require all your wisdom said quicksilver and a little of my own into the bargain to keep your royal and sagacious self from being transformed into a fox but do as i bid you and the matter may end better than it has begun  while he was speaking quicksilver seemed to be in search of something he went stooping along the ground and soon laid his hand on a little plant with a snowwhite flower which he plucked and smelt of ulysses had been looking at that very spot only just before and it appeared to him that the plant had burst into full flower the instant when quicksilver touched it with his fingers  take this flower king ulysses said he guard it as you do your eyesight for i can assure you it is exceedingly rare and precious and you might seek the whole earth over without ever finding another like it keep it in your hand and smell of it frequently after you enter the palace and while you are talking with the enchantress especially when she offers you food or a draught of wine out of her goblet be careful to fill your nostrils with the flowers fragrance follow these directions and you may defy her magic arts to change you into a fox  quicksilver then gave him some further advice how to behave and bidding him be bold and prudent again assured him that powerful as circe was he would have a fair prospect of coming safely out of her enchanted palace after listening attentively ulysses thanked his good friend and resumed his way but he had taken only a few steps when recollecting some other questions which he wished to ask he turned round again and beheld nobody on the spot where quicksilver had stood for that winged cap of his and those winged shoes with the help of the winged staff had carried him quickly out of sight  when ulysses reached the lawn in front of the palace the lions and other savage animals came bounding to meet him and would have fawned upon him and licked his feet but the wise king struck at them with his long spear and sternly bade them begone out of his path for he knew that they had once been bloodthirsty men and would now tear him limb from limb instead of fawning upon him could they do the mischief that was in their hearts the wild beasts yelped and glared at him and stood at a distance while he ascended the palace steps  on entering the hall ulysses saw the magic fountain in the centre of it the upgushing water had now again taken the shape of a man in a long white fleecy robe who appeared to be making gestures of welcome the king likewise heard the noise of the shuttle in the loom and the sweet melody of the beautiful womans song and then the pleasant voices of herself and the four maidens talking together with peals of merry laughter intermixed but ulysses did not waste much time in listening to the laughter or the song he leaned his spear against one of the pillars of the hall and then after loosening his sword in the scabbard stepped boldly forward and threw the foldingdoors wide open the moment she beheld his stately figure standing in the doorway the beautiful woman rose from the loom and ran to meet him with a glad smile throwing its sunshine over her face and both her hands extended  welcome brave stranger cried she we were expecting you  and the nymph with the seagreen hair made a courtesy down to the ground and likewise bade him welcome so did her sister with the bodice of oaken bark and she that sprinkled dewdrops from her fingers ends and the fourth one with some oddity which i cannot remember and circe as the beautiful enchantress was called who had deluded so many persons that she did not doubt of being able to delude ulysses not imagining how wise he was again addressed him  your companions said she have already been received into my palace and have enjoyed the hospitable treatment to which the propriety of their behavior so well entitles them if such be your pleasure you shall first take some refreshment and then join them in the elegant apartment which they now occupy see i and my maidens have been weaving their figures into this piece of tapestry  she pointed to the web of beautifully woven cloth in the loom circe and the four nymphs must have been very diligently at work since the arrival of the mariners for a great many yards of tapestry had now been wrought in addition to what i before described in this new part ulysses saw his twoandtwenty friends represented as sitting on cushioned and canopied thrones greedily devouring dainties and quaffing deep draughts of wine the work had not yet gone any further oh no indeed the enchantress was far too cunning to let ulysses see the mischief which her magic arts had since brought upon the gormandizers  as for yourself valiant sir said circe judging by the dignity of your aspect i take you to be nothing less than a king deign to follow me and you shall be treated as befits your rank  so ulysses followed her into the oval saloon where his twoandtwenty comrades had devoured the banquet which ended so disastrously for themselves but all this while he had held the snowwhite flower in his hand and had constantly smelt of it while circe was speaking and as he crossed the threshold of the saloon he took good care to inhale several long and deep snuffs of its fragrance instead of twoandtwenty thrones which had before been ranged around the wall there was now only a single throne in the centre of the apartment but this was surely the most magnificent seat that ever a king or an emperor reposed himself upon all made of chased gold studded with precious stones with a cushion that looked like a soft heap of living roses and overhung by a canopy of sunlight which circe knew how to weave into drapery the enchantress took ulysses by the hand and made him sit down upon this dazzling throne then clapping her hands she summoned the chief butler  bring hither said she the goblet that is set apart for kings to drink out of and fill it with the same delicious wine which my royal brother king √Üetes praised so highly when he last visited me with my fair daughter medea that good and amiable child were she now here it would delight her to see me offering this wine to my honored guest  but ulysses while the butler was gone for the wine held the snowwhite flower to his nose  is it a wholesome wine he asked  at this the four maidens tittered whereupon the enchantress looked round at them with an aspect of severity  it is the wholesomest juice that ever was squeezed out of the grape said she for instead of disguising a man as other liquor is apt to do it brings him to his true self and shows him as he ought to be  the chief butler liked nothing better than to see people turned into swine or making any kind of a beast of themselves so he made haste to bring the royal goblet filled with a liquid as bright as gold and which kept sparkling upward and throwing a sunny spray over the brim but delightfully as the wine looked it was mingled with the most potent enchantments that circe knew how to concoct for every drop of the pure grapejuice there were two drops of the pure mischief and the danger of the thing was that the mischief made it taste all the better the mere smell of the bubbles which effervesced at the brim was enough to turn a mans beard into pigs bristles or make a lions claws grow out of his fingers or a foxs brush behind him  drink my noble guest said circe smiling as she presented him with the goblet you will find in this draught a solace for all your troubles  king ulysses took the goblet with his right hand while with his left he held the snowwhite flower to his nostrils and drew in so long a breath that his lungs were quite filled with its pure and simple fragrance then drinking off all the wine he looked the enchantress calmly in the face  wretch cried circe giving him a smart stroke with her wand how dare you keep your human shape a moment longer take the form of the brute whom you most resemble if a hog go join your fellowswine in the sty if a lion a wolf a tiger go howl with the wild beasts on the lawn if a fox go exercise your craft in stealing poultry thou hast quaffed off my wine and canst be man no longer  but such was the virtue of the snowwhite flower instead of wallowing down from his throne in swinish shape or taking any other brutal form ulysses looked even more manly and kinglike than before he gave the magic goblet a toss and sent it clashing over the marble floor to the farthest end of the saloon then drawing his sword he seized the enchantress by her beautiful ringlets and made a gesture as if he meant to strike off her head at one blow  wicked circe cried he in a terrible voice this sword shall put an end to thy enchantments thou shalt die vile wretch and do no more mischief in the world by tempting human beings into the vices which make beasts of them  the tone and countenance of ulysses were so awful and his sword gleamed so brightly and seemed to have so intolerably keen an edge that circe was almost killed by the mere fright without waiting for a blow the chief butler scrambled out of the saloon picking up the golden goblet as he went and the enchantress and the four maidens fell on their knees wringing their hands and screaming for mercy  spare me cried circespare me royal and wise ulysses for now i know that thou art he of whom quicksilver forewarned me the most prudent of mortals against whom no enchantments can prevail thou only couldst have conquered circe spare me wisest of men i will show thee true hospitality and even give myself to be thy slave and this magnificent palace to be henceforth thy home  the four nymphs meanwhile were making a most piteous ado and especially the oceannymph with the seagreen hair wept a great deal of salt water and the fountainnymph besides scattering dewdrops from her fingers ends nearly melted away into tears but ulysses would not be pacified until circe had taken a solemn oath to change back his companions and as many others as he should direct from their present forms of beast or bird into their former shapes of men  on these conditions said he i consent to spare your life otherwise you must die upon the spot  with a drawn sword hanging over her the enchantress would readily have consented to do as much good as she had hitherto done mischief however little she might like such employment she therefore led ulysses out of the back entrance of the palace and showed him the swine in their sty there were about fifty of these unclean beasts in the whole herd and though the greater part were hogs by birth and education there was wonderfully little difference to be seen betwixt them and their new brethren who had so recently worn the human shape to speak critically indeed the latter rather carried the thing to excess and seemed to make it a point to wallow in the miriest part of the sty and otherwise to outdo the original swine in their own natural vocation when men once turn to brutes the trifle of mans wit that remains in them adds tenfold to their brutality  the comrades of ulysses however had not quite lost the remembrance of having formerly stood erect when he approached the sty twoandtwenty enormous swine separated themselves from the herd and scampered towards him with such a chorus of horrible squealing as made him clap both hands to his ears and yet they did not seem to know what they wanted nor whether they were merely hungry or miserable from some other cause it was curious in the midst of their distress to observe them thrusting their noses into the mire in quest of something to eat the nymph with the bodice of oaken bark she was the hamadryad of an oak threw a handful of acorns among them and the twoandtwenty hogs scrambled and fought for the prize as if they had tasted not so much as a noggin of sour milk for a twelvemonth  these must certainly be my comrades said ulysses i recognize their dispositions they are hardly worth the trouble of changing them into the human form again nevertheless we will have it done lest their bad example should corrupt the other hogs let them take their original shapes therefore dame circe if your skill is equal to the task it will require greater magic i trow than it did to make swine of them  so circe waved her wand again and repeated a few magic words at the sound of which the twoandtwenty hogs pricked up their pendulous ears it was a wonder to behold how their snouts grew shorter and shorter and their mouths which they seemed to be sorry for because they could not gobble so expeditiously smaller and smaller and how one and another began to stand upon his hind legs and scratch his nose with his fore trotters at first the spectators hardly knew whether to call them hogs or men but by and by came to the conclusion that they rather resembled the latter finally there stood the twentytwo comrades of ulysses looking pretty much the same as when they left the vessel  you must not imagine however that the swinish quality had entirely gone out of them when once it fastens itself into a persons character it is very difficult getting rid of it this was proved by the hamadryad who being exceedingly fond of mischief threw another handful of acorns before the twentytwo newly restored people whereupon down they wallowed in a moment and gobbled them up in a very shameful way then recollecting themselves they scrambled to their feet and looked more than commonly foolish  thanks noble ulysses they cried from brute beasts you have restored us to the condition of men again  do not put yourselves to the trouble of thanking me said the wise king i fear i have done but little for you  to say the truth there was a suspicious kind of a grunt in their voices and for a long time afterwards they spoke gruffly and were apt to set up a squeal  it must depend on your own future behavior added ulysses whether you do not find your way back to the sty  at this moment the note of a bird sounded from the branch of a neighboring tree  peep peep peweeep  it was the purple bird who all this while had been sitting over their heads watching what was going forward and hoping that ulysses would remember how he had done his utmost to keep him and his followers out of harms way ulysses ordered circe instantly to make a king of this good little fowl and leave him exactly as she found him hardly were the words spoken and before the bird had time to utter another peweep king picus leaped down from the bough of the tree as majestic a sovereign as any in the world dressed in a long purple robe and gorgeous yellow stockings with a splendidly wrought collar about his neck and a golden crown upon his head he and king ulysses exchanged with one another the courtesies which belong to their elevated rank but from that time forth king picus was no longer proud of his crown and his trappings of royalty nor of the fact of his being a king he felt himself merely the upper servant of his people and that it must be his lifelong labor to make them better and happier  as for the lions tigers and wolves though circe would have restored them to their former shapes at his slightest word ulysses thought it advisable that they should remain as they now were and thus give warning of their cruel dispositions instead of going about under the guise of men and pretending to human sympathies while their hearts had the bloodthirstiness of wild beasts so he let them howl as much as they liked but never troubled his head about them and when everything was settled according to his pleasure he sent to summon the remainder of his comrades whom he had left at the seashore these being arrived with the prudent eurylochus at their head they all made themselves comfortable in circes enchanted palace until quite rested and refreshed from the toils and hardships of their voyage     the pomegranate seeds   mother ceres was exceedingly fond of her daughter proserpina and seldom let her go alone into the fields but just at the time when my story begins the good lady was very busy because she had the care of the wheat and the indian corn and the rye and barley and in short of the crops of every kind all over the earth and as the season had thus far been uncommonly backward it was necessary to make the harvest ripen more speedily than usual so she put on her turban made of poppies a kind of flower which she was always noted for wearing and got into her car drawn by a pair of winged dragons and was just ready to set off  dear mother said proserpina i shall be very lonely while you are away may i not run down to the shore and ask some of the seanymphs to come up out of the waves and play with me  yes child answered mother ceres the seanymphs are good creatures and will never lead you into any harm but you must take care not to stray away from them nor go wandering about the fields by yourself young girls without their mothers to take care of them are very apt to get into mischief  the child promised to be as prudent as if she were a grownup woman and by the time the winged dragons had whirled the car out of sight she was already on the shore calling to the seanymphs to come and play with her they knew proserpinas voice and were not long in showing their glistening faces and seagreen hair above the water at the bottom of which was their home they brought along with them a great many beautiful shells and sitting down on the moist sand where the surf wave broke over them they busied themselves in making a necklace which they hung round proserpinas neck by way of showing her gratitude the child besought them to go with her a little way into the fields so that they might gather abundance of flowers with which she would make each of her kind playmates a wreath  illustration proserpina  from the original in the collection of mrs william b dinsmore staatsburg new york  oh no dear proserpina cried the seanymphs we dare not go with you upon the dry land we are apt to grow faint unless at every breath we can snuff up the salt breeze of the ocean and dont you see how careful we are to let the surf wave break over us every moment or two so as to keep ourselves comfortably moist if it were not for that we should soon look like bunches of uprooted seaweed dried in the sun  it is a great pity said proserpina but do you wait for me here and i will run and gather my apron full of flowers and be back again before the surf wave has broken ten times over you i long to make you some wreaths that shall be as lovely as this necklace of manycolored shells  we will wait then answered the seanymphs but while you are gone we may as well lie down on a bank of soft sponge under the water the air today is a little too dry for our comfort but we will pop up our heads every few minutes to see if you are coming  the young proserpina ran quickly to a spot where only the day before she had seen a great many flowers these however were now a little past their bloom and wishing to give her friends the freshest and loveliest blossoms she strayed farther into the fields and found some that made her scream with delight never had she met with such exquisite flowers beforeviolets so large and fragrantroses with so rich and delicate a blushsuch superb hyacinths and such aromatic pinksand many others some of which seemed to be of new shapes and colors two or three times moreover she could not help thinking that a tuft of most splendid flowers had suddenly sprouted out of the earth before her very eyes as if on purpose to tempt her a few steps farther proserpinas apron was soon filled and brimming over with delightful blossoms she was on the point of turning back in order to rejoin the seanymphs and sit with them on the moist sands all twining wreaths together but a little farther on what should she behold it was a large shrub completely covered with the most magnificent flowers in the world  the darlings cried proserpina and then she thought to herself i was looking at that spot only a moment ago how strange it is that i did not see the flowers  the nearer she approached the shrub the more attractive it looked until she came quite close to it and then although its beauty was richer than words can tell she hardly knew whether to like it or not it bore above a hundred flowers of the most brilliant hues and each different from the others but all having a kind of resemblance among themselves which showed them to be sister blossoms but there was a deep glossy lustre on the leaves of the shrub and on the petals of the flowers that made proserpina doubt whether they might not be poisonous to tell you the truth foolish as it may seem she was half inclined to turn round and run away  what a silly child i am thought she taking courage it is really the most beautiful shrub that ever sprang out of the earth i will pull it up by the roots and carry it home and plant it in my mothers garden  holding up her apron full of flowers with her left hand proserpina seized the large shrub with the other and pulled and pulled but was hardly able to loosen the soil about its roots what a deeprooted plant it was again the girl pulled with all her might and observed that the earth began to stir and crack to some distance around the stem she gave another pull but relaxed her hold fancying that there was a rumbling sound right beneath her feet did the roots extend down into some enchanted cavern then laughing at herself for so childish a notion she made another effort up came the shrub and proserpina staggered back holding the stem triumphantly in her hand and gazing at the deep hole which its roots had left in the soil  much to her astonishment this hole kept spreading wider and wider and growing deeper and deeper until it really seemed to have no bottom and all the while there came a rumbling noise out of its depths louder and louder and nearer and nearer and sounding like the tramp of horses hoofs and the rattling of wheels too much frightened to run away she stood straining her eyes into this wonderful cavity and soon saw a team of four sable horses snorting smoke out of their nostrils and tearing their way out of the earth with a splendid golden chariot whirling at their heels they leaped out of the bottomless hole chariot and all and there they were tossing their black manes flourishing their black tails and curvetting with every one of their hoofs off the ground at once close by the spot where proserpina stood in the chariot sat the figure of a man richly dressed with a crown on his head all flaming with diamonds he was of a noble aspect and rather handsome but looked sullen and discontented and he kept rubbing his eyes and shading them with his hand as if he did not live enough in the sunshine to be very fond of its light  as soon as this personage saw the affrighted proserpina he beckoned her to come a little nearer  do not be afraid said he with as cheerful a smile as he knew how to put on come will not you like to ride a little way with me in my beautiful chariot  but proserpina was so alarmed that she wished for nothing but to get out of his reach and no wonder the stranger did not look remarkably goodnatured in spite of his smile and as for his voice its tones were deep and stern and sounded as much like the rumbling of an earthquake under ground as anything else as is always the case with children in trouble proserpinas first thought was to call for her mother  mother mother ceres cried she all in a tremble come quickly and save me  but her voice was too faint for her mother to hear indeed it is most probable that ceres was then a thousand miles off making the corn grow in some fardistant country nor could it have availed her poor daughter even had she been within hearing for no sooner did proserpina begin to cry out than the stranger leaped to the ground caught the child in his arms and again mounting the chariot shook the reins and shouted to the four black horses to set off they immediately broke into so swift a gallop that it seemed rather like flying through the air than running along the earth in a moment proserpina lost sight of the pleasant vale of enna in which she had always dwelt another instant and even the summit of mount √Ütna had become so blue in the distance that she could scarcely distinguish it from the smoke that gushed out of its crater but still the poor child screamed and scattered her apron full of flowers along the way and left a long cry trailing behind the chariot and many mothers to whose ears it came ran quickly to see if any mischief had befallen their children but mother ceres was a great way off and could not hear the cry  as they rode on the stranger did his best to soothe her  why should you be so frightened my pretty child said he trying to soften his rough voice i promise not to do you any harm what you have been gathering flowers wait till we come to my palace and i will give you a garden full of prettier flowers than those all made of pearls and diamonds and rubies can you guess who i am they call my name pluto and i am the king of diamonds and all other precious stones every atom of the gold and silver that lies under the earth belongs to me to say nothing of the copper and iron and of the coalmines which supply me with abundance of fuel do you see this splendid crown upon my head you may have it for a plaything oh we shall be very good friends and you will find me more agreeable than you expect when once we get out of this troublesome sunshine  let me go home cried proserpinalet me go home  my home is better than your mothers answered king pluto it is a palace all made of gold with crystal windows and because there is little or no sunshine thereabouts the apartments are illuminated with diamond lamps you never saw anything half so magnificent as my throne if you like you may sit down on it and be my little queen and i will sit on the footstool  i dont care for golden palaces and thrones sobbed proserpina oh my mother my mother carry me back to my mother  but king pluto as he called himself only shouted to his steeds to go faster  pray do not be foolish proserpina said he in rather a sullen tone i offer you my palace and my crown and all the riches that are under the earth and you treat me as if i were doing you an injury the one thing which my palace needs is a merry little maid to run up stairs and down and cheer up the rooms with her smile and this is what you must do for king pluto  never answered proserpina looking as miserable as she could i shall never smile again till you set me down at my mothers door  but she might just as well have talked to the wind that whistled past them for pluto urged on his horses and went faster than ever proserpina continued to cry out and screamed so long and so loudly that her poor little voice was almost screamed away and when it was nothing but a whisper she happened to cast her eyes over a great broad field of waving grainand whom do you think she saw who but mother ceres making the corn grow and too busy to notice the golden chariot as it went rattling along the child mustered all her strength and gave one more scream but was out of sight before ceres had time to turn her head  king pluto had taken a road which now began to grow excessively gloomy it was bordered on each side with rocks and precipices between which the rumbling of the chariotwheels was reverberated with a noise like rolling thunder the trees and bushes that grew in the crevices of the rocks had very dismal foliage and by and by although it was hardly noon the air became obscured with a gray twilight the black horses had rushed along so swiftly that they were already beyond the limits of the sunshine but the duskier it grew the more did plutos visage assume an air of satisfaction after all he was not an illlooking person especially when he left off twisting his features into a smile that did not belong to them proserpina peeped at his face through the gathering dusk and hoped that he might not be so very wicked as she at first thought him  ah this twilight is truly refreshing said king pluto after being so tormented with that ugly and impertinent glare of the sun how much more agreeable is lamplight or torchlight more particularly when reflected from diamonds it will be a magnificent sight when we get to my palace  is it much farther asked proserpina and will you carry me back when i have seen it  we will talk of that by and by answered pluto we are just entering my dominions do you see that tall gateway before us when we pass those gates we are at home and there lies my faithful mastiff at the threshold cerberus cerberus come hither my good dog  so saying pluto pulled at the reins and stopped the charriot right between the tall massive pillars of the gateway the mastiff of which he had spoken got up from the threshold and stood on his hinder legs so as to put his fore paws on the chariotwheel but my stars what a strange dog it was why he was a big rough uglylooking monster with three separate heads and each of them fiercer than the two others but fierce as they were king pluto patted them all he seemed as fond of his threeheaded dog as if it had been a sweet little spaniel with silken ears and curly hair cerberus on the other hand was evidently rejoiced to see his master and expressed his attachment as other dogs do by wagging his tail at a great rate proserpinas eyes being drawn to it by its brisk motion she saw that this tail was neither more nor less than a live dragon with fiery eyes and fangs that had a very poisonous aspect and while the threeheaded cerberus was fawning so lovingly on king pluto there was the dragon tail wagging against its will and looking as cross and illnatured as you can imagine on its own separate account  will the dog bite me asked proserpina shrinking closer to pluto what an ugly creature he is  oh never fear answered her companion he never harms people unless they try to enter my dominions without being sent for or to get away when i wish to keep them here down cerberus now my pretty proserpina we will drive on  on went the chariot and king pluto seemed greatly pleased to find himself once more in his own kingdom he drew proserpinas attention to the rich veins of gold that were to be seen among the rocks and pointed to several places where one stroke of a pickaxe would loosen a bushel of diamonds all along the road indeed there were sparkling gems which would have been of inestimable value above ground but which were here reckoned of the meaner sort and hardly worth a beggars stooping for  not far from the gateway they came to a bridge which seemed to be built of iron pluto stopped the chariot and bade proserpina look at the stream which was gliding so lazily beneath it never in her life had she beheld so torpid so black so muddylooking a stream its waters reflected no images of anything that was on the banks and it moved as sluggishly as if it had quite forgotten which way it ought to flow and had rather stagnate than flow either one way or the other  this is the river lethe observed king pluto is it not a very pleasant stream  i think it is a very dismal one said proserpina  it suits my taste however answered pluto who was apt to be sullen when anybody disagreed with him at all events its water has one very excellent quality for a single draught of it makes people forget every care and sorrow that has hitherto tormented them only sip a little of it my dear proserpina and you will instantly cease to grieve for your mother and will have nothing in your memory that can prevent your being perfectly happy in my palace i will send for some in a golden goblet the moment we arrive  oh no no no cried proserpina weeping afresh i had a thousand times rather be miserable with remembering my mother than be happy in forgetting her that dear dear mother i never never will forget her  we shall see said king pluto you do not know what fine times we will have in my palace here we are just at the portal these pillars are solid gold i assure you  he alighted from the chariot and taking proserpina in his arms carried her up a lofty flight of steps into the great hall of the palace it was splendidly illuminated by means of large precious stones of various hues which seemed to burn like so many lamps and glowed with a hundredfold radiance all through the vast apartment and yet there was a kind of gloom in the midst of this enchanted light nor was there a single object in the hall that was really agreeable to behold except the little proserpina herself a lovely child with one earthly flower which she had not let fall from her hand it is my opinion that even king pluto had never been happy in his palace and that this was the true reason why he had stolen away proserpina in order that he might have something to love instead of cheating his heart any longer with this tiresome magnificence and though he pretended to dislike the sunshine of the upper world yet the effect of the childs presence bedimmed as she was by her tears was as if a faint and watery sunbeam had somehow or other found its way into the enchanted hall  pluto now summoned his domestics and bade them lose no time in preparing a most sumptuous banquet and above all things not to fail of setting a golden beaker of the water of lethe by proserpinas plate  i will neither drink that nor anything else said proserpina nor will i taste a morsel of food even if you keep me forever in your palace  i should be sorry for that replied king pluto patting her cheek for he really wished to be kind if he had only known how you are a spoiled child i perceive my little proserpina but when you see the nice things which my cook will make for you your appetite will quickly come again  then sending for the head cook he gave strict orders that all sorts of delicacies such as young people are usually fond of should be set before proserpina he had a secret motive in this for you are to understand it is a fixed law that when persons are carried off to the land of magic if they once taste any food there they can never get back to their friends now if king pluto had been cunning enough to offer proserpina some fruit or bread and milk which was the simple fare to which the child had always been accustomed it is very probable that she would soon have been tempted to eat it but he left the matter entirely to his cook who like all other cooks considered nothing fit to eat unless it were rich pastry or highly seasoned meat or spiced sweet cakesthings which proserpinas mother had never given her and the smell of which quite took away her appetite instead of sharpening it  but my story must now clamber out of king plutos dominions and see what mother ceres has been about since she was bereft of her daughter we had a glimpse of her as you remember half hidden among the waving grain while the four black steeds were swiftly whirling along the chariot in which her beloved proserpina was so unwillingly borne away you recollect too the loud scream which proserpina gave just when the chariot was out of sight  of all the childs outcries this last shriek was the only one that reached the ears of mother ceres she had mistaken the rumbling of the chariotwheels for a peal of thunder and imagined that a shower was coming up and that it would assist her in making the corn grow but at the sound of proserpinas shriek she started and looked about in every direction not knowing whence it came but feeling almost certain that it was her daughters voice it seemed so unaccountable however that the girl should have strayed over so many lands and seas which she herself could not have traversed without the aid of her winged dragons that the good ceres tried to believe that it must be the child of some other parent and not her own darling proserpina who had uttered this lamentable cry nevertheless it troubled her with a vast many tender fears such as are ready to bestir themselves in every mothers heart when she finds it necessary to go away from her dear children without leaving them under the care of some maiden aunt or other such faithful guardian so she quickly left the field in which she had been so busy and as her work was not half done the grain looked next day as if it needed both sun and rain and as if it were blighted in the ear and had something the matter with its roots  the pair of dragons must have had very nimble wings for in less than an hour mother ceres had alighted at the door of her home and found it empty knowing however that the child was fond of sporting on the seashore she hastened thither as fast as she could and there beheld the wet faces of the poor seanymphs peeping over a wave all this while the good creatures had been waiting on the bank of sponge and once every halfminute or so had popped up their four heads above water to see if their playmate were yet coming back when they saw mother ceres they sat down on the crest of the surf wave and let it toss them ashore at her feet  where is proserpina cried ceres where is my child tell me you naughty seanymphs have you enticed her under the sea  oh no good mother ceres said the innocent seanymphs tossing back their green ringlets and looking her in the face we never should dream of such a thing proserpina has been at play with us it is true but she left us a long while ago meaning only to run a little way upon the dry land and gather some flowers for a wreath this was early in the day and we have seen nothing of her since  ceres scarcely waited to hear what the nymphs had to say before she hurried off to make inquiries all through the neighborhood but nobody told her anything that could enable the poor mother to guess what had become of proserpina a fisherman it is true had noticed her little footprints in the sand as he went homeward along the beach with a basket of fish a rustic had seen the child stooping to gather flowers several persons had heard either the rattling of chariotwheels or the rumbling of distant thunder and one old woman while plucking vervain and catnip had heard a scream but supposed it to be some childish nonsense and therefore did not take the trouble to look up the stupid people it took them such a tedious while to tell the nothing that they knew that it was dark night before mother ceres found out that she must seek her daughter elsewhere so she lighted a torch and set forth resolving never to come back until proserpina was discovered  in her haste and trouble of mind she quite forgot her car and the winged dragons or it may be she thought that she could follow up the search more thoroughly on foot at all events this was the way in which she began her sorrowful journey holding her torch before her and looking carefully at every object along the path and as it happened she had not gone far before she found one of the magnificent flowers which grew on the shrub that proserpina had pulled up  ha thought mother ceres examining it by torchlight here is mischief in this flower the earth did not produce it by any help of mine nor of its own accord it is the work of enchantment and is therefore poisonous and perhaps it has poisoned my poor child  but she put the poisonous flower in her bosom not knowing whether she might ever find any other memorial of proserpina  all night long at the door of every cottage and farmhouse ceres knocked and called up the weary laborers to inquire if they had seen her child and they stood gaping and half asleep at the threshold and answered her pityingly and besought her to come in and rest at the portal of every palace too she made so loud a summons that the menials hurried to throw open the gate thinking that it must be some great king or queen who would demand a banquet for supper and a stately chamber to repose in and when they saw only a sad and anxious woman with a torch in her hand and a wreath of withered poppies on her head they spoke rudely and sometimes threatened to set the dogs upon her but nobody had seen proserpina nor could give mother ceres the least hint which way to seek her thus passed the night and still she continued her search without sitting down to rest or stopping to take food or even remembering to put out the torch although first the rosy dawn and then the glad light of the morning sun made its red flame look thin and pale but i wonder what sort of stuff this torch was made of for it burned dimly through the day and at night was as bright as ever and never was extinguished by the rain or wind in all the weary days and nights while ceres was seeking for proserpina  it was not merely of human beings that she asked tidings of her daughter in the woods and by the streams she met creatures of another nature who used in those old times to haunt the pleasant and solitary places and were very sociable with persons who understood their language and customs as mother ceres did sometimes for instance she tapped with her finger against the knotted trunk of a majestic oak and immediately its rude bark would cleave asunder and forth would step a beautiful maiden who was the hamadryad of the oak dwelling inside of it and sharing its long life and rejoicing when its green leaves sported with the breeze but not one of these leafy damsels had seen proserpina then going a little farther ceres would perhaps come to a fountain gushing out of a pebbly hollow in the earth and would dabble with her hand in the water behold up through its sandy and pebbly bed along with the fountains gush a young woman with dripping hair would arise and stand gazing at mother ceres half out of the water and undulating up and down with its everrestless motion but when the mother asked whether her poor lost child had stopped to drink out of the fountain the naiad with weeping eyes for these waternymphs had tears to spare for everybodys grief would answer no in a murmuring voice which was just like the murmur of the stream  often likewise she encountered fauns who looked like sunburnt country people except that they had hairy ears and little horns upon their foreheads and the hinder legs of goats on which they gambolled merrily about the woods and fields they were a frolicsome kind of creature but grew as sad as their cheerful dispositions would allow when ceres inquired for her daughter and they had no good news to tell but sometimes she came suddenly upon a rude gang of satyrs who had faces like monkeys and horses tails behind them and who were generally dancing in a very boisterous manner with shouts of noisy laughter when she stopped to question them they would only laugh the louder and make new merriment out of the lone womans distress how unkind of those ugly satyrs and once while crossing a solitary sheeppasture she saw a personage named pan seated at the foot of a tall rock and making music on a shepherds flute he too had horns and hairy ears and goats feet but being acquainted with mother ceres he answered her question as civilly as he knew how and invited her to taste some milk and honey out of a wooden bowl but neither could pan tell her what had become of proserpina any better than the rest of these wild people  and thus mother ceres went wandering about for nine long days and nights finding no trace of proserpina unless it were now and then a withered flower and these she picked up and put in her bosom because she fancied that they might have fallen from her poor childs hand all day she travelled onward through the hot sun and at night again the flame of the torch would redden and gleam along the pathway and she continued her search by its light without ever sitting down to rest  on the tenth day she chanced to espy the mouth of a cavern within which though it was bright noon everywhere else there would have been only a dusky twilight but it so happened that a torch was burning there it flickered and struggled with the duskiness but could not half light up the gloomy cavern with all its melancholy glimmer ceres was resolved to leave no spot without a search so she peeped into the entrance of the cave and lighted it up a little more by holding her own torch before her in so doing she caught a glimpse of what seemed to be a woman sitting on the brown leaves of the last autumn a great heap of which had been swept into the cave by the wind this woman if woman it were was by no means so beautiful as many of her sex for her head they tell me was shaped very much like a dogs and by way of ornament she wore a wreath of snakes around it but mother ceres the moment she saw her knew that this was an odd kind of a person who put all her enjoyment in being miserable and never would have a word to say to other people unless they were as melancholy and wretched as she herself delighted to be  i am wretched enough now thought poor ceres to talk with this melancholy hecate were she ten times sadder than ever she was yet  so she stepped into the cave and sat down on the withered leaves by the dogheaded womans side in all the world since her daughters loss she had found no other companion  o hecate said she if ever you lose a daughter you will know what sorrow is tell me for pitys sake have you seen my poor child proserpina pass by the mouth of your cavern  no answered hecate in a cracked voice and sighing betwixt every word or twono mother ceres i have seen nothing of your daughter but my ears you must know are made in such a way that all cries of distress and affright all over the world are pretty sure to find their way to them and nine days ago as i sat in my cave making myself very miserable i heard the voice of a young girl shrieking as if in great distress something terrible has happened to the child you may rest assured as well as i could judge a dragon or some other cruel monster was carrying her away  you kill me by saying so cried ceres almost ready to faint where was the sound and which way did it seem to go  it passed very swiftly along said hecate and at the same time there was a heavy rumbling of wheels towards the eastward i can tell you nothing more except that in my honest opinion you will never see your daughter again the best advice i can give you is to take up your abode in this cavern where we will be the two most wretched women in the world  not yet dark hecate replied ceres but do you first come with your torch and help me to seek for my lost child and when there shall be no more hope of finding her if that black day is ordained to come then if you will give me room to fling myself down either on these withered leaves or on the naked rock i will show you what it is to be miserable but until i know that she has perished from the face of the earth i will not allow myself space even to grieve  the dismal hecate did not much like the idea of going abroad into the sunny world but then she reflected that the sorrow of the disconsolate ceres would be like a gloomy twilight round about them both let the sun shine ever so brightly and that therefore she might enjoy her bad spirits quite as well as if she were to stay in the cave so she finally consented to go and they set out together both carrying torches although it was broad daylight and clear sunshine the torchlight seemed to make a gloom so that the people whom they met along the road could not very distinctly see their figures and indeed if they once caught a glimpse of hecate with the wreath of snakes round her forehead they generally thought it prudent to run away without waiting for a second glance  as the pair travelled along in this woebegone manner a thought struck ceres  there is one person she exclaimed who must have seen my poor child and can doubtless tell what has become of her why did not i think of him before it is phoebus  what said hecate the young man that always sits in the sunshine oh pray do not think of going near him he is a gay light frivolous young fellow and will only smile in your face and besides there is such a glare of the sun about him that he will quite blind my poor eyes which i have almost wept away already  you have promised to be my companion answered ceres come let us make haste or the sunshine will be gone and phoebus along with it  accordingly they went along in quest of phoebus both of them sighing grievously and hecate to say the truth making a great deal worse lamentation than ceres for all the pleasure she had you know lay in being miserable and therefore she made the most of it by and by after a pretty long journey they arrived at the sunniest spot in the whole world there they beheld a beautiful young man with long curling ringlets which seemed to be made of golden sunbeams his garments were like light summer clouds and the expression of his face was so exceedingly vivid that hecate held her hands before her eyes muttering that he ought to wear a black veil phoebus for this was the very person whom they were seeking had a lyre in his hands and was making its chords tremble with sweet music at the same time singing a most exquisite song which he had recently composed for besides a great many other accomplishments this young man was renowned for his admirable poetry  as ceres and her dismal companion approached him phoebus smiled on them so cheerfully that hecates wreath of snakes gave a spiteful hiss and hecate heartily wished herself back in her cave but as for ceres she was too earnest in her grief either to know or care whether phoebus smiled or frowned  phoebus exclaimed she i am in great trouble and have come to you for assistance can you tell me what has become of my dear child proserpina  proserpina proserpina did you call her name answered phoebus endeavoring to recollect for there was such a continual flow of pleasant ideas in his mind that he was apt to forget what had happened no longer ago than yesterday ah yes i remember her now a very lovely child indeed i am happy to tell you my dear madam that i did see the little proserpina not many days ago you may make yourself perfectly easy about her she is safe and in excellent hands  oh where is my dear child cried ceres clasping her hands and flinging herself at his feet  why said phoebusand as he spoke he kept touching his lyre so as to make a thread of music run in and out among his wordsas the little damsel was gathering flowers and she has really a very exquisite taste for flowers she was suddenly snatched up by king pluto and carried off to his dominions i have never been in that part of the universe but the royal palace i am told is built in a very noble style of architecture and of the most splendid and costly materials gold diamonds pearls and all manner of precious stones will be your daughters ordinary playthings i recommend to you my dear lady to give yourself no uneasiness proserpinas sense of beauty will be duly gratified and even in spite of the lack of sunshine she will lead a very enviable life  hush say not such a word answered ceres indignantly what is there to gratify her heart what are all the splendors you speak of without affection i must have her back again will you go with me phoebus to demand my daughter of this wicked pluto  pray excuse me replied phoebus with an elegant obeisance i certainly wish you success and regret that my own affairs are so immediately pressing that i cannot have the pleasure of attending you besides i am not upon the best of terms with king pluto to tell you the truth his threeheaded mastiff would never let me pass the gateway for i should be compelled to take a sheaf of sunbeams along with me and those you know are forbidden things in plutos kingdom  ah phoebus said ceres with bitter meaning in her words you have a harp instead of a heart farewell  will not you stay a moment asked phoebus and hear me turn the pretty and touching story of proserpina into extemporary verses  but ceres shook her head and hastened away along with hecate phoebus who as i have told you was an exquisite poet forthwith began to make an ode about the poor mothers grief and if we were to judge of his sensibility by this beautiful production he must have been endowed with a very tender heart but when a poet gets into the habit of using his heartstrings to make chords for his lyre he may thrum upon them as much as he will without any great pain to himself accordingly though phoebus sang a very sad song he was as merry all the while as were the sunbeams amid which he dwelt  poor mother ceres had now found out what had become of her daughter but was not a whit happier than before her case on the contrary looked more desperate than ever as long as proserpina was above ground there might have been hopes of regaining her but now that the poor child was shut up within the iron gates of the king of the mines at the threshold of which lay the threeheaded cerberus there seemed no possibility of her ever making her escape the dismal hecate who loved to take the darkest view of things told ceres that she had better come with her to the cavern and spend the rest of her life in being miserable ceres answered that hecate was welcome to go back thither herself but that for her part she would wander about the earth in quest of the entrance to king plutos dominions and hecate took her at her word and hurried back to her beloved cave frightening a great many little children with a glimpse of her dogs face as she went  poor mother ceres it is melancholy to think of her pursuing her toilsome way all alone and holding up that neverdying torch the flame of which seemed an emblem of the grief and hope that burned together in her heart so much did she suffer that though her aspect had been quite youthful when her troubles began she grew to look like an elderly person in a very brief time she cared not how she was dressed nor had she ever thought of flinging away the wreath of withered poppies which she put on the very morning of proserpinas disappearance she roamed about in so wild a way and with her hair so dishevelled that people took her for some distracted creature and never dreamed that this was mother ceres who had the oversight of every seed which the husbandman planted nowadays however she gave herself no trouble about seedtime nor harvest but left the farmers to take care of their own affairs and the crops to fade or flourish as the case might be there was nothing now in which ceres seemed to feel an interest unless when she saw children at play or gathering flowers along the wayside then indeed she would stand and gaze at them with tears in her eyes the children too appeared to have a sympathy with her grief and would cluster themselves in a little group about her knees and look up wistfully in her face and ceres after giving them a kiss all round would lead them to their homes and advise their mothers never to let them stray out of sight  for if they do said she it may happen to you as it has to me that the ironhearted king pluto will take a liking to your darlings and snatch them up in his chariot and carry them away  one day during her pilgrimage in quest of the entrance to plutos kingdom she came to the palace of king celeus who reigned at eleusis ascending a lofty flight of steps she entered the portal and found the royal household in very great alarm about the queens baby the infant it seems was sickly being troubled with its teeth i suppose and would take no food and was all the time moaning with pain the queenher name was metanirawas desirous of finding a nurse and when she beheld a woman of matronly aspect coming up the palace steps she thought in her own mind that here was the very person whom she needed so queen metanira ran to the door with the poor wailing baby in her arms and besought ceres to take charge of it or at least to tell her what would do it good  will you trust the child entirely to me asked ceres  yes and gladly too answered the queen if you will devote all your time to him for i can see that you have been a mother  you are right said ceres i once had a child of my own well i will be the nurse of this poor sickly boy but beware i warn you that you do not interfere with any kind of treatment which i may judge proper for him if you do so the poor infant must suffer for his mothers folly  then she kissed the child and it seemed to do him good for he smiled and nestled closely into her bosom  so mother ceres set her torch in a corner where it kept burning all the while and took up her abode in the palace of king celeus as nurse to the little prince demopho√∂n she treated him as if he were her own child and allowed neither the king nor the queen to say whether he should be bathed in warm or cold water or what he should eat or how often he should take the air or when he should be put to bed you would hardly believe me if i were to tell how quickly the baby prince got rid of his ailments and grew fat and rosy and strong and how he had two rows of ivory teeth in less time than any other little fellow before or since instead of the palest and wretchedest and puniest imp in the world as his own mother confessed him to be when ceres first took him in charge he was now a strapping baby crowing laughing kicking up his heels and rolling from one end of the room to the other all the good women of the neighborhood crowded to the palace and held up their hands in unutterable amazement at the beauty and wholesomeness of this darling little prince their wonder was the greater because he was never seen to taste any food not even so much as a cup of milk  pray nurse the queen kept saying how is it that you make the child thrive so  i was a mother once ceres always replied and having nursed my own child i know what other children need  but queen metanira as was very natural had a great curiosity to know precisely what the nurse did to her child one night therefore she hid herself in the chamber where ceres and the little prince were accustomed to sleep there was a fire in the chimney and it had now crumbled into great coals and embers which lay glowing on the hearth with a blaze flickering up now and then and flinging a warm and ruddy light upon the walls ceres sat before the hearth with the child in her lap and the firelight making her shadow dance upon the ceiling overhead she undressed the little prince and bathed him all over with some fragrant liquid out of a vase the next thing she did was to rake back the red embers and make a hollow place among them just where the backlog had been at last while the baby was crowing and clapping its fat little hands and laughing in the nurses face just as you may have seen your little brother or sister do before going into its warm bath ceres suddenly laid him all naked as he was in the hollow among the redhot embers she then raked the ashes over him and turned quietly away  you may imagine if you can how queen metanira shrieked thinking nothing less than that her dear child would be burned to a cinder she burst forth from her hidingplace and running to the hearth raked open the fire and snatched up poor little prince demopho√∂n out of his bed of live coals one of which he was gripping in each of his fists he immediately set up a grievous cry as babies are apt to do when rudely startled out of a sound sleep to the queens astonishment and joy she could perceive no token of the childs being injured by the hot fire in which he had lain she now turned to mother ceres and asked her to explain the mystery  foolish woman answered ceres did you not promise to intrust this poor infant entirely to me you little know the mischief you have done him had you left him to my care he would have grown up like a child of celestial birth endowed with superhuman strength and intelligence and would have lived forever do you imagine that earthly children are to become immortal without being tempered to it in the fiercest heat of the fire but you have ruined your own son for though he will be a strong man and a hero in his day yet on account of your folly he will grow old and finally die like the sons of other women the weak tenderness of his mother has cost the poor boy an immortality farewell  saying these words she kissed the little prince demopho√∂n and sighed to think what he had lost and took her departure without heeding queen metanira who entreated her to remain and cover up the child among the hot embers as often as she pleased poor baby he never slept so warmly again  while she dwelt in the kings palace mother ceres had been so continually occupied with taking care of the young prince that her heart was a little lightened of its grief for proserpina but now having nothing else to busy herself about she became just as wretched as before at length in her despair she came to the dreadful resolution that not a stalk of grain nor a blade of grass not a potato nor a turnip nor any other vegetable that was good for man or beast to eat should be suffered to grow until her daughter were restored she even forbade the flowers to bloom lest somebodys heart should be cheered by their beauty  now as not so much as a head of asparagus ever presumed to poke itself out of the ground without the especial permission of ceres you may conceive what a terrible calamity had here fallen upon the earth the husbandmen ploughed and planted as usual but there lay the rich black furrows all as barren as a desert of sand the pastures looked as brown in the sweet month of june as ever they did in chill november the rich mans broad acres and the cottagers small gardenpatch were equally blighted every little girls flowerbed showed nothing but dry stalks the old people shook their white heads and said that the earth had grown aged like themselves and was no longer capable of wearing the warm smile of summer on its face it was really piteous to see the poor starving cattle and sheep how they followed behind ceres lowing and bleating as if their instinct taught them to expect help from her and everybody that was acquainted with her power besought her to have mercy on the human race and at all events to let the grass grow but mother ceres though naturally of an affectionate disposition was now inexorable  never said she if the earth is ever again to see any verdure it must first grow along the path which my daughter will tread in coming back to me  finally as there seemed to be no other remedy our old friend quicksilver was sent post haste to king pluto in hopes that he might be persuaded to undo the mischief he had done and to set everything right again by giving up proserpina quicksilver accordingly made the best of his way to the great gate took a flying leap right over the threeheaded mastiff and stood at the door of the palace in an inconceivably short time the servants knew him both by his face and garb for his short cloak and his winged cap and shoes and his snaky staff had often been seen thereabouts in times gone by he requested to be shown immediately into the kings presence and pluto who heard his voice from the top of the stairs and who loved to recreate himself with quicksilvers merry talk called out to him to come up and while they settle their business together we must inquire what proserpina has been doing ever since we saw her last  the child had declared as you may remember that she would not taste a mouthful of food as long as she should be compelled to remain in king plutos palace how she contrived to maintain her resolution and at the same time to keep herself tolerably plump and rosy is more than i can explain but some young ladies i am given to understand possess the faculty of living on air and proserpina seems to have possessed it too at any rate it was now six months since she left the outside of the earth and not a morsel so far as the attendants were able to testify had yet passed between her teeth this was the more creditable to proserpina inasmuch as king pluto had caused her to be tempted day after day with all manner of sweetmeats and richly preserved fruits and delicacies of every sort such as young people are generally most fond of but her good mother had often told her of the hurtfulness of these things and for that reason alone if there had been no other she would have resolutely refused to taste them  all this time being of a cheerful and active disposition the little damsel was not quite so unhappy as you may have supposed the immense palace had a thousand rooms and was full of beautiful and wonderful objects there was a neverceasing gloom it is true which half hid itself among the innumerable pillars gliding before the child as she wandered among them and treading stealthily behind her in the echo of her footsteps neither was all the dazzle of the precious stones which flamed with their own light worth one gleam of natural sunshine nor could the most brilliant of the manycolored gems which proserpina had for playthings vie with the simple beauty of the flowers she used to gather but still wherever the girl went among those gilded halls and chambers it seemed as if she carried nature and sunshine along with her and as if she scattered dewy blossoms on her right hand and on her left after proserpina came the palace was no longer the same abode of stately artifice and dismal magnificence that it had before been the inhabitants all felt this and king pluto more than any of them  my own little proserpina he used to say i wish you could like me a little better we gloomy and cloudynatured persons have often as warm hearts at bottom as those of a more cheerful character if you would only stay with me of your own accord it would make me happier than the possession of a hundred such palaces as this  ah said proserpina you should have tried to make me like you before carrying me off and the best thing you can do now is to let me go again then i might remember you sometimes and think that you were as kind as you knew how to be perhaps too one day or other i might come back and pay you a visit  no no answered pluto with his gloomy smile i will not trust you for that you are too fond of living in the broad daylight and gathering flowers what an idle and childish taste that is are not these gems which i have ordered to be dug for you and which are richer than any in my crownare they not prettier than a violet  not half so pretty said proserpina snatching the gems from plutos hand and flinging them to the other end of the hall oh my sweet violets shall i never see you again  and then she burst into tears but young peoples tears have very little saltness or acidity in them and do not inflame the eyes so much as those of grown persons so that it is not to be wondered at if a few moments afterwards proserpina was sporting through the hall almost as merrily as she and the four seanymphs had sported along the edge of the surf wave king pluto gazed after her and wished that he too was a child and little proserpina when she turned about and beheld this great king standing in his splendid hall and looking so grand and so melancholy and so lonesome was smitten with a kind of pity she ran back to him and for the first time in all her life put her small soft hand in his  i love you a little whispered she looking up in his face  do you indeed my dear child cried pluto bending his dark face down to kiss her but proserpina shrank away from the kiss for though his features were noble they were very dusky and grim well i have not deserved it of you after keeping you a prisoner for so many months and starving you besides are you not terribly hungry is there nothing which i can get you to eat  in asking this question the king of the mines had a very cunning purpose for you will recollect if proserpina tasted a morsel of food in his dominions she would never afterwards be at liberty to quit them  no indeed said proserpina your head cook is always baking and stewing and roasting and rolling out paste and contriving one dish or another which he imagines may be to my liking but he might just as well save himself the trouble poor fat little man that he is i have no appetite for anything in the world unless it were a slice of bread of my mothers own baking or a little fruit out of her garden  when pluto heard this he began to see that he had mistaken the best method of tempting proserpina to eat the cooks made dishes and artificial dainties were not half so delicious in the good childs opinion as the simple fare to which mother ceres had accustomed her wondering that he had never thought of it before the king now sent one of his trusty attendants with a large basket to get some of the finest and juiciest pears peaches and plums which could anywhere be found in the upper world unfortunately however this was during the time when ceres had forbidden any fruits or vegetables to grow and after seeking all over the earth king plutos servant found only a single pomegranate and that so dried up as to be not worth eating nevertheless since there was no better to be had he brought this dry old withered pomegranate home to the palace put it on a magnificent golden salver and carried it up to proserpina now it happened curiously enough that just as the servant was bringing the pomegranate into the back door of the palace our friend quicksilver had gone up the front steps on his errand to get proserpina away from king pluto  as soon as proserpina saw the pomegranate on the golden salver she told the servant he had better take it away again  i shall not touch it i assure you said she if i were ever so hungry i should never think of eating such a miserable dry pomegranate as that  it is the only one in the world said the servant  he set down the golden salver with the wizened pomegranate upon it and left the room when he was gone proserpina could not help coming close to the table and looking at this poor specimen of dried fruit with a great deal of eagerness for to say the truth on seeing something that suited her taste she felt all the six months appetite taking possession of her at once to be sure it was a very wretchedlooking pomegranate and seemed to have no more juice in it than an oystershell but there was no choice of such things in king plutos palace this was the first fruit she had seen there and the last she was ever likely to see and unless she ate it up immediately it would grow drier than it already was and be wholly unfit to eat  at least i may smell it thought proserpina  so she took up the pomegranate and applied it to her nose and somehow or other being in such close neighborhood to her mouth the fruit found its way into that little red cave dear me what an everlasting pity before proserpina knew what she was about her teeth had actually bitten it of their own accord just as this fatal deed was done the door of the apartment opened and in came king pluto followed by quicksilver who had been urging him to let his little prisoner go at the first noise of their entrance proserpina withdrew the pomegranate from her mouth but quicksilver whose eyes were very keen and his wits the sharpest that ever anybody had perceived that the child was a little confused and seeing the empty salver he suspected that she had been taking a sly nibble of something or other as for honest pluto he never guessed at the secret  my little proserpina said the king sitting down and affectionately drawing her between his knees here is quicksilver who tells me that a great many misfortunes have befallen innocent people on account of my detaining you in my dominions to confess the truth i myself had already reflected that it was an unjustifiable act to take you away from your good mother but then you must consider my dear child that this vast palace is apt to be gloomy although the precious stones certainly shine very bright and that i am not of the most cheerful disposition and that therefore it was a natural thing enough to seek for the society of some merrier creature than myself i hoped you would take my crown for a plaything and meah you laugh naughty proserpiname grim as i am for a playmate it was a silly expectation  not so extremely silly whispered proserpina you have really amused me very much sometimes  thank you said king pluto rather dryly but i can see plainly enough that you think my palace a dusky prison and me the ironhearted keeper of it and an iron heart i should surely have if i could detain you here any longer my poor child when it is now six months since you tasted food i give you your liberty go with quicksilver hasten home to your dear mother  now although you may not have supposed it proserpina found it impossible to take leave of poor king pluto without some regrets and a good deal of compunction for not telling him about the pomegranate she even shed a tear or two thinking how lonely and cheerless the great palace would seem to him with all its ugly glare of artificial light after she herselfhis one little ray of natural sunshine whom he had stolen to be sure but only because he valued her so muchafter she should have departed i know not how many kind things she might have said to the disconsolate king of the mines had not quicksilver hurried her away  come along quickly whispered he in her ear or his majesty may change his royal mind and take care above all things that you say nothing of what was brought you on the golden salver  in a very short time they had passed the great gateway leaving the threeheaded cerberus barking and yelping and growling with threefold din behind them and emerged upon the surface of the earth it was delightful to behold as proserpina hastened along how the path grew verdant behind and on either side of her wherever she set her blessed foot there was at once a dewy flower the violets gushed up along the wayside the grass and the grain began to sprout with tenfold vigor and luxuriance to make up for the dreary months that had been wasted in barrenness the starved cattle immediately set to work grazing after their long fast and ate enormously all day and got up at midnight to eat more but i can assure you it was a busy time of year with the farmers when they found the summer coming upon them with such a rush nor must i forget to say that all the birds in the whole world hopped about upon the newly blossoming trees and sang together in a prodigious ecstasy of joy  mother ceres had returned to her deserted home and was sitting disconsolately on the doorstep with her torch burning in her hand she had been idly watching the flame for some moments past when all at once it flickered and went out  what does this mean thought she it was an enchanted torch and should have kept burning till my child came back  lifting her eyes she was surprised to see a sudden verdure flashing over the brown and barren fields exactly as you may have observed a golden hue gleaming far and wide across the landscape from the just risen sun  does the earth disobey me exclaimed mother ceres indignantly does it presume to be green when i have bidden it be barren until my daughter shall be restored to my arms  then open your arms dear mother cried a wellknown voice and take your little daughter into them  and proserpina came running and flung herself upon her mothers bosom their mutual transport is not to be described the grief of their separation had caused both of them to shed a great many tears and now they shed a great many more because their joy could not so well express itself in any other way  when their hearts had grown a little more quiet mother ceres looked anxiously at proserpina  my child said she did you taste any food while you were in king plutos palace  dearest mother answered proserpina i will tell you the whole truth until this very morning not a morsel of food had passed my lips but today they brought me a pomegranate a very dry one it was and all shrivelled up till there was little left of it but seeds and skin and having seen no fruit for so long a time and being faint with hunger i was tempted just to bite it the instant i tasted it king pluto and quicksilver came into the room i had not swallowed a morsel butdear mother i hope it was no harmbut six of the pomegranate seeds i am afraid remained in my mouth  ah unfortunate child and miserable me exclaimed ceres for each of those six pomegranate seeds you must spend one month of every year in king plutos palace you are but half restored to your mother only six months with me and six with that goodfornothing king of darkness  do not speak so harshly of poor king pluto said proserpina kissing her mother he has some very good qualities and i really think i can bear to spend six months in his palace if he will only let me spend the other six with you he certainly did very wrong to carry me off but then as he says it was but a dismal sort of life for him to live in that great gloomy place all alone and it has made a wonderful change in his spirits to have a little girl to run up stairs and down there is some comfort in making him so happy and so upon the whole dearest mother let us be thankful that he is not to keep me the whole year round     the golden fleece   when jason the son of the dethroned king of iolchos was a little boy he was sent away from his parents and placed under the queerest schoolmaster that ever you heard of this learned person was one of the people or quadrupeds called centaurs he lived in a cavern and had the body and legs of a white horse with the head and shoulders of a man his name was chiron and in spite of his odd appearance he was a very excellent teacher and had several scholars who afterwards did him credit by making a great figure in the world the famous hercules was one and so was achilles and philoctetes likewise and √Üsculapius who acquired immense repute as a doctor the good chiron taught his pupils how to play upon the harp and how to cure diseases and how to use the sword and shield together with various other branches of education in which the lads of those days used to be instructed instead of writing and arithmetic  i have sometimes suspected that master chiron was not really very different from other people but that being a kindhearted and merry old fellow he was in the habit of making believe that he was a horse and scrambling about the schoolroom on all fours and letting the little boys ride upon his back and so when his scholars had grown up and grown old and were trotting their grandchildren on their knees they told them about the sports of their schooldays and these young folks took the idea that their grandfathers had been taught their letters by a centaur half man and half horse little children not quite understanding what is said to them often get such absurd notions into their heads you know  be that as it may it has always been told for a fact and always will be told as long as the world lasts that chiron with the head of a schoolmaster had the body and legs of a horse just imagine the grave old gentleman clattering and stamping into the schoolroom on his four hoofs perhaps treading on some little fellows toes flourishing his switch tail instead of a rod and now and then trotting out of doors to eat a mouthful of grass i wonder what the blacksmith charged him for a set of iron shoes  so jason dwelt in the cave with this fourfooted chiron from the time that he was an infant only a few months old until he had grown to the full height of a man he became a very good harper i suppose and skilful in the use of weapons and tolerably acquainted with herbs and other doctors stuff and above all an admirable horseman for in teaching young people to ride the good chiron must have been without a rival among schoolmasters at length being now a tall and athletic youth jason resolved to seek his fortune in the world without asking chirons advice or telling him anything about the matter this was very unwise to be sure and i hope none of you my little hearers will ever follow jasons example but you are to understand he had heard how that he himself was a prince royal and how his father king √Üson had been deprived of the kingdom of iolchos by a certain pelias who would also have killed jason had he not been hidden in the centaurs cave and being come to the strength of a man jason determined to set all this business to rights and to punish the wicked pelias for wronging his dear father and to cast him down from the throne and seat himself there instead  with this intention he took a spear in each hand and threw a leopards skin over his shoulders to keep off the rain and set forth on his travels with his long yellow ringlets waving in the wind the part of his dress on which he most prided himself was a pair of sandals that had been his fathers they were handsomely embroidered and were tied upon his feet with strings of gold but his whole attire was such as people did not very often see and as he passed along the women and children ran to the doors and windows wondering whither this beautiful youth was journeying with his leopards skin and his goldentied sandals and what heroic deeds he meant to perform with a spear in his right hand and another in his left  illustration jason and his teacher  i know not how far jason had travelled when he came to a turbulent river which rushed right across his pathway with specks of white foam among its black eddies hurrying tumultuously onward and roaring angrily as it went though not a very broad river in the dry seasons of the year it was now swollen by heavy rains and by the melting of the snow on the sides of mount olympus and it thundered so loudly and looked so wild and dangerous that jason bold as he was thought it prudent to pause upon the brink the bed of the stream seemed to be strewn with sharp and rugged rocks some of which thrust themselves above the water by and by an uprooted tree with shattered branches came drifting along the current and got entangled among the rocks now and then a drowned sheep and once the carcass of a cow floated past  in short the swollen river had already done a great deal of mischief it was evidently too deep for jason to wade and too boisterous for him to swim he could see no bridge and as for a boat had there been any the rocks would have broken it to pieces in an instant  see the poor lad said a cracked voice close to his side he must have had but a poor education since he does not know how to cross a little stream like this or is he afraid of wetting his fine goldenstringed sandals it is a pity his fourfooted schoolmaster is not here to carry him safely across on his back  jason looked round greatly surprised for he did not know that anybody was near but beside him stood an old woman with a ragged mantle over her head leaning on a staff the top of which was carved into the shape of a cuckoo she looked very aged and wrinkled and infirm and yet her eyes which were as brown as those of an ox were so extremely large and beautiful that when they were fixed on jasons eyes he could see nothing else but them the old woman had a pomegranate in her hand although the fruit was then quite out of season  whither are you going jason she now asked  she seemed to know his name you will observe and indeed those great brown eyes looked as if they had a knowledge of everything whether past or to come while jason was gazing at her a peacock strutted forward and took his stand at the old womans side  i am going to iolchos answered the young man to bid the wicked king pelias come down from my fathers throne and let me reign in his stead  ah well then said the old woman still with the same cracked voice if that is all your business you need not be in a very great hurry just take me on your back theres a good youth and carry me across the river i and my peacock have something to do on the other side as well as yourself  good mother replied jason your business can hardly be so important as the pulling down a king from his throne besides as you may see for yourself the river is very boisterous and if i should chance to stumble it would sweep both of us away more easily than it has carried off yonder uprooted tree i would gladly help you if i could but i doubt whether i am strong enough to carry you across  then said she very scornfully neither are you strong enough to pull king pelias off his throne and jason unless you will help an old woman at her need you ought not to be a king what are kings made for save to succor the feeble and distressed but do as you please either take me on your back or with my poor old limbs i shall try my best to struggle across the stream  saying this the old woman poked with her staff in the river as if to find the safest place in its rocky bed where she might make the first step but jason by this time had grown ashamed of his reluctance to help her he felt that he could never forgive himself if this poor feeble creature should come to any harm in attempting to wrestle against the headlong current the good chiron whether half horse or no had taught him that the noblest use of his strength was to assist the weak and also that he must treat every young woman as if she were his sister and every old one like a mother remembering these maxims the vigorous and beautiful young man knelt down and requested the good dame to mount upon his back  the passage seems to me not very safe he remarked but as your business is so urgent i will try to carry you across if the river sweeps you away it shall take me too  that no doubt will be a great comfort to both of us quoth the old woman but never fear we shall get safely across  so she threw her arms around jasons neck and lifting her from the ground he stepped boldly into the raging and foamy current and began to stagger away from the shore as for the peacock it alighted on the old dames shoulder jasons two spears one in each hand kept him from stumbling and enabled him to feel his way among the hidden rocks although every instant he expected that his companion and himself would go down the stream together with the driftwood of shattered trees and the carcasses of the sheep and cow down came the cold snowy torrent from the steep side of olympus raging and thundering as if it had a real spite against jason or at all events were determined to snatch off his living burden from his shoulders when he was halfway across the uprooted tree which i have already told you about broke loose from among the rocks and bore down upon him with all its splintered branches sticking out like the hundred arms of the giant briareus it rushed past however without touching him but the next moment his foot was caught in a crevice between two rocks and stuck there so fast that in the effort to get free he lost one of his goldenstringed sandals  at this accident jason could not help uttering a cry of vexation  what is the matter jason asked the old woman  matter enough said the young man i have lost a sandal here among the rocks and what sort of a figure shall i cut at the court of king pelias with a goldenstringed sandal on one foot and the other foot bare  do not take it to heart answered his companion cheerily you never met with better fortune than in losing that sandal it satisfies me that you are the very person whom the speaking oak has been talking about  there was no time just then to inquire what the speaking oak had said but the briskness of her tone encouraged the young man and besides he had never in his life felt so vigorous and mighty as since taking this old woman on his back instead of being exhausted he gathered strength as he went on and struggling up against the torrent he at last gained the opposite shore clambered up the bank and set down the old dame and her peacock safely on the grass as soon as this was done however he could not help looking rather despondently at his bare foot with only a remnant of the golden string of the sandal clinging round his ankle  you will get a handsomer pair of sandals by and by said the old woman with a kindly look out of her beautiful brown eyes only let king pelias get a glimpse of that bare foot and you shall see him turn as pale as ashes i promise you there is your path go along my good jason and my blessing go with you and when you sit on your throne remember the old woman whom you helped over the river  with these words she hobbled away giving him a smile over her shoulder as she departed whether the light of her beautiful brown eyes threw a glory round about her or whatever the cause might be jason fancied that there was something very noble and majestic in her figure after all and that though her gait seemed to be a rheumatic hobble yet she moved with as much grace and dignity as any queen on earth her peacock which had now fluttered down from her shoulder strutted behind her in prodigious pomp and spread out its magnificent tail on purpose for jason to admire it  when the old dame and her peacock were out of sight jason set forward on his journey after travelling a pretty long distance he came to a town situated at the foot of a mountain and not a great way from the shore of the sea on the outside of the town there was an immense crowd of people not only men and women but children too all in their best clothes and evidently enjoying a holiday the crowd was thickest towards the seashore and in that direction over the peoples heads jason saw a wreath of smoke curling upward to the blue sky he inquired of one of the multitude what town it was near by and why so many persons were here assembled together  this is the kingdom of iolchos answered the man and we are the subjects of king pelias our monarch has summoned us together that we may see him sacrifice a black bull to neptune who they say is his majestys father yonder is the king where you see the smoke going up from the altar  while the man spoke he eyed jason with great curiosity for his garb was quite unlike that of the iolchians and it looked very odd to see a youth with a leopards skin over his shoulders and each hand grasping a spear jason perceived too that the man stared particularly at his feet one of which you remember was bare while the other was decorated with his fathers goldenstringed sandal  look at him only look at him said the man to his next neighbor do you see he wears but one sandal  upon this first one person and then another began to stare at jason and everybody seemed to be greatly struck with something in his aspect though they turned their eyes much oftener towards his feet than to any other part of his figure besides he could hear them whispering to one another  one sandal one sandal they kept saying the man with one sandal here he is at last whence has he come what does he mean to do what will the king say to the onesandalled man  poor jason was greatly abashed and made up his mind that the people of iolchos were exceedingly ill bred to take such public notice of an accidental deficiency in his dress meanwhile whether it were that they hustled him forward or that jason of his own accord thrust a passage through the crowd it so happened that he soon found himself close to the smoking altar where king pelias was sacrificing the black bull the murmur and hum of the multitude in their surprise at the spectacle of jason with his one bare foot grew so loud that it disturbed the ceremonies and the king holding the great knife with which he was just going to cut the bulls throat turned angrily about and fixed his eyes on jason the people had now withdrawn from around him so that the youth stood in an open space near the smoking altar front to front with the angry king pelias  who are you cried the king with a terrible frown and how dare you make this disturbance while i am sacrificing a black bull to my father neptune  it is no fault of mine answered jason your majesty must blame the rudeness of your subjects who have raised all this tumult because one of my feet happens to be bare  when jason said this the king gave a quick startled glance down at his feet  ha muttered he here is the onesandalled fellow sure enough what can i do with him  and he clutched more closely the great knife in his hand as if he were half a mind to slay jason instead of the black bull the people round about caught up the kings words indistinctly as they were uttered and first there was a murmur among them and then a loud shout  the onesandalled man has come the prophecy must be fulfilled  for you are to know that many years before king pelias had been told by the speaking oak of dodona that a man with one sandal should cast him down from his throne on this account he had given strict orders that nobody should ever come into his presence unless both sandals were securely tied upon his feet and he kept an officer in his palace whose sole business it was to examine peoples sandals and to supply them with a new pair at the expense of the royal treasury as soon as the old ones began to wear out in the whole course of the kings reign he had never been thrown into such a fright and agitation as by the spectacle of poor jasons bare foot but as he was naturally a bold and hardhearted man he soon took courage and began to consider in what way he might rid himself of this terrible onesandalled stranger  my good young man said king pelias taking the softest tone imaginable in order to throw jason off his guard you are excessively welcome to my kingdom judging by your dress you must have travelled a long distance for it is not the fashion to wear leopardskins in this part of the world pray what may i call your name and where did you receive your education  my name is jason answered the young stranger ever since my infancy i have dwelt in the cave of chiron the centaur he was my instructor and taught me music and horsemanship and how to cure wounds and likewise how to inflict wounds with my weapons  i have heard of chiron the schoolmaster replied king pelias and how that there is an immense deal of learning and wisdom in his head although it happens to be set on a horses body it gives me great delight to see one of his scholars at my court but to test how much you have profited under so excellent a teacher will you allow me to ask you a single question  i do not pretend to be very wise said jason but ask me what you please and i will answer to the best of my ability  now king pelias meant cunningly to entrap the young man and to make him say something that should be the cause of mischief and destruction to himself so with a crafty and evil smile upon his face he spoke as follows  what would you do brave jason asked he if there were a man in the world by whom as you had reason to believe you were doomed to be ruined and slainwhat would you do i say if that man stood before you and in your power  when jason saw the malice and wickedness which king pelias could not prevent from gleaming out of his eyes he probably guessed that the king had discovered what he came for and that he intended to turn his own words against himself still he scorned to tell a falsehood like an upright and honorable prince as he was he determined to speak out the real truth since the king had chosen to ask him the question and since jason had promised him an answer there was no right way save to tell him precisely what would be the most prudent thing to do if he had his worst enemy in his power  therefore after a moments consideration he spoke up with a firm and manly voice  i would send such a man said he in quest of the golden fleece  this enterprise you will understand was of all others the most difficult and dangerous in the world in the first place it would be necessary to make a long voyage through unknown seas there was hardly a hope or a possibility that any young man who should undertake this voyage would either succeed in obtaining the golden fleece or would survive to return home and tell of the perils he had run the eyes of king pelias sparkled with joy therefore when he heard jasons reply  well said wise man with the one sandal cried he go then and at the peril of your life bring me back the golden fleece  i go answered jason composedly if i fail you need not fear that i will ever come back to trouble you again but if i return to iolchos with the prize then king pelias you must hasten down from your lofty throne and give me your crown and sceptre  that i will said the king with a sneer meantime i will keep them very safely for you  the first thing that jason thought of doing after he left the kings presence was to go to dodona and inquire of the talking oak what course it was best to pursue this wonderful tree stood in the centre of an ancient wood its stately trunk rose up a hundred feet into the air and threw a broad and dense shadow over more than an acre of ground standing beneath it jason looked up among the knotted branches and green leaves and into the mysterious heart of the old tree and spoke aloud as if he were addressing some person who was hidden in the depths of the foliage  what shall i do said he in order to win the golden fleece  at first there was a deep silence not only within the shadow of the talking oak but all through the solitary wood in a moment or two however the leaves of the oak began to stir and rustle as if a gentle breeze were wandering amongst them although the other trees of the wood were perfectly still the sound grew louder and became like the roar of a high wind by and by jason imagined that he could distinguish words but very confusedly because each separate leaf of the tree seemed to be a tongue and the whole myriad of tongues were babbling at once but the noise waxed broader and deeper until it resembled a tornado sweeping through the oak and making one great utterance out of the thousand and thousand of little murmurs which each leafy tongue had caused by its rustling and now though it still had the tone of mighty wind roaring among the branches it was also like a deep bass voice speaking as distinctly as a tree could be expected to speak the following words  go to argus the shipbuilder and bid him build a galley with fifty oars  then the voice melted again into the indistinct murmur of the rustling leaves and died gradually away when it was quite gone jason felt inclined to doubt whether he had actually heard the words or whether his fancy had not shaped them out of the ordinary sound made by a breeze while passing through the thick foliage of the tree  but on inquiry among the people of iolchos he found that there was really a man in the city by the name of argus who was a very skilful builder of vessels this showed some intelligence in the oak else how should it have known that any such person existed at jasons request argus readily consented to build him a galley so big that it should require fifty strong men to row it although no vessel of such a size and burden had heretofore been seen in the world so the head carpenter and all his journeymen and apprentices began their work and for a good while afterwards there they were busily employed hewing out the timbers and making a great clatter with their hammers until the new ship which was called the argo seemed to be quite ready for sea and as the talking oak had already given him such good advice jason thought that it would not be amiss to ask for a little more he visited it again therefore and standing beside its huge rough trunk inquired what he should do next  this time there was no such universal quivering of the leaves throughout the whole tree as there had been before but after a while jason observed that the foliage of a great branch which stretched above his head had begun to rustle as if the wind were stirring that one bough while all the other boughs of the oak were at rest  cut me off said the branch as soon as it could speak distinctlycut me off cut me off and carve me into a figurehead for your galley  accordingly jason took the branch at its word and lopped it off the tree a carver in the neighborhood engaged to make the figurehead he was a tolerably good workman and had already carved several figureheads in what he intended for feminine shapes and looking pretty much like those which we see nowadays stuck up under a vessels bowsprit with great staring eyes that never wink at the dash of the spray but what was very strange the carver found that his hand was guided by some unseen power and by a skill beyond his own and that his tools shaped out an image which he had never dreamed of when the work was finished it turned out to be the figure of a beautiful woman with a helmet on her head from beneath which the long ringlets fell down upon her shoulders on the left arm was a shield and in its centre appeared a lifelike representation of the head of medusa with the snaky locks the right arm was extended as if pointing onward the face of this wonderful statue though not angry or forbidding was so grave and majestic that perhaps you might call it severe and as for the mouth it seemed just ready to unclose its lips and utter words of the deepest wisdom  jason was delighted with the oaken image and gave the carver no rest until it was completed and set up where a figurehead has always stood from that time to this in the vessels prow  and now cried he as he stood gazing at the calm majestic face of the statue i must go to the talking oak and inquire what next to do  there is no need of that jason said a voice which though it was far lower reminded him of the mighty tones of the great oak when you desire good advice you can seek it of me  jason had been looking straight into the face of the image when these words were spoken but he could hardly believe either his ears or his eyes the truth was however that the oaken lips had moved and to all appearance the voice had proceeded from the statues mouth recovering a little from his surprise jason bethought himself that the image had been carved out of the wood of the talking oak and that therefore it was really no great wonder but on the contrary the most natural thing in the world that it should possess the faculty of speech it would have been very odd indeed if it had not but certainly it was a great piece of good fortune that he should be able to carry so wise a block of wood along with him in his perilous voyage  tell me wondrous image exclaimed jasonsince you inherit the wisdom of the speaking oak of dodona whose daughter you aretell me where shall i find fifty bold youths who will take each of them an oar of my galley they must have sturdy arms to row and brave hearts to encounter perils or we shall never win the golden fleece  go replied the oaken imagego summon all the heroes of greece  and in fact considering what a great deed was to be done could any advice be wiser than this which jason received from the figurehead of his vessel he lost no time in sending messengers to all the cities and making known to the whole people of greece that prince jason the son of king √Üson was going in quest of the fleece of gold and that he desired the help of fortynine of the bravest and strongest young men alive to row his vessel and share his dangers and jason himself would be the fiftieth  at this news the adventurous youths all over the country began to bestir themselves some of them had already fought with giants and slain dragons and the younger ones who had not yet met with such good fortune thought it a shame to have lived so long without getting astride of a flying serpent or sticking their spears into a chim√¶ra or at least thrusting their right arms down a monstrous lions throat there was a fair prospect that they would meet with plenty of such adventures before finding the golden fleece as soon as they could furbish up their helmets and shields therefore and gird on their trusty swords they came thronging to iolchos and clambered on board the new galley shaking hands with jason they assured him that they did not care a pin for their lives but would help row the vessel to the remotest edge of the world and as much farther as he might think it best to go  many of these brave fellows had been educated by chiron the fourfooted pedagogue and were therefore old schoolmates of jason and knew him to be a lad of spirit the mighty hercules whose shoulders afterwards held up the sky was one of them and there were castor and pollux the twin brothers who were never accused of being chickenhearted although they had been hatched out of an egg and theseus who was so renowned for killing the minotaur and lynceus with his wonderfully sharp eyes which could see through a millstone or look right down into the depths of the earth and discover the treasures that were there and orpheus the very best of harpers who sang and played upon his lyre so sweetly that the brute beasts stood upon their hind legs and capered merrily to the music yes and at some of his more moving tunes the rocks bestirred their mossgrown bulk out of the ground and a grove of forest trees uprooted themselves and nodding their tops to one another performed a country dance  one of the rowers was a beautiful young woman named atalanta who had been nursed among the mountains by a bear so light of foot was this fair damsel that she could step from one foamy crest of a wave to the foamy crest of another without wetting more than the sole of her sandal she had grown up in a very wild way and talked much about the rights of women and loved hunting and war far better than her needle but in my opinion the most remarkable of this famous company were two sons of the north wind airy youngsters and of rather a blustering disposition who had wings on their shoulders and in case of a calm could puff out their cheeks and blow almost as fresh a breeze as their father i ought not to forget the prophets and conjurers of whom there were several in the crew and who could foretell what would happen tomorrow or the next day or a hundred years hence but were generally quite unconscious of what was passing at the moment  jason appointed tiphys to be helmsman because he was a stargazer and knew the points of the compass lynceus on account of his sharp sight was stationed as a lookout in the prow where he saw a whole days sail ahead but was rather apt to overlook things that lay directly under his nose if the sea only happened to be deep enough however lynceus could tell you exactly what kind of rocks or sands were at the bottom of it and he often cried out to his companions that they were sailing over heaps of sunken treasure which yet he was none the richer for beholding to confess the truth few people believed him when he said it  well but when the argonauts as these fifty brave adventurers were called had prepared everything for the voyage an unforeseen difficulty threatened to end it before it was begun the vessel you must understand was so long and broad and ponderous that the united force of all the fifty was insufficient to shove her into the water hercules i suppose had not grown to his full strength else he might have set her afloat as easily as a little boy launches his boat upon a puddle but here were these fifty heroes pushing and straining and growing red in the face without making the argo start an inch at last quite wearied out they sat themselves down on the shore exceedingly disconsolate and thinking that the vessel must be left to rot and fall in pieces and that they must either swim across the sea or lose the golden fleece  all at once jason bethought himself of the galleys miraculous figurehead  o daughter of the talking oak cried he how shall we set to work to get our vessel into the water  seat yourselves answered the image for it had known what ought to be done from the very first and was only waiting for the question to be putseat yourselves and handle your oars and let orpheus play upon his harp  immediately the fifty heroes got on board and seizing their oars held them perpendicularly in the air while orpheus who liked such a task far better than rowing swept his fingers across the harp at the first ringing note of the music they felt the vessel stir orpheus thrummed away briskly and the galley slid at once into the sea dipping her prow so deeply that the figurehead drank the wave with its marvellous lips and rose again as buoyant as a swan the rowers plied their fifty oars the white foam boiled up before the prow the water gurgled and bubbled in their wake while orpheus continued to play so lively a strain of music that the vessel seemed to dance over the billows by way of keeping time to it thus triumphantly did the argo sail out of the harbor amidst the huzzas and good wishes of everybody except the wicked old pelias who stood on a promontory scowling at her and wishing that he could blow out of his lungs the tempest of wrath that was in his heart and so sink the galley with all on board when they had sailed above fifty miles over the sea lynceus happened to cast his sharp eyes behind and said that there was this badhearted king still perched upon the promontory and scowling so gloomily that it looked like a black thundercloud in that quarter of the horizon  in order to make the time pass away more pleasantly during the voyage the heroes talked about the golden fleece it originally belonged it appears to a boeotian ram who had taken on his back two children when in danger of their lives and fled with them over land and sea as far as colchis one of the children whose name was helle fell into the sea and was drowned but the other a little boy named phrixus was brought safe ashore by the faithful ram who however was so exhausted that he immediately lay down and died in memory of this good deed and as a token of his true heart the fleece of the poor dead ram was miraculously changed to gold and became one of the most beautiful objects ever seen on earth it was hung upon a tree in a sacred grove where it had now been kept i know not how many years and was the envy of mighty kings who had nothing so magnificent in any of their palaces  if i were to tell you all the adventures of the argonauts it would take me till nightfall and perhaps a great deal longer there was no lack of wonderful events as you may judge from what you may have already heard at a certain island they were hospitably received by king cyzicus its sovereign who made a feast for them and treated them like brothers but the argonauts saw that this good king looked downcast and very much troubled and they therefore inquired of him what was the matter king cyzicus hereupon informed them that he and his subjects were greatly abused and incommoded by the inhabitants of a neighboring mountain who made war upon them and killed many people and ravaged the country and while they were talking about it cyzicus pointed to the mountain and asked jason and his companions what they saw there  i see some very tall objects answered jason but they are at such a distance that i cannot distinctly make out what they are to tell your majesty the truth they look so very strangely that i am inclined to think them clouds which have chanced to take something like human shapes  i see them very plainly remarked lynceus whose eyes you know were as farsighted as a telescope they are a band of enormous giants all of whom have six arms apiece and a club a sword or some other weapon in each of their hands  you have excellent eyes said king cyzicus yes they are sixarmed giants as you say and these are the enemies whom i and my subjects have to contend with  the next day when the argonauts were about setting sail down came these terrible giants stepping a hundred yards at a stride brandishing their six arms apiece and looking very formidable so far aloft in the air each of these monsters was able to carry on a whole war by himself for with one of his arms he could fling immense stones and wield a club with another and a sword with a third while the fourth was poking a long spear at the enemy and the fifth and sixth were shooting him with a bow and arrow but luckily though the giants were so huge and had so many arms they had each but one heart and that no bigger nor braver than the heart of an ordinary man besides if they had been like the hundredarmed briareus the brave argonauts would have given them their hands full of fight jason and his friends went boldly to meet them slew a great many and made the rest take to their heels so that if the giants had had six legs apiece instead of six arms it would have served them better to run away with  another strange adventure happened when the voyagers came to thrace where they found a poor blind king named phineus deserted by his subjects and living in a very sorrowful way all by himself on jasons inquiring whether they could do him any service the king answered that he was terribly tormented by three great winged creatures called harpies which had the faces of women and the wings bodies and claws of vultures these ugly wretches were in the habit of snatching away his dinner and allowing him no peace of his life upon hearing this the argonauts spread a plentiful feast on the seashore well knowing from what the blind king said of their greediness that the harpies would snuff up the scent of the victuals and quickly come to steal them away and so it turned out for hardly was the table set before the three hideous vulture women came flapping their wings seized the food in their talons and flew off as fast as they could but the two sons of the north wind drew their swords spread their pinions and set off through the air in pursuit of the thieves whom they at last overtook among some islands after a chase of hundreds of miles the two winged youths blustered terribly at the harpies for they had the rough temper of their father and so frightened them with their drawn swords that they solemnly promised never to trouble king phineus again  then the argonauts sailed onward and met with many other marvellous incidents any one of which would make a story by itself at one time they landed on an island and were reposing on the grass when they suddenly found themselves assailed by what seemed a shower of steelheaded arrows some of them stuck in the ground while others hit against their shields and several penetrated their flesh the fifty heroes started up and looked about them for the hidden enemy but could find none nor see any spot on the whole island where even a single archer could lie concealed still however the steelheaded arrows came whizzing among them and at last happening to look upward they beheld a large flock of birds hovering and wheeling aloft and shooting their feathers down upon the argonauts these feathers were the steelheaded arrows that had so tormented them there was no possibility of making any resistance and the fifty heroic argonauts might all have been killed or wounded by a flock of troublesome birds without ever setting eyes on the golden fleece if jason had not thought of asking the advice of the oaken image  illustration the argonauts in quest of the golden fleece  from the original in the collection of harry payne whitney esqre new york  so he ran to the galley as fast as his legs would carry him  o daughter of the speaking oak cried he all out of breath we need your wisdom more than ever before we are in great peril from a flock of birds who are shooting us with their steelpointed feathers what can we do to drive them away  make a clatter on your shields said the image  on receiving this excellent counsel jason hurried back to his companions who were far more dismayed than when they fought with the sixarmed giants and bade them strike with their swords upon their brazen shields forthwith the fifty heroes set heartily to work banging with might and main and raised such a terrible clatter that the birds made what haste they could to get away and though they had shot half the feathers out of their wings they were soon seen skimming among the clouds a long distance off and looking like a flock of wild geese orpheus celebrated this victory by playing a triumphant anthem on his harp and sang so melodiously that jason begged him to desist lest as the steelfeathered birds had been driven away by an ugly sound they might be enticed back again by a sweet one  while the argonauts remained on this island they saw a small vessel approaching the shore in which were two young men of princely demeanor and exceedingly handsome as young princes generally were in those days now who do you imagine these two voyagers turned out to be why if you will believe me they were the sons of that very phrixus who in his childhood had been carried to colchis on the back of the goldenfleeced ram since that time phrixus had married the kings daughter and the two young princes had been born and brought up at colchis and had spent their playdays in the outskirts of the grove in the centre of which the golden fleece was hanging upon a tree they were now on their way to greece in hopes of getting back a kingdom that had been wrongfully taken from their father  when the princes understood whither the argonauts were going they offered to turn back and guide them to colchis at the same time however they spoke as if it were very doubtful whether jason would succeed in getting the golden fleece according to their account the tree on which it hung was guarded by a terrible dragon who never failed to devour at one mouthful every person who might venture within his reach  there are other difficulties in the way continued the young princes but is not this enough ah brave jason turn back before it is too late it would grieve us to the heart if you and your nineandforty brave companions should be eaten up at fifty mouthfuls by this execrable dragon  my young friends quietly replied jason i do not wonder that you think the dragon very terrible you have grown up from infancy in the fear of this monster and therefore still regard him with the awe that children feel for the bugbears and hobgoblins which their nurses have talked to them about but in my view of the matter the dragon is merely a pretty large serpent who is not half so likely to snap me up at one mouthful as i am to cut off his ugly head and strip the skin from his body at all events turn back who may i will never see greece again unless i carry with me the golden fleece  we will none of us turn back cried his nineandforty brave comrades let us get on board the galley this instant and if the dragon is to make a breakfast of us much good may it do him  and orpheus whose custom it was to set everything to music began to harp and sing most gloriously and made every mothers son of them feel as if nothing in this world were so delectable as to fight dragons and nothing so truly honorable as to be eaten up at one mouthful in case of the worst  after this being now under the guidance of the two princes who were well acquainted with the way they quickly sailed to colchis when the king of the country whose name was √Üetes heard of their arrival he instantly summoned jason to court the king was a stern and cruellooking potentate and though he put on as polite and hospitable an expression as he could jason did not like his face a whit better than that of the wicked king pelias who dethroned his father  you are welcome brave jason said king √Üetes pray are you on a pleasure voyageor do you meditate the discovery of unknown islandsor what other cause has procured me the happiness of seeing you at my court  great sir replied jason with an obeisancefor chiron had taught him how to behave with propriety whether to kings or beggarsi have come hither with a purpose which i now beg your majestys permission to execute king pelias who sits on my fathers throne to which he has no more right than to the one on which your excellent majesty is now seated has engaged to come down from it and to give me his crown and sceptre provided i bring him the golden fleece this as your majesty is aware is now hanging on a tree here at colchis and i humbly solicit your gracious leave to take it away  in spite of himself the kings face twisted itself into an angry frown for above all things else in the world he prized the golden fleece and was even suspected of having done a very wicked act in order to get it into his own possession it put him into the worst possible humor therefore to hear that the gallant prince jason and fortynine of the bravest young warriors of greece had come to colchis with the sole purpose of taking away his chief treasure  do you know asked king √Üetes eying jason very sternly what are the conditions which you must fulfil before getting possession of the golden fleece  i have heard rejoined the youth that a dragon lies beneath the tree on which the prize hangs and that whoever approaches him runs the risk of being devoured at a mouthful  true said the king with a smile that did not look particularly goodnatured very true young man but there are other things as hard or perhaps a little harder to be done before you can even have the privilege of being devoured by the dragon for example you must first tame my two brazenfooted and brazenlunged bulls which vulcan the wonderful blacksmith made for me there is a furnace in each of their stomachs and they breathe such hot fire out of their mouths and nostrils that nobody has hitherto gone nigh them without being instantly burned to a small black cinder what do you think of this my brave jason  i must encounter the peril answered jason composedly since it stands in the way of my purpose  after taming the fiery bulls continued king √Üetes who was determined to scare jason if possible you must yoke them to a plough and must plough the sacred earth in the grove of mars and sow some of the same dragons teeth from which cadmus raised a crop of armed men they are an unruly set of reprobates those sons of the dragons teeth and unless you treat them suitably they will fall upon you sword in hand you and your nineandforty argonauts my bold jason are hardly numerous or strong enough to fight with such a host as will spring up  my master chiron replied jason taught me long ago the story of cadmus perhaps i can manage the quarrelsome sons of the dragons teeth as well as cadmus did  i wish the dragon had him muttered king √Üetes to himself and the fourfooted pedant his schoolmaster into the bargain why what a foolhardy selfconceited coxcomb he is well see what my firebreathing bulls will do for him well prince jason he continued aloud and as complaisantly as he could make yourself comfortable for today and tomorrow morning since you insist upon it you shall try your skill at the plough  while the king talked with jason a beautiful young woman was standing behind the throne she fixed her eyes earnestly upon the youthful stranger and listened attentively to every word that was spoken and when jason withdrew from the kings presence this young woman followed him out of the room  i am the kings daughter she said to him and my name is medea i know a great deal of which other young princesses are ignorant and can do many things which they would be afraid so much as to dream of if you will trust to me i can instruct you how to tame the fiery bulls and sow the dragons teeth and get the golden fleece  indeed beautiful princess answered jason if you will do me this service i promise to be grateful to you my whole life long  gazing at medea he beheld a wonderful intelligence in her face she was one of those persons whose eyes are full of mystery so that while looking into them you seem to see a very great way as into a deep well yet can never be certain whether you see into the farthest depths or whether there be not something else hidden at the bottom if jason had been capable of fearing anything he would have been afraid of making this young princess his enemy for beautiful as she now looked she might the very next instant become as terrible as the dragon that kept watch over the golden fleece  princess he exclaimed you seem indeed very wise and very powerful but how can you help me to do the things of which you speak are you an enchantress  yes prince jason answered medea with a smile you have hit upon the truth i am an enchantress circe my fathers sister taught me to be one and i could tell you if i pleased who was the old woman with the peacock the pomegranate and the cuckoo staff whom you carried over the river and likewise who it is that speaks through the lips of the oaken image that stands in the prow of your galley i am acquainted with some of your secrets you perceive it is well for you that i am favorably inclined for otherwise you would hardly escape being snapped up by the dragon  i should not so much care for the dragon replied jason if i only knew how to manage the brazenfooted and fierylunged bulls  if you are as brave as i think you and as you have need to be said medea your own bold heart will teach you that there is but one way of dealing with a mad bull what it is i leave you to find out in the moment of peril as for the fiery breath of these animals i have a charmed ointment here which will prevent you from being burned up and cure you if you chance to be a little scorched  so she put a golden box into his hand and directed him how to apply the perfumed unguent which it contained and where to meet her at midnight  only be brave added she and before daybreak the brazen bulls shall be tamed  the young man assured her that his heart would not fail him he then rejoined his comrades and told them what had passed between the princess and himself and warned them to be in readiness in case there might be need of their help  at the appointed hour he met the beautiful medea on the marble steps of the kings palace she gave him a basket in which were the dragons teeth just as they had been pulled out of the monsters jaws by cadmus long ago medea then led jason down the palace steps and through the silent streets of the city and into the royal pastureground where the two brazenfooted bulls were kept it was a starry night with a bright gleam along the eastern edge of the sky where the moon was soon going to show herself after entering the pasture the princess paused and looked around  there they are said she reposing themselves and chewing their fiery cuds in that farthest corner of the field it will be excellent sport i assure you when they catch a glimpse of your figure my father and all his court delight in nothing so much as to see a stranger trying to yoke them in order to come at the golden fleece it makes a holiday in colchis whenever such a thing happens for my part i enjoy it immensely you cannot imagine in what a mere twinkling of an eye their hot breath shrivels a young man into a black cinder  are you sure beautiful medea asked jason quite sure that the unguent in the gold box will prove a remedy against those terrible burns  if you doubt it if you are in the least afraid said the princess looking him in the face by the dim starlight you had better never have been born than go a step nigher to the bulls  but jason had set his heart steadfastly on getting the golden fleece and i positively doubt whether he would have gone back without it even had he been certain of finding himself turned into a redhot cinder or a handful of white ashes the instant he made a step farther he therefore let go medeas hand and walked boldly forward in the direction whither she had pointed at some distance before him he perceived four streams of fiery vapor regularly appearing and again vanishing after dimly lighting up the surrounding obscurity these you will understand were caused by the breath of the brazen bulls which was quietly stealing out of their four nostrils as they lay chewing their cuds  at the first two or three steps which jason made the four fiery streams appeared to gush out somewhat more plentifully for the two brazen bulls had heard his foottramp and were lifting up their hot noses to snuff the air he went a little farther and by the way in which the red vapor now spouted forth he judged that the creatures had got upon their feet now he could see glowing sparks and vivid jets of flame at the next step each of the bulls made the pasture echo with a terrible roar while the burning breath which they thus belched forth lit up the whole field with a momentary flash one other stride did bold jason make and suddenly as a streak of lightning on came these fiery animals roaring like thunder and sending out sheets of white flame which so kindled up the scene that the young man could discern every object more distinctly than by daylight most distinctly of all he saw the two horrible creatures galloping right down upon him their brazen hoofs rattling and ringing over the ground and their tails sticking up stiffly into the air as has always been the fashion with angry bulls their breath scorched the herbage before them so intensely hot it was indeed that it caught a dry tree under which jason was now standing and set it all in a light blaze but as for jason himself thanks to medeas enchanted ointment the white flame curled around his body without injuring him a jot more than if he had been made of asbestos  greatly encouraged at finding himself not yet turned into a cinder the young man awaited the attack of the bulls just as the brazen brutes fancied themselves sure of tossing him into the air he caught one of them by the horn and the other by his screwedup tail and held them in a gripe like that of an iron vise one with his right hand the other with his left well he must have been wonderfully strong in his arms to be sure but the secret of the matter was that the brazen bulls were enchanted creatures and that jason had broken the spell of their fiery fierceness by his bold way of handling them and ever since that time it has been the favorite method of brave men when danger assails them to do what they call taking the bull by the horns and to gripe him by the tail is pretty much the same thingthat is to throw aside fear and overcome the peril by despising it  it was now easy to yoke the bulls and to harness them to the plough which had lain rusting on the ground for a great many years gone by so long was it before anybody could be found capable of ploughing that piece of land jason i suppose had been taught how to draw a furrow by the good old chiron who perhaps used to allow himself to be harnessed to the plough at any rate our hero succeeded perfectly well in breaking up the greensward and by the time that the moon was a quarter of her journey up the sky the ploughed field lay before him a large tract of black earth ready to be sown with the dragons teeth so jason scattered them broadcast and harrowed them into the soil with a brushharrow and took his stand on the edge of the field anxious to see what would happen next  must we wait long for harvesttime he inquired of medea who was now standing by his side  whether sooner or later it will be sure to come answered the princess a crop of armed men never fails to spring up when the dragons teeth have been sown  the moon was now high aloft in the heavens and threw its bright beams over the ploughed field where as yet there was nothing to be seen any farmer on viewing it would have said that jason must wait weeks before the green blades would peep from among the clods and whole months before the yellow grain would be ripened for the sickle but by and by all over the field there was something that glistened in the moonbeams like sparkling drops of dew these bright objects sprouted higher and proved to be the steel heads of spears then there was a dazzling gleam from a vast number of polished brass helmets beneath which as they grew farther out of the soil appeared the dark and bearded visages of warriors struggling to free themselves from the imprisoning earth the first look that they gave at the upper world was a glare of wrath and defiance next were seen their bright breastplates in every right hand there was a sword or a spear and on each left arm a shield and when this strange crop of warriors had but half grown out of the earth they struggledsuch was their impatience of restraintand as it were tore themselves up by the roots wherever a dragons tooth had fallen there stood a man armed for battle they made a clangor with their swords against their shields and eyed one another fiercely for they had come into this beautiful world and into the peaceful moonlight full of rage and stormy passions and ready to take the life of every human brother in recompense of the boon of their own existence  there have been many other armies in the world that seemed to possess the same fierce nature with the one which had now sprouted from the dragons teeth but these in the moonlit field were the more excusable because they never had women for their mothers and how it would have rejoiced any great captain who was bent on conquering the world like alexander or napoleon to raise a crop of armed soldiers as easily as jason did  for a while the warriors stood flourishing their weapons clashing their swords against their shields and boiling over with the redhot thirst for battle then they began to shout show us the enemy lead us to the charge death or victory come on brave comrades conquer or die and a hundred other outcries such as men always bellow forth on a battlefield and which these dragon people seemed to have at their tongues ends at last the front rank caught sight of jason who beholding the flash of so many weapons in the moonlight had thought it best to draw his sword in a moment all the sons of the dragons teeth appeared to take jason for an enemy and crying with one voice guard the golden fleece they ran at him with uplifted swords and protruded spears jason knew that it would be impossible to withstand this bloodthirsty battalion with his single arm but determined since there was nothing better to be done to die as valiantly as if he himself had sprung from a dragons tooth  medea however bade him snatch up a stone from the ground  throw it among them quickly cried she it is the only way to save yourself  the armed men were now so nigh that jason could discern the fire flashing out of their enraged eyes when he let fly the stone and saw it strike the helmet of a tall warrior who was rushing upon him with his blade aloft the stone glanced from this mans helmet to the shield of his nearest comrade and thence flew right into the angry face of another hitting him smartly between the eyes each of the three who had been struck by the stone took it for granted that his next neighbor had given him a blow and instead of running any farther towards jason they began a fight among themselves the confusion spread through the host so that it seemed scarcely a moment before they were all hacking hewing and stabbing at one another lopping off arms heads and legs and doing such memorable deeds that jason was filled with immense admiration although at the same time he could not help laughing to behold these mighty men punishing each other for an offence which he himself had committed in an incredibly short space of time almost as short indeed as it had taken them to grow up all but one of the heroes of the dragons teeth were stretched lifeless on the field the last survivor the bravest and strongest of the whole had just force enough to wave his crimson sword over his head and give a shout of exultation crying victory victory immortal fame when he himself fell down and lay quietly among his slain brethren  and there was the end of the army that had sprouted from the dragons teeth that fierce and feverish fight was the only enjoyment which they had tasted on this beautiful earth  let them sleep in the bed of honor said the princess medea with a sly smile at jason the world will always have simpletons enough just like them fighting and dying for they know not what and fancying that posterity will take the trouble to put laurel wreaths on their rusty and battered helmets could you help smiling prince jason to see the selfconceit of that last fellow just as he tumbled down  it made me very sad answered jason gravely and to tell you the truth princess the golden fleece does not appear so well worth the winning after what i have here beheld  you will think differently in the morning said medea true the golden fleece may not be so valuable as you have thought it but then there is nothing better in the world and one must needs have an object you know come your nights work has been well performed and tomorrow you can inform king √Üetes that the first part of your allotted task is fulfilled  agreeably to medeas advice jason went betimes in the morning to the palace of king √Üetes entering the presencechamber he stood at the foot of the throne and made a low obeisance  your eyes look heavy prince jason observed the king you appear to have spent a sleepless night i hope you have been considering the matter a little more wisely and have concluded not to get yourself scorched to a cinder in attempting to tame my brazenlunged bulls  that is already accomplished may it please your majesty replied jason the bulls have been tamed and yoked the field has been ploughed the dragons teeth have been sown broadcast and harrowed into the soil the crop of armed warriors has sprung up and they have slain one another to the last man and now i solicit your majestys permission to encounter the dragon that i may take down the golden fleece from the tree and depart with my nineandforty comrades  king √Üetes scowled and looked very angry and excessively disturbed for he knew that in accordance with his kingly promise he ought now to permit jason to win the fleece if his courage and skill should enable him to do so but since the young man had met with such good luck in the matter of the brazen bulls and the dragons teeth the king feared that he would be equally successful in slaying the dragon and therefore though he would gladly have seen jason snapped up at a mouthful he was resolved and it was a very wrong thing of this wicked potentate not to run any further risk of losing his beloved fleece  you never would have succeeded in this business young man said he if my undutiful daughter medea had not helped you with her enchantments had you acted fairly you would have been at this instant a black cinder or a handful of white ashes i forbid you on pain of death to make any more attempts to get the golden fleece to speak my mind plainly you shall never set eyes on so much as one of its glistening locks  jason left the kings presence in great sorrow and anger he could think of nothing better to be done than to summon together his fortynine brave argonauts march at once to the grove of mars slay the dragon take possession of the golden fleece get on board the argo and spread all sail for iolchos the success of the scheme depended it is true on the doubtful point whether all the fifty heroes might not be snapped up at so many mouthfuls by the dragon but as jason was hastening down the palace steps the princess medea called after him and beckoned him to return her black eyes shone upon him with such a keen intelligence that he felt as if there were a serpent peeping out of them and although she had done him so much service only the night before he was by no means very certain that she would not do him an equally great mischief before sunset these enchantresses you must know are never to be depended upon  what says king √Üetes my royal and upright father inquired medea slightly smiling will he give you the golden fleece without any further risk or trouble  on the contrary answered jason he is very angry with me for taming the brazen bulls and sowing the dragons teeth and he forbids me to make any more attempts and positively refuses to give up the golden fleece whether i slay the dragon or no  yes jason said the princess and i can tell you more unless you set sail from colchis before tomorrows sunrise the king means to burn your fiftyoared galley and put yourself and your fortynine brave comrades to the sword but be of good courage the golden fleece you shall have if it lies within the power of my enchantments to get it for you wait for me here an hour before midnight  at the appointed hour you might again have seen prince jason and the princess medea side by side stealing through the streets of colchis on their way to the sacred grove in the centre of which the golden fleece was suspended to a tree while they were crossing the pastureground the brazen bulls came towards jason lowing nodding their heads and thrusting forth their snouts which as other cattle do they loved to have rubbed and caressed by a friendly hand their fierce nature was thoroughly tamed and with their fierceness the two furnaces in their stomachs had likewise been extinguished insomuch that they probably enjoyed far more comfort in grazing and chewing their cuds than ever before indeed it had heretofore been a great inconvenience to these poor animals that whenever they wished to eat a mouthful of grass the fire out of their nostrils had shrivelled it up before they could manage to crop it how they contrived to keep themselves alive is more than i can imagine but now instead of emitting jets of flame and streams of sulphurous vapor they breathed the very sweetest of cow breath  after kindly patting the bulls jason followed medeas guidance into the grove of mars where the great oaktrees that had been growing for centuries threw so thick a shade that the moonbeams struggled vainly to find their way through it only here and there a glimmer fell upon the leafstrewn earth or now and then a breeze stirred the boughs aside and gave jason a glimpse of the sky lest in that deep obscurity he might forget that there was one overhead at length when they had gone farther and farther into the heart of the duskiness medea squeezed jasons hand  look yonder she whispered do you see it  gleaming among the venerable oaks there was a radiance not like the moonbeams but rather resembling the golden glory of the setting sun it proceeded from an object which appeared to be suspended at about a mans height from the ground a little farther within the wood  what is it asked jason  have you come so far to seek it exclaimed medea and do you not recognize the meed of all your toils and perils when it glitters before your eyes it is the golden fleece  jason went onward a few steps farther and then stopped to gaze oh how beautiful it looked shining with a marvellous light of its own that inestimable prize which so many heroes had longed to behold but had perished in the quest of it either by the perils of their voyage or by the fiery breath of the brazenlunged bulls  how gloriously it shines cried jason in a rapture it has surely been dipped in the richest gold of sunset let me hasten onward and take it to my bosom  stay said medea holding him back have you forgotten what guards it  to say the truth in the joy of beholding the object of his desires the terrible dragon had quite slipped out of jasons memory soon however something came to pass that reminded him what perils were still to be encountered an antelope that probably mistook the yellow radiance for sunrise came bounding fleetly through the grove he was rushing straight towards the golden fleece when suddenly there was a frightful hiss and the immense head and half of the scaly body of the dragon was thrust forth for he was twisted round the trunk of the tree on which the fleece hung and seizing the poor antelope swallowed him with one snap of his jaws  after this feat the dragon seemed sensible that some other living creature was within reach on which he felt inclined to finish his meal in various directions he kept poking his ugly snout among the trees stretching out his neck a terrible long way now here now there and now close to the spot where jason and the princess were hiding behind an oak upon my word as the head came waving and undulating through the air and reaching almost within armslength of prince jason it was a very hideous and uncomfortable sight the gape of his enormous jaws was nearly as wide as the gateway of the kings palace  well jason whispered medea for she was illnatured as all enchantresses are and wanted to make the bold youth tremble what do you think now of your prospect of winning the golden fleece  jason answered only by drawing his sword and making a step forward  stay foolish youth said medea grasping his arm do not you see you are lost without me as your good angel in this gold box i have a magic potion which will do the dragons business far more effectually than your sword  the dragon had probably heard the voices for swift as lightning his black head and forked tongue came hissing among the trees again darting full forty feet at a stretch as it approached medea tossed the contents of the gold box right down the monsters wide open throat immediately with an outrageous hiss and a tremendous wriggleflinging his tail up to the tiptop of the tallest tree and shattering all its branches as it crashed heavily down againthe dragon fell at full length upon the ground and lay quite motionless  it is only a sleeping potion said the enchantress to prince jason one always finds a use for these mischievous creatures sooner or later so i did not wish to kill him outright quick snatch the prize and let us begone you have won the golden fleece  jason caught the fleece from the tree and hurried through the grove the deep shadows of which were illuminated as he passed by the golden glory of the precious object that he bore along a little way before him he beheld the old woman whom he had helped over the stream with her peacock beside her she clapped her hands for joy and beckoning him to make haste disappeared among the duskiness of the trees espying the two winged sons of the north wind who were disporting themselves in the moonlight a few hundred feet aloft jason bade them tell the rest of the argonauts to embark as speedily as possible but lynceus with his sharp eyes had already caught a glimpse of him bringing the golden fleece although several stonewalls a hill and the black shadows of the grove of mars intervened between by his advice the heroes had seated themselves on the benches of the galley with their oars held perpendicularly ready to let fall into the water  as jason drew near he heard the talking image calling to him with more than ordinary eagerness in its grave sweet voice  make haste prince jason for your life make haste  with one hound he leaped aboard at sight of the glorious radiance of the golden fleece the nineandforty heroes gave a mighty shout and orpheus striking his harp sang a song of triumph to the cadence of which the galley flew over the water homeward bound as if careering along with wings
