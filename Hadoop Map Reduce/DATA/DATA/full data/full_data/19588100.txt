19588100	henry james jr  by  william dean howells    the events of mr jamess lifeas we agree to understand eventsmay be told in a very few words  his race is irish on his fathers side and scotch on his mothers to which mingled strains the generalizer may attribute if he likes that union of vivid expression and dispassionate analysis which has characterized his work from the first there are none of those early struggles with poverty which render the lives of so many distinguished americans monotonous reading to record in his case  the cabin hearthfire did not light him to the youthful pursuit of literature he had from the start all those advantages which when they go too far become limitations  he was born in new york city in the year 1843 and his first lessons in life and letters were the best which the metropolisso small in the perspective diminishing to that datecould afford  in his twelfth year his family went abroad and after some stay in england made a long sojourn in france and switzerland  they returned to america in 1860 placing themselves at newport and for a year or two mr james was at the harvard law school where perhaps he did not study a great deal of law  his father removed from newport to cambridge in 1866 and there mr james remained till he went abroad three years later for the residence in england and italy which with infrequent visits home has continued ever since  it was during these three years of his cambridge life that i became acquainted with his work  he had already printed a talethe story of a yearin the atlantic monthly when i was asked to be mr fieldss assistant in the management and it was my fortune to read mr jamess second contribution in manuscript  would you take it asked my chief  yes and all the stories you can get from the writer  one is much securer of ones judgment at twentynine than say at fortyfive but if this was a mistake of mine i am not yet old enough to regret it the story was called poor richard and it dealt with the conscience of a man very much in love with a woman who loved his rival  he told this rival a lie which sent him away to his death on the fieldin that day nearly every fictitious personage had something to do with the warbut poor richards lie did not win him his love  it still seems to me that the situation was strongly and finely felt  ones pity went as it should with the liar but the whole story had a pathos which lingers in my mind equally with a sense of the new literary qualities which gave me such delight in it  i admired as we must in all that mr james has written the finished workmanship in which there is no loss of vigor the luminous and uncommon use of words the originality of phrase the whole clear and beautiful style which i confess i weakly liked the better for the occasional gallicisms remaining from an inveterate habit of french  those who know the writings of mr henry james will recognize the inherited felicity of diction which is so striking in the writings of mr henry james jr the sons diction is not so racy as the fathers it lacks its daring but it is as fortunate and graphic and i cannot give it greater praise than this though it has when he will a splendor and state which is wholly its own  mr james is now so universally recognized that i shall seem to be making an unwarrantable claim when i express my belief that the popularity of his stories was once largely confined to mr fields assistant  they had characteristics which forbade any editor to refuse them and there are no anecdotes of thricerejected manuscripts finally printed to tell of him his work was at once successful with all the magazines  but with the readers of the atlantic of harpers of lippincotts of the galaxy of the century it was another affair  the flavor was so strange that with rare exceptions they had to learn to like it  probably few writers have in the same degree compelled the liking of their readers  he was reluctantly accepted partly through a mistake as to his attitudethrough the confusion of his point of view with his private opinionin the readers mind  this confusion caused the tears of rage which bedewed our continent in behalf of the average american girl supposed to be satirized in daisy miller and prevented the perception of the fact that so far as the average american girl was studied at all in daisy miller her indestructible innocence her invulnerable newworldliness had never been so delicately appreciated  it was so plain that mr james disliked her vulgar conditions that the very people to whom he revealed her essential sweetness and light were furious that he should have seemed not to see what existed through him  in other words they would have liked him better if he had been a worse artistif he had been a little more confidential  but that artistic impartiality which puzzled so many in the treatment of daisy miller is one of the qualities most valuable in the eyes of those who care how things are done and i am not sure that it is not mr jamess most characteristic quality  as frost performs the effect of fire this impartiality comes at last to the same result as sympathy  we may be quite sure that mr james does not like the peculiar phase of our civilization typified in henrietta stackpole but he treats her with such exquisite justice that he lets us like her  it is an extreme case but i confidently allege it in proof  his impartiality is part of the reserve with which he works in most respects and which at first glance makes us say that he is wanting in humor  but i feel pretty certain that mr james has not been able to disinherit himself to this degree  we americans are terribly in earnest about making ourselves individually and collectively but i fancy that our prevailing mood in the face of all problems is that of an abiding faith which can afford to be funny  he has himself indicated that we have as a nation as a people our joke and every one of us is in the joke more or less  we may some of us dislike it extremely disapprove it wholly and even abhor it but we are in the joke all the same and no one of us is safe from becoming the great american humorist at any given moment  the danger is not apparent in mr jamess case and i confess that i read him with a relief in the comparative immunity that he affords from the national facetiousness many of his people are humorously imagined or rather humorously seen like daisy millers mother but these do not give a dominant color the business in hand is commonly serious and the droll people are subordinated  they abound nevertheless and many of them are perfectly new finds like mr tristram in the american the billpaying father in the pension beaurepas the anxiously europeanizing mother in the same story the amusing little madame de belgarde henrietta stackpole and even newman himself  but though mr james portrays the humorous in character he is decidedly not on humorous terms with his reader he ignores rather than recognizes the fact that they are both in the joke  if we take him at all we must take him on his own ground for clearly he will not come to ours  we must make concessions to him not in this respect only but in several others chief among which is the motive for reading fiction  by example at least he teaches that it is the pursuit and not the end which should give us pleasure for he often prefers to leave us to our own conjectures in regard to the fate of the people in whom he has interested us  there is no question of course but he could tell the story of isabel in the portrait of a lady to the end yet he does not tell it  we must agree then to take what seems a fragment instead of a whole and to find when we can a name for this new kind in fiction  evidently it is the character not the fate of his people which occupies him when he has fully developed their character he leaves them to what destiny the reader pleases  the analytic tendency seems to have increased with him as his work has gone on  some of the earlier tales were very dramatic a passionate pilgrim which i should rank above all his other short stories and for certain rich poetical qualities above everything else that he has done is eminently dramatic  but i do not find much that i should call dramatic in the portrait of a lady while i do find in it an amount of analysis which i should call superabundance if it were not all such good literature  the novelists main business is to possess his reader with a due conception of his characters and the situations in which they find themselves  if he does more or less than this he equally fails  i have sometimes thought that mr jamess danger was to do more but when i have been ready to declare this excess an error of his method i have hesitated  could anything be superfluous that had given me so much pleasure as i read  certainly from only one point of view and this a rather narrow technical one  it seems to me that an enlightened criticism will recognize in mr jamess fiction a metaphysical genius working to aesthetic results and will not be disposed to deny it any method it chooses to employ  no other novelist except george eliot has dealt so largely in analysis of motive has so fully explained and commented upon the springs of action in the persons of the drama both before and after the facts  these novelists are more alike than any others in their processes but with george eliot an ethical purpose is dominant and with mr james an artistic purpose  i do not know just how it should be stated of two such noble and generous types of character as dorothea and isabel archer but i think that we sympathize with the former in grand aims that chiefly concern others and with the latter in beautiful dreams that primarily concern herself  both are unselfish and devoted women sublimely true to a mistaken ideal in their marriages but though they come to this common martyrdom the original difference in them remains isabel has her great weaknesses as dorothea had but these seem to me on the whole the most nobly imagined and the most nobly intentioned women in modern fiction and i think isabel is the more subtly divined of the two  if we speak of mere characterization we must not fail to acknowledge the perfection of gilbert osmond  it was a profound stroke to make him an american by birth  no european could realize so fully in his own life the ideal of a european dilettante in all the meaning of that cheapened word as no european could so deeply and tenderly feel the sweetness and loveliness of the english past as the sick american searle in the passionate pilgrim  what is called the international novel is popularly dated from the publication of daisy miller though roderick hudson and the american had gone before but it really began in the beautiful story which i have just named  mr james who invented this species in fiction first contrasted in the passionate pilgrim the new world and old world moods ideals and prejudices and he did it there with a richness of poetic effect which he has since never equalled  i own that i regret the loss of the poetry but you cannot ask a man to keep on being a poet for you it is hardly for him to choose yet i compare rather discontentedly in my own mind such impassioned creations as searle and the painter in the madonna of the future with daisy miller of whose slight thin personality i also feel the indefinable charm and of the tragedy of whose innocence i recognize the delicate pathos  looking back to those early stories where mr james stood at the dividing ways of the novel and the romance i am sometimes sorry that he declared even superficially for the former  his best efforts seem to me those of romance his best types have an ideal development like isabel and claire belgarde and bessy alden and poor daisy and even newman  but doubtless he has chosen wisely perhaps the romance is an outworn form and would not lend itself to the reproduction of even the ideality of modern life  i myself waver somewhat in my preferenceif it is a preferencewhen i think of such people as lord warburton and the touchetts whom i take to be all decidedly of this world  the first of these especially interested me as a probable type of the english nobleman who amiably accepts the existing situation with all its possibilities of political and social change and insists not at all upon the surviving feudalities but means to be a manly and simple gentleman in any event  an american is not able to pronounce as to the verity of the type i only know that it seems probable and that it is charming  it makes one wish that it were in mr jamess way to paint in some story the present phase of change in england  a titled personage is still mainly an inconceivable being to us he is like a goblin or a fairy in a storybook  how does he comport himself in the face of all the changes and modifications that have taken place and that still impend  we can hardly imagine a lord taking his nobility seriously it is some hint of the conditional frame of lord warburtons mind that makes him imaginable and delightful to us  it is not my purpose here to review any of mr jamess books i like better to speak of his people than of the conduct of his novels and i wish to recognize the fineness with which he has touchedin the pretty primness of osmonds daughter and the mild devotedness of mr rosier a masterly hand is as often manifest in the treatment of such subordinate figures as in that of the principal persons and mr james does them unerringly  this is felt in the more important character of valentin belgarde a fascinating character in spite of its defectsperhaps on account of themand a sort of french lord warburton but wittier and not so good  these are my ideas says his sisterinlaw at the end of a number of inanities  ah you call them ideas he returns which is delicious and makes you love him he too has his moments of misgiving apparently in regard to his nobility and his acceptance of newman on the basis of something like manhood suffrage is very charming  it is of course difficult for a remote plebeian to verify the pictures of legitimist society in the american but there is the probable suggestion in them of conditions and principles and want of principles of which we get glimpses in our travels abroad at any rate they reveal another and not impossible world and it is fine to have newman discover that the opinions and criticisms of our world are so absolutely valueless in that sphere that his knowledge of the infamous crime of the mother and brother of his betrothed will have no effect whatever upon them in their own circle if he explodes it there  this seems like aristocracy indeed and one admires almost respects its survival in our day  but i always regretted that newmans discovery seemed the precursor of his magnanimous resolution not to avenge himself it weakened the effect of this with which it had really nothing to do  upon the whole however newman is an adequate and satisfying representative of americanism with his generous matrimonial ambition his vast goodnature and his thorough good sense and right feeling  we must be very hard to please if we are not pleased with him  he is not the cultivated american who redeems us from time to time in the eyes of europe but he is unquestionably more national and it is observable that his unaffected fellowcountrymen and women fare very well at mr jamess hand always it is the europeanizing sort like the critical little bostonian in the bundle of letters the ladies shocked at daisy miller the mother in the pension beaurepas who goes about trying to be of the native world everywhere madame merle and gilbert osmond miss light and her mother who have reason to complain if any one has  doubtless mr james does not mean to satirize such americans but it is interesting to note how they strike such a keen observer  we are certainly not allowed to like them and the other sort find somehow a place in our affections along with his good europeans  it is a little odd by the way that in all the printed talk about mr jamesand there has been no end of ithis power of engaging your preference for certain of his people has been so little commented on  perhaps it is because he makes no obvious appeal for them but one likes such men as lord warburton newman valentin the artistic brother in the europeans and ralph touchett and such women as isabel claire belgarde mrs tristram and certain others with a thoroughness that is one of the best testimonies to their vitality  this comes about through their own qualities and is not affected by insinuation or by downright petting such as we find in dickens nearly always and in thackeray too often  the art of fiction has in fact become a finer art in our day than it was with dickens and thackeray  we could not suffer the confidential attitude of the latter now nor the mannerism of the former any more than we could endure the prolixity of richardson or the coarseness of fielding  these great men are of the pastthey and their methods and interests even trollope and reade are not of the present  the new school derives from hawthorne and george eliot rather than any others but it studies human nature much more in its wonted aspects and finds its ethical and dramatic examples in the operation of lighter but not really less vital motives  the moving accident is certainly not its trade and it prefers to avoid all manner of dire catastrophes  it is largely influenced by french fiction in form but it is the realism of daudet rather than the realism of zola that prevails with it and it has a soul of its own which is above the business of recording the rather brutish pursuit of a woman by a man which seems to be the chief end of the french novelist  this school which is so largely of the future as well as the present finds its chief exemplar in mr james it is he who is shaping and directing american fiction at least  it is the ambition of the younger contributors to write like him he has his following more distinctly recognizable than that of any other englishwriting novelist  whether he will so far control this following as to decide the nature of the novel with us remains to be seen  will the reader be content to accept a novel which is an analytic study rather than a story which is apt to leave him arbiter of the destiny of the authors creations  will he find his account in the unflagging interest of their development  mr jamess growing popularity seems to suggest that this may be the case but the work of mr jamess imitators will have much to do with the final result  in the meantime it is not surprising that he has his imitators whatever exceptions we take to his methods or his results we cannot deny him a very great literary genius  to me there is a perpetual delight in his way of saying things and i cannot wonder that younger men try to catch the trick of it  the disappointing thing for them is that it is not a trick but an inherent virtue  his style is upon the whole better than that of any other novelist i know it is always easy without being trivial and it is often stately without being stiff it gives a charm to everything he writes and he has written so much and in such various directions that we should be judging him very incompletely if we considered him only as a novelist  his book of european sketches must rank him with the most enlightened and agreeable travelers and it might be fitly supplemented from his uncollected papers with a volume of american sketches  in his essays on modern french writers he indicates his critical range and grasp but he scarcely does more as his criticisms in the atlantic and the nation and elsewhere could abundantly testify  there are indeed those who insist that criticism is his true vocation and are impatient of his devotion to fiction but i suspect that these admirers are mistaken  a novelists he is not after the old fashion or after any fashion but his own yet since he has finally made his public in his own way of storytellingor call it characterpainting if you preferit must be conceded that he has chosen best for himself and his readers in choosing the form of fiction for what he has to say it is after all what a writer has to say rather than what he has to tell that we care for nowadays  in one manner or other the stories were all told long ago and now we want merely to know what the novelist thinks about persons and situations  mr james gratifies this philosophic desire  if he sometimes forbears to tell us what he thinks of the last state of his people it is perhaps because that does not interest him and a largeminded criticism might well insist that it was childish to demand that it must interest him  i am not sure that any criticism is sufficiently largeminded for this i own that i like a finished story but then also i like those which mr james seems not to finish  this is probably the position of most of his readers who cannot very logically account for either preference  we can only make sure that we have here an annalist or analyst as we choose who fascinates us from his first page to his last whose narrative or whose comment may enter into any minuteness of detail without fatiguing us and can only truly grieve us when it ceases
