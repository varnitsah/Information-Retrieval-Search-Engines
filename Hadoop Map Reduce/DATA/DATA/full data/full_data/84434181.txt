series  the external incidents which direct its course are mostly an unexaggerated reproduction of the recollections of old persons well known to the author in childhood but now long dead who were eyewitnesses of those scenes  if wholly transcribed their recollections would have filled a volume thrice the length of the trumpetmajor  down to the middle of this century and later there were not wanting in the neighbourhood of the places more or less clearly indicated herein casual relics of the circumstances amid which the action movesour preparations for defence against the threatened invasion of england by buonaparte  an outhouse door riddled with bulletholes which had been extemporized by a solitary man as a target for firelock practice when the landing was hourly expected a heap of bricks and clods on a beaconhill which had formed the chimney and walls of the hut occupied by the beacon keeper wormeaten shafts and iron heads of pikes for the use of those who had no better weapons ridges on the down thrown up during the encampment fragments of volunteer uniform and other such lingering remains brought to my imagination in early childhood the state of affairs at the date of the war more vividly than volumes of history could have done  those who have attempted to construct a coherent narrative of past times from the fragmentary information furnished by survivors are aware of the difficulty of ascertaining the true sequence of events indiscriminately recalled  for this purpose the newspapers of the date were indispensable  of other documents consulted i may mention for the satisfaction of those who love a true story that the address to all ranks and descriptions of englishmen was transcribed from an original copy in a local museum that the hieroglyphic portrait of napoleon existed as a print down to the present day in an old womans cottage near overcombe that the particulars of the kings doings at his favourite wateringplace were augmented by details from records of the time  the drilling scene of the local militia received some additions from an account given in so grave a work as giffords history of the wars of the french revolution london 1817  but on reference to the history i find i was mistaken in supposing the account to be advanced as authentic or to refer to rural england  however it does in a large degree accord with the local traditions of such scenes that i have heard recounted times without number and the system of drill was tested by reference to the army regulations of 1801 and other military handbooks  almost the whole narrative of the supposed landing of the french in the bay is from oral relation as aforesaid  other proofs of the veracity of this chronicle have escaped my recollection  t h  october 1895     i  what was seen from the window overlooking the down   in the days of highwaisted and muslingowned women when the vast amount of soldiering going on in the country was a cause of much trembling to the sex there lived in a village near the wessex coast two ladies of good report though unfortunately of limited means  the elder was a mrs martha garland a landscapepainters widow and the other was her only daughter anne  anne was fair very fair in a poetical sense but in complexion she was of that particular tint between blonde and brunette which is inconveniently left without a name  her eyes were honest and inquiring her mouth cleanly cut and yet not classical the middle point of her upper lip scarcely descending so far as it should have done by rights so that at the merest pleasant thought not to mention a smile portions of two or three white teeth were uncovered whether she would or not  some people said that this was very attractive  she was graceful and slender and though but little above five feet in height could draw herself up to look tall  in her manner in her comings and goings in her ill do this or ill do that she combined dignity with sweetness as no other girl could do and any impressionable stranger youths who passed by were led to yearn for a windfall of speech from her and to see at the same time that they would not get it  in short beneath all that was charming and simple in this young woman there lurked a real firmness unperceived at first as the speck of colour lurks unperceived in the heart of the palest parsley flower  she wore a white handkerchief to cover her white neck and a cap on her head with a pink ribbon round it tied in a bow at the front  she had a great variety of these capribbons the young men being fond of sending them to her as presents until they fell definitely in love with a special sweetheart elsewhere when they left off doing so  between the border of her cap and her forehead were ranged a row of round brown curls like swallows nests under eaves  she lived with her widowed mother in a portion of an ancient building formerly a manorhouse but now a mill which being too large for his own requirements the miller had found it convenient to divide and appropriate in part to these highly respectable tenants  in this dwelling mrs garlands and annes ears were soothed morning noon and night by the music of the mill the wheels and cogs of which being of wood produced notes that might have borne in their minds a remote resemblance to the wooden tones of the stopped diapason in an organ occasionally when the miller was bolting there was added to these continuous sounds the cheerful clicking of the hopper which did not deprive them of rest except when it was kept going all night and over and above all this they had the pleasure of knowing that there crept in through every crevice door and window of their dwelling however tightly closed a subtle mist of superfine flour from the grinding room quite invisible but making its presence known in the course of time by giving a pallid and ghostly look to the best furniture  the miller frequently apologized to his tenants for the intrusion of this insidious dry fog but the widow was of a friendly and thankful nature and she said that she did not mind it at all being as it was not nasty dirt but the blessed staff of life  by goodhumour of this sort and in other ways mrs garland acknowledged her friendship for her neighbour with whom anne and herself associated to an extent which she never could have anticipated when tempted by the lowness of the rent they first removed thither after her husbands death from a larger house at the other end of the village  those who have lived in remote places where there is what is called no society will comprehend the gradual levelling of distinctions that went on in this case at some sacrifice of gentility on the part of one household  the widow was sometimes sorry to find with what readiness anne caught up some dialectword or accent from the miller and his friends but he was so good and truehearted a man and she so easyminded unambitious a woman that she would not make life a solitude for fastidious reasons  more than all she had good ground for thinking that the miller secretly admired her and this added a piquancy to the situation        on a fine summer morning when the leaves were warm under the sun and the more industrious bees abroad diving into every blue and red cup that could possibly be considered a flower anne was sitting at the back window of her mothers portion of the house measuring out lengths of worsted for a fringed rug that she was making which lay about three quarters finished beside her  the work though chromatically brilliant was tedious a hearthrug was a thing which nobody worked at from morning to night it was taken up and put down it was in the chair on the floor across the handrail under the bed kicked here kicked there rolled away in the closet brought out again and so on more capriciously perhaps than any other homemade article  nobody was expected to finish a rug within a calculable period and the wools of the beginning became faded and historical before the end was reached  a sense of this inherent nature of worstedwork rather than idleness led anne to look rather frequently from the open casement  immediately before her was the large smooth millpond overfull and intruding into the hedge and into the road  the water with its flowing leaves and spots of froth was stealing away like time under the dark arch to tumble over the great slimy wheel within  on the other side of the millpond was an open place called the cross because it was three quarters of one two lanes and a cattledrive meeting there  it was the general rendezvous and arena of the surrounding village  behind this a steep slope rose high into the sky merging in a wide and open down now littered with sheep newly shorn  the upland by its height completely sheltered the mill and village from north winds making summers of springs reducing winters to autumn temperatures and permitting myrtle to flourish in the open air  the heaviness of noon pervaded the scene and under its influence the sheep had ceased to feed  nobody was standing at the cross the few inhabitants being indoors at their dinner  no human being was on the down and no human eye or interest but annes seemed to be concerned with it  the bees still worked on and the butterflies did not rest from roving their smallness seeming to shield them from the stagnating effect that this turning moment of day had on larger creatures  otherwise all was still  the girl glanced at the down and the sheep for no particular reason the steep margin of turf and daisies rising above the roofs chimneys apple trees and church tower of the hamlet around her bounded the view from her position and it was necessary to look somewhere when she raised her head  while thus engaged in working and stopping her attention was attracted by the sudden rising and running away of the sheep squatted on the down and there succeeded sounds of a heavy tramping over the hard sod which the sheep had quitted the tramp being accompanied by a metallic jingle  turning her eyes further she beheld two cavalry soldiers on bulky grey chargers armed and accoutred throughout ascending the down at a point to the left where the incline was comparatively easy  the burnished chains buckles and plates of their trappings shone like little lookingglasses and the blue red and white about them was unsubdued by weather or wear  the two troopers rode proudly on as if nothing less than crowns and empires ever concerned their magnificent minds  they reached that part of the down which lay just in front of her where they came to a halt  in another minute there appeared behind them a group containing some half dozen more of the same sort  these came on halted and dismounted likewise  two of the soldiers then walked some distance onward together when one stood still the other advancing further and stretching a white line of tape between them  two more of the men marched to another outlying point where they made marks in the ground  thus they walked about and took distances obviously according to some preconcerted scheme  at the end of this systematic proceeding one solitary horsemana commissioned officer if his uniform could be judged rightly at that distancerode up the down went over the ground looked at what the others had done and seemed to think that it was good  and then the girl heard yet louder tramps and clankings and she beheld rising from where the others had risen a whole column of cavalry in marching order  at a distance behind these came a cloud of dust enveloping more and more troops their arms and accoutrements reflecting the sun through the haze in faint flashes stars and streaks of light  the whole body approached slowly towards the plateau at the top of the down  anne threw down her work and letting her eyes remain on the nearing masses of cavalry the worsteds getting entangled as they would said mother mother come here  heres such a fine sight  what does it mean  what can they be going to do up there  the mother thus invoked ran upstairs and came forward to the window  she was a woman of sanguine mouth and eye unheroic manner and pleasant general appearance a little more tarnished as to surface but not much worse in contour than the girl herself  widow garlands thoughts were those of the period can it be the french she said arranging herself for the extremest form of consternation  can that archenemy of mankind have landed at last  it should be stated that at this time there were two archenemies of mankindsatan as usual and buonaparte who had sprung up and eclipsed his elder rival altogether  mrs garland alluded of course to the junior gentleman  it cannot be he said anne  ah theres simon burden the man who watches at the beacon  hell know  she waved her hand to an aged form of the same colour as the road who had just appeared beyond the millpond and who though active was bowed to that degree which almost reproaches a feeling observer for standing upright  the arrival of the soldiery had drawn him out from his drop of drink at the duke of york as it had attracted anne  at her call he crossed the millbridge and came towards the window  anne inquired of him what it all meant but simon burden without answering continued to move on with parted gums staring at the cavalry on his own private account with a concern that people often show about temporal phenomena when such matters can affect them but a short time longer  youll walk into the millpond said anne  what are they doing  you were a soldier many years ago and ought to know  dont ask me misess anne said the military relic depositing his body against the wall one limb at a time  i were only in the foot ye know and never had a clear understanding of horses  ay i be a old man and of no judgment now  some additional pressure however caused him to search further in his wormeaten magazine of ideas and he found that he did know in a dim irresponsible way  the soldiers must have come there to camp those men they had seen first were the markers they had come on before the rest to measure out the ground  he who had accompanied them was the quartermaster  and so you see they have got all the lines marked out by the time the regiment have come up he added  and then they willwelladeary whod ha supposed that overcombe would see such a day as this  and then they will  then ah its gone from me again said simon  o and then they will raise their tents you know and picket their horses  that was it so it was  by this time the column of horse had ascended into full view and they formed a lively spectacle as they rode along the high ground in marching order backed by the pale blue sky and lit by the southerly sun  their uniform was bright and attractive white buckskin pantaloons threequarter boots scarlet shakos set off with lace mustachios waxed to a needle point and above all those richly ornamented blue jackets mantled with the historic pelissethat fascination to women and encumbrance to the wearers themselves  tis the york hussars said simon burden brightening like a dying ember fanned  foreigners to a man and enrolled long since my time  but as good hearty comrades they say as youll find in the kings service  here are more and different ones said mrs garland  other troops had during the last few minutes been ascending the down at a remoter point and now drew near  these were of different weight and build from the others lighter men in helmet hats with white plumes  i dont know which i like best said anne  these i think after all  simon who had been looking hard at the latter now said that they were the th dragoons  all englishmen they said the old man  they lay at budmouth barracks a few years ago  they did  i remember it said mrs garland  and lots of the chaps about here listed at the time said simon  i can call to mind that there wasah tis gone from me again  however all thats of little account now  the dragoons passed in front of the lookerson as the others had done and their gay plumes which had hung lazily during the ascent swung to northward as they reached the top showing that on the summit a fresh breeze blew  but look across there said anne  there had entered upon the down from another direction several battalions of foot in white kerseymere breeches and cloth gaiters  they seemed to be weary from a long march the original black of their gaiters and boots being whity brown with dust  presently came regimental waggons and the private canteen carts which followed at the end of a convoy  the space in front of the millpond was now occupied by nearly all the inhabitants of the village who had turned out in alarm and remained for pleasure their eyes lighted up with interest in what they saw for trappings and regimentals war horses and men in towns an attraction were here almost a sublimity  the troops filed to their lines dismounted and in quick time took off their accoutrements rolled up their sheepskins picketed and unbitted their horses and made ready to erect the tents as soon as they could be taken from the waggons and brought forward  when this was done at a given signal the canvases flew up from the sod and thenceforth every man had a place in which to lay his head  though nobody seemed to be looking on but the few at the window and in the village street there were as a matter of fact many eyes converging upon that military arrival in its high and conspicuous position not to mention the glances of birds and other wild creatures  men in distant gardens women in orchards and at cottagedoors shepherds on remote hills turniphoers in bluegreen enclosures miles away captains with spyglasses out at sea were regarding the picture keenly  those three or four thousand men of one machinelike movement some of them swashbucklers by nature others doubtless of a quiet shopkeeping disposition who had inadvertently got into uniformall of them had arrived from nobody knew where and hence were matter of great curiosity they seemed to the mere eye to belong to a different order of beings from those who inhabited the valleys below  apparently unconscious and careless of what all the world was doing elsewhere they remained picturesquely engrossed in the business of making themselves a habitation on the isolated spot which they had chosen  mrs garland was of a festive and sanguine turn of mind a woman soon set up and soon set down and the coming of the regiments quite excited her she thought there was reason for putting on her best cap thought that perhaps there was not that she would hurry on the dinner and go out in the afternoon then that she would after all do nothing unusual nor show any silly excitements whatever since they were unbecoming in a mother and a widow  thus circumscribing her intentions till she was toned down to an ordinary person of forty mrs garland accompanied her daughter downstairs to dine saying presently we will call on miller loveday and hear what he thinks of it all     ii  somebody knocks and comes in   miller loveday was the representative of an ancient family of corngrinders whose history is lost in the mists of antiquity  his ancestral line was contemporaneous with that of de ros howard and de la zouche but owing to some trifling deficiency in the possessions of the house of loveday the individual names and intermarriages of its members were not recorded during the middle ages and thus their private lives in any given century were uncertain  but it was known that the family had formed matrimonial alliances with farmers not so very small and once with a gentlemantanner who had for many years purchased after their death the horses of the most aristocratic persons in the countyfiery steeds that earlier in their career had been valued at many hundred guineas  it was also ascertained that mr lovedays greatgrandparents had been eight in number and his greatgreatgrandparents sixteen every one of whom reached to years of discretion at every stage backwards his sires and gammers thus doubled and doubled till they became a vast body of gothic ladies and gentlemen of the rank known as ceorls or villeins full of importance to the country at large and ramifying throughout the unwritten history of england  his immediate father had greatly improved the value of their residence by building a new chimney and setting up an additional pair of millstones  overcombe mill presented at one end the appearance of a hardworked house slipping into the river and at the other of an idle genteel place half cloaked with creepers at this time of the year and having no visible connexion with flour  it had hips instead of gables giving it a round shouldered look four chimneys with no smoke coming out of them two zigzag cracks in the wall several open windows with a lookingglass here and there inside showing its warped back to the passerby snowy dimity curtains waving in the draught two mill doors one above the other the upper enabling a person to step out upon nothing at a height of ten feet from the ground a gaping arch vomiting the river and a lean longnosed fellow looking out from the mill doorway who was the hired grinder except when a bulging fifteen stone man occupied the same place namely the miller himself  behind the mill door and invisible to the mere wayfarer who did not visit the family were chalked addition and subtraction sums many of them originally done wrong and the figures half rubbed out and corrected noughts being turned into nines and ones into twos  these were the millers private calculations  there were also chalked in the same place rows and rows of strokes like open palings representing the calculations of the grinder who in his youthful ciphering studies had not gone so far as arabic figures  in the court in front were two wornout millstones made useful again by being let in level with the ground  here people stood to smoke and consider things in muddy weather and cats slept on the clean surfaces when it was hot  in the large stubbardtree at the corner of the garden was erected a pole of larch fir which the miller had bought with others at a sale of small timber in damers wood one christmas week  it rose from the upper boughs of the tree to about the height of a fishermans mast and on the top was a vane in the form of a sailor with his arm stretched out  when the sun shone upon this figure it could be seen that the greater part of his countenance was gone and the paint washed from his body so far as to reveal that he had been a soldier in red before he became a sailor in blue  the image had in fact been john one of our coming characters and was then turned into robert another of them  this revolving piece of statuary could not however be relied on as a vane owing to the neighbouring hill which formed variable currents in the wind  the leafy and quieter wing of the millhouse was the part occupied by mrs garland and her daughter who made up in summertime for the narrowness of their quarters by overflowing into the garden on stools and chairs  the parlour or diningroom had a stone floora fact which the widow sought to disguise by double carpeting lest the standing of anne and herself should be lowered in the public eye  here now the midday meal went lightly and mincingly on as it does where there is no greedy carnivorous man to keep the dishes about and was hanging on the close when somebody entered the passage as far as the chink of the parlour door and tapped  this proceeding was probably adopted to kindly avoid giving trouble to susan the neighbours pink daughter who helped at mrs garlands in the mornings but was at that moment particularly occupied in standing on the waterbutt and gazing at the soldiers with an inhaling position of the mouth and circular eyes  there was a flutter in the little diningroomthe sensitiveness of habitual solitude makes hearts beat for preternaturally small reasonsand a guessing as to who the visitor might be  it was some military gentleman from the camp perhaps  no that was impossible  it was the parson  no he would not come at dinnertime  it was the wellinformed man who travelled with drapery and the best birmingham earrings  not at all his time was not till thursday at three  before they could think further the visitor moved forward another step and the diners got a glimpse of him through the same friendly chink that had afforded him a view of the garland dinnertable  o  it is only loveday  this approximation to nobody was the miller above mentioned a hale man of fiftyfive or sixtyhale all through as many were in those days and not merely veneered with purple by exhilarating victuals and drinks though the latter were not at all despised by him  his face was indeed rather pale than otherwise for he had just come from the mill  it was capable of immense changes of expression mobility was its essence a roll of flesh forming a buttress to his nose on each side and a deep ravine lying between his lower lip and the tumulus represented by his chin  these fleshy lumps moved stealthily as if of their own accord whenever his fancy was tickled  his eyes having lighted on the tablecloth plates and viands he found himself in a position which had a sensible awkwardness for a modest man who always liked to enter only at seasonable times the presence of a girl of such pleasantly soft ways as anne garland she who could make apples seem like peaches and throw over her shillings the glamour of guineas when she paid him for flour  dinner is over neighbour loveday please come in said the widow seeing his case  the miller said something about coming in presently but anne pressed him to stay with a tender motion of her lip as it played on the verge of a solicitous smile without quite lapsing into oneher habitual manner when speaking  loveday took off his lowcrowned hat and advanced  he had not come about pigs or fowls this time  you have been looking out like the rest o us no doubt mrs garland at the mampus of soldiers that have come upon the down  well one of the horse regiments is the th dragoons my son johns regiment you know  the announcement though it interested them did not create such an effect as the father of john had seemed to anticipate but anne who liked to say pleasant things replied the dragoons looked nicer than the foot or the german cavalry either  they are a handsome body of men said the miller in a disinterested voice  faith i didnt know they were coming though it may be in the newspaper all the time  but old derriman keeps it so long that we never know things till they be in everybodys mouth  this derriman was a squireen living near who was chiefly distinguished in the present warlike time by having a nephew in the yeomanry  we were told that the yeomanry went along the turnpike road yesterday said anne and they say that they were a pretty sight and quite soldierly  ah wellthey be not regulars said miller loveday keeping back harsher criticism as uncalled for  but inflamed by the arrival of the dragoons which had been the exciting cause of his call his mind would not go to yeomanry  john has not been home these five years he said  and what rank does he hold now said the widow  hes trumpetmajor maam and a good musician  the miller who was a good father went on to explain that john had seen some service too  he had enlisted when the regiment was lying in this neighbourhood more than eleven years before which put his father out of temper with him as he had wished him to follow on at the mill  but as the lad had enlisted seriously and as he had often said that he would be a soldier the miller had thought that he would let jack take his chance in the profession of his choice  loveday had two sons and the second was now brought into the conversation by a remark of annes that neither of them seemed to care for the millers business  no said loveday in a less buoyant tone  robert you see must needs go to sea  he is much younger than his brother said mrs garland  about four years the miller told her  his soldier son was twoandthirty and bob was twentyeight  when bob returned from his present voyage he was to be persuaded to stay and assist as grinder in the mill and go to sea no more  a sailormiller said anne  o he knows as much about mill business as i do said loveday he was intended for it you know like john  but bless me he continued i am before my story  im come more particularly to ask you maam and you anne my honey if you will join me and a few friends at a leetle homely supper that i shall gie to please the chap now hes come  i can do no less than have a bit of a randy as the saying is now that hes here safe and sound  mrs garland wanted to catch her daughters eye she was in some doubt about her answer  but annes eye was not to be caught for she hated hints nods and calculations of any kind in matters which should be regulated by impulse and the matron replied if so be tis possible well be there  you will tell us the day  he would as soon as he had seen son john  twill be rather untidy you know owing to my having no womenfolks in the house and my man david is a poor dunderheaded feller for getting up a feast  poor chap his sight is bad thats true and hes very good at making the beds and oiling the legs of the chairs and other furniture or i should have got rid of him years ago  you should have a woman to attend to the house loveday said the widow  yes i should but  well tis a fine day neighbours  hark  i fancy i hear the noise of pots and pans up at the camp or my ears deceive me  poor fellows they must be hungry  good day tye maam and the miller went away  all that afternoon overcombe continued in a ferment of interest in the military investment which brought the excitement of an invasion without the strife  there were great discussions on the merits and appearance of the soldiery  the event opened up to the girls unbounded possibilities of adoring and being adored and to the young men an embarrassment of dashing acquaintances which quite superseded falling in love  thirteen of these lads incontinently stated within the space of a quarter of an hour that there was nothing in the world like going for a soldier  the young women stated little but perhaps thought the more though in justice they glanced round towards the encampment from the corners of their blue and brown eyes in the most demure and modest manner that could be desired  in the evening the village was lively with soldiers wives a tree full of starlings would not have rivalled the chatter that was going on  these ladies were very brilliantly dressed with more regard for colour than for material  purple red and blue bonnets were numerous with bunches of cocks feathers and one had on an arcadian hat of green sarcenet turned up in front to show her cap underneath  it had once belonged to an officers lady and was not so much stained except where the occasional storms of rain incidental to a military life had caused the green to run and stagnate in curious watermarks like peninsulas and islands  some of the prettiest of these butterfly wives had been fortunate enough to get lodgings in the cottages and were thus spared the necessity of living in huts and tents on the down  those who had not been so fortunate were not rendered more amiable by the success of their sistersinarms and called them names which brought forth retorts and rejoinders till the end of these alternative remarks seemed dependent upon the close of the day  one of these new arrivals who had a rosy nose and a slight thickness of voice which as anne said she couldnt help poor thing seemed to have seen so much of the world and to have been in so many campaigns that anne would have liked to take her into their own house so as to acquire some of that practical knowledge of the history of england which the lady possessed and which could not be got from books  but the narrowness of mrs garlands rooms absolutely forbade this and the houseless treasury of experience was obliged to look for quarters elsewhere  that night anne retired early to bed  the events of the day cheerful as they were in themselves had been unusual enough to give her a slight headache  before getting into bed she went to the window and lifted the white curtains that hung across it  the moon was shining though not as yet into the valley but just peeping above the ridge of the down where the white cones of the encampment were softly touched by its light  the quarterguard and foremost tents showed themselves prominently but the body of the camp the officers tents kitchens canteen and appurtenances in the rear were blotted out by the ground because of its height above her  she could discern the forms of one or two sentries moving to and fro across the disc of the moon at intervals  she could hear the frequent shuffling and tossing of the horses tied to the pickets and in the other direction the mileslong voice of the sea whispering a louder note at those points of its length where hampered in its ebb and flow by some jutting promontory or group of boulders  louder sounds suddenly broke this approach to silence they came from the camp of dragoons were taken up further to the right by the camp of the hanoverians and further on still by the body of infantry  it was tattoo  feeling no desire to sleep she listened yet longer looked at charless wain swinging over the church tower and the moon ascending higher and higher over the righthand streets of tents where instead of parade and bustle there was nothing going on but snores and dreams the tired soldiers lying by this time under their proper canvases radiating like spokes from the pole of each tent  at last anne gave up thinking and retired like the rest  the night wore on and except the occasional alls well of the sentries no voice was heard in the camp or in the village below     iii  the mill becomes an important centre of operations   the next morning miss garland awoke with an impression that something more than usual was going on and she recognized as soon as she could clearly reason that the proceedings whatever they might be lay not far away from her bedroom window  the sounds were chiefly those of pickaxes and shovels  anne got up and lifting the corner of the curtain about an inch peeped out  a number of soldiers were busily engaged in making a zigzag path down the incline from the camp to the riverhead at the back of the house and judging from the quantity of work already got through they must have begun very early  squads of men were working at several equidistant points in the proposed pathway and by the time that anne had dressed herself each section of the length had been connected with those above and below it so that a continuous and easy track was formed from the crest of the down to the bottom of the steep  the down rested on a bed of solid chalk and the surface exposed by the roadmakers formed a white ribbon serpenting from top to bottom  then the relays of working soldiers all disappeared and not long after a troop of dragoons in watering order rode forward at the top and began to wind down the new path  they came lower and closer and at last were immediately beneath her window gathering themselves up on the space by the millpond  a number of the horses entered it at the shallow part drinking and splashing and tossing about  perhaps as many as thirty half of them with riders on their backs were in the water at one time the thirsty animals drank stamped flounced and drank again letting the clear cool water dribble luxuriously from their mouths  miller loveday was looking on from over his garden hedge and many admiring villagers were gathered around  gazing up higher anne saw other troops descending by the new road from the camp those which had already been to the pond making room for these by withdrawing along the village lane and returning to the top by a circuitous route  suddenly the miller exclaimed as in fulfilment of expectation ah john my boy good morning  and the reply of morning father came from a wellmounted soldier near him who did not however form one of the watering party  anne could not see his face very clearly but she had no doubt that this was john loveday  there were tones in the voice which reminded her of old times those of her very infancy when johnny loveday had been top boy in the village school and had wanted to learn painting of her father  the deeps and shallows of the millpond being better known to him than to any other man in the camp he had apparently come down on that account and was cautioning some of the horsemen against riding too far in towards the millhead  since her childhood and his enlistment anne had seen him only once and then but casually when he was home on a short furlough  his figure was not much changed from what it had been but the many sunrises and sunsets which had passed since that day developing her from a comparative child to womanhood had abstracted some of his angularities reddened his skin and given him a foreign look  it was interesting to see what years of training and service had done for this man  few would have supposed that the white and the blue coats of miller and soldier covered the forms of father and son  before the last troop of dragoons rode off they were welcomed in a body by miller loveday who still stood in his outer garden this being a plot lying below the milltail and stretching to the waterside  it was just the time of year when cherries are ripe and hang in clusters under their dark leaves  while the troopers loitered on their horses and chatted to the miller across the stream he gathered bunches of the fruit and held them up over the garden hedge for the acceptance of anybody who would have them whereupon the soldiers rode into the water to where it had washed holes in the garden bank and reining their horses there caught the cherries in their foragecaps or received bunches of them on the ends of their switches with the dignified laugh that became martial men when stooping to slightly boyish amusement  it was a cheerful careless unpremeditated halfhour which returned like the scent of a flower to the memories of some of those who enjoyed it even at a distance of many years after when they lay wounded and weak in foreign lands  then dragoons and horses wheeled off as the others had done and troops of the german legion next came down and entered in panoramic procession the space below annes eyes as if on purpose to gratify her  these were notable by their mustachios and queues wound tightly with brown ribbon to the level of their broad shoulderblades  they were charmed as the others had been by the head and neck of miss garland in the little square window overlooking the scene of operations and saluted her with devoted foreign civility and in such overwhelming numbers that the modest girl suddenly withdrew herself into the room and had a private blush between the chest of drawers and the washingstand  when she came downstairs her mother said i have been thinking what i ought to wear to miller lovedays tonight  to miller lovedays said anne  yes  the party is tonight  he has been in here this morning to tell me that he has seen his son and they have fixed this evening  do you think we ought to go mother said anne slowly and looking at the smaller features of the windowflowers  why not said mrs garland  he will only have men there except ourselves will he  and shall we be right to go alone among em  anne had not recovered from the ardent gaze of the gallant york hussars whose voices reached her even now in converse with loveday  la anne how proud you are said widow garland  why isnt he our nearest neighbour and our landlord and dont he always fetch our faggots from the wood and keep us in vegetables for next to nothing  thats true said anne  well we cant be distant with the man  and if the enemy land next autumn as everybody says they will we shall have quite to depend upon the millers waggon and horses  hes our only friend  yes so he is said anne  and you had better go mother and ill stay at home  they will be all men and i dont like going  mrs garland reflected  well if you dont want to go i dont she said  perhaps as you are growing up it would be better to stay at home this time  your father was a professional man certainly  having spoken as a mother she sighed as a woman  why do you sigh mother  you are so prim and stiff about everything  very wellwell go  o noi am not sure that we ought  i did not promise and there will be no trouble in keeping away  anne apparently did not feel certain of her own opinion and instead of supporting or contradicting looked thoughtfully down and abstractedly brought her hands together on her bosom till her fingers met tip to tip  as the day advanced the young woman and her mother became aware that great preparations were in progress in the millers wing of the house the partitioning between the lovedays and the garlands was not very thorough consisting in many cases of a simple screwing up of the doors in the dividing walls and thus when the mill began any new performances they proclaimed themselves at once in the more private dwelling  the smell of miller lovedays pipe came down mrs garlands chimney of an evening with the greatest regularity  every time that he poked his fire they knew from the vehemence or deliberateness of the blows the precise state of his mind and when he wound his clock on sunday nights the whirr of that monitor reminded the widow to wind hers  this transit of noises was most perfect where lovedays lobby adjoined mrs garlands pantry and anne who was occupied for some time in the latter apartment enjoyed the privilege of hearing the visitors arrive and of catching stray sounds and words without the connecting phrases that made them entertaining to judge from the laughter they evoked  the arrivals passed through the house and went into the garden where they had tea in a large summerhouse an occasional blink of bright colour through the foliage being all that was visible of the assembly from mrs garlands windows when it grew dusk they all could be heard coming indoors to finish the evening in the parlour  then there was an intensified continuation of the abovementioned signs of enjoyment talkings and hawhaws runnings upstairs and runnings down a slamming of doors and a clinking of cups and glasses till the proudest adjoining tenant without friends on his own side of the partition might have been tempted to wish for entrance to that merry dwelling if only to know the cause of these fluctuations of hilarity and to see if the guests were really so numerous and the observations so very amusing as they seemed  the stagnation of life on the garland side of the partywall began to have a very gloomy effect by the contrast  when about halfpast nine oclock one of these tantalizing bursts of gaiety had resounded for a longer time than usual anne said i believe mother that you are wishing you had gone  i own to feeling that it would have been very cheerful if we had joined in said mrs garland in a hankering tone  i was rather too nice in listening to you and not going  the parson never calls upon us except in his spiritual capacity  old derriman is hardly genteel and theres nobody left to speak to  lonely people must accept what company they can get  or do without it altogether  thats not natural anne and i am surprised to hear a young woman like you say such a thing  nature will not be stifled in that way    song and powerful chorus heard through partition  i declare the room on the other side of the wall seems quite a paradise compared with this  mother you are quite a girl said anne in slightly superior accents go in and join them by all means  o nonot now said her mother resignedly shaking her head  it is too late now  we ought to have taken advantage of the invitation  they would look hard at me as a poor mortal who had no real business there and the miller would say with his broad smile ah you be obliged to come round  while the sociable and unaspiring mrs garland continued thus to pass the evening in two places her body in her own house and her mind in the millers somebody knocked at the door and directly after the elder loveday himself was admitted to the room  he was dressed in a suit between grand and gay which he used for such occasions as the present and his blue coat yellow and red waistcoat with the three lower buttons unfastened steelbuckled shoes and speckled stockings became him very well in mrs martha garlands eyes  your servant maam said the miller adopting as a matter of propriety the raised standard of politeness required by his higher costume  now begging your pardon i cant hae this  tis unnatural that you two ladies should be biding here and we under the same roof making merry without ye  your husband poor manlovely picters that a would make to be surewould have been in with us long ago if he had been in your place  i can take no nay from ye upon my honour  you and maidy anne must come in if it be only for halfanhour  john and his friends have got passes till twelve oclock tonight and saving a few of our own village folk the lowest visitor present is a very genteel german corporal  if you should hae any misgivings on the score of respectability maam well pack off the underbred ones into the back kitchen  widow garland and anne looked yes at each other after this appeal  well follow you in a few minutes said the elder smiling and she rose with anne to go upstairs  no ill wait for ye said the miller doggedly or perhaps youll alter your mind again  while the mother and daughter were upstairs dressing and saying laughingly to each other well we must go now as if they hadnt wished to go all the evening other steps were heard in the passage and the miller cried from below your pardon mrs garland but my son john has come to help fetch ye  shall i ask him in till ye be ready  certainly i shall be down in a minute screamed annes mother in a slanting voice towards the staircase  when she descended the outline of the trumpetmajor appeared halfway down the passage  this is john said the miller simply  john you can mind mrs martha garland very well  very well indeed said the dragoon coming in a little further  i should have called to see her last time but i was only home a week  how is your little girl maam  mrs garland said anne was quite well  she is grownup now  she will be down in a moment  there was a slight noise of military heels without the door at which the trumpetmajor went and put his head outside and said all rightcoming in a minute when voices in the darkness replied no hurry  more friends said mrs garland  o it is only buck and jones come to fetch me said the soldier  shall i ask em in a minute mrs garland maam  o yes said the lady and the two interesting forms of trumpeter buck and saddlersergeant jones then came forward in the most friendly manner whereupon other steps were heard without and it was discovered that sergeantmastertailor brett and farrierextraordinary johnson were outside having come to fetch messrs buck and jones as buck and jones had come to fetch the trumpetmajor  as there seemed a possibility of mrs garlands small passage being choked up with human figures personally unknown to her she was relieved to hear anne coming downstairs  heres my little girl said mrs garland and the trumpetmajor looked with a sort of awe upon the muslin apparition who came forward and stood quite dumb before her  anne recognized him as the trooper she had seen from her window and welcomed him kindly  there was something in his honest face which made her feel instantly at home with him  at this frankness of manner lovedaywho was not a ladies manblushed and made some alteration in his bodily posture began a sentence which had no end and showed quite a boys embarrassment  recovering himself he politely offered his arm which anne took with a very pretty grace  he conducted her through his comrades who glued themselves perpendicularly to the wall to let her pass and then they went out of the door her mother following with the miller and supported by the body of troopers the latter walking with the usual cavalry gait as if their thighs were rather too long for them  thus they crossed the threshold of the mill house and up the passage the paving of which was worn into a gutter by the ebb and flow of feet that had been going on there ever since tudor times     iv  who were present at the millers little entertainment   when the group entered the presence of the company a lull in the conversation was caused by the sight of new visitors and of course by the charm of annes appearance until the old men who had daughters of their own perceiving that she was only a halfformed girl resumed their tales and tosspotting with unconcern  miller loveday had fraternized with half the soldiers in the camp since their arrival and the effect of this upon his party was strikingboth chromatically and otherwise  those among the guests who first attracted the eye were the sergeants and sergeantmajors of lovedays regiment fine hearty men who sat facing the candles entirely resigned to physical comfort  then there were other noncommissioned officers a german two hungarians and a swede from the foreign hussarsyoung men with a look of sadness on their faces as if they did not much like serving so far from home  all of them spoke english fairly well  old age was represented by simon burden the pensioner and the shady side of fifty by corporal tullidge his friend and neighbour who was hard of hearing and sat with his hat on over a red cotton handkerchief that was wound several times round his head  these two veterans were employed as watchers at the neighbouring beacon which had lately been erected by the lordlieutenant for firing whenever the descent on the coast should be made  they lived in a little hut on the hill close by the heap of faggots but tonight they had found deputies to watch in their stead  on a lower plane of experience and qualifications came neighbour james comfort of the volunteers a soldier by courtesy but a blacksmith by rights also william tremlett and anthony cripplestraw of the local forces  the two latter men of war were dressed merely as villagers and looked upon the regulars from a humble position in the background  the remainder of the party was made up of a neighbouring dairyman or two and their wives invited by the miller as anne was glad to see that she and her mother should not be the only women there  the elder loveday apologized in a whisper to mrs garland for the presence of the inferior villagers  but as they are learning to be brave defenders of their home and country maam as fast as they can master the drill and have worked for me off and on these many years ive asked em in and thought youd excuse it  certainly miller loveday said the widow  and the same of old burden and tullidge  they have served well and long in the foot and even now have a hard time of it up at the beacon in wet weather  so after giving them a meal in the kitchen i just asked em in to hear the singing  they faithfully promise that as soon as ever the gunboats appear in view and they have fired the beacon to run down here first in case we shouldnt see it  tis worth while to be friendly with em you see though their tempers be queer  quite worth while miller said she  anne was rather embarrassed by the presence of the regular military in such force and at first confined her words to the dairymens wives she was acquainted with and to the two old soldiers of the parish  why didnt ye speak to me afore chiel said one of these corporal tullidge the elderly man with the hat while she was talking to old simon burden  i met ye in the lane yesterday he added reproachfully but ye didnt notice me at all  i am very sorry for it she said but being afraid to shout in such a company the effect of her remark upon the corporal was as if she had not spoken at all  you was coming along with yer head full of some high notions or other no doubt continued the uncompromising corporal in the same loud voice ah tis the young bucks that get all the notice nowadays and old folks are quite forgot  i can mind well enough how young bob loveday used to lie in wait for ye  anne blushed deeply and stopped his too excursive discourse by hastily saying that she always respected old folks like him  the corporal thought she inquired why he always kept his hat on and answered that it was because his head was injured at valenciennes in july ninetythree we were trying to bomb down the tower and a piece of the shell struck me  i was no more nor less than a dead man for two days  if it hadnt a been for that and my smashed arm i should have come home none the worse for my fiveandtwenty years service  you have got a silver plate let into yer head havent ye corpel said anthony cripplestraw who had drawn near  i have heard that the way they morticed yer skull was a beautiful piece of workmanship  perhaps the young woman would like to see the place  tis a curious sight misess anne you dont see such a wownd every day  no thank you said anne hurriedly dreading as did all the young people of overcombe the spectacle of the corporal uncovered  he had never been seen in public without the hat and the handkerchief since his return in ninetyfour and strange stories were told of the ghastliness of his appearance bareheaded a little boy who had accidentally beheld him going to bed in that state having been frightened into fits  well if the young woman dont want to see yer head maybe shed like to hear yer arm continued cripplestraw earnest to please her  hey said the corporal  your arm hurt too cried anne  knocked to a pummy at the same time as my head said tullidge dispassionately  rattle yer arm corpel and show her said cripplestraw  yes sure said the corporal raising the limb slowly as if the glory of exhibition had lost some of its novelty though he was willing to oblige  twisting it mercilessly about with his right hand he produced a crunching among the bones at every motion cripplestraw seeming to derive great satisfaction from the ghastly sound  how very shocking said anne painfully anxious for him to leave off  o it dont hurt him bless ye  do it corpel said cripplestraw  not a bit said the corporal still working his arm with great energy  theres no life in the bones at all  no life in em i tell her corpel  none at all  they be as loose as a bag of ninepins explained cripplestraw in continuation  you can feel em quite plain misess anne  if ye would like to hell undo his sleeve in a minute to oblege ye  o no no please not  i quite understand said the young woman  do she want to hear or see any more or dont she the corporal inquired with a sense that his time was getting wasted  anne explained that she did not on any account and managed to escape from the corner     v  the song and the stranger   the trumpetmajor now contrived to place himself near her annes presence having evidently been a great pleasure to him since the moment of his first seeing her  she was quite at her ease with him and asked him if he thought that buonaparte would really come during the summer and many other questions which the gallant dragoon could not answer but which he nevertheless liked to be asked  william tremlett who had not enjoyed a sound nights rest since the first consuls menace had become known pricked up his ears at sound of this subject and inquired if anybody had seen the terrible flatbottomed boats that the enemy were to cross in  my brother robert saw several of them paddling about the shore the last time he passed the straits of dover said the trumpetmajor and he further startled the company by informing them that there were supposed to be more than fifteen hundred of these boats and that they would carry a hundred men apiece  so that a descent of one hundred and fifty thousand men might be expected any day as soon as boney had brought his plans to bear  lord ha mercy upon us said william tremlett  the nighttime is when they will try it if they try it at all said old tullidge in the tone of one whose watch at the beacon must in the nature of things have given him comprehensive views of the situation it is my belief that the point they will choose for making the shore is just over there and he nodded with indifference towards a section of the coast at a hideous nearness to the house in which they were assembled whereupon fencible tremlett and cripplestraw of the locals tried to show no signs of trepidation  when dye think twill be said volunteer comfort the blacksmith  i cant answer to a day said the corporal but it will certainly be in a downchannel tide and instead of pulling hard against it hell let his boats drift and that will bring em right into budmouth bay  twill be a beautiful stroke of war if so be tis quietly done  beautiful said cripplestraw moving inside his clothes  but how if we should be all abed corpel  you cant expect a man to be brave in his shirt especially we locals that have only got so far as shoulder fire locks  hes not coming this summer  hell never come at all said a tall sergeantmajor decisively  loveday the soldier was too much engaged in attending upon anne and her mother to join in these surmises bestirring himself to get the ladies some of the best liquor the house afforded which had as a matter of fact crossed the channel as privately as buonaparte wished his army to do and had been landed on a dark night over the cliff  after this he asked anne to sing but though she had a very pretty voice in private performances of that nature she declined to oblige him turning the subject by making a hesitating inquiry about his brother robert whom he had mentioned just before  robert is as well as ever thank you miss garland he said  he is now mate of the brig pewitrather young for such a command but the owner puts great trust in him  the trumpetmajor added deepening his thoughts to a profounder view of the person discussed bob is in love  anne looked conscious and listened attentively but loveday did not go on  much she asked  i cant exactly say  and the strange part of it is that he never tells us who the woman is  nobody knows at all  he will tell of course said anne in the remote tone of a person with whose sex such matters had no connexion whatever  loveday shook his head and the teteatete was put an end to by a burst of singing from one of the sergeants who was followed at the end of his song by others each giving a ditty in his turn the singer standing up in front of the table stretching his chin well into the air as though to abstract every possible wrinkle from his throat and then plunging into the melody  when this was over one of the foreign hussarsthe genteel german of miller lovedays description who called himself a hungarian and in reality belonged to no definite countryperformed at trumpetmajor lovedays request the series of wild motions that he denominated his national dance that anne might see what it was like miss garland was the flower of the whole company the soldiers one and all foreign and english seemed to be quite charmed by her presence as indeed they well might be considering how seldom they came into the society of such as she  anne and her mother were just thinking of retiring to their own dwelling when sergeant stanner of the th foot who was recruiting at budmouth began a satirical song     when lawyers strive to heal a breach    and parsons practise what they preach    then little boney hell pounce down    and march his men on london town     chorusrollicum rorum tollollorum          rollicum rorum tollollay     when justices hold equal scales    and rogues are only found in jails    then little boney hell pounce down    and march his men on london town     chorusrollicum rorum tollollorum         rollicum rorum tollollay     when rich men find their wealth a curse    and fill therewith the poor mans purse    then little boney hell pounce down    and march his men on london town     chorusrollicum rorum tollollorum         rollicum rorum tollollay  poor stanner in spite of his satire he fell at the bloody battle of albuera a few years after this pleasantly spent summer at the georgian wateringplace being mortally wounded and trampled down by a french hussar when the brigade was deploying into line under beresford  while miller loveday was saying well done mr stanner at the close of the thirteenth stanza which seemed to be the last and mr stanner was modestly expressing his regret that he could do no better a stentorian voice was heard outside the window shutter repeating     rollicum rorum tollollorum    rollicum rorum tollollay  the company was silent in a moment at this reinforcement and only the military tried not to look surprised  while all wondered who the singer could be somebody entered the porch the door opened and in came a young man about the size and weight of the farnese hercules in the uniform of the yeomanry cavalry  tis young squire derriman old mr derrimans nephew murmured voices in the background  without waiting to address anybody or apparently seeing who were gathered there the colossal man waved his cap above his head and went on in tones that shook the windowpanes     when husbands with their wives agree    and maids wont wed from modesty    then little boney hell pounce down    and march his men on london town     chorusrollicum rorum tollollorum          rollicum rorum tollollay  it was a verse which had been omitted by the gallant stanner out of respect to the ladies  the newcomer was redhaired and of florid complexion and seemed full of a conviction that his whim of entering must be their pleasure which for the moment it was  no ceremony good men all he said i was passing by and my ear was caught by the singing  i like singing tis warming and cheering and shall not be put down  i should like to hear anybody say otherwise  welcome master derriman said the miller filling a glass and handing it to the yeoman  come all the way from quarters then  i hardly knowed ye in your soldiers clothes  youd look more natural with a spud in your hand sir  i shouldnt ha known ye at all if i hadnt heard that you were called out  more natural with a spudhave a care miller said the young giant the fire of his complexion increasing to scarlet  i dont mean anger butbuta soldiers honour you know  the military in the background laughed a little and the yeoman then for the first time discovered that there were more regulars present than one he looked momentarily disconcerted but expanded again to full assurance  right right master derriman no offencetwas only my joke said the genial miller  everybodys a soldier nowadays  drink a drap o this cordial and dont mind words  the young man drank without the least reluctance and said yes miller i am called out  tis ticklish times for us soldiers now we hold our lives in our handswhat are those fellows grinning at behind the tablei say we do  staying with your uncle at the farm for a day or two mr derriman  no no as i told you six mile off  billeted at casterbridge  but i have to call and see the old old  gentleman  gentlemanno skinflint  he lives upon the sweepings of the barton ha ha  and the speakers regular white teeth showed themselves like snow in a dutch cabbage  well well the profession of arms makes a man proof against all that  i take things as i find em  quite right master derriman  another drop  no no  ill take no more than is good for meno man should so dont tempt me  the yeoman then saw anne and by an unconscious gravitation went towards her and the other women flinging a remark to john loveday in passing ah loveday  i heard you were come in short i come o purpose to see you  glad to see you enjoying yourself at home again  the trumpetmajor replied civilly though not without grimness for he seemed hardly to like derrimans motion towards anne  widow garlands daughteryes tis surely  you remember me  i have been here before  festus derriman yeomanry cavalry  anne gave a little curtsey  i know your name is festusthats all  yes tis well knownespecially latterly  he dropped his voice to confidence pitch  i suppose your friends here are disturbed by my coming in as they dont seem to talk much  i dont mean to interrupt the party but i often find that people are put out by my coming among em especially when ive got my regimentals on  la and are they  yes tis the way i have  he further lowered his tone as if they had been old friends though in reality he had only seen her three or four times  and how did you come to be here  dash my wig i dont like to see a nice young lady like you in this company  you should come to some of our yeomanry sprees in casterbridge or shottsfordforum  o but the girls do come  the yeomanry are respected men men of good substantial families many farming their own land and every one among us rides his own charger which is more than these cussed fellows do  he nodded towards the dragoons  hush hush  why these are friends and neighbours of miller loveday and he is a great friend of oursour best friend said anne with great emphasis and reddening at the sense of injustice to their host  what are you thinking of talking like that  it is ungenerous in you  ha ha  ive affronted you  isnt that it fair angel fairwhat do you call itfair vestal  ah well would you was safe in my own house but honour must be minded now not courting  rollicumrorum tollol lorum  pardon me my sweet i like ye  it may be a come down for me owning land but i do like ye  sir please be quiet said anne distressed  i will i will  well corporal tullidge hows your head he said going towards the other end of the room and leaving anne to herself  the company had again recovered its liveliness and it was a long time before the bouncing rufus who had joined them could find heart to tear himself away from their society and good liquors although he had had quite enough of the latter before he entered  the natives received him at his own valuation and the soldiers of the camp who sat beyond the table smiled behind their pipes at his remarks with a pleasant twinkle of the eye which approached the satirical john loveday being not the least conspicuous in this bearing  but he and his friends were too courteous on such an occasion as the present to challenge the young mans large remarks and readily permitted him to set them right on the details of camping and other military routine about which the troopers seemed willing to let persons hold any opinion whatever provided that they themselves were not obliged to give attention to it showing strangely enough that if there was one subject more than another which never interested their minds it was the art of war  to them the art of enjoying good company in overcombe mill the details of the millers household the swarming of his bees the number of his chickens and the fatness of his pigs were matters of infinitely greater concern  the present writer to whom this party has been described times out of number by members of the loveday family and other aged people now passed away can never enter the old livingroom of overcombe mill without beholding the genial scene through the mists of the seventy or eighty years that intervene between then and now  first and brightest to the eye are the dozen candles scattered about regardless of expense and kept well snuffed by the miller who walks round the room at intervals of five minutes snuffers in hand and nips each wick with great precision and with something of an executioners grim look upon his face as he closes the snuffers upon the neck of the candle  next to the candlelight show the red and blue coats and white breeches of the soldiersnearly twenty of them in all besides the ponderous derrimanthe head of the latter and indeed the heads of all who are standing up being in dangerous proximity to the black beams of the ceiling  there is not one among them who would attach any meaning to vittoria or gather from the syllables waterloo the remotest idea of his own glory or death  next appears the correct and innocent anne little thinking what things time has in store for her at no great distance off  she looks at derriman with a halfuneasy smile as he clanks hither and thither and hopes he will not single her out again to hold a private dialogue withwhich however he does irresistibly attracted by the white muslin figure  she must of course look a little gracious again now lest his mood should turn from sentimental to quarrelsomeno impossible contingency with the yeomansoldier as her quick perception had noted  well well this idling wont do for me folks he at last said to annes relief  i ought not to have come in by rights but i heard you enjoying yourselves and thought it might be worth while to see what you were up to i have several miles to go before bedtime and stretching his arms lifting his chin and shaking his head to eradicate any unseemly curve or wrinkle from his person the yeoman wished them an off hand goodnight and departed  you should have teased him a little more father said the trumpetmajor drily  you could soon have made him as crabbed as a bear  i didnt want to provoke the chaptwasnt worth while  he came in friendly enough said the gentle miller without looking up  i dont think he was overmuch friendly said john  tis as well to be neighbourly with folks if they be not quite onbearable his father genially replied as he took off his coat to go and draw more alethis periodical stripping to the shirtsleeves being necessitated by the narrowness of the cellar and the smeary effect of its numerous cobwebs upon best clothes  some of the guests then spoke of fess derriman as not such a bad young man if you took him right and humoured him others said that he was nobodys enemy but his own and the elder ladies mentioned in a tone of interest that he was likely to come into a deal of money at his uncles death  the person who did not praise was the one who knew him best who had known him as a boy years ago when he had lived nearer to overcombe than he did at present  this unappreciative person was the trumpetmajor     vi  old mr derriman of oxwell hall   at this time in the history of overcombe one solitary newspaper occasionally found its way into the village  it was lent by the postmaster at budmouth who in some mysterious way got it for nothing through his connexion with the mail to mr derriman at the hall by whom it was handed on to mrs garland when it was not more than a fortnight old  whoever remembers anything about the old farmersquire will of course know well enough that this delightful privilege of reading history in long columns was not accorded to the widow garland for nothing  it was by such ingenuous means that he paid her for her daughters occasional services in reading aloud to him and making out his accounts in which matters the farmer whose guineas were reported to touch five figuressome said morewas not expert  mrs martha garland as a respectable widow occupied a twilight rank between the benighted villagers and the wellinformed gentry and kindly made herself useful to the former as letterwriter and reader and general translator from the printing tongue  it was not without satisfaction that she stood at her door of an evening newspaper in hand with three or four cottagers standing round and poured down their open throats any paragraph that she might choose to select from the stirring ones of the period  when she had done with the sheet mrs garland passed it on to the miller the miller to the grinder and the grinder to the grinders boy in whose hands it became subdivided into half pages quarter pages and irregular triangles and ended its career as a paper cap a flagon bung or a wrapper for his bread and cheese  notwithstanding his compact with mrs garland old mr derriman kept the paper so long and was so chary of wasting his mans time on a merely intellectual errand that unless she sent for the journal it seldom reached her hands  anne was always her messenger  the arrival of the soldiers led mrs garland to despatch her daughter for it the day after the party and away she went in her hat and pelisse in a direction at right angles to that of the encampment on the hill  walking across the fields for the distance of a mile or two she came out upon the highroad by a wicketgate  on the other side of the way was the entrance to what at first sight looked like a neglected meadow the gate being a rotten one without a bottom rail and brokendown palings lying on each side  the dry hard mud of the opening was marked with several horse and cow tracks that had been half obliterated by fifty score sheep tracks surcharged with the tracks of a man and a dog  beyond this geological record appeared a carriageroad nearly grown over with grass which anne followed  it descended by a gentle slope dived under darkrinded elm and chestnut trees and conducted her on till the hiss of a waterfall and the sound of the sea became audible when it took a bend round a swamp of fresh watercress and brooklime that had once been a fish pond  here the grey weatherworn front of a building edged from behind the trees  it was oxwell hall once the seat of a family now extinct and of late years used as a farmhouse  benjamin derriman who owned the crumbling place had originally been only the occupier and tenantfarmer of the fields around  his wife had brought him a small fortune and during the growth of their only son there had been a partition of the oxwell estate giving the farmer now a widower the opportunity of acquiring the building and a small portion of the land attached on exceptionally low terms  but two years after the purchase the boy died and derrimans existence was paralyzed forthwith it was said that since that event he had devised the house and fields to a distant female relative to keep them out of the hands of his detested nephew but this was not certainly known  the hall was as interesting as mansions in a state of declension usually are as the excellent county history showed  that popular work in folio contained an old plate dedicated to the last scion of the original owners from which drawing it appeared that in 1750 the date of publication the windows were covered with little scratches like black flashes of lightning that a horn of hard smoke came out of each of the twelve chimneys that a lady and a lapdog stood on the lawn in a strenuously walking position and a substantial cloud and nine flying birds of no known species hung over the trees to the northeast  the rambling and neglected dwelling had all the romantic excellencies and practical drawbacks which such mildewed places share in common with caves mountains wildernesses glens and other homes of poesy that people of taste wish to live and die in  mustard and cress could have been raised on the inner plaster of the dewy walls at any height not exceeding three feet from the floor and mushrooms of the most refined and thinstemmed kinds grew up through the chinks of the larder paving as for the outside nature in the ample time that had been given her had so mingled her filings and effacements with the marks of human wear and tear upon the house that it was often hard to say in which of the two or if in both any particular obliteration had its origin  the keenness was gone from the mouldings of the doorways but whether worn out by the rubbing past of innumerable peoples shoulders and the moving of their heavy furniture or by time in a grander and more abstract form did not appear  the iron stanchions inside the windowpanes were eaten away to the size of wires at the bottom where they entered the stone the condensed breathings of generations having settled there in pools and rusted them  the panes themselves had either lost their shine altogether or become iridescent as a peacocks tail  in the middle of the porch was a vertical sundial whose gnomon swayed loosely about when the wind blew and cast its shadow hither and thither as much as to say heres your fine model dial heres any time for any man i am an old dial and shiftiness is the best policy  anne passed under the arched gateway which screened the main front over it was the porters lodge reached by a spiral staircase  across the archway was fixed a row of wooden hurdles one of which anne opened and closed behind her  their necessity was apparent as soon as she got inside  the quadrangle of the ancient pile was a bed of mud and manure inhabited by calves geese ducks and sow pigs surprisingly large with young ones surprisingly small  in the groined porch some heifers were amusing themselves by stretching up their necks and licking the carved stone capitals that supported the vaulting  anne went on to a second and open door across which was another hurdle to keep the live stock from absolute community with the inmates  there being no knocker she knocked by means of a short stick which was laid against the post for that purpose but nobody attending she entered the passage and tried an inner door  a slight noise was heard inside the door opened about an inch and a strip of decayed face including the eye and some forehead wrinkles appeared within the crevice  please i have come for the paper said anne  o is it you dear anne whined the inmate opening the door a little further  i could hardly get to the door to open it i am so weak  the speaker was a wizened old gentleman in a coat the colour of his farmyard breeches of the same hue unbuttoned at the knees revealing a bit of leg above his stocking and a dazzlingly white shirtfrill to compensate for this untidiness below  the edge of his skull round his eyesockets was visible through the skin and he had a mouth whose corners made towards the back of his head on the slightest provocation he walked with great apparent difficulty back into the room anne following him  well you can have the paper if you want it but you never give me much time to see whats in en  heres the paper  he held it out but before she could take it he drew it back again saying i have not had my share o the paper by a good deal what with my weak sight and people coming so soon for en  i am a poor putupon soul but my duty of man will be left to me when the newspaper is gone  and he sank into his chair with an air of exhaustion  anne said that she did not wish to take the paper if he had not done with it and that she was really later in the week than usual owing to the soldiers  soldiers yesrot the soldiers  and now hedges will be broke and hens nests robbed and suckingpigs stole and i dont know what all whos to pay fort sure  i reckon that because the soldiers be come you dont mean to be kind enough to read to me what i hadnt time to read myself  she would read if he wished she said she was in no hurry  and sitting herself down she unfolded the paper  dinner at carlton house  no faith  tis nothing to i  defence of the country  ye may read that if ye will  i hope there will be no billeting in this parish or any wild work of that sort for what would a poor old lamiger like myself do with soldiers in his house and nothing to feed em with  anne began reading and continued at her task nearly ten minutes when she was interrupted by the appearance in the quadrangular slough without of a large figure in the uniform of the yeomanry cavalry  what do you see out there said the farmer with a start as she paused and slowly blushed  a soldierone of the yeomanry said anne not quite at her ease  scrounch it alltis my nephew exclaimed the old man his face turning to a phosphoric pallor and his body twitching with innumerable alarms as he formed upon his face a gasping smile of joy with which to welcome the newcoming relative  read on prithee miss garland  before she had read far the visitor straddled over the doorhurdle into the passage and entered the room  well nunc how do you feel said the giant shaking hands with the farmer in the manner of one violently ringing a handbell  glad to see you  bad and weakish festus replied the other his person responding passively to the rapid vibrations imparted  o be tender pleasea little softer theres a dear nephew  my arm is no more than a cobweb  ah poor soul  yes i am not much more than a skeleton and cant bear rough usage  sorry to hear that but ill bear your affliction in mind  why you are all in a tremble uncle benjy  tis because i am so gratified said the old man  i always get all in a tremble when i am taken by surprise by a beloved relation  ah thats it said the yeoman bringing his hand down on the back of his uncles chair with a loud smack at which uncle benjy nervously sprang three inches from his seat and dropped into it again  ask your pardon for frightening ye uncle  tis how we do in the army and i forgot your nerves  you have scarcely expected to see me i dare say but here i am  i am glad to see ye  you are not going to stay long perhaps  quite the contrary  i am going to stay ever so long  o i see  i am so glad dear festus  ever so long did ye say  yes ever so long said the young gentleman sitting on the slope of the bureau and stretching out his legs as props  i am going to make this quite my own home whenever i am off duty as long as we stay out and after that when the campaign is over in the autumn i shall come here and live with you like your own son and help manage your land and your farm you know and make you a comfortable old man  ah  how you do please me said the farmer with a horrified smile and grasping the arms of his chair to sustain himself  yes i have been meaning to come a long time as i knew youd like to have me uncle benjy and tisnt in my heart to refuse you  you always was kind that way  yes i always was  but i ought to tell you at once not to disappoint you that i shant be here alwaysall day that is because of my military duties as a cavalry man  o not always  thats a pity exclaimed the farmer with a cheerful eye  i knew youd say so  and i shant be able to sleep here at night sometimes for the same reason  not sleep here o nights said the old gentleman still more relieved you ought to sleep hereyou certainly ought in short you must  but you cant  not while we are with the colours  but directly thats overthe very next dayill stay here all day and all night too to oblige you since you ask me so very kindly  ththank ye that will be very nice said uncle benjy  yes i knew twould relieve ye  and he kindly stroked his uncles head the old man expressing his enjoyment at the affectionate token by a deathshead grimace  i should have called to see you the other night when i passed through here festus continued but it was so late that i couldnt come so far out of my way  you wont think it unkind  not at all if you couldnt  i never shall think it unkind if you really cant come you know festy  there was a few minutes pause and as the nephew said nothing uncle benjy went on i wish i had a little present for ye  but as illluck would have it we have lost a deal of stock this year and i have had to pay away so much  poor old mani know you have  shall i lend you a sevenshilling piece uncle benjy  ha hayou must have your joke well ill think o that  and so they expect buonaparty to choose this very part of the coast for his landing hey  and that the yeomanry be to stand in front as the forlorn hope  who says so asked the florid son of mars losing a little redness  the newspaperman  o theres nothing in that said festus bravely  the goverment thought it possible at one time but they dont know  festus turned himself as he talked and now said abruptly ah whos this  why tis our little anne  he had not noticed her till this moment the young woman having at his entry kept her face over the newspaper and then got away to the back part of the room  and are you and your mother always going to stay down there in the millhouse watching the little fishes miss anne  she said that it was uncertain in a tone of truthful precision which the question was hardly worth looking forcedly at him as she spoke  but she blushed fitfully in her arms and hands as much as in her face  not that she was overpowered by the great boots formidable spurs and other fierce appliances of his person as he imagined simply she had not been prepared to meet him there  i hope you will i am sure for my own good said he letting his eyes linger on the round of her cheek  anne became a little more dignified and her look showed reserve  but the yeoman on perceiving this went on talking to her in so civil a way that he irresistibly amused her though she tried to conceal all feeling at a brighter remark of his than usual her mouth moved her upper lip playing uncertainly over her white teeth it would stay stillno it would withdraw a little way in a smile then it would flutter down again and so it wavered like a butterfly in a tender desire to be pleased and smiling and yet to be also sedate and composed to show him that she did not want compliments and yet that she was not so cold as to wish to repress any genuine feeling he might be anxious to utter  shall you want any more reading mr derriman said she interrupting the younger man in his remarks  if not ill go homeward  dont let me hinder you longer said festus  im off in a minute or two when your man has cleaned my boots  ye dont hinder us nephew  she must have the paper tis the day for her to have n  she might read a little more as i have had so little profit out o en hitherto  well why dont ye speak  will ye or wont ye my dear  not to two she said  ho ho damn it i must go then i suppose said festus laughing and unable to get a further glance from her he left the room and clanked into the back yard where he saw a man holding up his hand he cried anthony cripplestraw  cripplestraw came up in a trot moved a lock of his hair and replaced it and said yes maister derriman  he was old mr derrimans odd hand in the yard and garden and like his employer had no great pretensions to manly beauty owing to a limpness of backbone and speciality of mouth which opened on one side only giving him a triangular smile  well cripplestraw how is it today said festus with sociallysuperior heartiness  middlin considering maister derriman  and hows yerself  fairish  well now see and clean these military boots of mine  ill cock my foot up on this bench  this pigsty of my uncles is not fit for a soldier to come into  yes maister derriman i will  no tis not fit maister derriman  what stock has uncle lost this year cripplestraw  well lets see sir  i can call to mind that weve lost three chickens a tompigeon and a weakly suckingpig one of a fare of ten  i cant think of no more maister derriman  hm not a large quantity of cattle  the old rascal  no tis not a large quantity  old what did you say sir  o nothing  hes within there  festus flung his forehead in the direction of a right line towards the inner apartment  hes a regular sniche one  hee hee fie fie master derriman said cripplestraw shaking his head in delighted censure  gentlefolks shouldnt talk so  and an officer mr derriman  tis the duty of all cavalry gentlemen to bear in mind that their blood is a knowed thing in the country and not to speak ill ot  hes closefisted  well maister he isi own he is a little  tis the nater of some old venerable gentlemen to be so  well hope hell treat ye well in yer fortune sir  hope he will  do people talk about me here cripplestraw asked the yeoman as the other continued busy with his boots  well yes sir they do off and on you know  they says you be as fine a piece of calvery flesh and bones as was ever growed on fallowground in short all owns that you be a fine fellow sir  i wish i wasnt no more afraid of the french than you be but being in the locals maister derriman i assure ye i dream of having to defend my country every night and i dont like the dream at all  you should take it careless cripplestraw as i do and twould soon come natural to you not to mind it at all  well a fine fellow is not everything you know  o no  theres as good as i in the army and even better  and they say that when you fall this summer youll die like a man  when i fall  yes sure maister derriman  poor soul o thee  i shant forget ee as you lie mouldering in yer soldiers grave  hey said the warrior uneasily  what makes em think i am going to fall  well sir by all accounts the yeomanry will be put in front  front  thats what my uncle has been saying  yes and by all accounts tis true  and naterelly theyll be mowed down like grass and you among em poor young galliant officer  look here cripplestraw  this is a reglar foolish report  how can yeomanry be put in front  nobodys put in front  we yeomanry have nothing to do with buonapartes landing  we shall be away in a safe place guarding the possessions and jewels  now can you see cripplestraw any way at all that the yeomanry can be put in front  do you think they really can  well maister i am afraid i do said the cheering cripplestraw  and i know a great warrior like you is only too glad o the chance  twill be a great thing for ye death and glory  in short i hope from my heart you will be and i say so very often to folkin fact i pray at night fort  o cuss you you neednt pray about it  no maister derriman i wont  of course my sword will do its duty  thats enough  and now be off with ye  festus gloomily returned to his uncles room and found that anne was just leaving  he was inclined to follow her at once but as she gave him no opportunity for doing this he went to the window and remained tapping his fingers against the shutter while she crossed the yard  well nephy you are not gone yet said the farmer looking dubiously at festus from under one eyelid  you see how i am  not by any means better you see so i cant entertain ee as well as i would  you cant nunc you cant  i dont think you are worseif i do dash my wig  but youll have plenty of opportunities to make me welcome when you are better  if you are not so brisk inwardly as you was why not try change of air  this is a dull damp hole  tis festus and i am thinking of moving  ah where to said festus with surprise and interest  up into the garret in the north corner  there is no fireplace in the room but i shant want that poor soul o me  tis not moving far  tis not  but i have not a soul belonging to me within ten mile and you know very well that i couldnt afford to go to lodgings that i had to pay for  i know iti know it uncle benjy  well dont be disturbed  ill come and manage for you as soon as ever this boney alarm is over but when a mans country calls he must obey if he is a man  a splendid spirit said uncle benjy with much admiration on the surface of his countenance  i never had it  how could it have got into the boy  from my mothers side perhaps  perhaps so  well take care of yourself nephy said the farmer waving his hand impressively  take care  in these warlike times your spirit may carry ye into the arms of the enemy and you are the last of the family  you should think of this and not let your bravery carry ye away  dont be disturbed uncle ill control myself said festus betrayed into selfcomplacency against his will  at least ill do what i can but nature will out sometimes  well im off  he began humming brighton camp and promising to come again soon retired with assurance each yard of his retreat adding private joyousness to his uncles form  when the bulky young man had disappeared through the porters lodge uncle benjy showed preternatural activity for one in his invalid state jumping up quickly without his stick at the same time opening and shutting his mouth quite silently like a thirsty frog which was his way of expressing mirth  he ran upstairs as quick as an old squirrel and went to a dormer window which commanded a view of the grounds beyond the gate and the footpath that stretched across them to the village  yes yes he said in a suppressed scream dancing up and down hes after her sheve hit en  for there appeared upon the path the figure of anne garland and hastening on at some little distance behind her the swaggering shape of festus  she became conscious of his approach and moved more quickly  he moved more quickly still and overtook her she turned as if in answer to a call from him and he walked on beside her till they were out of sight  the old man then played upon an imaginary fiddle for about half a minute and suddenly discontinuing these signs of pleasure went downstairs again     vii  how they talked in the pastures   you often come this way said festus to anne rather before he had overtaken her  i come for the newspaper and other things she said perplexed by a doubt whether he were there by accident or design  they moved on in silence festus beating the grass with his switch in a masterful way  did you speak misess anne he asked  no said anne  ten thousand pardons  i thought you did  now dont let me drive you out of the path  i can walk among the high grass and giltycupsthey will not yellow my stockings as they will yours  well what do you think of a lot of soldiers coming to the neighbourhood in this way  i think it is very lively and a great change she said with demure seriousness  perhaps you dont like us warriors as a body  anne smiled without replying  why you are laughing said the yeoman looking searchingly at her and blushing like a little fire  what do you see to laugh at  did i laugh said anne a little scared at his sudden mortification  why yes you know you did you young sneerer he said like a cross baby  you are laughing at methats who you are laughing at  i should like to know what you would do without such as me if the french were to drop in upon ye any night  would you help to beat them off said she  can you ask such a question  what are we for  but you dont think anything of soldiers  o yes she liked soldiers she said especially when they came home from the wars covered with glory though when she thought what doings had won them that glory she did not like them quite so well  the gallant and appeased yeoman said he supposed her to mean chopping off heads blowing out brains and that kind of business and thought it quite right that a tenderhearted thing like her should feel a little horrified  but as for him he should not mind such another blenheim this summer as the army had fought a hundred years ago or whenever it wasdash his wig if he should mind it at all  hullo now you are laughing again yes i saw you  and the choleric festus turned his blue eyes and flushed face upon her as though he would read her through  anne strove valiantly to look calmly back but her eyes could not face his and they fell  you did laugh he repeated  it was only a tiny little one she murmured  ahi knew you did thundered he  now what was it you laughed at  i onlythought that you weremerely in the yeomanry she murmured slily  and what of that  and the yeomanry only seem farmers that have lost their senses  yes yes  i knew you meant some jeering o that sort mistress anne but i suppose tis the way of women and i take no notice  ill confess that some of us are no great things but i know how to draw a sword dont isay i dont just to provoke me  i am sure you do said anne sweetly  if a frenchman came up to you mr derriman would you take him on the hip or on the thigh  now you are flattering he said his white teeth uncovering themselves in a smile  well of course i should draw my swordno i mean my sword would be already drawn and i should put spurs to my horsecharger as we call it in the army and i should ride up to him and sayno i shouldnt say anything of coursemen never waste words in battle i should take him with the third guard low point and then coming back to the second guard  but that would be taking care of yourselfnot hitting at him  how can you say that he cried the beams upon his face turning to a lurid cloud in a moment  how can you understand military terms whove never had a sword in your life  i shouldnt take him with the sword at all  he went on with eager sulkiness i should take him with my pistol  i should pull off my right glove and throw back my goatskin then i should open my primingpan prime and cast aboutno i shouldnt thats wrong i should draw my right pistol and as soon as loaded seize the weapon by the butt then at the word cock your pistol i should  then there is plenty of time to give such words of command in the heat of battle said anne innocently  no said the yeoman his face again in flames  why of course i am only telling you what would be the word of command ifthere now you la  i didnt pon my word i didnt  no i dont think you did it was my mistake  well then i come smartly to present looking well along the barrelalong the barreland fire  of course i know well enough how to engage the enemy  but i expect my old uncle has been setting you against me  he has not said a word replied anne though i have heard of you of course  what have you heard  nothing good i dare say  it makes my blood boil within me  o nothing bad said she assuringly  just a word now and then  now come tell me theres a dear  i dont like to be crossed  it shall be a sacred secret between us  come now  anne was embarrassed and her smile was uncomfortable  i shall not tell you she said at last  there it is again said the yeoman throwing himself into a despair  i shall soon begin to believe that my name is not worth sixpence about here  i tell you twas nothing against you repeated anne  that means it might have been for me said festus in a mollified tone well though to speak the truth i have a good many faults some people will praise me i suppose  twas praise  it was  well i am not much at farming and i am not much in company and i am not much at figures but perhaps i must own since it is forced upon me that i can show as fine a soldiers figure on the esplanade as any man of the cavalry  you can said anne for though her flesh crept in mortal terror of his irascibility she could not resist the fearful pleasure of leading him on  you look very well and some say you are  what  well they say i am goodlooking  i dont make myself so tis no praise  hullo what are you looking across there for  only at a bird that i saw fly out of that tree said anne  what  only at a bird do you say he heaved out in a voice of thunder i see your shoulders ashaking young madam  now dont you provoke me with that laughing  by god it wont do  then go away said anne changed from mirthfulness to irritation by his rough manner  i dont want your company you great bragging thing  you are so touchy theres no bearing with you  go away  no no anne i am wrong to speak to you so  i give you free liberty to say what you will to me  say i am not a bit of a soldier or anything abuse medo now theres a dear  im scum im froth im dirt before the besomyes  i have nothing to say sir  stay where you are till i am out of this field  well theres such command in your looks that i hant heart to go against you  you will come this way tomorrow at the same time  now dont be uncivil  she was too generous not to forgive him but the short little lip murmured that she did not think it at all likely she should come that way tomorrow  then sunday he said  not sunday said she  then mondaytuesdaywednesday surely he went on experimentally  she answered that she should probably not see him on either day and cutting short the argument went through the wicket into the other field festus paused looking after her and when he could no longer see her slight figure he swept away his deliberations began singing and turned off in the other direction     viii  anne makes a circuit of the camp   when anne was crossing the last field she saw approaching her an old woman with wrinkled cheeks who surveyed the earth and its inhabitants through the medium of brassrimmed spectacles  shaking her head at anne till the glasses shone like two moons she said ah ah i zeed ye  if i had only kept on my short ones that i use for reading the collect and gospel i shouldnt have zeed ye but thinks i i be going out o doors and ill put on my long ones little thinking what theyd show me  ay i can tell folk at any distance with thesetis a beautiful pair for out o doors though my short ones be best for close work such as darning and catching fleas thats true  what have you seen granny seamore said anne  fie fie miss nancy you know said granny seamore shaking her head still  but hes a fine young feller and will have all his uncles money when as gone  anne said nothing to this and looking ahead with a smile passed granny seamore by  festus the subject of the remark was at this time about threeandtwenty a fine fellow as to feet and inches and of a remarkably warm tone in skin and hair  symptoms of beard and whiskers had appeared upon him at a very early age owing to his persistent use of the razor before there was any necessity for its operation  the brave boy had scraped unseen in the outhouse in the cellar in the woodshed in the stable in the unused parlour in the cowstalls in the barn and wherever he could set up his triangular bit of lookingglass without observation or extemporize a mirror by sticking up his hat on the outside of a windowpane  the result now was that did he neglect to use the instrument he once had trifled with a fine rust broke out upon his countenance on the first day a golden lichen on the second and a fiery stubble on the third to a degree which admitted of no further postponement  his disposition divided naturally into two the boastful and the cantankerous  when festus put on the big pot as it is classically called he was quite blinded ipso facto to the diverting effect of that mood and manner upon others but when disposed to be envious or quarrelsome he was rather shrewd than otherwise and could do some pretty strokes of satire  he was both liked and abused by the girls who knew him and though they were pleased by his attentions they never failed to ridicule him behind his back  in his cups he knew those vessels though only twentythree he first became noisy then excessively friendly and then invariably nagging  during childhood he had made himself renowned for his pleasant habit of pouncing down upon boys smaller and poorer than himself and knocking their birds nests out of their hands or overturning their little carts of apples or pouring water down their backs but his conduct became singularly the reverse of aggressive the moment the little boys mothers ran out to him brandishing brooms fryingpans skimmers and whatever else they could lay hands on by way of weapons  he then fled and hid behind bushes under faggots or in pits till they had gone away and on one such occasion was known to creep into a badgers hole quite out of sight maintaining that post with great firmness and resolution for two or three hours  he had brought more vulgar exclamations upon the tongues of respectable parents in his native parish than any other boy of his time  when other youngsters snowballed him he ran into a place of shelter where he kneaded snowballs of his own with a stone inside and used these formidable missiles in returning their pleasantry  sometimes he got fearfully beaten by boys his own age when he would roar most lustily but fight on in the midst of his tears blood and cries  he was early in love and had at the time of the story suffered from the ravages of that passion thirteen distinct times  he could not love lightly and gaily his love was earnest crosstempered and even savage it was a positive agony to him to be ridiculed by the object of his affections and such conduct drove him into a frenzy if persisted in  he was a torment to those who behaved humbly towards him cynical with those who denied his superiority and a very nice fellow towards those who had the courage to illuse him  this stalwart gentleman and anne garland did not cross each others paths again for a week  then her mother began as before about the newspaper and though anne did not much like the errand she agreed to go for it on mrs garland pressing her with unusual anxiety  why her mother was so persistent on so small a matter quite puzzled the girl but she put on her hat and started  as she had expected festus appeared at a stile over which she sometimes went for shortness sake and showed by his manner that he awaited her when she saw this she kept straight on as if she would not enter the park at all  surely this is your way said festus  i was thinking of going round by the road she said  why is that  she paused as if she were not inclined to say  i go that way when the grass is wet she returned at last  it is not wet now he persisted the sun has been shining on it these nine hours  the fact was that the way by the path was less open than by the road and festus wished to walk with her uninterrupted  but of course it is nothing to me what you do  he flung himself from the stile and walked away towards the house  anne supposing him really indifferent took the same way upon which he turned his head and waited for her with a proud smile  i cannot go with you she said decisively  nonsense you foolish girl  i must walk along with you down to the corner  no please mr derriman we might be seen  now nowthats shyness he said jocosely  no you know i cannot let you  but i must  but i do not allow it  allow it or not i will  then you are unkind and i must submit she said her eyes brimming with tears  ho ho what a shame of me  my wig i wont do any such thing for the world said the repentant yeoman  haw haw why i thought your go away meant come on as it does with so many of the women i meet especially in these clothes  who was to know you were so confoundedly serious  as he did not go anne stood still and said nothing  i see you have a deal more caution and a deal less goodnature than i ever thought you had he continued emphatically  no sir it is not any planned manner of mine at all she said earnestly  but you will see i am sure that i could not go down to the hall with you without putting myself in a wrong light  yes thats it thats it  i am only a fellow in the yeomanry cavalrya plain soldier i may say and we know what women think of such that they are a bad lotmen you mustnt speak to for fear of losing your characterchaps you avoid in the roadschaps that come into a house like oxen daub the stairs wi their boots stain the furniture wi their drink talk rubbish to the servants abuse all thats holy and righteous and are only saved from being carried off by old nick because they are wanted for boney  indeed i didnt know you were thought so bad of as that said she simply  what dont my uncle complain to you of me  you are a favourite of that handsome nice old gaffers i know  never  well what do we think of our nice trumpetmajor hey  anne closed her mouth up tight built it up in fact to show that no answer was coming to that question  o now come seriously loveday is a good fellow and so is his father  i dont know  what a close little rogue you are  there is no getting anything out of you  i believe you would say i dont know to every mortal question so very discreet as you are  upon my heart there are some women who would say i dont know to will ye marry me  the brightness upon annes cheek and in her eyes during this remark showed that there was a fair quantity of life and warmth beneath the discretion he complained of  having spoken thus he drew aside that she might pass and bowed very low  anne formally inclined herself and went on  she had been at vexation point all the time that he was present from a haunting sense that he would not have spoken to her so freely had she been a young woman with thriving male relatives to keep forward admirers in check  but she had been struck now as at their previous meeting with the power she possessed of working him up either to irritation or to complacency at will and this consciousness of being able to play upon him as upon an instrument disposed her to a humorous considerateness and made her tolerate even while she rebuffed him  when anne got to the hall the farmer as usual insisted upon her reading what he had been unable to get through and held the paper tightly in his skinny hand till she had agreed  he sent her to a hard chair that she could not possibly injure to the extent of a pennyworth by sitting in it a twelvemonth and watched her from the outer angle of his near eye while she bent over the paper  his look might have been suggested by the sight that he had witnessed from his window on the last occasion of her visit for it partook of the nature of concern  the old man was afraid of his nephew physically and morally and he began to regard anne as a fellow sufferer under the same despot  after this sly and curious gaze at her he withdrew his eye again so that when she casually lifted her own there was nothing visible but his keen bluish profile as before  when the reading was about halfway through the door behind them opened and footsteps crossed the threshold  the farmer diminished perceptibly in his chair and looked fearful but pretended to be absorbed in the reading and quite unconscious of an intruder  anne felt the presence of the swashing festus and stopped her reading  please go on miss anne he said i am not going to speak a word  he withdrew to the mantelpiece and leaned against it at his ease  go on do ye maidy anne said uncle benjy keeping down his tremblings by a great effort to half their natural extent  annes voice became much lower now that there were two listeners and her modesty shrank somewhat from exposing to festus the appreciative modulations which an intelligent interest in the subject drew from her when unembarrassed  but she still went on that he might not suppose her to be disconcerted though the ensuing ten minutes was one of disquietude  she knew that the bothering yeomans eyes were travelling over her from his position behind creeping over her shoulders up to her head and across her arms and hands  old benjy on his part knew the same thing and after sundry endeavours to peep at his nephew from the corner of his eye he could bear the situation no longer  do ye want to say anything to me nephew he quaked  no uncle thank ye said festus heartily  i like to stay here thinking of you and looking at your back hair  the nervous old man writhed under this vivisection and anne read on till to the relief of both the gallant fellow grew tired of his amusement and went out of the room  anne soon finished her paragraph and rose to go determined never to come again as long as festus haunted the precincts  her face grew warmer as she thought that he would be sure to waylay her on her journey home today  on this account when she left the house instead of going in the customary direction she bolted round to the further side through the bushes along under the kitchengarden wall and through a door leading into a rutted carttrack which had been a pleasant gravelled drive when the fine old hall was in its prosperity  once out of sight of the windows she ran with all her might till she had quitted the park by a route directly opposite to that towards her home  why she was so seriously bent upon doing this she could hardly tell but the instinct to run was irresistible  it was necessary now to clamber over the down to the left of the camp and make a complete circuit round the latterinfantry cavalry sutlers and alldescending to her house on the other side  this tremendous walk she performed at a rapid rate never once turning her head and avoiding every beaten track to keep clear of the knots of soldiers taking a walk when she at last got down to the levels again she paused to fetch breath and murmured why did i take so much trouble  he would not after all have hurt me  as she neared the mill an erect figure with a blue body and white thighs descended before her from the down towards the village and went past the mill to a stile beyond over which she usually returned to her house here he lingered  on coming nearer anne discovered this person to be trumpetmajor loveday and not wishing to meet anybody just now anne passed quickly on and entered the house by the garden door  my dear anne what a time you have been gone said her mother  yes i have been round by another road  why did you do that  anne looked thoughtful and reticent for her reason was almost too silly a one to confess  well i wanted to avoid a person who is very busy trying to meet methats all she said  her mother glanced out of the window  and there he is i suppose she said as john loveday tired of looking for anne at the stile passed the house on his way to his fathers door  he could not help casting his eyes towards their window and seeing them he smiled  annes reluctance to mention festus was such that she did not correct her mothers error and the dame went on well you are quite right my dear  be friendly with him but no more at present  i have heard of your other affair and think it is a very wise choice  i am sure you have my best wishes in it and i only hope it will come to a point  whats that said the astonished anne  you and mr festus derriman dear  you need not mind me i have known it for several days  old granny seamore called here saturday and told me she saw him coming home with you across park close last week when you went for the newspaper so i thought id send you again today and give you another chance  then you didnt want the paperand it was only for that  hes a very fine young fellow he looks a thorough womans protector  he may look it said anne  he has given up the freehold farm his father held at pitstock and lives in independence on what the land brings him  and when farmer derriman dies hell have all the old mans for certain  hell be worth ten thousand pounds if a penny in money besides sixteen horses cart and hack a fiftycow dairy and at least five hundred sheep  anne turned away and instead of informing her mother that she had been running like a doe to escape the interesting heirpresumptive alluded to merely said mother i dont like this at all     ix  anne is kindly fetched by the trumpetmajor   after this anne would on no account walk in the direction of the hall for fear of another encounter with young derriman  in the course of a few days it was told in the village that the old farmer had actually gone for a weeks holiday and change of air to the royal wateringplace near at hand at the instance of his nephew festus  this was a wonderful thing to hear of uncle benjy who had not slept outside the walls of oxwell hall for many a long year before and anne well imagined what extraordinary pressure must have been put upon him to induce him to take such a step  she pictured his unhappiness at the bustling wateringplace and hoped no harm would come to him  she spent much of her time indoors or in the garden hearing little of the camp movements beyond the periodical tatatataa of the trumpeters sounding their various ingenious calls for watchsetting stables feed bootandsaddle parade and so on which made her think how clever her friend the trumpetmajor must be to teach his pupils to play those pretty little tunes so well  on the third morning after uncle benjys departure she was disturbed as usual while dressing by the tramp of the troops down the slope to the millpond and during the now familiar stamping and splashing which followed there sounded upon the glass of the window a slight smack which might have been caused by a whip or switch  she listened more particularly and it was repeated  as john loveday was the only dragoon likely to be aware that she slept in that particular apartment she imagined the signal to come from him though wondering that he should venture upon such a freak of familiarity  wrapping herself up in a red cloak she went to the window gently drew up a corner of the curtain and peeped out as she had done many times before  nobody who was not quite close beneath her window could see her face but as it happened somebody was close  the soldiers whose floundering anne had heard were not lovedays dragoons but a troop of the york hussars quite oblivious of her existence  they had passed on out of the water and instead of them there sat festus derriman alone on his horse and in plain clothes the water reaching up to the animals belly and festus heels elevated over the saddle to keep them out of the stream which threatened to wash rider and horse into the deep millhead just below  it was plainly he who had struck her lattice for in a moment he looked up and their eyes met  festus laughed loudly and slapped her window again and just at that moment the dragoons began prancing down the slope in review order  she could not but wait a minute or two to see them pass  while doing so she was suddenly led to draw back drop the corner of the curtain and blush privately in her room she had not only been seen by festus derriman but by john loveday who riding along with his trumpet slung up behind him had looked over his shoulder at the phenomenon of derriman beneath annes bedroom window and seemed quite astounded at the sight  she was quite vexed at the conjunction of incidents and went no more to the window till the dragoons had ridden far away and she had heard festuss horse laboriously wade on to dry land  when she looked out there was nobody left but miller loveday who usually stood in the garden at this time of the morning to say a word or two to the soldiers of whom he already knew so many and was in a fair way of knowing many more from the liberality with which he handed round mugs of cheering liquor whenever parties of them walked that way  in the afternoon of this day anne walked to a christening party at a neighbours in the adjoining parish of springham intending to walk home again before it got dark but there was a slight fall of rain towards evening and she was pressed by the people of the house to stay over the night  with some hesitation she accepted their hospitality but at ten oclock when they were thinking of going to bed they were startled by a smart rap at the door and on it being unbolted a mans form was seen in the shadows outside  is miss garland here the visitor inquired at which anne suspended her breath  yes said annes entertainer warily  her mother is very anxious to know whats become of her  she promised to come home  to her great relief anne recognized the voice as john lovedays and not festus derrimans  yes i did mr loveday said she coming forward but it rained and i thought my mother would guess where i was  loveday said with diffidence that it had not rained anything to speak of at the camp or at the mill so that her mother was rather alarmed  and she asked you to come for me anne inquired  this was a question which the trumpetmajor had been dreading during the whole of his walk thither  well she didnt exactly ask me he said rather lamely but still in a manner to show that mrs garland had indirectly signified such to be her wish  in reality mrs garland had not addressed him at all on the subject  she had merely spoken to his father on finding that her daughter did not return and received an assurance from the miller that the precious girl was doubtless quite safe  john heard of this inquiry and having a pass that evening resolved to relieve mrs garlands mind on his own responsibility  ever since his morning view of festus under her window he had been on thorns of anxiety and his thrilling hope now was that she would walk back with him  he shifted his foot nervously as he made the bold request  anne felt at once that she would go  there was nobody in the world whose care she would more readily be under than the trumpetmajors in a case like the present  he was their nearest neighbours son and she had liked his singleminded ingenuousness from the first moment of his return home  when they had started on their walk anne said in a practical way to show that there was no sentiment whatever in her acceptance of his company mother was much alarmed about me perhaps  yes she was uneasy he said and then was compelled by conscience to make a clean breast of it  i know she was uneasy because my father said so  but i did not see her myself  the truth is she doesnt know i am come  anne now saw how the matter stood but she was not offended with him what woman could have been  they walked on in silence the respectful trumpetmajor keeping a yard off on her right as precisely as if that measure had been fixed between them  she had a great feeling of civility toward him this evening and spoke again  i often hear your trumpeters blowing the calls  they do it beautifully i think  pretty fair they might do better said he as one too wellmannered to make much of an accomplishment in which he had a hand  and you taught them how to do it  yes i taught them  it must require wonderful practice to get them into the way of beginning and finishing so exactly at one time  it is like one throat doing it all  how came you to be a trumpeter mr loveday  well i took to it naturally when i was a little boy said he betrayed into quite a gushing state by her delightful interest  i used to make trumpets of paper eldersticks eltrot stems and even stingingnettle stalks you know  then father set me to keep the birds off that little barleyground of his and gave me an old horn to frighten em with  i learnt to blow that horn so that you could hear me for miles and miles then he bought me a clarionet and when i could play that i borrowed a serpent and i learned to play a tolerable bass  so when i listed i was picked out for training as trumpeter at once  of course you were  sometimes however i wish i had never joined the army  my father gave me a very fair education and your father showed me how to draw horseson a slate i mean  yes i ought to have done more than i have  what did you know my father she asked with new interest  o yes for years  you were a little mite of a thing then and you used to cry when we big boys looked at you and made pigs eyes at you which we did sometimes  many and many a time have i stood by your poor father while he worked  ah you dont remember much about him but i do  anne remained thoughtful and the moon broke from behind the clouds lighting up the wet foliage with a twinkling brightness and lending to each of the trumpetmajors buttons and spurs a little ray of its own they had come to oxwell park gate and he said do you like going across or round by the lane  we may as well go by the nearest road said anne  they entered the park following the halfobliterated drive till they came almost opposite the hall when they entered a footpath leading on to the village  while hereabout they heard a shout or chorus of exclamation apparently from within the walls of the dark buildings near them  what was that said anne  i dont know said her companion  ill go and see  he went round the intervening swamp of watercress and brooklime which had once been the fishpond crossed by a culvert the trickling brook that still flowed that way and advanced to the wall of the house  boisterous noises were resounding from within and he was tempted to go round the corner where the low windows were and look through a chink into the room whence the sounds proceeded  it was the room in which the owner dinedtraditionally called the great parlourand within it sat about a dozen young men of the yeomanry cavalry one of them being festus  they were drinking laughing singing thumping their fists on the tables and enjoying themselves in the very perfection of confusion  the candles blown by the breeze from the partly opened window had guttered into coffin handles and shrouds and choked by their long black wicks for want of snuffing gave out a smoky yellow light  one of the young men might possibly have been in a maudlin state for he had his arm round the neck of his next neighbour another was making an incoherent speech to which nobody was listening some of their faces were red some were sallow some were sleepy some wide awake  the only one among them who appeared in his usual frame of mind was festus whose huge burly form rose at the head of the table enjoying with a serene and triumphant aspect the difference between his own condition and that of his neighbours  while the trumpetmajor looked a young woman niece of anthony cripplestraw and one of uncle benjys servants was called in by one of the crew and much against her will a fiddle was placed in her hands from which they made her produce discordant screeches  the absence of uncle benjy had in fact been contrived by young derriman that he might make use of the hall on his own account  cripplestraw had been left in charge and festus had found no difficulty in forcing from that dependent the keys of whatever he required  john loveday turned his eyes from the scene to the neighbouring moonlit path where anne still stood waiting  then he looked into the room then at anne again  it was an opportunity of advancing his own cause with her by exposing festus for whom he began to entertain hostile feelings of no mean force  no i cant do it he said  tis underhand  let things take their chance  he moved away and then perceived that anne tired of waiting had crossed the stream and almost come up with him  what is the noise about she said  theres company in the house said loveday  company  farmer derriman is not at home said anne and went on to the window whence the rays of light leaked out the trumpetmajor standing where he was  he saw her face enter the beam of candlelight stay there for a moment and quickly withdraw  she came back to him at once  let us go on she said  loveday imagined from her tone that she must have an interest in derriman and said sadly you blame me for going across to the window and leading you to follow me  not a bit said anne seeing his mistake as to the state of her heart and being rather angry with him for it  i think it was most natural considering the noise  silence again  derriman is sober as a judge said loveday as they turned to go  it was only the others who were noisy  whether he is sober or not is nothing whatever to me said anne  of course not  i know it said the trumpetmajor in accents expressing unhappiness at her somewhat curt tone and some doubt of her assurance  before they had emerged from the shadow of the hall some persons were seen moving along the road  loveday was for going on just the same but anne from a shy feeling that it was as well not to be seen walking alone with a man who was not her lover said  mr loveday let us wait here a minute till they have passed  on nearer view the group was seen to comprise a man on a piebald horse and another man walking beside him  when they were opposite the house they halted and the rider dismounted whereupon a dispute between him and the other man ensued apparently on a question of money  tis old mr derriman come home said anne  he has hired that horse from the bathingmachine to bring him  only fancy  before they had gone many steps further the farmer and his companion had ended their dispute and the latter mounted the horse and cantered away uncle benjy coming on to the house at a nimble pace  as soon as he observed loveday and anne he fell into a feebler gait when they came up he recognized anne  and you have torn yourself away from king georges esplanade so soon farmer derriman said she  yes faith  i couldnt bide at such a ruination place said the farmer  your hand in your pocket every minute of the day  tis a shilling for this halfacrown for that if you only eat one egg or even a poor windfall of an apple youve got to pay and a bunch o radishes is a halfpenny and a quart o cider a good tuppence threefarthings at lowest reckoning  nothing without paying  i couldnt even get a ride homeward upon that screw without the man wanting a shilling for it when my weight didnt take a penny out of the beast ive saved a pennorth or so of shoeleather to be sure but the saddle was so rough wi patches that a took twopence out of the seat of my best breeches  king george hev ruined the town for other folks  more than that my nephew promised to come there tomorrow to see me and if i had stayed i must have treated en  heywhats that  it was a shout from within the walls of the building and loveday said  your nephew is here and has company  my nephew here gasped the old man  good folks will you come up to the door with me  i meanheeheejust for company  dear me i thought my house was as quiet as a church  they went back to the window and the farmer looked in his mouth falling apart to a greater width at the corners than in the middle and his fingers assuming a state of radiation  tis my best silver tankards theyve got that ive never used  o tis my strong beer  tis eight candles guttering away when ive used nothing but twenties myself for the last halfyear  you didnt know he was here then said loveday  o no said the farmer shaking his head halfway  nothings known to poor i  theres my best rummers jingling as careless as if twas tin cups and my table scratched and my chairs wrenched out of joint  see how they tilt em on the two back legsand thats ruin to a chair  ah when i be gone he wont find another old man to make such work with and provide goods for his breaking and houseroom and drink for his tear brass set  comrades and fellowsoldiers said festus to the hot farmers and yeomen he entertained within as we have vowed to brave danger and death together so well share the couch of peace  you shall sleep here to night for it is getting late  my scram bluevinnied gallicrow of an uncle takes care that there shant be much comfort in the house but you can curl up on the furniture if beds run short  as for my sleep it wont be much  im melancholy  a woman has i may say got my heart in her pocket and i have hers in mine  shes not muchto other folk i meanbut she is to me  the little thing came in my way and conquered me  i fancy that simple girl  i ought to have looked higheri know it what of that  tis a fate that may happen to the greatest men  whash her name said one of the warriors whose head occasionally drooped upon his epaulettes and whose eyes fell together in the casual manner characteristic of the tired soldier  it was really farmer stubb of duddle hole  her name  well tis spelt a nbut by gad i wont give ye her name here in company  she dont live a hundred miles off however and she wears the prettiest capribbons you ever saw  well well tis weakness she has little and i have much but i do adore that girl in spite of myself  lets go on said anne  prithee stand by an old man till hes got into his house implored uncle benjy  i only ask ye to bide within call  stand back under the trees and ill do my poor best to give no trouble  ill stand by you for halfanhour sir said loveday  after that i must bolt to camp  very well bide back there under the trees said uncle benjy  i dont want to spite em  youll wait a few minutes just to see if he gets in said the trumpet major to anne as they retired from the old man  i want to get home said anne anxiously  when they had quite receded behind the treetrunks and he stood alone uncle benjy to their surprise set up a loud shout altogether beyond the imagined power of his lungs  man alost man alost he cried repeating the exclamation several times and then ran and hid himself behind a corner of the building  soon the door opened and festus and his guests came tumbling out upon the green  tis our duty to help folks in distress said festus  man alost where are you  twas across there said one of his friends  no twas here said another  meanwhile uncle benjy coming from his hidingplace had scampered with the quickness of a boy up to the door they had quitted and slipped in in a moment the door flew together and anne heard him bolting and barring it inside  the revellers however did not notice this and came on towards the spot where the trumpetmajor and anne were standing  heres succour at hand friends said festus  we are all kings men do not fear us  thank you said loveday so are we  he explained in two words that they were not the distressed traveller who had cried out and turned to go on  tis she my life tis she said festus now first recognizing anne fair anne i will not part from you till i see you safe at your own dear door  shes in my hands said loveday civilly though not without firmness so it is not required thank you  man had i but my sword  come said loveday i dont want to quarrel  lets put it to her whichever of us she likes best he shall take her home  miss anne which  anne would much rather have gone home alone but seeing the remainder of the yeomanry party staggering up she thought it best to secure a protector of some kind  how to choose one without offending the other and provoking a quarrel was the difficulty  you must both walk home with me she adroitly said one on one side and one on the other  and if you are not quite civil to one another all the time ill never speak to either of you again  they agreed to the terms and the other yeomen arriving at this time said they would go also as rearguard  very well said anne  now go and get your hats and dont be long  ah yes our hats said the yeomanry whose heads were so hot that they had forgotten their nakedness till then  youll wait till weve got emwe wont be a moment said festus eagerly  anne and loveday said yes and festus ran back to the house followed by all his band  now lets run and leave em said anne when they were out of hearing  but weve promised to wait said the trumpetmajor in surprise  promised to wait said anne indignantly  as if one ought to keep such a promise to drunken men as that  you can do as you like i shall go  it is hardly fair to leave the chaps said loveday reluctantly and looking back at them  but she heard no more and flitting off under the trees was soon lost to his sight  festus and the rest had by this time reached uncle benjys door which they were discomfited and astonished to find closed  they began to knock and then to kick at the venerable timber till the old mans head crowned with a tasselled nightcap appeared at an upper window followed by his shoulders with apparently nothing on but his shirt though it was in truth a sheet thrown over his coat  fie fie upon ye all for making such a hullaballoo at a weak old mans door he said yawning  whats in ye to rouse honest folks at this time o night  hang mewhyits uncle benjy  hawhawhaw said festus  nunc why how the devils this  tis ifestuswanting to come in  o no no my clever man whoever you be said uncle benjy in a tone of incredulous integrity  my nephew dear boy is miles away at quarters and sound asleep by this time as becomes a good soldier  that story wont do tonight my man not at all  upon my soul tis i said festus  not tonight my man not tonight  anthony bring my blunderbuss said the farmer turning and addressing nobody inside the room  lets break in the windowshutters said one of the others  my wig and we will said festus  what a trick of the old man  get some big stones said the yeomen searching under the wall  no forbear forbear said festus beginning to be frightened at the spirit he had raised  i forget we should drive him into fits for hes subject to em and then perhaps twould be manslaughter  comrades we must march  no well lie in the barn  ill see into this take my word for t  our honour is at stake  now lets back to see my beauty home  we cant as we havnt got our hats said one of his fellowtroopersin domestic life jacob noakes of muckleford farm  no more we can said festus in a melancholy tone  but i must go to her and tell her the reason  she pulls me in spite of all  shes gone  i saw her flee across park while we were knocking at the door said another of the yeomanry  gone said festus grinding his teeth and putting himself into a rigid shape  then tis my enemyhe has tempted her away with him  but i am a rich man and hes poor and rides the kings horse while i ride my own  could i but find that fellow that regular that common man i would  yes said the trumpetmajor coming up behind him  isaid festus starting roundi would seize him by the hand and say guard her if you are my friend guard her from all harm  a good speech  and i will too said loveday heartily  and now for shelter said festus to his companions  they then unceremoniously left loveday without wishing him goodnight and proceeded towards the barn  he crossed the park and ascended the down to the camp grieved that he had given anne cause of complaint and fancying that she held him of slight account beside his wealthier rival     x the matchmaking virtues of a double garden   anne was so flurried by the military incidents attending her return home that she was almost afraid to venture alone outside her mothers premises  moreover the numerous soldiers regular and otherwise that haunted overcombe and its neighbourhood were getting better acquainted with the villagers and the result was that they were always standing at garden gates walking in the orchards or sitting gossiping just within cottage doors with the bowls of their tobaccopipes thrust outside for politeness sake that they might not defile the air of the household being gentlemen of a gallant and most affectionate nature they naturally turned their heads and smiled if a pretty girl passed by which was rather disconcerting to the latter if she were unused to society  every belle in the village soon had a lover and when the belles were all allotted those who scarcely deserved that title had their turn many of the soldiers being not at all particular about halfaninch of nose more or less a trifling deficiency of teeth or a larger crop of freckles than is customary in the saxon race  thus with one and another courtship began to be practised in overcombe on rather a large scale and the dispossessed young men who had been born in the place were left to take their walks alone where instead of studying the works of nature they meditated gross outrages on the brave men who had been so good as to visit their village  anne watched these romantic proceedings from her window with much interest and when she saw how triumphantly other handsome girls of the neighbourhood walked by on the gorgeous arms of lieutenant knockheelmann cornet flitzenhart and captain klaspenkissen of the thrilling york hussars who swore the most picturesque foreign oaths and had a wonderful sort of estate or property called the vaterland in their country across the sea she was filled with a sense of her own loneliness  it made her think of things which she tried to forget and to look into a little drawer at something soft and brown that lay in a curl there wrapped in paper  at last she could bear it no longer and went downstairs  where are you going said mrs garland  to see the folks because i am so gloomy  certainly not at present anne  why not mother said anne blushing with an indefinite sense of being very wicked  because you must not  i have been going to tell you several times not to go into the street at this time of day  why not walk in the morning theres young mr derriman would be glad to  dont mention him mother dont  well then dear walk in the garden  so poor anne who really had not the slightest wish to throw her heart away upon a soldier but merely wanted to displace old thoughts by new turned into the inner garden from day to day and passed a good many hours there the pleasant birds singing to her and the delightful butterflies alighting on her hat and the horrid ants running up her stockings  this garden was undivided from lovedays the two having originally been the single garden of the whole house  it was a quaint old place enclosed by a thorn hedge so shapely and dense from incessant clipping that the millboy could walk along the top without sinking ina feat which he often performed as a means of filling out his days work  the soil within was of that intense fat blackness which is only seen after a century of constant cultivation  the paths were grassed over so that people came and went upon them without being heard  the grass harboured slugs and on this account the miller was going to replace it by gravel as soon as he had time but as he had said this for thirty years without doing it the grass and the slugs seemed likely to remain  the millers man attended to mrs garlands piece of the garden as well as to the larger portion digging planting and weeding indifferently in both the miller observing with reason that it was not worth while for a helpless widow lady to hire a man for her little plot when his man working alongside could tend it without much addition to his labour  the two households were on this account even more closely united in the garden than within the mill  out there they were almost one family and they talked from plot to plot with a zest and animation which mrs garland could never have anticipated when she first removed thither after her husbands death  the lower half of the garden farthest from the road was the most snug and sheltered part of this snug and sheltered enclosure and it was well watered as the land of lot  three small brooks about a yard wide ran with a tinkling sound from side to side between the plots crossing the path under wood slabs laid as bridges and passing out of the garden through little tunnels in the hedge  the brooks were so far overhung at their brinks by grass and garden produce that had it not been for their perpetual babbling few would have noticed that they were there  this was where anne liked best to linger when her excursions became restricted to her own premises and in a spot of the garden not far removed the trumpetmajor loved to linger also  having by virtue of his office no stable duty to perform he came down from the camp to the mill almost every day and anne finding that he adroitly walked and sat in his fathers portion of the garden whenever she did so in the other half could not help smiling and speaking to him so his epaulettes and blue jacket and annes yellow gipsy hat were often seen in different parts of the garden at the same time but he never intruded into her part of the enclosure nor did she into lovedays  she always spoke to him when she saw him there and he replied in deep firm accents across the gooseberry bushes or through the tall rows of flowering peas as the case might be  he thus gave her accounts at fifteen paces of his experiences in camp in quarters in flanders and elsewhere of the difference between line and column of forced marches billeting and suchlike together with his hopes of promotion  anne listened at first indifferently but knowing no one else so goodnatured and experienced she grew interested in him as in a brother  by degrees his gold lace buckles and spurs lost all their strangeness and were as familiar to her as her own clothes  at last mrs garland noticed this growing friendship and began to despair of her motherly scheme of uniting anne to the moneyed festus  why she could not take prompt steps to check interference with her plans arose partly from her nature which was the reverse of managing and partly from a new emotional circumstance with which she found it difficult to reckon  the near neighbourhood that had produced the friendship of anne for john loveday was slowly effecting a warmer liking between her mother and his father  thus the month of july passed  the troop horses came with the regularity of clockwork twice a day down to drink under her window and as the weather grew hotter kicked up their heels and shook their heads furiously under the maddening sting of the dunfly  the green leaves in the garden became of a darker dye the gooseberries ripened and the three brooks were reduced to half their winter volume  at length the earnest trumpetmajor obtained mrs garlands consent to take her and her daughter to the camp which they had not yet viewed from any closer point than their own windows  so one afternoon they went the miller being one of the party  the villagers were by this time driving a roaring trade with the soldiers who purchased of them every description of garden produce milk butter and eggs at liberal prices  the figures of these rural sutlers could be seen creeping up the slopes laden like bees to a spot in the rear of the camp where there was a kind of market place on the greensward  mrs garland anne and the miller were conducted from one place to another and on to the quarter where the soldiers wives lived who had not been able to get lodgings in the cottages near  the most sheltered place had been chosen for them and snug huts had been built for their use by their husbands of clods hurdles a little thatch or whatever they could lay hands on  the trumpetmajor conducted his friends thence to the large barn which had been appropriated as a hospital and to the cottage with its windows bricked up that was used as the magazine then they inspected the lines of shining dark horses each representing the then high figure of twoandtwenty guineas purchase money standing patiently at the ropes which stretched from one picketpost to another a bank being thrown up in front of them as a protection at night  they passed on to the tents of the german legion a wellgrown and rather dandy set of men with a poetical look about their faces which rendered them interesting to feminine eyes  hanoverians saxons prussians swedes hungarians and other foreigners were numbered in their ranks they were cleaning arms which they leant carefully against a rail when the work was complete  on their return they passed the messhouse a temporary wooden building with a brick chimney  as anne and her companions went by a group of three or four of the hussars were standing at the door talking to a dashing young man who was expatiating on the qualities of a horse that one was inclined to buy  anne recognized festus derriman in the seller and cripplestraw was trotting the animal up and down  as soon as she caught the yeomans eye he came forward making some friendly remark to the miller and then turning to miss garland who kept her eyes steadily fixed on the distant landscape till he got so near that it was impossible to do so longer  festus looked from anne to the trumpetmajor and from the trumpetmajor back to anne with a dark expression of face as if he suspected that there might be a tender understanding between them  are you offended with me he said to her in a low voice of repressed resentment  no said anne  when are you coming to the hall again  never perhaps  nonsense anne said mrs garland who had come near and smiled pleasantly on festus  you can go at any time as usual  let her come with me now mrs garland i should be pleased to walk along with her  my man can lead home the horse  thank you but i shall not come said miss anne coldly  the widow looked unhappily in her daughters face distressed between her desire that anne should encourage festus and her wish to consult annes own feelings  leave her alone leave her alone said festus his gaze blackening now i think of it i am glad she cant come with me for i am engaged and he stalked away  anne moved on with her mother young loveday silently following and they began to descend the hill  well wheres mr loveday asked mrs garland  fathers behind said john  mrs garland looked behind her solicitously and the miller who had been waiting for the event beckoned to her  ill overtake you in a minute she said to the younger pair and went back her colour for some unaccountable reason rising as she did so the miller and she then came on slowly together conversing in very low tones and when they got to the bottom they stood still  loveday and anne waited for them saying but little to each other for the rencounter with festus had damped the spirits of both  at last the widows private talk with miller loveday came to an end and she hastened onward the miller going in another direction to meet a man on business  when she reached the trumpetmajor and anne she was looking very bright and rather flurried and seemed sorry when loveday said that he must leave them and return to the camp  they parted in their usual friendly manner and anne and her mother were left to walk the few remaining yards alone  there ive settled it said mrs garland  anne what are you thinking about  i have settled in my mind that it is all right  whats all right said anne  that you do not care for derriman and mean to encourage john loveday whats all the world so long as folks are happy  child dont take any notice of what i have said about festus and dont meet him any more  what a weathercock you are mother  why should you say that just now  it is easy to call me a weathercock said the matron putting on the look of a good woman but i have reasoned it out and at last thank god i have got over my ambition  the lovedays are our true and only friends and mr festus derriman with all his money is nothing to us at all  but said anne what has made you change all of a sudden from what you have said before  my feelings and my reason which i am thankful for  anne knew that her mothers sentiments were naturally so versatile that they could not be depended on for two days together but it did not occur to her for the moment that a change had been helped on in the present case by a romantic talk between mrs garland and the miller  but mrs garland could not keep the secret long  she chatted gaily as she walked and before they had entered the house she said what do you think mr loveday has been saying to me dear anne  anne did not know at all  why he has asked me to marry him     xi  our people are affected by the presence of royalty   to explain the millers sudden proposal it is only necessary to go back to that moment when anne festus and mrs garland were talking together on the down  john loveday had fallen behind so as not to interfere with a meeting in which he was decidedly superfluous and his father who guessed the trumpetmajors secret watched his face as he stood  johns face was sad and his eyes followed mrs garlands encouraging manner to festus in a way which plainly said that every parting of her lips was tribulation to him  the miller loved his son as much as any miller or private gentleman could do and he was pained to see johns gloom at such a trivial circumstance  so what did he resolve but to help john there and then by precipitating a matter which had he himself been the only person concerned he would have delayed for another six months  he had long liked the society of his impulsive tractable neighbour mrs garland had mentally taken her up and pondered her in connexion with the question whether it would not be for the happiness of both if she were to share his home even though she was a little his superior in antecedents and knowledge  in fact he loved her not tragically but to a very creditable extent for his years that is next to his sons bob and john though he knew very well of that ploughedground appearance near the corners of her once handsome eyes and that the little depression in her right cheek was not the lingering dimple it was poetically assumed to be but a result of the abstraction of some wornout nether millstones within the cheek by rootle the budmouth man who lived by such practices on the heads of the elderly  but what of that when he had lost two to each one of hers and exceeded her in age by some eight years  to do john a service then he quickened his designs and put the question to her while they were standing under the eyes of the younger pair  mrs garland though she had been interested in the miller for a long time and had for a moment now and then thought on this question as far as suppose he should if he were to and so on had never thought much further and she was really taken by surprise when the question came  she answered without affectation that she would think over the proposal and thus they parted  her mothers infirmity of purpose set anne thinking and she was suddenly filled with a conviction that in such a case she ought to have some purpose herself  mrs garlands complacency at the millers offer had in truth amazed her  while her mother had held up her head and recommended festus it had seemed a very pretty thing to rebel but the pressure being removed an awful sense of her own responsibility took possession of her mind  as there was no longer anybody to be wise or ambitious for her surely she should be wise and ambitious for herself discountenance her mothers attachment and encourage festus in his addresses for her own and her mothers good  there had been a time when a loveday thrilled her own heart but that was long ago before she had thought of position or differences  to wake into cold daylight like this when and because her mother had gone into the land of romance was dreadful and new to her and like an increase of years without living them  but it was easier to think that she ought to marry the yeoman than to take steps for doing it and she went on living just as before only with a little more thoughtfulness in her eyes  two days after the visit to the camp when she was again in the garden soldier loveday said to her at a distance of five rows of beans and a parsleybed  you have heard the news miss garland  no said anne without looking up from a book she was reading  the king is coming tomorrow  the king she looked up then  yes to gloucester lodge and he will pass this way  he cant arrive till long past the middle of the night if what they say is true that he is timed to change horses at woodyates innbetween mid and south wessexat twelve oclock continued loveday encouraged by her interest to cut off the parsleybed from the distance between them  miller loveday came round the corner of the house  have ye heard about the king coming miss maidy anne he said  anne said that she had just heard of it and the trumpetmajor who hardly welcomed his father at such a moment explained what he knew of the matter  and you will go with your regiment to meet en i suppose said old loveday  young loveday said that the men of the german legion were to perform that duty  and turning half from his father and half towards anne he added in a tentative tone that he thought he might get leave for the night if anybody would like to be taken to the top of the ridgeway over which the royal party must pass  anne knowing by this time of the budding hope in the gallant dragoons mind and not wishing to encourage it said i dont want to go  the miller looked disappointed as well as john  your mother might like to  yes i am going indoors and ill ask her if you wish me to said she  she went indoors and rather coldly told her mother of the proposal  mrs garland though she had determined not to answer the millers question on matrimony just yet was quite ready for this jaunt and in spite of anne she sailed off at once to the garden to hear more about it  when she re entered she said  anne i have not seen the king or the kings horses for these many years and i am going  ah it is well to be you mother said anne in an elderly tone  then you wont come with us said mrs garland rather rebuffed  i have very different things to think of said her daughter with virtuous emphasis than going to see sights at that time of night  mrs garland was sorry but resolved to adhere to the arrangement  the night came on and it having gone abroad that the king would pass by the road many of the villagers went out to see the procession  when the two lovedays and mrs garland were gone anne bolted the door for security and sat down to think again on her grave responsibilities in the choice of a husband now that her natural guardian could no longer be trusted  a knock came to the door  annes instinct was at once to be silent that the comer might think the family had retired  the knocking person however was not to be easily persuaded  he had in fact seen rays of light over the top of the shutter and unable to get an answer went on to the door of the mill which was still going the miller sometimes grinding all night when busy  the grinder accompanied the stranger to mrs garlands door  the daughter is certainly at home sir said the grinder  ill go round to tother side and see if shes there master derriman  i want to take her out to see the king said festus  anne had started at the sound of the voice  no opportunity could have been better for carrying out her new convictions on the disposal of her hand  but in her mortal dislike of festus anne forgot her principles and her idea of keeping herself above the lovedays  tossing on her hat and blowing out the candle she slipped out at the back door and hastily followed in the direction that her mother and the rest had taken  she overtook them as they were beginning to climb the hill  what you have altered your mind after all said the widow  how came you to do that my dear  i thought i might as well come said anne  to be sure you did said the miller heartily  a good deal better than biding at home there  john said nothing though she could almost see through the gloom how glad he was that she had altered her mind  when they reached the ridge over which the highway stretched they found many of their neighbours who had got there before them idling on the grass border between the roadway and the hedge enjoying a sort of midnight picnic which it was easy to do the air being still and dry  some carriages were also standing near though most people of the district who possessed four wheels or even two had driven into the town to await the king there  from this height could be seen in the distance the position of the wateringplace an additional number of lanterns lamps and candles having been lighted to night by the loyal burghers to grace the royal entry if it should occur before dawn  mrs garland touched annes elbow several times as they walked and the young woman at last understood that this was meant as a hint to her to take the trumpetmajors arm which its owner was rather suggesting than offering to her  anne wondered what infatuation was possessing her mother declined to take the arm and contrived to get in front with the miller who mostly kept in the van to guide the others footsteps  the trumpetmajor was left with mrs garland and annes encouraging pursuit of them induced him to say a few words to the former  by your leave maam ill speak to you on something that concerns my mind very much indeed  certainly  it is my wish to be allowed to pay my addresses to your daughter  i thought you meant that said mrs garland simply  and youll not object  i shall leave it to her  i dont think she will agree even if i do  the soldier sighed and seemed helpless  well i can but ask her he said  the spot on which they had finally chosen to wait for the king was by a field gate whence the white road could be seen for a long distance northwards by day and some little distance now  they lingered and lingered but no king came to break the silence of that beautiful summer night  as halfhour after halfhour glided by and nobody came anne began to get weary she knew why her mother did not propose to go back and regretted the reason  she would have proposed it herself but that mrs garland seemed so cheerful and as wide awake as at noonday so that it was almost a cruelty to disturb her  the trumpetmajor at last made up his mind and tried to draw anne into a private conversation  the feeling which a week ago had been a vague and piquant aspiration was today altogether too lively for the reasoning of this warmhearted soldier to regulate  so he persevered in his intention to catch her alone and at last in spite of her manoeuvres to the contrary he succeeded  the miller and mrs garland had walked about fifty yards further on and anne and himself were left standing by the gate  but the gallant musicians soul was so much disturbed by tender vibrations and by the sense of his presumption that he could not begin and it may be questioned if he would ever have broached the subject at all had not a distant church clock opportunely assisted him by striking the hour of three  the trumpetmajor heaved a breath of relief  that clock strikes in g sharp he said  indeedg sharp said anne civilly  yes  tis a finetoned bell  i used to notice that note when i was a boy  did youthe very same  yes and since then i had a wager about that bell with the bandmaster of the north wessex militia  he said the note was g i said it wasnt  when we found it g sharp we didnt know how to settle it  it is not a deep note for a clock  o no  the finest tenor bell about here is the bell of peters casterbridgein e flat  tummmmthats the notetummmm  the trumpetmajor sounded from far down his throat what he considered to be e flat with a parenthetic sense of luxury unquenchable even by his present distraction  shall we go on to where my mother is said anne less impressed by the beauty of the note than the trumpetmajor himself was  in one minute he said tremulously  talking of musici fear you dont think the rank of a trumpetmajor much to compare with your own  i do  i think a trumpetmajor a very respectable man  i am glad to hear you say that  it is given out by the kings command that trumpetmajors are to be considered respectable  indeed  then i am by chance more loyal than i thought for  i get a good deal a year extra to the trumpeters because of my position  thats very nice  and i am not supposed ever to drink with the trumpeters who serve beneath me  naturally  and by the orders of the war office i am to exert over them thats the government word exert over them full authority and if any one behaves towards me with the least impropriety or neglects my orders he is to be confined and reported  it is really a dignified post she said with however a reserve of enthusiasm which was not altogether encouraging  and of course some day i shall stammered the dragoonshall be in rather a better position than i am at present  i am glad to hear it mr loveday  and in short mistress anne continued john loveday bravely and desperately may i pay court to you in the hope thatno no dont go awayyou havent heard yetthat you may make me the happiest of men not yet but when peace is proclaimed and all is smooth and easy again  i cant put it any better though theres more to be explained  this is most awkward said anne evidently with pain  i cannot possibly agree believe me mr loveday i cannot  but theres more than this  you would be surprised to see what snug rooms the married trumpet and sergeantmajors have in quarters  barracks are not all consider camp and war  that brings me to my strong point exclaimed the soldier hopefully  my father is better off than most noncommissioned officers fathers and theres always a home for you at his house in any emergency  i can tell you privately that he has enough to keep us both and if you wouldnt hear of barracks well peace once established id live at home as a miller and farmernext door to your own mother  my mother would be sure to object expostulated anne  no she leaves it all to you  what you have asked her said anne with surprise  yes  i thought it would not be honourable to act otherwise  thats very good of you said anne her face warming with a generous sense of his straightforwardness  but my mother is so entirely ignorant of a soldiers life and the life of a soldiers wifeshe is so simple in all such matters that i cannot listen to you any more readily for what she may say  then it is all over for me said the poor trumpetmajor wiping his face and putting away his handkerchief with an air of finality  anne was silent  any woman who has ever tried will know without explanation what an unpalatable task it is to dismiss even when she does not love him a man who has all the natural and moral qualities she would desire and only fails in the social  wouldbe lovers are not so numerous even with the best women that the sacrifice of one can be felt as other than a good thing wasted in a world where there are few good things  you are not angry miss garland said he finding that she did not speak  o no  dont let us say anything more about this now  and she moved on  when she drew near to the miller and her mother she perceived that they were engaged in a conversation of that peculiar kind which is all the more full and communicative from the fact of definitive words being few in short here the game was succeeding which with herself had failed  it was pretty clear from the symptoms marks tokens telegraphs and general byplay between widower and widow that miller loveday must have again said to mrs garland some such thing as he had said before with what result this time she did not know  as the situation was delicate anne halted awhile apart from them  the trumpetmajor quite ignorant of how his cause was entered into by the whitecoated man in the distance for his father had not yet told him of his designs upon mrs garland did not advance but stood still by the gate as though he were attending a princess waiting till he should be called up  thus they lingered and the day began to break  mrs garland and the miller took no heed of the time and what it was bringing to earth and sky so occupied were they with themselves but anne in her place and the trumpetmajor in his each in private thought of no bright kind watched the gradual glory of the east through all its tones and changes  the world of birds and insects got lively the blue and the yellow and the gold of lovedays uniform again became distinct the sun bored its way upward the fields the trees and the distant landscape kindled to flame and the trumpetmajor backed by a lilac shadow as tall as a steeple blazed in the rays like a very god of war  it was halfpast three oclock  a short time after a rattle of horses and wheels reached their ears from the quarter in which they gazed and there appeared upon the white line of road a moving mass which presently ascended the hill and drew near  then there arose a huzza from the few knots of watchers gathered there and they cried long live king jarge  the cortege passed abreast  it consisted of three travellingcarriages escorted by a detachment of the german legion  anne was told to look in the first carriagea postchariot drawn by four horsesfor the king and queen and was rewarded by seeing a profile reminding her of the current coin of the realm but as the party had been travelling all night and the spectators here gathered were few none of the royal family looked out of the carriage windows  it was said that the two elder princesses were in the same carriage but they remained invisible  the next vehicle a coach and four contained more princesses and the third some of their attendants  thank god i have seen my king said mrs garland when they had all gone by  nobody else expressed any thankfulness for most of them had expected a more pompous procession than the bucolic tastes of the king cared to indulge in and one old man said grimly that that sight of dusty old leather coaches was not worth waiting for  anne looked hither and thither in the bright rays of the day each of her eyes having a little sun in it which gave her glance a peculiar golden fire and kindled the brown curls grouped over her forehead to a yellow brilliancy and made single hairs blown astray by the night look like lacquered wires  she was wondering if festus were anywhere near but she could not see him  before they left the ridge they turned their attention towards the royal wateringplace which was visible at this place only as a portion of the seashore from which the nightmist was rolling slowly back  the sea beyond was still wrapped in summer fog the ships in the roads showing through it as black spiders suspended in the air  while they looked and walked a white jet of smoke burst from a spot which the miller knew to be the battery in front of the kings residence and then the report of guns reached their ears  this announcement was answered by a salute from the castle of the adjoining isle and the ships in the neighbouring anchorage  all the bells in the town began ringing  the king and his family had arrived     xii  how everybody great and small climbed to the top of the downs   as the days went on echoes of the life and bustle of the town reached the ears of the quiet people in overcombe hollowexciting and moving those unimportant natives as a groundswell moves the weeds in a cave travellingcarriages of all kinds and colours climbed and descended the road that led towards the seaside borough  some contained those personages of the kings suite who had not kept pace with him in his journey from windsor others were the coaches of aristocracy big and little whom news of the kings arrival drew thither for their own pleasure so that the highway as seen from the hills about overcombe appeared like an antwalka constant succession of dark spots creeping along its surface at nearly uniform rates of progress and all in one direction  the traffic and intelligence between camp and town passed in a measure over the villagers heads  it being summer time the miller was much occupied with business and the trumpetmajor was too constantly engaged in marching between the camp and gloucester lodge with the rest of the dragoons to bring his friends any news for some days  at last he sent a message that there was to be a review on the downs by the king and that it was fixed for the day following  this information soon spread through the village and country round and next morning the whole population of overcombeexcept two or three very old men and women a few babies and their nurses a cripple and corporal tullidgeascended the slope with the crowds from afar and awaited the events of the day  the miller wore his best coat on this occasion which meant a good deal an overcombe man in those days would have a best coat and keep it as a best coat half his life  the millers had seen five and twenty summers chiefly through the chinks of a clothesbox and was not at all shabby as yet though getting singular  but that could not be helped common coats and best coats were distinct species and never interchangeable  living so near the scene of the review he walked up the hill accompanied by mrs garland and anne as usual  it was a clear day with little wind stirring and the view from the downs one of the most extensive in the county was unclouded  the eye of any observer who cared for such things swept over the wavewashed town and the bay beyond and the isle with its pebble bank lying on the sea to the left of these like a great crouching animal tethered to the mainland  on the extreme east of the marine horizon st aldhelms head closed the scene the sea to the southward of that point glaring like a mirror under the sun  inland could be seen badbury rings where a beacon had been recently erected and nearer rainbarrow on egdon heath where another stood farther to the left bulbarrow where there was yet another  not far from this came nettlecombe tout to the west dogberry hill and blackon near to the foreground the beacon thereon being built of furze faggots thatched with straw and standing on the spot where the monument now raises its head  at nine oclock the troops marched upon the groundsome from the camps in the vicinity and some from quarters in the different towns round about  the approaches to the down were blocked with carriages of all descriptions ages and colours and with pedestrians of every class  at ten the royal personages were said to be drawing near and soon after the king accompanied by the dukes of cambridge and cumberland and a couple of generals appeared on horseback wearing a round hat turned up at the side with a cockade and military feather  sensation among the crowd then the queen and three of the princesses entered the field in a great coach drawn by six beautiful creamcoloured horses  another coach with four horses of the same sort brought the two remaining princesses confused acclamations theres king jarge thats queen sharlett princess lizabeth princesses sophiar and meelyer etc from the surrounding spectators  anne and her party were fortunate enough to secure a position on the top of one of the barrows which rose here and there on the down and the miller having gallantly constructed a little cairn of flints he placed the two women thereon by which means they were enabled to see over the heads horses and coaches of the multitudes below and around  at the marchpast the millers eye which had been wandering about for the purpose discovered his son in his place by the trumpeters who had moved forwards in two ranks and were sounding the march  thats john he cried to the widow  his trumpetsling is of two colours dye see and the others be plain  mrs garland too saw him now and enthusiastically admired him from her hands upwards and anne silently did the same  but before the young womans eyes had quite left the trumpetmajor they fell upon the figure of yeoman festus riding with his troop and keeping his face at a medium between haughtiness and mere bravery  he certainly looked as soldierly as any of his own corps and felt more soldierly than halfadozen as anybody could see by observing him  anne got behind the miller in case festus should discover her and regardless of his monarch rush upon her in a rage with why the devil did you run away from me that nighthey madam  but she resolved to think no more of him just now and to stick to loveday who was her mothers friend  in this she was helped by the stirring tones which burst from the latter gentleman and his subordinates from time to time  well said the miller complacently theres few of more consequence in a regiment than a trumpeter  hes the chap that tells em what to do after all  hey mrs garland  so he is miller said she  they could no more do without jack and his men than they could without generals  indeed they could not said mrs garland again in a tone of pleasant agreement with any one in great britain or ireland  it was said that the line that day was three miles long reaching from the high ground on the right of where the people stood to the turnpike road on the left  after the review came a sham fight during which action the crowd dispersed more widely over the downs enabling widow garland to get still clearer glimpses of the king and his handsome charger and the head of the queen and the elbows and shoulders of the princesses in the carriages and fractional parts of general garth and the duke of cumberland which sights gave her great gratification  she tugged at her daughter at every opportunity exclaiming now you can see his feather theres her hat theres her majestys india muslin shawl in a minor form of ecstasy that made the miller think her more girlish and animated than her daughter anne  in those military manoeuvres the miller followed the fortunes of one man anne garland of two  the spectators who unlike our party had no personal interest in the soldiery saw only troops and battalions in the concrete straight lines of red straight lines of blue white lines formed of innumerable kneebreeches black lines formed of many gaiters coming and going in kaleidoscopic change  who thought of every point in the line as an isolated man each dwelling all to himself in the hermitage of his own mind  one person did a young man far removed from the barrow where the garlands and miller loveday stood  the natural expression of his face was somewhat obscured by the bronzing effects of rough weather but the lines of his mouth showed that affectionate impulses were strong within himperhaps stronger than judgment well could regulate  he wore a blue jacket with little brass buttons and was plainly a seafaring man  meanwhile in the part of the plain where rose the tumulus on which the miller had established himself a broadbrimmed tradesman was elbowing his way along  he saw mr loveday from the base of the barrow and beckoned to attract his attention  loveday went halfway down and the other came up as near as he could  miller said the man a letter has been lying at the postoffice for you for the last three days  if i had known that i should see ye here id have brought it along with me  the miller thanked him for the news and they parted loveday returning to the summit  what a very strange thing he said to mrs garland who had looked inquiringly at his face now very grave  that was budmouth postmaster and he says theres a letter for me  ah i now call to mind that there was a letter in the candle three days ago this very nighta large red one but foolishlike i thought nothing ot  who can that letter be from  a letter at this time was such an event for hamleteers even of the millers respectable standing that loveday thenceforward was thrown into a fit of abstraction which prevented his seeing any more of the sham fight or the people or the king  mrs garland imbibed some of his concern and suggested that the letter might come from his son robert  i should naturally have thought that said miller loveday but he wrote to me only two months ago and his brother john heard from him within the last four weeks when he was just about starting on another voyage  if youll pardon me mrs garland maam ill see if theres any overcombe man here who is going to budmouth today so that i may get the letter by nighttime  i cannot possibly go myself  so mr loveday left them for awhile and as they were so near home mrs garland did not wait on the barrow for him to come back but walked about with anne a little time until they should be disposed to trot down the slope to their own door  they listened to a man who was offering one guinea to receive ten in case buonaparte should be killed in three months and to other entertainments of that nature which at this time were not rare  once during their peregrination the eyes of the sailor beforementioned fell upon anne but he glanced over her and passed her unheedingly by  loveday the elder was at this time on the other side of the line looking for a messenger to the town  at twelve oclock the review was over and the king and his family left the hill  the troops then cleared off the field the spectators followed and by one oclock the downs were again bare  they still spread their grassy surface to the sun as on that beautiful morning not historically speaking so very long ago but the king and his fifteen thousand armed men the horses the bands of music the princesses the creamcoloured teamsthe gorgeous centrepiece in short to which the downs were but the mere mount or marginhow entirely have they all passed and gonelying scattered about the world as military and other dust some at talavera albuera salamanca vittoria toulouse and waterloo some in home churchyards and a few small handfuls in royal vaults  in the afternoon john loveday lightened of his trumpet and trappings appeared at the old millhouse door and beheld anne standing at hers  i saw you miss garland said the soldier gaily  where was i said she smiling  on the top of the big moundto the right of the king  and i saw you lots of times she rejoined  loveday seemed pleased  did you really take the trouble to find me that was very good of you  her eyes followed you everywhere said mrs garland from an upper window  of course i looked at the dragoons most said anne disconcerted  and when i looked at them my eyes naturally fell upon the trumpets  i looked at the dragoons generally no more  she did not mean to show any vexation to the trumpetmajor but he fancied otherwise and stood repressed  the situation was relieved by the arrival of the miller still looking serious  i am very much concerned john i did not go to the review for nothing theres a letter awaiting for me at budmouth and i must get it before bedtime or i shant sleep a wink  ill go of course said john and perhaps miss garland would like to see whats doing there today  everybody is gone or going the road is like a fair  he spoke pleadingly but anne was not won to assent  you can drive in the gig twill do blossom good said the miller  let david drive miss garland said the trumpetmajor not wishing to coerce her i would just as soon walk  anne joyfully welcomed this arrangement and a time was fixed for the start     xiii  the conversation in the crowd   in the afternoon they drove off john loveday being nowhere visible  all along the road they passed and were overtaken by vehicles of all descriptions going in the same direction among them the extraordinary machines which had been invented for the conveyance of troops to any point of the coast on which the enemy should land they consisted of four boards placed across a sort of trolly thirty men of the volunteer companies riding on each  the popular georgian wateringplace was in a paroxysm of gaiety  the town was quite overpowered by the country round much to the towns delight and profit  the fear of invasion was such that six frigates lay in the roads to ensure the safety of the royal family and from the regiments of horse and foot quartered at the barracks or encamped on the hills round about a picket of a thousand men mounted guard every day in front of gloucester lodge where the king resided  when anne and her attendant reached this point which they did on foot stabling the horse on the outskirts of the town it was about six oclock  the king was on the esplanade and the soldiers were just marching past to mount guard the band formed in front of the king and all the officers saluted as they went by  anne now felt herself close to and looking into the stream of recorded history within whose banks the littlest things are great and outside which she and the general bulk of the human race were content to live on as an unreckoned unheeded superfluity  when she turned from her interested gaze at this scene there stood john loveday  she had had a presentiment that he would turn up in this mysterious way  it was marvellous that he could have got there so quickly but there he wasnot looking at the king or at the crowd but waiting for the turn of her head  trumpetmajor i didnt see you said anne demurely  how is it that your regiment is not marching past  we take it by turns and it is not our turn said loveday  she wanted to know then if they were afraid that the king would be carried off by the first consul  yes loveday told her and his majesty was rather venturesome  a day or two before he had gone so far to sea that he was nearly caught by some of the enemys cruisers  he is anxious to fight boney singlehanded he said  what a good brave king said anne  loveday seemed anxious to come to more personal matters  will you let me take you round to the other side where you can see better he asked the queen and the princesses are at the window  anne passively assented  david wait here for me she said i shall be back again in a few minutes  the trumpetmajor then led her off triumphantly and they skirted the crowd and came round on the side towards the sands  he told her everything he could think of military and civil to which anne returned pretty syllables and parenthetic words about the colour of the sea and the curl of the foama way of speaking that moved the soldiers heart even more than long and direct speeches would have done  and that other thing i asked you he ventured to say at last  we wont speak of it  you dont dislike me  o no she said gazing at the bathingmachines digging children and other common objects of the seashore as if her interest lay there rather than with him  but i am not worthy of the daughter of a genteel professional manthats what you mean  theres something more than worthiness required in such cases you know she said still without calling her mind away from surrounding scenes  ah there are the queen and princesses at the window  something more  well since you will make me speak i mean the woman ought to love the man  the trumpetmajor seemed to be less concerned about this than about her supposed superiority  if it were all right on that point would you mind the other he asked like a man who knows he is too persistent yet who cannot be still  how can i say when i dont know  what a pretty chip hat the elder princess wears  her companions general disappointment extended over him almost to his lace and his plume  your mother said you know miss anne  yes thats the worst of it she said  let us go back to david i have seen all i want to see mr loveday  the mass of the people had by this time noticed the queen and princesses at the window and raised a cheer to which the ladies waved their embroidered handkerchiefs  anne went back towards the pavement with her trumpetmajor whom all the girls envied her so finelooking a soldier was he and not only for that but because it was well known that he was not a soldier from necessity but from patriotism his father having repeatedly offered to set him up in business his artistic taste in preferring a horse and uniform to a dirty rumbling flourmill was admired by all  she too had a very nice appearance in her best clothes as she walked alongthe sarcenet hat muslin shawl and tightsleeved gown being of the newest overcombe fashion that was only about a year old in the adjoining town and in london three or four  she could not be harsh to loveday and dismiss him curtly for his musical pursuits had refined him educated him and made him quite poetical  today he had been particularly wellmannered and tender so instead of answering never speak to me like this again she merely put him off with a let us go back to david  when they reached the place where they had left him david was gone  anne was now positively vexed  what shall i do she said  hes only gone to drink the kings health said loveday who had privately given david the money for performing that operation  depend upon it hell be back soon  will you go and find him said she with intense propriety in her looks and tone  i will said loveday reluctantly and he went  anne stood still  she could now escape her gallant friend for although the distance was long it was not impossible to walk home  on the other hand loveday was a good and sincere fellow for whom she had almost a brotherly feeling and she shrank from such a trick  while she stood and mused scarcely heeding the music the marching of the soldiers the king the dukes the brilliant staff the attendants and the happy groups of people her eyes fell upon the ground  before her she saw a flower lyinga crimson sweetwilliamfresh and uninjured  an instinctive wish to save it from destruction by the passengers feet led her to pick it up and then moved by a sudden self consciousness she looked around  she was standing before an inn and from an upper window festus derriman was leaning with two or three kindred spirits of his cut and kind  he nodded eagerly and signified to her that he had thrown the flower  what should she do  to throw it away would seem stupid and to keep it was awkward  she held it between her finger and thumb twirled it round on its axis and twirled it back again regarding and yet not examining it  just then she saw the trumpetmajor coming back  i cant find david anywhere he said and his heart was not sorry as he said it  anne was still holding out the sweetwilliam as if about to drop it and scarcely knowing what she did under the distressing sense that she was watched she offered the flower to loveday  his face brightened with pleasure as he took it  thank you indeed he said  then anne saw what a misleading blunder she had committed towards loveday in playing to the yeoman  perhaps she had sown the seeds of a quarrel  it was not my sweetwilliam she said hastily it was lying on the ground  i dont mean anything by giving it to you  but ill keep it all the same said the innocent soldier as if he knew a good deal about womankind and he put the flower carefully inside his jacket between his white waistcoat and his heart  festus seeing this enlarged himself wrathfully got hot in the face rose to his feet and glared down upon them like a turniplantern  let us go away said anne timorously  ill see you safe to your own door depend upon me said loveday buti had near forgottheres fathers letter that hes so anxiously waiting for  will you come with me to the postoffice  then ill take you straight home  anne expecting festus to pounce down every minute was glad to be off anywhere so she accepted the suggestion and they went along the parade together  loveday set this down as a proof of annes relenting  thus in joyful spirits he entered the office paid the postage and received the letter  it is from bob after all he said  father told me to read it at once in case of bad news  ask your pardon for keeping you a moment  he broke the seal and read anne standing silently by  he is coming home to be married said the trumpetmajor without looking up  anne did not answer  the blood swept impetuously up her face at his words and as suddenly went away again leaving her rather paler than before  she disguised her agitation and then overcame it loveday observing nothing of this emotional performance  as far as i can understand he will be here saturday he said  indeed said anne quite calmly  and who is he going to marry  that i dont know said john turning the letter about  the woman is a stranger  at this moment the miller entered the office hastily  come john he cried i have been waiting and waiting for that there letter till i was nigh crazy  john briefly explained the news and when his father had recovered from his astonishment taken off his hat and wiped the exact line where his forehead joined his hair he walked with anne up the street leaving john to return alone  the miller was so absorbed in his mental perspective of bobs marriage that he saw nothing of the gaieties they passed through and anne seemed also so much impressed by the same intelligence that she crossed before the inn occupied by festus without showing a recollection of his presence there     xiv  later in the evening of the same day   when they reached home the sun was going down  it had already been noised abroad that miller loveday had received a letter and his cart having been heard coming up the lane the population of overcombe drew down towards the mill as soon as he had gone indoorsa sudden flash of brightness from the window showing that he had struck such an early light as nothing but the immediate deciphering of literature could require letters were matters of public moment and everybody in the parish had an interest in the reading of those rare documents so that when the miller had placed the candle slanted himself and called in mrs garland to have her opinion on the meaning of any hieroglyphics that he might encounter in his course he found that he was to be additionally assisted by the opinions of the other neighbours whose persons appeared in the doorway partly covering each other like a hand of cards yet each showing a large enough piece of himself for identification  to pass the time while they were arranging themselves the miller adopted his usual way of filling up casual intervals that of snuffing the candle  we heard you had got a letter maister loveday they said  yes southampton the twelfth of august dear father said loveday and they were as silent as relations at the reading of a will  anne for whom the letter had a singular fascination came in with her mother and sat down  bob stated in his own way that having since landing taken into consideration his fathers wish that he should renounce a seafaring life and become a partner in the mill he had decided to agree to the proposal and with that object in view he would return to overcombe in three days from the time of writing  he then said incidentally that since his voyage he had been in lodgings at southampton and during that time had become acquainted with a lovely and virtuous young maiden in whom he found the exact qualities necessary to his happiness  having known this lady for the full space of a fortnight he had had ample opportunities of studying her character and being struck with the recollection that if there was one thing more than another necessary in a mill which had no mistress it was somebody who could play that part with grace and dignity he had asked miss matilda johnson to be his wife  in her kindness she though sacrificing far better prospects had agreed and he could not but regard it as a happy chance that he should have found at the nick of time such a woman to adorn his home whose innocence was as stunning as her beauty  without much ado therefore he and she had arranged to be married at once and at overcombe that his father might not be deprived of the pleasures of the wedding feast  she had kindly consented to follow him by land in the course of a few days and to live in the house as their guest for the week or so previous to the ceremony  tis a proper good letter said mrs comfort from the background  i never heerd true love better put out of hand in my life and they seem nation fond of one another  he havent knowed her such a very long time said job mitchell dubiously  thats nothing said esther beach  nater will find her way very rapid when the times come fort  well tis good news for ye miller  yes sure i hope tis said loveday without however showing any great hurry to burst into the frantic form of fatherly joy which the event should naturally have produced seeming more disposed to let off his feelings by examining thoroughly into the fibres of the letterpaper  i was five years acourting my wife he presently remarked  but folks were slower about everything in them days  well since shes coming we must make her welcome  did any of ye catch by my reading which day it is he means  what with making out the penmanship my mind was drawn off from the sense here and there  he says in three days said mrs garland  the date of the letter will fix it  on examination it was found that the day appointed was the one nearly expired at which the miller jumped up and said then hell be here before bedtime  i didnt gather till now that he was coming afore saturday  why he may drop in this very minute  he had scarcely spoken when footsteps were heard coming along the front and they presently halted at the door  loveday pushed through the neighbours and rushed out and seeing in the passage a form which obscured the declining light the miller seized hold of him saying o my dear bob then you are come  scrounch it all miller dont quite pull my poor shoulder out of joint whatever is the matter said the newcomer trying to release himself from lovedays grasp of affection  it was uncle benjy  thought twas my son faltered the miller sinking back upon the toes of the neighbours who had closely followed him into the entry  well come in mr derriman and make yerself at home  why you havent been here for years  whatever has made you come now sir of all times in the world  is he in there with ye whispered the farmer with misgiving  who  my nephew after that maid that hes so mighty smit with  o no he never calls here  farmer derriman breathed a breath of relief  well ive called to tell ye he said that theres more news of the french  we shall have em here this month as sure as a gun  the gunboats be all readynear two thousand of emand the whole army is at boulogne  and miller i know ye to be an honest man  loveday did not say nay  neighbour loveday i know ye to be an honest man repeated the old squireen  can i speak to ye alone  as the house was full loveday took him into the garden all the while upon tenterhooks not lest buonaparte should appear in their midst but lest bob should come whilst he was not there to receive him  when they had got into a corner uncle benjy said miller what with the french and what with my nephew festus i assure ye my life is nothing but wherrit from morning to night  miller loveday you are an honest man  loveday nodded  well ive come to ask a favourto ask if you will take charge of my few poor titledeeds and documents and suchlike while i am away from home next week lest anything should befall me and they should be stole away by boney or festus and i should have nothing left in the wide world  i can trust neither banks nor lawyers in these terrible times and i am come to you  loveday after some hesitation agreed to take care of anything that derriman should bring whereupon the farmer said he would call with the parchments and papers alluded to in the course of a week  derriman then went away by the garden gate mounted his pony which had been tethered outside and rode on till his form was lost in the shades  the miller rejoined his friends and found that in the meantime john had arrived  john informed the company that after parting from his father and anne he had rambled to the harbour and discovered the pewit by the quay  on inquiry he had learnt that she came in at eleven oclock and that bob had gone ashore  well go and meet him said the miller  tis still light out of doors  so as the dew rose from the meads and formed fleeces in the hollows loveday and his friends and neighbours strolled out and loitered by the stiles which hampered the footpath from overcombe to the high road at intervals of a hundred yards  john loveday being obliged to return to camp was unable to accompany them but widow garland thought proper to fall in with the procession  when she had put on her bonnet she called to her daughter  anne said from upstairs that she was coming in a minute and her mother walked on without her  what was anne doing  having hastily unlocked a receptacle for emotional objects of small size she took thence the little folded paper with which we have already become acquainted and striking a light from her private tinderbox she held the paper and curl of hair it contained in the candle till they were burnt  then she put on her hat and followed her mother and the rest of them across the moist grey fields cheerfully singing in an undertone as she went to assure herself of her indifference to circumstances     xv  captain bob loveday of the merchant service   while loveday and his neighbours were thus rambling forth full of expectancy some of them including anne in the rear heard the crackling of light wheels along the curved lane to which the path was the chord  at once anne thought perhaps thats he and we are missing him  but recent events were not of a kind to induce her to say anything and the others of the company did not reflect on the sound  had they gone across to the hedge which hid the lane and looked through it they would have seen a light cart driven by a boy beside whom was seated a seafaring man apparently of good standing in the merchant service with his feet outside on the shaft  the vehicle went over the main bridge turned in upon the other bridge at the tail of the mill and halted by the door  the sailor alighted showing himself to be a well shaped active and fine young man with a bright eye an anonymous nose and of such a rich complexion by exposure to ripening suns that he might have been some connexion of the foreigner who calls his likeness the portrait of a gentleman in galleries of the old masters  yet in spite of this and though bob loveday had been all over the world from cape horn to pekin and from indias coral strand to the white sea the most conspicuous of all the marks that he had brought back with him was an increased resemblance to his mother who had lain all the time beneath overcombe church wall  captain loveday tried the house door finding this locked he went to the mill door this was locked also the mill being stopped for the night  they are not at home he said to the boy  but never mind that  just help to unload the things and then ill pay you and you can drive off home  the cart was unloaded and the boy was dismissed thanking the sailor profusely for the payment rendered  then bob loveday finding that he had still some leisure on his hands looked musingly east west north south and nadir after which he bestirred himself by carrying his goods article by article round to the back door out of the way of casual passers  this done he walked round the mill in a more regardful attitude and surveyed its familiar features one by onethe panes of the grindingroom now as heretofore clouded with flour as with stale hoar frost the meal lodged in the corners of the windowsills forming a soil in which lichens grew without ever getting any bigger as they had done since his smallest infancy the mosses on the plinth towards the river reaching as high as the capillary power of the walls would fetch up moisture for their nourishment and the penned millpond now as ever on the point of overflowing into the garden  everything was the same  when he had had enough of this it occurred to loveday that he might get into the house in spite of the locked doors and by entering the garden placing a pole from the fork of an appletree to the windowsill of a bedroom on that side and climbing across like a barbary ape he entered the window and stepped down inside  there was something anomalous in being close to the familiar furniture without having first seen his father and its silent impassive shine was not cheering it was as if his relations were all dead and only their tables and chests of drawers left to greet him  he went downstairs and seated himself in the dark parlour  finding this place too rather solitary and the tick of the invisible clock preternaturally loud he unearthed the tinderbox obtained a light and set about making the house comfortable for his fathers return divining that the miller had gone out to meet him by the wrong road  roberts interest in this work increased as he proceeded and he bustled round and round the kitchen as lightly as a girl  david the indoor factotum having lost himself among the quart pots of budmouth there had been nobody left here to prepare supper and bob had it all to himself in a short time a fire blazed up the chimney a tablecloth was found the plates were clapped down and a search made for what provisions the house afforded which in addition to various meats included some fresh eggs of the elongated shape that produces cockerels when hatched and had been set aside on that account for putting under the next broody hen  a more reckless cracking of eggs than that which now went on had never been known in overcombe since the last large christening and as loveday gashed one on the side another at the end another longways and another diagonally he acquired adroitness by practice and at last made every son of a hen of them fall into two hemispheres as neatly as if it opened by a hinge  from eggs he proceeded to ham and from ham to kidneys the result being a brilliant fry  not to be tempted to fall to before his father came back the returned navigator emptied the whole into a dish laid a plate over the top his coat over the plate and his hat over his coat  thus completely stopping in the appetizing smell he sat down to await events  he was relieved from the tediousness of doing this by hearing voices outside and in a minute his father entered  glad to welcome ye home father said bob  and supper is just ready  lard lardwhy captain bobs here said mrs garland  and weve been out waiting to meet thee said the miller as he entered the room followed by representatives of the houses of cripplestraw comfort mitchell beach and snooks together with some small beginnings of fencible tremletts posterity  in the rear came david and quite in the vanishingpoint of the composition anne the fair  i drove over and so was forced to come by the road said bob  and we went across the fields thinking youd walk said his father  i should have been here this morning but not so much as a wheelbarrow could i get for my traps everything was gone to the review  so i went too thinking i might meet you there  i was then obliged to return to the harbour for the luggage  then there was a welcoming of captain bob by pulling out his arms like drawers and shutting them again smacking him on the back as if he were choking holding him at arms length as if he were of too large type to read close  all which persecution bob bore with a wide genial smile that was shaken into fragments and scattered promiscuously among the spectators  get a chair for n said the miller to david whom they had met in the fields and found to have got nothing worse by his absence than a slight slant in his walk  never mindi am not tiredi have been here ever so long said bob and i  but the chair having been placed behind him and a smart touch in the hollow of a persons knee by the edge of that piece of furniture having a tendency to make the person sit without further argument bob sank down dumb and the others drew up other chairs at a convenient nearness for easy analytic vision and the subtler forms of good fellowship  the miller went about saying david the nine best glasses from the corner cupboarddavid the corkscrewdavid whisk the tail of thy smockfrock round the inside of these quart pots afore you draw drink in emthey be an inch thick in dustdavid lower that chimneycrook a couple of notches that the flame may touch the bottom of the kettle and light three more of the largest candlesif you cant get the cork out of the jar david bore a hole in the tub of hollands thats buried under the scroff in the fuelhouse dye heardan brown left en there yesterday as a return for the little porker i gied en  when they had all had a thimbleful round and the superfluous neighbours had reluctantly departed one by one the inmates gave their minds to the supper which david had begun to serve up  what be you rolling back the tablecloth for david said the miller  maister bob have put down one of the under sheets by mistake and i thought you might not like it sir as theres ladies present  faith twas the first thing that came to hand said robert  it seemed a tablecloth to me  never minddont pull off the things now hes laid em downlet it bide said the miller  but wheres widow garland and maidy anne  they were here but a minute ago said david  depend upon it they have slinked off cause they be shy  the miller at once went round to ask them to come back and sup with him and while he was gone david told bob in confidence what an excellent place he had for an old man  yes capn bob as i suppose i must call ye ive worked for yer father these eightandthirty years and we have always got on very well together  trusts me with all the keys lends me his sleevewaistcoat and leaves the house entirely to me  widow garland next door too is just the same with me and treats me as if i was her own child  she must have married young to make you that david  yes yesim years older than she  tis only my common way of speaking  mrs garland would not come in to supper and the meal proceeded without her bob recommending to his father the dish he had cooked in the manner of a householder to a stranger just come  the miller was anxious to know more about his sons plans for the future but would not for the present interrupt his eating looking up from his own plate to appreciate bobs travelled way of putting english victuals out of sight as he would have looked at a mill on improved principles  david had only just got the table clear and set the plates in a row under the bakehouse table for the cats to lick when the door was hastily opened and mrs garland came in looking concerned  i have been waiting to hear the plates removed to tell you how frightened we are at something we hear at the backdoor  it seems like robbers muttering but when i look out theres nobody there  this must be seen to said the miller rising promptly  david light the middlesized lantern  ill go and search the garden  and ill go too said his son taking up a cudgel  lucky ive come home just in time  they went out stealthily followed by the widow and anne who had been afraid to stay alone in the house under the circumstances  no sooner were they beyond the door when sure enough there was the muttering almost close at hand and low upon the ground as from persons lying down in hiding  bless my heart said bob striking his head as though it were some enemys why tis my luggage  id quite forgot it  what asked his father  my luggage  really if it hadnt been for mrs garland it would have stayed there all night and they poor things would have been starved ive got all sorts of articles for ye  you go inside and ill bring em in  tis parrots that you hear a muttering mrs garland  you neednt be afraid any more  parrots said the miller  well im glad tis no worse  but how couldst forget so bob  the packages were taken in by david and bob and the first unfastened were three wrapped in cloths which being stripped off revealed three cages with a gorgeous parrot in each  this one is for you father to hang up outside the door and amuse us said bob  hell talk very well but hes sleepy tonight  this other one i brought along for any neighbour that would like to have him  his colours are not so bright but tis a good bird  if you would like to have him you are welcome to him he said turning to anne who had been tempted forward by the birds  you have hardly spoken yet miss anne but i recollect you very well  how much taller you have got to be sure  anne said she was much obliged but did not know what she could do with such a present  mrs garland accepted it for her and the sailor went onnow this other bird i hardly know what to do with but i dare say hell come in for something or other  he is by far the prettiest said the widow  i would rather have it than the other if you dont mind  yes said bob with embarrassment  but the fact is that bird will hardly do for ye maam  hes a hard swearer to tell the truth and i am afraid hes too old to be broken of it  how dreadful said mrs garland  we could keep him in the mill suggested the miller  it wont matter about the grinder hearing him for he cant learn to cuss worse than he do already  the grinder shall have him then said bob  the one i have given you maam has no harm in him at all  you might take him to church o sundays as far as that goes  the sailor now untied a small wooden box about a foot square perforated with holes  here are two marmosets he continued  you cant see them tonight but they are beautiesthe tufted sort  whats a marmoset said the miller  o a little kind of monkey  they bite strangers rather hard but youll soon get used to em  they are wrapped up in something i declare said mrs garland peeping in through a chink  yes thats my flannel shirt said bob apologetically  they suffer terribly from cold in this climate poor things and i had nothing better to give them  well now in this next box ive got things of different sorts  the latter was a regular seamans chest and out of it he produced shells of many sizes and colours carved ivories queer little caskets gorgeous feathers and several silk handkerchiefs which articles were spread out upon all the available tables and chairs till the house began to look like a bazaar  what a lovely shawl exclaimed widow garland in her interest forestalling the regular exhibition by looking into the box at what was coming  o yes said the mate pulling out a couple of the most bewitching shawls that eyes ever saw  one of these i am going to give to that young lady i am shortly to be married to you know mrs garland  has father told you about it  matilda johnson of southampton thats her name  yes we know all about it said the widow  well i shall give one of these shawls to herbecause of course i ought to  of course said she  but the other one ive got no use for at all and he continued looking round will you have it miss anne  you refused the parrot and you ought not to refuse this  thank you said anne calmly but much distressed but really i dont want it and couldnt take it  but do have it said bob in hurt tones mrs garland being all the while on tenterhooks lest anne should persist in her absurd refusal  why theres another reason why you ought to said he his face lighting up with recollections  it never came into my head till this moment that i used to be your beau in a humble sort of way  faith so i did and we used to meet at places sometimes didnt wethat is when you were not too proud and once i gave you or somebody else a bit of my hair in fun  it was somebody else said anne quickly  ah perhaps it was said bob innocently  but it was you i used to meet or try to i am sure  well ive never thought of that boyish time for years till this minute  i am sure you ought to accept some one gift dear out of compliment to those old times  anne drew back and shook her head for she would not trust her voice  well mrs garland then you shall have it said bob tossing the shawl to that ready receiver  if you dont upon my life i will throw it out to the first beggar i see  now heres a parcel of cap ribbons of the splendidest sort i could get  have thesedo anne  yes do said mrs garland  i promised them to matilda continued bob but i am sure she wont want em as she has got some of her own and i would as soon see them upon your head my dear as upon hers  i think you had better keep them for your bride if you have promised them to her said mrs garland mildly  it wasnt exactly a promise  i just said til theres some cap ribbons in my box if you would like to have them  but shes got enough things already for any bride in creation  anne now you shall have emupon my soul you shallor ill fling them down the milltail  anne had meant to be perfectly firm in refusing everything for reasons obvious even to that poor waif the meanest capacity but when it came to this point she was absolutely compelled to give in and reluctantly received the cap ribbons in her arms blushing fitfully and with her lip trembling in a motion which she tried to exhibit as a smile  what would tilly say if she knew said the miller slily  yes indeedand it is wrong of him anne instantly cried tears running down her face as she threw the parcel of ribbons on the floor youd better bestow your gifts where you bestow your lllove mr lovedaythats what i say  and anne turned her back and went away  ill take them for her said mrs garland quickly picking up the parcel  now thats a pity said bob looking regretfully after anne  i didnt remember that she was a quicktempered sort of girl at all  tell her mrs garland that i ask her pardon  but of course i didnt know she was too proud to accept a little presenthow should i  upon my life if it wasnt for matilda idwell that cant be of course  whats this said mrs garland touching with her foot a large package that had been laid down by bob unseen  thats a bit of baccy for myself said robert meekly  the examination of presents at last ended and the two families parted for the night  when they were alone mrs garland said to anne what a close girl you are  i am sure i never knew that bob loveday and you had walked together you must have been mere children  o yesso we were said anne now quite recovered  it was when we first came here about a year after father died  we did not walk together in any regular way  you know i have never thought the lovedays high enough for me  it was only justnothing at all and i had almost forgotten it  it is to be hoped that somebodys sins were forgiven her that night before she went to bed  when bob and his father were left alone the miller said well robert about this young woman of thinematilda whats her name  yes fathermatilda johnson  i was just going to tell ye about her  the miller nodded and sipped his mug  well she is an excellent body continued bob that can truly be saida real charmer you knowa nice good comely young woman a miracle of genteel breeding you know and all that  she can throw her hair into the nicest curls and shes got splendid gowns and headclothes  in short you might call her a land mermaid  shell make such a firstrate wife as there never was  no doubt she will said the miller for i have never known thee wanting in sense in a jineral way  he turned his cup round on its axis till the handle had travelled a complete circle  how long did you say in your letter that you had known her  a fortnight  not very long  it dont sound long tis true and twas really longertwas fifteen days and a quarter  but hang it father i could see in the twinkling of an eye that the girl would do  i know a woman well enough when i see heri ought to indeed having been so much about the world  now for instance theres widow garland and her daughter  the girl is a nice little thing but the old womano no  bob shook his head  what of her said his father slightly shifting in his chair  well shes shesi mean i should never have chose her you know shes of a nice disposition and young for a widow with a grownup daughter but if all the men had been like me she would never have had a husband  i like her in some respects but shes a style of beauty i dont care for  o if tis only looks you are thinking of said the miller much relieved theres nothing to be said of course  though theres many a duchess worselooking if it comes to argument as you would find my son he added with a sense of having been mollified too soon  the mates thoughts were elsewhere by this time  as to my marrying matilda thinks i heres one of the very genteelest sort and i may as well do the job at once  so i chose her  shes a dear girl theres nobody like her search where you will  how many did you choose her out from inquired his father  well she was the only young woman i happened to know in southampton thats true  but what of that  it would have been all the same if i had known a hundred  her father is in business near the docks i suppose  well no  in short i didnt see her father  her mother  her mother  no i didnt  i think her mother is dead but she has got a very rich aunt living at melchester  i didnt see her aunt because there wasnt time to go but of course we shall know her when we are married  yes yes of course said the miller trying to feel quite satisfied and she will soon be here  ay shes coming soon said bob  she has gone to this aunts at melchester to get her things packed and suchlike or she would have come with me  i am going to meet the coach at the kings arms casterbridge on sunday at one oclock  to show what a capital sort of wife shell be i may tell you that she wanted to come by the mercury because tis a little cheaper than the other  but i said for once in your life do it well and come by the royal mail and ill pay  i can have the pony and trap to fetch her i suppose as tis too far for her to walk  of course you can bob or anything else  and ill do all i can to give you a good wedding feast     xvi  they make ready for the illustrious stranger   preparations for matildas welcome and for the event which was to follow at once occupied the attention of the mill  the miller and his man had but dim notions of housewifery on any large scale so the great wedding cleaning was kindly supervised by mrs garland bob being mostly away during the day with his brother the trumpetmajor on various errands one of which was to buy paint and varnish for the gig that matilda was to be fetched in which he had determined to decorate with his own hands  by the widows direction the old familiar incrustation of shining dirt imprinted along the back of the settle by the heads of countless jolly sitters was scrubbed and scraped away the brown circle round the nail whereon the miller hung his hat stained by the brim in wet weather was whitened over the tawny smudges of bygone shoulders in the passage were removed without regard to a certain genial and historical value which they had acquired  the face of the clock coated with verdigris as thick as a diachylon plaister was rubbed till the figures emerged into day while inside the case of the same chronometer the cobwebs that formed triangular hammocks which the pendulum could hardly wade through were cleared away at one swoop  mrs garland also assisted at the invasion of wormeaten cupboards where layers of ancient smells lingered on in the stagnant air and recalled to the reflective nose the many good things that had been kept there  the upper floors were scrubbed with such abundance of water that the oldestablished deathwatches woodlice and flourworms were all drowned the suds trickling down into the room below in so lively and novel a manner as to convey the romantic notion that the miller lived in a cave with dripping stalactites  they moved what had never been moved beforethe oak coffer containing the millers wardrobea tremendous weight what with its locks hinges nails dirt framework and the hard stratification of old jackets waistcoats and kneebreeches at the bottom never disturbed since the millers wife died and half pulverized by the moths whose flattened skeletons lay amid the mass in thousands  it fairly makes my back open and shut said loveday as in obedience to mrs garlands direction he lifted one corner the grinder and david assisting at the others  all together speak when ye be going to heave now  the pot covers and skimmers were brought to such a state that on examining them the beholder was not conscious of utensils but of his own face in a condition of hideous elasticity  the broken clockline was mended the kettles rocked the creeper nailed up and a new handle put to the warmingpan  the large household lantern was cleaned out after three years of uninterrupted accumulation the operation yielding a conglomerate of candlesnuffs candleends remains of matches lampblack and eleven ounces and a half of good greaseinvaluable as dubbing for skitty boots and ointment for cartwheels  everybody said that the mill residence had not been so thoroughly scoured for twenty years  the miller and david looked on with a sort of awe tempered by gratitude tacitly admitting by their gaze that this was beyond what they had ever thought of  mrs garland supervised all with disinterested benevolence  it would never have done she said for his future daughterinlaw to see the house in its original state  she would have taken a dislike to him and perhaps to bob likewise  why dont ye come and live here with me and then you would be able to see to it at all times said the miller as she bustled about again  to which she answered that she was considering the matter and might in good time  he had previously informed her that his plan was to put bob and his wife in the part of the house that she mrs garland occupied as soon as she chose to enter his which relieved her of any fear of being incommoded by matilda  the cooking for the wedding festivities was on a proportionate scale of thoroughness  they killed the four supernumerary chickens that had just begun to crow and the little curlytailed barrow pig in preference to the sow not having been put up fattening for more than five weeks it was excellent small meat and therefore more delicate and likely to suit a townbred ladys taste than the large one which having reached the weight of fourteen score might have been a little gross to a cultured palate  there were also provided a cold chine stuffed veal and two pigeon pies  also thirty rings of blackpot a dozen of whitepot and ten knots of tender and wellwashed chitterlings cooked plain in case she should like a change  as additional reserves there were sweetbreads and five milts sewed up at one side in the form of a chrysalis and stuffed with thyme sage parsley mint groats rice milk chopped egg and other ingredients they were afterwards roasted before a slow fire and eaten hot  the business of chopping so many herbs for the various stuffings was found to be aching work for women and david the miller the grinder and the grinders boy being fully occupied in their proper branches and bob being very busy painting the gig and touching up the harness loveday called in a friendly dragoon of johns regiment who was passing by and he being a muscular man willingly chopped all the afternoon for a quart of strong judiciously administered and all other victuals found taking off his jacket and gloves rolling up his shirtsleeves and unfastening his collar in an honourable and energetic way  all windfalls and maggotcored codlins were excluded from the apple pies and as there was no known dish large enough for the purpose the puddings were stirred up in the milkingpail and boiled in the threelegged bell metal crock of great weight and antiquity which every travelling tinker for the previous thirty years had tapped with his stick coveted made a bid for and often attempted to steal  in the liquor line loveday laid in an ample barrel of casterbridge strong beer  this renowned drinknow almost as much a thing of the past as falstaffs favourite beveragewas not only well calculated to win the hearts of soldiers blown dry and dusty by residence in tents on a hilltop but of any wayfarer whatever in that land  it was of the most beautiful colour that the eye of an artist in beer could desire full in body yet brisk as a volcano piquant yet without a twang luminous as an autumn sunset free from streakiness of taste but finally rather heady  the masses worshipped it the minor gentry loved it more than wine and by the most illustrious county families it was not despised anybody brought up for being drunk and disorderly in the streets of its natal borough had only to prove that he was a stranger to the place and its liquor to be honourably dismissed by the magistrates as one overtaken in a fault that no man could guard against who entered the town unawares  in addition mr loveday also tapped a hogshead of fine cider that he had had mellowing in the house for several months having bought it of an honest downcountry man who did not colour for any special occasion like the present  it had been pressed from fruit judiciously chosen by an old handhorner and cleeves apple for the body a few tomputts for colour and just a dash of old fivecorners for sparklea selection originally made to please the palate of a wellknown temperate earl who was a regular ciderdrinker and lived to be eightyeight  on the morning of the sunday appointed for her coming captain bob loveday set out to meet his bride  he had been all the week engaged in painting the gig assisted by his brother at odd times and it now appeared of a gorgeous yellow with blue streaks and tassels at the corners and red wheels outlined with a darker shade  he put in the pony at halfpast eleven anne looking at him from the door as he packed himself into the vehicle and drove off  there may be young women who look out at young men driving to meet their brides as anne looked at captain bob and yet are quite indifferent to the circumstances but they are not often met with  so much dust had been raised on the highway by traffic resulting from the presence of the court at the town further on that brambles hanging from the fence and giving a friendly scratch to the wanderers face were dingy as church cobwebs and the grass on the margin had assumed a paper shaving hue  bobs father had wished him to take david lest from want of recent experience at the whip he should meet with any mishap but picturing to himself the awkwardness of three in such circumstances bob would not hear of this and nothing more serious happened to his driving than that the wheelmarks formed two serpentine lines along the road during the first mile or two before he had got his hand in and that the horse shied at a milestone a piece of paper a sleeping tramp and a wheelbarrow just to make use of the opportunity of being in bad hands  he entered casterbridge between twelve and one and putting up at the old greyhound walked on to the bow  here rather dusty on the ledges of his clothes he stood and waited while the people in their best summer dresses poured out of the three churches round him  when they had all gone and a smell of cinders and gravy had spread down the ancient high street and the piedishes from adjacent bakehouses had all travelled past he saw the mail coach rise above the arch of greys bridge a quarter of a mile distant surmounted by swaying knobs which proved to be the heads of the outside travellers  thats the way for a mans bride to come to him said robert to himself with a feeling of poetry and as the horn sounded and the horses clattered up the street he walked down to the inn  the knot of hostlers and innservants had gathered the horses were dragged from the vehicle and the passengers for casterbridge began to descend  captain bob eyed them over looked inside looked outside again to his disappointment matilda was not there nor her boxes nor anything that was hers  neither coachman nor guard had seen or heard of such a person at melchester and bob walked slowly away  depressed by forebodings to an extent which took away nearly a third of his appetite he sat down in the parlour of the old greyhound to a slice from the family joint of the landlord  this gentleman who dined in his shirtsleeves partly because it was august and partly from a sense that they would not be so fit for public view further on in the week suggested that bob should wait till three or four that afternoon when the roadwaggon would arrive as the lost lady might have preferred that mode of conveyance and when bob appeared rather hurt at the suggestion the landlords wife assured him as a woman who knew good life that many genteel persons travelled in that way during the present high price of provisions  loveday who knew little of travelling by land readily accepted her assurance and resolved to wait  wandering up and down the pavement or leaning against some hot wall between the waggonoffice and the corner of the street above he passed the time away  it was a still sunny drowsy afternoon and scarcely a soul was visible in the length and breadth of the street  the office was not far from all saints church and the churchwindows being open he could hear the afternoon service from where he lingered as distinctly as if he had been one of the congregation  thus he was mentally conducted through the psalms through the first and second lessons through the burst of fiddles and clarionets which announced the eveninghymn and well into the sermon before any signs of the waggon could be seen upon the london road  the afternoon sermons at this church being of a dry and metaphysical nature at that date it was by a special providence that the waggonoffice was placed near the ancient fabric so that whenever the sunday waggon was late which it always was in hot weather in cold weather in wet weather and in weather of almost every other sort the rattle dismounting and swearing outside completely drowned the parsons voice within and sustained the flagging interest of the congregation at precisely the right moment  no sooner did the charity children begin to writhe on their benches and adult snores grow audible than the waggon arrived  captain loveday felt a kind of sinking in his poetry at the possibility of her for whom they had made such preparations being in the slow unwieldy vehicle which crunched its way towards him but he would not give in to the weakness  neither would he walk down the street to meet the waggon lest she should not be there  at last the broad wheels drew up against the kerb the waggoner with his white smockfrock and whip as long as a fishingline descended from the pony on which he rode alongside and the six broadchested horses backed from their collars and shook themselves  in another moment something showed forth and he knew that matilda was there  bob felt three cheers rise within him as she stepped down but it being sunday he did not utter them  in dress miss johnson passed his expectationsa green and white gown with long tight sleeves a green silk handkerchief round her neck and crossed in front a green parasol and green gloves  it was strange enough to see this verdant caterpillar turn out of a roadwaggon and gracefully shake herself free from the bits of straw and fluff which would usually gather on the raiment of the grandest travellers by that vehicle  but my dear matilda said bob when he had kissed her three times with much publicitythe practical step he had determined on seeming to demand that these things should no longer be done in a cornermy dear matilda why didnt you come by the coach having the money fort and all  thats my scrimping said matilda in a delightful gush  i know you wont be offended when you know i did it to save against a rainy day  bob of course was not offended though the glory of meeting her had been less and even if vexation were possible it would have been out of place to say so  still he would have experienced no little surprise had he learnt the real reason of his matildas change of plan  that angel had in short so wildly spent bobs and her own money in the adornment of her person before setting out that she found herself without a sufficient margin for her fare by coach and had scrimped from sheer necessity  well i have got the trap out at the greyhound said bob  i dont know whether it will hold your luggage and us too but it looked more respectable than the waggon on a sunday and if theres not room for the boxes i can walk alongside  i think there will be room said miss johnson mildly  and it was soon very evident that she spoke the truth for when her property was deposited on the pavement it consisted of a trunk about eighteen inches long and nothing more  othats all said captain loveday surprised  thats all said the young woman assuringly  i didnt want to give trouble you know and what i have besides i have left at my aunts  yes of course he answered readily  and as its no bigger i can carry it in my hand to the inn and so it will be no trouble at all  he caught up the little box and they went side by side to the greyhound and in ten minutes they were trotting up the southern road  bob did not hurry the horse there being many things to say and hear for which the present situation was admirably suited  the sun shone occasionally into matildas face as they drove on its rays picking out all her features to a great nicety  her eyes would have been called brown but they were really eelcolour like many other nice brown eyes they were wellshaped and rather bright though they had more of a broad shine than a sparkle  she had a firm sufficient nose which seemed to say of itself that it was good as noses go  she had rather a picturesque way of wrapping her upper in her lower lip so that the red of the latter showed strongly  whenever she gazed against the sun towards the distant hills she brought into her forehead without knowing it three short vertical linesnot there at other timesgiving her for the moment rather a hard look  and in turning her head round to a far angle to stare at something or other that he pointed out the drawn flesh of her neck became a mass of lines  but bob did not look at these things which of course were of no significance for had she not told him when they compared ages that she was a little over twoandtwenty  as nature was hardly invented at this early point of the century bobs matilda could not say much about the glamour of the hills or the shimmering of the foliage or the wealth of glory in the distant sea as she would doubtless have done had she lived later on but she did her best to be interesting asking bob about matters of social interest in the neighbourhood to which she seemed quite a stranger  is your wateringplace a large city she inquired when they mounted the hill where the overcombe folk had waited for the king  bless you my dearno  twould be nothing if it wasnt for the royal family and the lords and ladies and the regiments of soldiers and the frigates and the kings messengers and the actors and actresses and the games that go on  at the words actors and actresses the innocent young thing pricked up her ears  does elliston pay as good salaries this summer as in  o you know about it then  i thought  o no no  i have heard of budmouthread in the papers you know dear robert about the doings there and the actors and actresses you know  yes yes i see  well i have been away from england a long time and dont know much about the theatre in the town but ill take you there some day  would it be a treat to you  o an amazing treat said miss johnson with an ecstasy in which a close observer might have discovered a tinge of ghastliness  youve never been into one perhaps dear  nnever said matilda flatly  whatever do i see yondera row of white things on the down  yes thats a part of the encampment above overcombe  lots of soldiers are encamped about here those are the white tops of their tents  he pointed to a wing of the camp that had become visible  matilda was much interested  it will make it very lively for us he added especially as john is there  she thought so too and thus they chatted on     xvii  two fainting fits and a bewilderment   meanwhile miller loveday was expecting the pair with interest and about five oclock after repeated outlooks he saw two specks the size of caraway seeds on the far line of ridge where the sunlit white of the road met the blue of the sky  then the remainder parts of bob and his lady became visible and then the whole vehicle end on and he heard the dry rattle of the wheels on the dusty road  miller lovedays plan as far as he had formed any was that robert and his wife should live with him in the millhouse until mrs garland made up her mind to join him there in which event her present house would be made over to the young couple upon all grounds he wished to welcome becomingly the woman of his sons choice and came forward promptly as they drew up at the door  what a lovely place youve got here said miss johnson when the miller had received her from the captain  a real stream of water a real mill wheel and real fowls and everything  yes tis real enough said loveday looking at the river with balanced sentiments and so you will say when youve lived here a bit as misess and had the trouble of claning the furniture  at this miss johnson looked modest and continued to do so till anne not knowing they were there came round the corner of the house with her prayerbook in her hand having just arrived from church  bob turned and smiled to her at which miss johnson looked glum  how long she would have remained in that phase is unknown for just then her ears were assailed by a loud bass note from the other side causing her to jump round  o la what dreadful thing is it she exclaimed and beheld a cow of lovedays of the name of crumpler standing close to her shoulder  it being about milkingtime she had come to look up david and hasten on the operation  o what a horrid bullit did frighten me so  i hope i shant faint said matilda  the miller immediately used the formula which has been uttered by the proprietors of live stock ever since noahs time  she wont hurt ye hoosh crumpler  shes as timid as a mouse maam  but as crumpler persisted in making another terrific inquiry for david matilda could not help closing her eyes and saying o i shall be gored to death her head falling back upon bobs shoulder whichseeing the urgent circumstances and knowing her delicate naturehe had providentially placed in a position to catch her  anne garland who had been standing at the corner of the house not knowing whether to go back or come on at this felt her womanly sympathies aroused  she ran and dipped her handkerchief into the splashing milltail and with it damped matildas face  but as her eyes still remained closed bob to increase the effect took the handkerchief from anne and wrung it out on the bridge of matildas nose whence it ran over the rest of her face in a stream  o captain loveday said anne the water is running over her green silk handkerchief and into her pretty reticule  thereif i didnt think so exclaimed matilda opening her eyes starting up and promptly pulling out her own handkerchief with which she wiped away the drops and an unimportant trifle of her complexion assisted by anne who in spite of her background of antagonistic emotions could not help being interested  thats right said the miller his spirits reviving with the revival of matilda  the lady is not used to country life are you maam  i am not replied the sufferer  all is so strange about here  suddenly there spread into the firmament from the direction of the down     ra ta ta  tatatatata  ra ta ta  o dear dear more hideous country sounds i suppose she inquired with another start  o no said the miller cheerfully  tis only my son johns trumpeter chaps at the camp of dragoons just above us ablowing mess or feed or picket or some other of their vagaries  john will be much pleased to tell you the meaning ont when he comes down  hes trumpetmajor as you may know maam  o yes you mean captain lovedays brother  dear bob has mentioned him  if you come round to widow garlands side of the house you can see the camp said the miller  dont force her shes tired with her long journey said mrs garland humanely the widow having come out in the general wish to see captain bobs choice  indeed they all behaved towards her as if she were a tender exotic which their crude country manners might seriously injure  she went into the house accompanied by mrs garland and her daughter though before leaving bob she managed to whisper in his ear dont tell them i came by waggon will you deara request which was quite needless for bob had long ago determined to keep that a dead secret not because it was an uncommon mode of travel but simply that it was hardly the usual conveyance for a gorgeous lady to her bridal  as the men had a feeling that they would be superfluous indoors just at present the miller assisted david in taking the horse round to the stables bob following and leaving matilda to the women  indoors miss johnson admired everything the new parrots and marmosets the black beams of the ceiling the doublecorner cupboard with the glass doors through which gleamed the remainders of sundry china sets acquired by bobs mother in her housekeepingtwohandled sugarbasins nohandled teacups a teapot like a pagoda and a creamjug in the form of a spotted cow  this sociability in their visitor was returned by mrs garland and anne and miss johnsons pleasing habit of partly dying whenever she heard any unusual bark or bellow added to her piquancy in their eyes  but conversation as such was naturally at first of a nervous tentative kind in which as in the works of some minor poets the sense was considerably led by the sound  you get the seabreezes here no doubt  o yes dear when the wind is that way  do you like windy weather  yes though not now for it blows down the young apples  apples are plentiful it seems  you countryfolk call st swithins their christening day if it rains  yes dear  ah me i have not been to a christening for these many years the babys name was george i rememberafter the king  i hear that king george is still staying at the town here  i hope hell stay till i have seen him  hell wait till the corn turns yellow he always does  how very fashionable yellow is getting for gloves just now  yes  some persons wear them to the elbow i hear  do they  i was not aware of that  i struck my elbow last week so hard against the door of my aunts mansion that i feel the ache now  before they were quite overwhelmed by the interest of this discourse the miller and bob came in  in truth mrs garland found the office in which he had placed herthat of introducing a strange woman to a house which was not the widows owna rather awkward one and yet almost a necessity  there was no woman belonging to the house except that wondrous compendium of usefulness the intermittent maidservant whom loveday had for appearances borrowed from mrs garland and mrs garland was in the habit of borrowing from the girls mother  and as for the demiwoman david he had been informed as peremptorily as pharaohs baker that the office of housemaid and bedmaker was taken from him and would be given to this girl till the wedding was over and bobs wife took the management into her own hands  they all sat down to high tea anne and her mother included and the captain sitting next to miss johnson  anne had put a brave face upon the matteroutwardly at leastand seemed in a fair way of subduing any lingering sentiment which bobs return had revived  during the evening and while they still sat over the meal john came down on a hurried visit as he had promised ostensibly on purpose to be introduced to his intended sisterinlaw but much more to get a word and a smile from his beloved anne  before they saw him they heard the trumpetmajors smart step coming round the corner of the house and in a moment his form darkened the door  as it was sunday he appeared in his fulldress laced coat white waistcoat and breeches and towering plume the latter of which he instantly lowered as much from necessity as good manners the beam in the millhouse ceiling having a tendency to smash and ruin all such headgear without warning  john weve been hoping you would come down said the miller and so we have kept the tay about on purpose  draw up and speak to mrs matilda johnson    maam this is roberts brother  your humble servant maam said the trumpetmajor gallantly  as it was getting dusk in the low smallpaned room he instinctively moved towards miss johnson as he spoke who sat with her back to the window  he had no sooner noticed her features than his helmet nearly fell from his hand his face became suddenly fixed and his natural complexion took itself off leaving a greenish yellow in its stead  the young person on her part had no sooner looked closely at him than she said weakly roberts brother and changed colour yet more rapidly than the soldier had done  the faintness previously half counterfeit seized on her now in real earnest  i dont feel well she said suddenly rising by an effort  this warm day has quite upset me  there was a regular collapse of the teaparty like that of the hamlet play scene  bob seized his sweetheart and carried her upstairs the miller exclaiming ah shes terribly worn by the journey  i thought she was when i saw her nearly go off at the blare of the cow  no woman would have been frightened at that if shed been up to her natural strength  that and being so very shy of men too must have made johns handsome regimentals quite overpowering to her poor thing added mrs garland following the catastrophic young lady upstairs whose indisposition was this time beyond question  and yet by some perversity of the heart she was as eager now to make light of her faintness as she had been to make much of it two or three hours ago  the miller and john stood like straight sticks in the room the others had quitted johns face being hastily turned towards a caricature of buonaparte on the wall that he had not seen more than a hundred and fifty times before  come sit down and have a dish of tea anyhow said his father at last shell soon be right again no doubt  thanks i dont want any tea said john quickly  and indeed he did not for he was in one gigantic ache from head to foot  the light had been too dim for anybody to notice his amazement and not knowing where to vent it the trumpetmajor said he was going out for a minute  he hastened to the bakehouse but david being there he went to the pantry but the maid being there he went to the cartshed but a couple of tramps being there he went behind a row of french beans in the garden where he let off an ejaculation the most pious that he had uttered that sabbath day heaven whats to be done  and then he walked wildly about the paths of the dusky garden where the trickling of the brooks seemed loud by comparison with the stillness around treading recklessly on the cracking snails that had come forth to feed and entangling his spurs in the long grass till the rowels were choked with its blades  presently he heard another person approaching and his brothers shape appeared between the stubbard tree and the hedge  o is it you said the mate  yes  i amtaking a little air  she is getting round nicely again and as i am not wanted indoors just now i am going into the village to call upon a friend or two i have not been able to speak to as yet  john took his brother bobs hand  bob rather wondered why  all right old boy he said  going into the village  youll be back again i suppose before it gets very late  o yes said captain bob cheerfully and passed out of the garden  john allowed his eyes to follow his brother till his shape could not be seen and then he turned and again walked up and down     xviii  the night after the arrival   john continued his sad and heavy pace till walking seemed too old and wornout a way of showing sorrow so new and he leant himself against the fork of an appletree like a log  there the trumpetmajor remained for a considerable time his face turned towards the house whose ancient many chimneyed outline rose against the darkened sky and just shut out from his view the camp above  but faint noises coming thence from horses restless at the pickets and from visitors taking their leave recalled its existence and reminded him that in consequence of matildas arrival he had obtained leave for the nighta fact which owing to the startling emotions that followed his entry he had not yet mentioned to his friends  while abstractedly considering how he could best use that privilege under the new circumstances which had arisen he heard farmer derriman drive up to the front door and hold a conversation with his father  the old man had at last apparently brought the tin box of private papers that he wished the miller to take charge of during derrimans absence and it being a calm night john could hear though he little heeded uncle benjys reiterated supplications to loveday to keep it safe from fire and thieves  then uncle benjy left and johns father went upstairs to deposit the box in a place of security the whole proceeding reaching johns preoccupied comprehension merely as voices during sleep  the next thing was the appearance of a light in the bedroom which had been assigned to matilda johnson  this effectually aroused the trumpet major and with a stealthiness unusual in him he went indoors  no light was in the lower rooms his father mrs garland and anne having gone out on the bridge to look at the new moon  john went upstairs on tip toe and along the uneven passage till he came to her door  it was standing ajar a band of candlelight shining across the passage and up the opposite wall  as soon as he entered the radiance he saw her  she was standing before the lookingglass apparently lost in thought her fingers being clasped behind her head in abstraction and the light falling full upon her face  i must speak to you said the trumpetmajor  she started turned and grew paler than before and then as if moved by a sudden impulse she swung the door wide open and coming out said quite collectedly and with apparent pleasantness o yes you are my bobs brother  i didnt for a moment recognize you  but you do now  as bobs brother  you have not seen me before  i have not she answered with a face as impassible as talleyrands  good god  i have not she repeated  nor any of the th dragoons  captain jolly for instance  no  you mistake  ill remind you of particulars he said drily  and he did remind her at some length  never she said desperately  but she had miscalculated her staying powers and her adversarys character  five minutes after that she was in tears and the conversation had resolved itself into words which on the soldiers part were of the nature of commands tempered by pity and were a mere series of entreaties on hers  the whole scene did not last ten minutes  when it was over the trumpet major walked from the doorway where they had been standing and brushed moisture from his eyes  reaching a dark lumberroom he stood still there to calm himself and then descended by a flemishladder to the bakehouse instead of by the front stairs  he found that the others including bob had gathered in the parlour during his absence and lighted the candles  miss johnson having sent down some time before john reentered the house to say that she would prefer to keep her room that evening was not expected to join them and on this account bob showed less than his customary liveliness  the miller wishing to keep up his sons spirits expressed his regret that it being sunday night they could have no songs to make the evening cheerful when mrs garland proposed that they should sing psalms which by choosing lively tunes and not thinking of the words would be almost as good as ballads  this they did the trumpetmajor appearing to join in with the rest but as a matter of fact no sound came from his moving lips  his mind was in such a state that he derived no pleasure even from anne garlands presence though he held a corner of the same book with her and was treated in a winsome way which it was not her usual practice to indulge in  she saw that his mind was clouded and far from guessing the reason why was doing her best to clear it  at length the garlands found that it was the hour for them to leave and john loveday at the same time wished his father and bob goodnight and went as far as mrs garlands door with her  he had said not a word to show that he was free to remain out of camp for the reason that there was painful work to be done which it would be best to do in secret and alone  he lingered near the house till its reflected windowlights ceased to glimmer upon the millpond and all within the dwelling was dark and still  then he entered the garden and waited there till the back door opened and a womans figure timorously came forward  john loveday at once went up to her and they began to talk in low yet dissentient tones  they had conversed about ten minutes and were parting as if they had come to some painful arrangement miss johnson sobbing bitterly when a head stealthily arose above the dense hedgerow and in a moment a shout burst from its owner  thieves thievesmy tin boxthieves thieves  matilda vanished into the house and john loveday hastened to the hedge for heavens sake hold your tongue mr derriman he exclaimed  my tin box said uncle benjy  o only the trumpetmajor  your box is safe enough i assure you  it was onlyhere the trumpet major gave vent to an artificial laughonly a sly bit of courting you know  ha ha i see said the relieved old squireen  courting miss anne then youve ousted my nephew trumpetmajor  well so much the better as for myself the truth ont is that i havent been able to go to bed easy for thinking that possibly your father might not take care of what i put under his charge and at last i thought i would just step over and see if all was safe here before i turned in  and when i saw your two shapes my poor nerves magnified ye to housebreakers and boneys and i dont know what all  you have alarmed the house said the trumpetmajor hearing the clicking of flint and steel in his fathers bedroom followed in a moment by the rise of a light in the window of the same apartment  you have got me into difficulty he added gloomily as his father opened the casement  i am sorry for that said uncle benjy  but step back ill put it all right again  what for heavens sake is the matter said the miller his tasselled nightcap appearing in the opening  nothing nothing said the farmer  i was uneasy about my few bonds and documents and i walked this way miller before going to bed as i start from home tomorrow morning  when i came down by your gardenhedge i thought i saw thieves but it turned out to beto be  here a lump of earth from the trumpetmajors hand struck uncle benjy in the back as a reminder  to bethe bough of a cherrytree awaving in the wind  goodnight  no thieves are like to try my house said miller loveday  now dont you come alarming us like this again farmer or you shall keep your box yourself begging your pardon for saying so  goodnight t ye  miller will ye just look since i am herejust look and see if the box is all right theres a good man  i am old you know and my poor remains are not what my original self was  look and see if it is where you put it theres a good kind man  very well said the miller goodhumouredly  neighbour loveday on second thoughts i will take my box home again after all if you dont mind  you wont deem it ill of me  i have no suspicion of course but now i think ont theres rivalry between my nephew and your son and if festus should take it into his head to set your house on fire in his enmity twould be bad for my deeds and documents  no offence miller but ill take the box if you dont mind  faith i dont mind said loveday  but your nephew had better think twice before he lets his enmity take that colour  receding from the window he took the candle to a back part of the room and soon reappeared with the tin box  i wont trouble ye to dress said derriman considerately let en down by anything you have at hand  the box was lowered by a cord and the old man clasped it in his arms thank ye he said with heartfelt gratitude  goodnight  the miller replied and closed the window and the light went out  there now i hope you are satisfied sir said the trumpetmajor  quite quite said derriman and leaning on his walkingstick he pursued his lonely way  that night anne lay awake in her bed musing on the traits of the new friend who had come to her neighbours house  she would not be critical it was ungenerous and wrong but she could not help thinking of what interested her  and were there she silently asked in miss johnsons mind and person such rare qualities as placed that lady altogether beyond comparison with herself  o yes there must be for had not captain bob singled out matilda from among all other women herself included  of course with his worldwide experience he knew best  when the moon had set and only the summer stars threw their light into the great damp garden she fancied that she heard voices in that direction  perhaps they were the voices of bob and matilda taking a lovers walk before retiring  if so how sleepy they would be next day and how absurd it was of matilda to pretend she was tired  ruminating in this way and saying to herself that she hoped they would be happy anne fell asleep     xix  miss johnsons behaviour causes no little surprise   partly from the excitement of having his matilda under the paternal roof bob rose next morning as early as his father and the grinder and when the big wheel began to patter and the little ones to mumble in response went to sun himself outside the millfront among the fowls of brown and speckled kinds which haunted that spot and the ducks that came up from the milltail  standing on the wornout millstone inlaid in the gravel he talked with his father on various improvements of the premises and on the proposed arrangements for his permanent residence there with an enjoyment that was half based upon this prospect of the future and half on the penetrating warmth of the sun to his back and shoulders  then the different troops of horses began their morning scramble down to the mill pond and after making it very muddy round the edge ascended the slope again  the bustle of the camp grew more and more audible and presently david came to say that breakfast was ready  is miss johnson downstairs said the miller and bob listened for the answer looking at a blue sentinel aloft on the down  not yet maister said the excellent david  well wait till shes down said loveday  when she is let us know  david went indoors again and loveday and bob continued their morning survey by ascending into the mysterious quivering recesses of the mill and holding a discussion over a second pair of burrstones which had to be redressed before they could be used again  this and similar things occupied nearly twenty minutes and looking from the window the elder of the two was reminded of the time of day by seeing mrs garlands table cloth fluttering from her back door over the heads of a flock of pigeons that had alighted for the crumbs  i suppose david cant find us he said with a sense of hunger that was not altogether strange to bob  he put out his head and shouted  the lady is not down yet said his man in reply  no hurry no hurry said the miller with cheerful emptiness  bob to pass the time well look into the garden  shell get up sooner than this you know when shes signed articles and got a berth here bob observed apologetically  yes yes said loveday and they descended into the garden  here they turned over sundry flat stones and killed the slugs sheltered beneath them from the coming heat of the day talking of slugs in all their branchesof the brown and the black of the tough and the tender of the reason why there were so many in the garden that year of the coming time when the grasswalks harbouring them were to be taken up and gravel laid and of the relatively exterminatory merits of a pair of scissors and the heel of the shoe  at last the miller said well really bob im hungry we must begin without her  they were about to go in when david appeared with haste in his motions his eyes wider vertically than crosswise and his cheeks nearly all gone  maister ive been to call her and as a didnt speak i rapped and as a didnt answer i kicked and not being latched the door opened andshes gone  bob went off like a swallow towards the house and the miller followed like the rather heavy man that he was  that miss matilda was not in her room or a scrap of anything belonging to her was soon apparent  they searched every place in which she could possibly hide or squeeze herself every place in which she could not but found nothing at all  captain bob was quite wild with astonishment and grief  when he was quite sure that she was nowhere in his fathers house he ran into mrs garlands and telling them the story so hastily that they hardly understood the particulars he went on towards comforts house intending to raise the alarm there and also at mitchells beachs cripplestraws the parsons the clerks the camp of dragoons of hussars and so on through the whole county  but he paused and thought it would be hardly expedient to publish his discomfiture in such a way if matilda had left the house for any freakish reason he would not care to look for her and if her deed had a tragic intent she would keep aloof from camp and village  in his trouble he thought of anne  she was a nice girl and could be trusted  to her he went and found her in a state of excitement and anxiety which equalled his own  tis so lonely to cruise for her all by myself said bob disconsolately his forehead all in wrinkles and ive thought you would come with me and cheer the way  where shall we search said anne  o in the holes of rivers you know and down wells and in quarries and over cliffs and like that  your eyes might catch the loom of any bit of a shawl or bonnet that i should overlook and it would do me a real service  please do come  so anne took pity upon him and put on her hat and went the miller and david having gone off in another direction  they examined the ditches of fields bob going round by one fence and anne by the other till they met at the opposite side  then they peeped under culverts into outhouses and down old wells and quarries till the theory of a tragical end had nearly spent its force in bobs mind and he began to think that matilda had simply run away  however they still walked on though by this time the sun was hot and anne would gladly have sat down  now didnt you think highly of her miss garland he inquired as the search began to languish  o yes said anne very highly  she was really beautiful no nonsense about her looks was there  none  her beauty was thoroughly ripenot too young  we should all have got to love her  what can have possessed her to go away  i dont know and upon my life i shall soon be drove to say i dont care replied the mate despairingly  let me pilot ye down over those stones he added as anne began to descend a rugged quarry  he stepped forward leapt down and turned to her  she gave him her hand and sprang down  before he relinquished his hold captain bob raised her fingers to his lips and kissed them  o captain loveday cried anne snatching away her hand in genuine dismay while a tear rose unexpectedly to each eye  i never heard of such a thing  i wont go an inch further with you sir it is too barefaced  and she turned and ran off  upon my life i didnt mean it said the repentant captain hastening after  i do love her bestindeed i doand i dont love you at all  i am not so fickle as that  i merely just for the moment admired you as a sweet little craft and thats how i came to do it  you know miss garland he continued earnestly and still running after tis like this when you come ashore after having been shut up in a ship for eighteen months womenfolks seem so new and nice that you cant help liking them one and all in a body and so your heart is apt to get scattered and to yaw a bit but of course i think of poor matilda most and shall always stick to her  he heaved a sigh of tremendous magnitude to show beyond the possibility of doubt that his heart was still in the place that honour required  i am glad to hear thatof course i am very glad said she with quick petulance keeping her face turned from him  and i hope we shall find her and that the wedding will not be put off and that youll both be happy  but i wont look for her any more  no i dont care to look for herand my head aches  i am going home  and so am i said robert promptly  no no go on looking for her of courseall the afternoon and all night  i am sure you will if you love her  o yes i mean to  still i ought to convoy you home first  no you ought not and i shall not accept your company  goodmorning sir  and she went off over one of the stone stiles with which the spot abounded leaving the friendly sailor standing in the field  he sighed again and observing the camp not far off thought he would go to his brother john and ask him his opinion on the sorrowful case  on reaching the tents he found that john was not at liberty just at that time being engaged in practising the trumpeters and leaving word that he wished the trumpetmajor to come down to the mill as soon as possible bob went back again  tis no good looking for her he said gloomily  she liked me well enough but when she came here and saw the house and the place and the old horse and the plain furniture she was disappointed to find us all so homely and felt she didnt care to marry into such a family  his father and david had returned with no news  yes tis as ive been thinking father bob said  we werent good enough for her and she went away in scorn  well that cant be helped said the miller  what we be we be and have been for generations  to my mind she seemed glad enough to get hold of us  yes yesfor the momentbecause of the flowers and birds and whats pretty in the place said bob tragically  but you dont know fatherhow should you know who have hardly been out of overcombe in your lifeyou dont know what delicate feelings are in a real refined womans mind  any little vulgar action unreaves their nerves like a marlinespike  now i wonder if you did anything to disgust her  faith not that i know of said loveday reflecting  i didnt say a single thing that i should naturally have said on purpose to give no offence  you was always very homely you know father  yes so i was said the miller meekly  i wonder what it could have been bob continued wandering about restlessly  you didnt go drinking out of the big mug with your mouth full or wipe your lips with your sleeve  that ill swear i didnt said the miller firmly  thinks i theres no knowing what i may do to shock her so ill take my solid victuals in the bakehouse and only a crumb and a drop in her company for manners  you could do no more than that certainly said bob gently  if my manners be good enough for wellbroughtup people like the garlands they be good enough for her continued the miller with a sense of injustice  thats true  then it must have been david  david come here  how did you behave before that lady  now mind you speak the truth  yes mr captain robert said david earnestly  i assure ye she was served like a royal queen  the best silver spoons wez put down and yer poor grandfers silver tanket as you seed and the feather cushion for her to sit on  now ive got it said bob decisively bringing down his hand upon the windowsill  her bed was hardand theres nothing shocks a true lady like that  the bed in that room always was as hard as the rock of gibraltar  no captain bob  the beds were changedwasnt they maister  we put the goose bed in her room and the flock one that used to be there in yours  yes we did corroborated the miller  david and i changed em with our own hands because they were too heavy for the women to move  sure i didnt know i had the flock bed murmured bob  i slept on little thinking what i was going to wake to  well well shes gone and search as i will i shall never find another like her  she was too good for me  she must have carried her box with her own hands poor girl  as far as that goes i could overtake her even now i dare say but i wont entreat her against her willnot i  miller loveday and david feeling themselves to be rather a desecration in the presence of bobs sacred emotions managed to edge off by degrees the former burying himself in the most floury recesses of the mill his invariable resource when perturbed the rumbling having a soothing effect upon the nerves of those properly trained to its music  bob was so impatient that after going up to her room to assure himself once more that she had not undressed but had only lain down on the outside of the bed he went out of the house to meet john and waited on the sunny slope of the down till his brother appeared  john looked so brave and shapely and warlike that even in bobs present distress he could not but feel an honest and affectionate pride at owning such a relative  yet he fancied that john did not come along with the same swinging step he had shown yesterday and when the trumpetmajor got nearer he looked anxiously at the mate and waited for him to speak first  you know our great trouble john said robert gazing stoically into his brothers eyes  come and sit down and tell me all about it answered the trumpetmajor showing no surprise  they went towards a slight ravine where it was easier to sit down than on the flat ground and here john reclined among the grasshoppers pointing to his brother to do the same  but do you know what it is said robert  has anybody told ye  i do know said john  shes gone and i am thankful  what said bob rising to his knees in amazement  im at the bottom of it said the trumpetmajor slowly  you john  yes and if you will listen ill tell you all  do you remember what happened when i came into the room last night  why she turned colour and nearly fainted away  that was because she knew me  bob stared at his brother with a face of pain and distrust  for once bob i must say something that will hurt thee a good deal continued john  she was not a woman who could possibly be your wifeand so shes gone  you sent her off  well i did  johntell me right throughtell me  perhaps i had better said the trumpetmajor his blue eyes resting on the far distant sea that seemed to rise like a wall as high as the hill they sat upon  and then he told a tale of miss johnson and the th dragoons which wrung his heart as much in the telling as it did bobs to hear and which showed that john had been temporarily cruel to be ultimately kind  even bob excited as he was could discern from johns manner of speaking what a terrible undertaking that nights business had been for him  to justify the course he had adopted the dictates of duty must have been imperative but the trumpetmajor with a becoming reticence which his brother at the time was naturally unable to appreciate scarcely dwelt distinctly enough upon the compelling cause of his conduct  it would indeed have been hard for any man much less so modest a one as john to do himself justice in that remarkable relation when the listener was the ladys lover and it is no wonder that robert rose to his feet and put a greater distance between himself and john  and what time was it he asked in a hard suppressed voice  it was just before one oclock  how could you help her to go away  i had a pass  i carried her box to the coachoffice  she was to follow at dawn  but she had no money  yes she had i took particular care of that  john did not add as he might have done that he had given her in his pity all the money he possessed and at present had only eighteenpence in the world  well it is over bob so sit ye down and talk with me of old times he added  ah jack it is well enough for you to speak like that said the disquieted sailor but i cant help feeling that it is a cruel thing you have done  after all she would have been snug enough for me  would i had never found out this about her  john why did you interfere  you had no right to overhaul my affairs like this  why didnt you tell me fairly all you knew and let me do as i chose  you have turned her out of the house and its a shame  if she had only come to me  why didnt she  because she knew it was best to do otherwise  well i shall go after her said bob firmly  you can do as you like said john but i would advise you strongly to leave matters where they are  i wont leave matters where they are said bob impetuously  you have made me miserable and all for nothing  i tell you she was good enough for me and as long as i knew nothing about what you say of her history what difference would it have made to me  never was there a young woman who was better company and she loved a merry song as i do myself  yes ill follow her  o bob said john i hardly expected this  thats because you didnt know your man  can i ask you to do me one kindness  i dont suppose i can  can i ask you not to say a word against her to any of them at home  certainly  the very reason why i got her to go off silently as she has done was because nothing should be said against her here and no scandal should be heard of  that may be but im off after her  marry that girl i will  youll be sorry  that we shall see replied robert with determination and he went away rapidly towards the mill  the trumpetmajor had no heart to followno good could possibly come of further opposition and there on the down he remained like a graven image till bob had vanished from his sight into the mill  bob entered his fathers only to leave word that he was going on a renewed search for matilda and to pack up a few necessaries for his journey  ten minutes later he came out again with a bundle in his hand and john saw him go diagonally across the lower fields towards the high road  and this is all the good i have done said john musingly readjusting his stock where it cut his neck and descending towards the mill     xx  how they lessened the effect of the calamity   meanwhile anne garland had gone home and being weary with her ramble in search of matilda sat silent in a corner of the room  her mother was passing the time in giving utterance to every conceivable surmise on the cause of miss johnsons disappearance that the human mind could frame to which anne returned monosyllabic answers the result not of indifference but of intense preoccupation  presently loveday the father came to the door her mother vanished with him and they remained closeted together a long time  anne went into the garden and seated herself beneath the branching tree whose boughs had sheltered her during so many hours of her residence here  her attention was fixed more upon the millers wing of the irregular building before her than upon that occupied by her mother for she could not help expecting every moment to see some one run out with a wild face and announce some awful clearing up of the mystery  every sound set her on the alert and hearing the tread of a horse in the lane she looked round eagerly  gazing at her over the hedge was festus derriman mounted on such an incredibly tall animal that he could see to her very feet over the thick and broad thorn fence  she no sooner recognized him than she withdrew her glance but as his eyes were fixed steadily upon her this was a futile manoeuvre  i saw you look round he exclaimed crossly  what have i done to make you behave like that  come miss garland be fair  tis no use to turn your back upon me  as she did not turn he went onwell now this is enough to provoke a saint  now i tell you what miss garland here ill stay till you do turn round if tis all the afternoon  you know my temperwhat i say i mean  he seated himself firmly in the saddle plucked some leaves from the hedge and began humming a song to show how absolutely indifferent he was to the flight of time  what have you come for that you are so anxious to see me inquired anne when at last he had wearied her patience rising and facing him with the added independence which came from a sense of the hedge between them  there i knew you would turn round he said his hot angry face invaded by a smile in which his teeth showed like white hemmed in by red at chess  what do you want mr derriman said she  what do you want mr derrimannow listen to that  is that my encouragement  anne bowed superciliously and moved away  i have just heard news that explains all that said the giant eyeing her movements with somnolent irascibility  my uncle has been letting things out  he was here late last night and he saw you  indeed he didnt said anne  o now  he saw trumpetmajor loveday courting somebody like you in that garden walk and when he came you ran indoors  it is not true and i wish to hear no more  upon my life he said so  how can you do it miss garland when i who have enough money to buy up all the lovedays would gladly come to terms with ye  what a simpleton you must be to pass me over for him  there now you are angry because i said simpletoni didnt mean simpleton i meant misguidedmisguided rosebud  thats itrun off he continued in a raised voice as anne made towards the garden door  but ill have you yet  much reason you have to be too proud to stay with me  but it wont last long i shall marry you madam if i choose as youll see  when he was quite gone and anne had calmed down from the not altogether unrelished fear and excitement that he always caused her she returned to her seat under the tree and began to wonder what festus derrimans story meant which from the earnestness of his tone did not seem like a pure invention  it suddenly flashed upon her mind that she herself had heard voices in the garden and that the persons seen by farmer derriman of whose visit and reclamation of his box the miller had told her might have been matilda and john loveday  she further recalled the strange agitation of miss johnson on the preceding evening and that it occurred just at the entry of the dragoon till by degrees suspicion amounted to conviction that he knew more than any one else supposed of that ladys disappearance  it was just at this time that the trumpetmajor descended to the mill after his talk with his brother on the down  as fate would have it instead of entering the house he turned aside to the garden and walked down that pleasant enclosure to learn if he were likely to find in the other half of it the woman he loved so well  yes there she was sitting on the seat of logs that he had repaired for her under the appletree but she was not facing in his direction  he walked with a noisier tread he coughed he shook a bough he did everything in short but the one thing that festus did in the same circumstancescall out to her  he would not have ventured on that for the world  any of his signs would have been sufficient to attract her a day or two earlier now she would not turn  at last in his fond anxiety he did what he had never done before without an invitation and crossed over into mrs garlands half of the garden till he stood before her  when she could not escape him she arose and saying good afternoon trumpetmajor in a glacial manner unusual with her walked away to another part of the garden  loveday quite at a loss had not the strength of mind to persevere further  he had a vague apprehension that some imperfect knowledge of the previous nights unhappy business had reached her and unable to remedy the evil without telling more than he dared he went into the mill where his father still was looking doleful enough what with his concern at events and the extra quantity of flour upon his face through sticking so closely to business that day  well john bob has told you all of course  a queer strange perplexing thing isnt it  i cant make it out at all  there must be something wrong in the woman or it couldnt have happened  i havent been so upset for years  nor have i  i wouldnt it should have happened for all i own in the world said the dragoon  have you spoke to anne garland todayor has anybody been talking to her  festus derriman rode by halfanhour ago and talked to her over the hedge  john guessed the rest and after standing on the threshold in silence awhile walked away towards the camp  all this time his brother robert had been hastening along in pursuit of the woman who had withdrawn from the scene to avoid the exposure and complete overthrow which would have resulted had she remained  as the distance lengthened between himself and the mill bob was conscious of some cooling down of the excitement that had prompted him to set out but he did not pause in his walk till he had reached the head of the river which fed the millstream  here for some indefinite reason he allowed his eyes to be attracted by the bubbling spring whose waters never failed or lessened and he stopped as if to look longer at the scene it was really because his mind was so absorbed by johns story  the sun was warm the spot was a pleasant one and he deposited his bundle and sat down  by degrees as he reflected first on johns view and then on his own his convictions became unsettled till at length he was so balanced between the impulse to go on and the impulse to go back that a puff of wind either way would have been wellnigh sufficient to decide for him  when he allowed johns story to repeat itself in his ears the reasonableness and good sense of his advice seemed beyond question  when on the other hand he thought of his poor matildas eyes and her to him pleasant ways their charming arrangements to marry and her probable willingness still he could hardly bring himself to do otherwise than follow on the road at the top of his speed  this strife of thought was so well maintained that sitting and standing he remained on the borders of the spring till the shadows had stretched out eastwards and the chance of overtaking matilda had grown considerably less  still he did not positively go towards home  at last he took a guinea from his pocket and resolved to put the question to the hazard  heads i go tails i dont  the piece of gold spun in the air and came down heads  no i wont go after all he said  i wont be steered by accidents any more  he picked up his bundle and switch and retraced his steps towards overcombe mill knocking down the brambles and nettles as he went with gloomy and indifferent blows  when he got within sight of the house he beheld david in the road  all rightall right again captain shouted that retainer  a wedding after all  hurrah  ahshes back again cried bob seizing david ecstatically and dancing round with him  nobut its all the same it is of no consequence at all and no harm will be done  maister and mrs garland have made up a match and mean to marry at once that the wedding victuals may not be wasted  they felt twould be a thousand pities to let such good things get bluevinnied for want of a ceremony to use em upon and at last they have thought of this  victualsi dont care for the victuals bitterly cried bob in a tone of far higher thought  how you disappoint me and he went slowly towards the house  his father appeared in the opening of the milldoor looking more cheerful than when they had parted  what robert youve been after her he said  faith then i wouldnt have followed her if i had been as sure as you were that she went away in scorn of us  since you told me that i have not looked for her at all  i was wrong father bob replied gravely throwing down his bundle and stick  matilda i find has not gone away in scorn of us she has gone away for other reasons  i followed her some way but i have come back again  she may go  why is she gone said the astonished miller  bob had intended for matildas sake to give no reason to a living soul for her departure  but he could not treat his father thus reservedly and he told  she has made great fools of us said the miller deliberately and she might have made us greater ones  bob i thought th hadst more sense  well dont say anything against her father implored bob  twas a sorry haul and theres an end ont  let her down quietly and keep the secret  you promise that  i do  loveday the elder remained thinking awhile and then went onwell what i was going to say is this ive hit upon a plan to get out of the awkward corner she has put us in  what youll think of it i cant say  david has just given me the heads  and do it hurt your feelings my son at such a time  noill bring myself to bear it anyhow  why should i object to other peoples happiness because i have lost my own said bob with saintly selfsacrifice in his air  well said answered the miller heartily  but you may be sure that there will be no unseemly rejoicing to disturb ye in your present frame of mind  all the morning i felt more ashamed than i cared to own at the thought of how the neighbours great and small would laugh at what they would call your folly when they knew what had happened so i resolved to take this step to stave it off if so be twas possible  and when i saw mrs garland i knew i had done right  she pitied me so much for having had the house cleaned in vain and laid in provisions to waste that it put her into the humour to agree  we mean to do it right off at once afore the pies and cakes get mouldy and the blackpot stale  twas a good thought of mine and hers and i am glad tis settled he concluded cheerfully  poor matilda murmured bob  therei was afraid twould hurt thy feelings said the miller with selfreproach making preparations for thy wedding and using them for my own  no said bob heroically it shall not  it will be a great comfort in my sorrow to feel that the splendid grub and the ale and your stunning new suit of clothes and the great tablecloths youve bought will be just as useful now as if i had married myself  poor matilda  but you wont expect me to join inyou hardly can  i can sheer off that day very easily you know  nonsense bob said the miller reproachfully  i couldnt stand iti should break down  deuce take me if i would have asked her then if i had known twas going to drive thee out of the house  now come bob ill find a way of arranging it and sobering it down so that it shall be as melancholy as you can requirein short just like a funeral if thoult promise to stay  very well said the afflicted one  on that condition ill stay     xxi  upon the hill he turned   having entered into this solemn compact with his son the elder lovedays next action was to go to mrs garland and ask her how the toning down of the wedding had best be done  it is plain enough that to make merry just now would be slighting bobs feelings as if we didnt care who was not married so long as we were he said  but then whats to be done about the victuals  give a dinner to the poor folk she suggested  we can get everything used up that way  thats true said the miller  theres enough of em in these times to carry off any extras whatsoever  and it will save bobs feelings wonderfully  and they wont know that the dinner was got for another sort of wedding and another sort of guests so youll have their goodwill for nothing  the miller smiled at the subtlety of the view  that can hardly be called fair he said  still i did mean some of it for them for the friends we meant to ask would not have cleared all  upon the whole the idea pleased him well particularly when he noticed the forlorn look of his sailor son as he walked about the place and pictured the inevitably jarring effect of fiddles and tambourines upon bobs shattered nerves at such a crisis even if the notes of the former were dulled by the application of a mute and bob shut up in a distant bedrooma plan which had at first occurred to him  he therefore told bob that the surcharged larder was to be emptied by the charitable process above alluded to and hoped he would not mind making himself useful in such a good and gloomy work  bob readily fell in with the scheme and it was at once put in hand and the tables spread  the alacrity with which the substituted wedding was carried out seemed to show that the worthy pair of neighbours would have joined themselves into one long ago had there previously occurred any domestic incident dictating such a step as an apposite expedient apart from their personal wish to marry  the appointed morning came and the service quietly took place at the cheerful hour of ten in the face of a triangular congregation of which the base was the front pew and the apex the west door  mrs garland dressed herself in the muslin shawl like queen charlottes that bob had brought home and her best plumcoloured gown beneath which peeped out her shoes with red rosettes  anne was present but she considerately toned herself down so as not to too seriously damage her mothers appearance  at moments during the ceremony she had a distressing sense that she ought not to be born and was glad to get home again  the interest excited in the village though real was hardly enough to bring a serious blush to the face of coyness  neighbours minds had become so saturated by the abundance of showy military and regal incident lately vouchsafed to them that the wedding of middleaged civilians was of small account excepting in so far that it solved the question whether or not mrs garland would consider herself too genteel to mate with a grinder of corn  in the evening lovedays heart was made glad by seeing the baked and boiled in rapid process of consumption by the kitchenful of people assembled for that purpose  threequarters of an hour were sufficient to banish for ever his fears as to spoilt food  the provisions being the cause of the assembly and not its consequence it had been determined to get all that would not keep consumed on that day even if highways and hedges had to be searched for operators  and in addition to the poor and needy every cottagers daughter known to the miller was invited and told to bring her lover from campan expedient which for letting daylight into the inside of full platters was among the most happy ever known  while mr and mrs loveday anne and bob were standing in the parlour discussing the progress of the entertainment in the next room john who had not been down all day entered the house and looked in upon them through the open door  hows this john  why didnt you come before  had to see the captain andother duties said the trumpetmajor in a tone which showed no great zeal for explanations  well come in however continued the miller as his son remained with his hand on the doorpost surveying them reflectively  i cannot stay long said john advancing  the route is come and we are going away  going away  where to  to exonbury  when  friday morning  all of you  yes some tomorrow and some next day  the king goes next week  i am sorry for this said the miller not expressing half his sorrow by the simple utterance  i wish you could have been here today since this is the case he added looking at the horizon through the window  mrs loveday also expressed her regret which seemed to remind the trumpetmajor of the event of the day and he went to her and tried to say something befitting the occasion  anne had not said that she was either sorry or glad but john loveday fancied that she had looked rather relieved than otherwise when she heard his news  his conversation with bob on the down made bobs manner too remarkably cool notwithstanding that he had after all followed his brothers advice which it was as yet too soon after the event for him to rightly value  john did not know why the sailor had come back never supposing that it was because he had thought better of going and said to him privately you didnt overtake her  i didnt try to said bob  and you are not going to  no i shall let her drift  i am glad indeed bob you have been wise said john heartily  bob however still loved matilda too well to be other than dissatisfied with john and the event that he had precipitated which the elder brother only too promptly perceived and it made his stay that evening of short duration  before leaving he said with some hesitation to his father including anne and her mother by his glance do you think to come up and see us off  the miller answered for them all and said that of course they would come  but youll step down again between now and then he inquired  ill try to  he added after a pause in case i should not remember that revalley will sound at half past five we shall leave about eight next summer perhaps we shall come and camp here again  i hope so said his father and mrs loveday  there was something in johns manner which indicated to anne that he scarcely intended to come down again but the others did not notice it and she said nothing  he departed a few minutes later in the dusk of the august evening leaving anne still in doubt as to the meaning of his private meeting with miss johnson  john loveday had been going to tell them that on the last night by an especial privilege it would be in his power to come and stay with them until eleven oclock but at the moment of leaving he abandoned the intention  annes attitude had chilled him and made him anxious to be off  he utilized the spare hours of that last night in another way  this was by coming down from the outskirts of the camp in the evening and seating himself near the brink of the millpond as soon as it was quite dark where he watched the lights in the different windows till one appeared in annes bedroom and she herself came forward to shut the casement with the candle in her hand  the light shone out upon the broad and deep millhead illuminating to a distinct individuality every moth and gnat that entered the quivering chain of radiance stretching across the water towards him and every bubble or atom of froth that floated into its width  she stood for some time looking out little thinking what the darkness concealed on the other side of that wide stream till at length she closed the casement drew the curtains and retreated into the room  presently the light went out upon which john loveday returned to camp and lay down in his tent  the next morning was dull and windy and the trumpets of the th sounded reveille for the last time on overcombe down  knowing that the dragoons were going away anne had slept heedfully and was at once awakened by the smart notes  she looked out of the window to find that the miller was already astir his white form being visible at the end of his garden where he stood motionless watching the preparations  anne also looked on as well as she could through the dim grey gloom and soon she saw the blue smoke from the cooks fires creeping fitfully along the ground instead of rising in vertical columns as it had done during the fine weather season  then the men began to carry their bedding to the waggons and others to throw all refuse into the trenches till the down was lively as an anthill  anne did not want to see john loveday again but hearing the household astir she began to dress at leisure looking out at the camp the while  when the soldiers had breakfasted she saw them selling and giving away their superfluous crockery to the natives who had clustered round and then they pulled down and cleared away the temporary kitchens which they had constructed when they came  a tapping of tentpegs and wriggling of picketposts followed and soon the cones of white canvas now almost become a component part of the landscape fell to the ground  at this moment the miller came indoors and asked at the foot of the stairs if anybody was going up the hill with him  anne felt that in spite of the cloud hanging over john in her mind it would ill become the present moment not to see him off and she went downstairs to her mother who was already there though bob was nowhere to be seen  each took an arm of the miller and thus climbed to the top of the hill  by this time the men and horses were at the place of assembly and shortly after the millparty reached level ground the troops slowly began to move forward  when the trumpetmajor half buried in his uniform arms and horsefurniture drew near to the spot where the lovedays were waiting to see him pass his father turned anxiously to anne and said you will shake hands with john  anne faintly replied yes and allowed the miller to take her forward on his arm to the trackway so as to be close to the flank of the approaching column  it came up many people on each side grasping the hands of the troopers in bidding them farewell and as soon as john loveday saw the members of his fathers household he stretched down his hand across his right pistol for the same performance  the miller gave his then mrs loveday gave hers and then the hand of the trumpetmajor was extended towards anne  but as the horse did not absolutely stop it was a somewhat awkward performance for a young woman to undertake and more on that account than on any other anne drew back and the gallant trooper passed by without receiving her adieu  annes heart reproached her for a moment and then she thought that after all he was not going off to immediate battle and that she would in all probability see him again at no distant date when she hoped that the mystery of his conduct would be explained  her thoughts were interrupted by a voice at her elbow thank heaven hes gone  now theres a chance for me  she turned and festus derriman was standing by her  theres no chance for you she said indignantly  why not  because theres another left  the words had slipped out quite unintentionally and she blushed quickly she would have given anything to be able to recall them but he had heard and said who  anne went forward to the miller to avoid replying and festus caught her no more  has anybody been hanging about overcombe mill except lovedays son the soldier he asked of a comrade  his son the sailor was the reply  ohis son the sailor said festus slowly  damn his son the sailor     xxii  the two households united   at this particular moment the object of festus derrimans fulmination was assuredly not dangerous as a rival  bob after abstractedly watching the soldiers from the front of the house till they were out of sight had gone within doors and seated himself in the millparlour where his father found him his elbows resting on the table and his forehead on his hands his eyes being fixed upon a document that lay open before him  what art perusing bob with such a long face  bob sighed and then mrs loveday and anne entered  tis only a state paper that i fondly thought i should have a use for he said gloomily and looking down as before he cleared his voice as if moved inwardly to go on and began to read in feeling tones from what proved to be his nullified marriage licence  timothy titus philemon by permission bishop of bristol to our well beloved robert loveday of the parish of overcombe bachelor and matilda johnson of the same parish spinster  greeting  here anne sighed but contrived to keep down her sigh to a mere nothing  beautiful language isnt it said bob  i was never greeted like that afore  yes i have often thought it very excellent language myself said mrs loveday  come to that the old gentleman will greet thee like it again any day for a couple of guineas said the miller  thats not the point father  you never could see the real meaning of these things     well then he goes on whereas ye are as it is alleged determined to enter into the holy estate of matrimony  but why should i read on  it all means nothing nownothing and the splendid words are all wasted upon air  it seems as if i had been hailed by some venerable hoary prophet and had turned away put the helm hard up and wouldnt hear  nobody replied feeling probably that sympathy could not meet the case and bob went on reading the rest of it to himself occasionally heaving a breath like the wind in a ships shrouds  i wouldnt set my mind so much upon her if i was thee said his father at last  why not  well folk might call thee a fool and say thy brains were turning to water  bob was apparently much struck by this thought and instead of continuing the discourse further he carefully folded up the licence went out and walked up and down the garden  it was startlingly apt what his father had said and worse than that what people would call him might be true and the liquefaction of his brains turn out to be no fable  by degrees he became much concerned and the more he examined himself by this new light the more clearly did he perceive that he was in a very bad way  on reflection he remembered that since miss johnsons departure his appetite had decreased amazingly  he had eaten in meat no more than fourteen or fifteen ounces a day but onethird of a quartern pudding on an average in vegetables only a small heap of potatoes and half a york cabbage and no gravy whatever which considering the usual appetite of a seaman for fresh food at the end of a long voyage was no small index of the depression of his mind  then he had waked once every night and on one occasion twice  while dressing each morning since the gloomy day he had not whistled more than seven bars of a hornpipe without stopping and falling into thought of a most painful kind and he had told none but absolutely true stories of foreign parts to the neighbouring villagers when they saluted and clustered about him as usual for anything he chose to pour forthexcept that story of the whale whose eye was about as large as the round pond in derrimans eweleasewhich was like tempting fate to set a seal for ever upon his tongue as a traveller  all this enervation mental and physical had been produced by matildas departure  he also considered what he had lost of the rational amusements of manhood during these unfortunate days  he might have gone to the neighbouring fashionable resort every afternoon stood before gloucester lodge till the king and queen came out held his hat in his hand and enjoyed their majesties smiles at his homage all for nothingwatched the picketmounting heard the different bands strike up observed the staff and above all have seen the pretty town girls go triptriptrip along the esplanade deliberately fixing their innocent eyes on the distant sea the grey cliffs and the sky and accidentally on the soldiers and himself  ill raze out her image he said  she shall make a fool of me no more  and his resolve resulted in conduct which had elements of real greatness  he went back to his father whom he found in the millloft  tis true father what you say he observed my brains will turn to bilgewater if i think of her much longer  by the oath of anavigator i wish i could sigh less and laugh more shes gonewhy cant i let her go and be happy  but how begin  take it careless my son said the miller and lay yourself out to enjoy snacks and cordials  ahthats a thought said bob  baccy is good fort  so is sperrits  though i dont advise thee to drink neat  baccyid almost forgot it said captain loveday  he went to his room hastily untied the package of tobacco that he had brought home and began to make use of it in his own way calling to david for a bottle of the old household mead that had lain in the cellar these eleven years  he was discovered by his father threequarters of an hour later as a halfinvisible object behind a cloud of smoke  the miller drew a breath of relief  why bob he said i thought the house was afire  im smoking rather fast to drown my reflections father  tis no use to chaw  to tempt his attenuated appetite the unhappy mate made david cook an omelet and bake a seedcake the latter so richly compounded that it opened to the knife like a freckled buttercup  with the same object he stuck nightlines into the banks of the millpond and drew up next morning a family of fat eels some of which were skinned and prepared for his breakfast  they were his favourite fish but such had been his condition that until the moment of making this effort he had quite forgotten their existence at his fathers backdoor  in a few days bob loveday had considerably improved in tone and vigour one other obvious remedy for his dejection was to indulge in the society of miss garland love being so much more effectually got rid of by displacement than by attempted annihilation  but lovedays belief that he had offended her beyond forgiveness and his everpresent sense of her as a woman who by education and antecedents was fitted to adorn a higher sphere than his own effectually kept him from going near her for a long time notwithstanding that they were inmates of one house  the reserve was however in some degree broken by the appearance one morning later in the season of the point of a saw through the partition which divided annes room from the loveday half of the house  though she dined and supped with her mother and the loveday family miss garland had still continued to occupy her old apartments because she found it more convenient there to pursue her hobbies of woolwork and of copying her fathers old pictures  the division wall had not as yet been broken down  as the saw worked its way downwards under her astonished gaze anne jumped up from her drawing and presently the temporary canvasing and papering which had sealed up the old door of communication was cut completely through  the door burst open and bob stood revealed on the other side with the saw in his hand  i beg your ladyships pardon he said taking off the hat he had been working in as his handsome face expanded into a smile  i didnt know this door opened into your private room  indeed captain loveday  i am pulling down the division on principle as we are now one family but i really thought the door opened into your passage  it dont matter i can get another room  not at all  father wouldnt let me turn you out  ill close it up again  but anne was so interested in the novelty of a new doorway that she walked through it and found herself in a dark low passage which she had never seen before  it leads to the mill said bob  would you like to go in and see it at work  but perhaps you have already  only into the ground floor  come all over it  i am practising as grinder you know to help my father  she followed him along the dark passage in the side of which he opened a little trap when she saw a great slimy cavern where the long arms of the millwheel flung themselves slowly and distractedly round and splashing waterdrops caught the little light that strayed into the gloomy place turning it into stars and flashes  a cold mistladen puff of air came into their faces and the roar from within made it necessary for anne to shout as she said it is dismal let us go on  bob shut the trap the roar ceased and they went on to the inner part of the mill where the air was warm and nutty and pervaded by a fog of flour  then they ascended the stairs and saw the stones lumbering round and round and the yellow corn running down through the hopper  they climbed yet further to the top stage where the wheat lay in bins and where long rays like feelers stretched in from the sun through the little window got nearly lost among cobwebs and timber and completed their course by marking the opposite wall with a glowing patch of gold  in his earnestness as an exhibitor bob opened the bolter which was spinning rapidly round the result being that a dense cloud of flour rolled out in their faces reminding anne that her complexion was probably much paler by this time than when she had entered the mill  she thanked her companion for his trouble and said she would now go down  he followed her with the same deference as hitherto and with a sudden and increasing sense that of all cures for his former unhappy passion this would have been the nicest the easiest and the most effectual if he had only been fortunate enough to keep her upon easy terms  but miss garland showed no disposition to go further than accept his services as a guide she descended to the open air shook the flour from her like a bird and went on into the garden amid the september sunshine whose rays lay level across the blue haze which the earth gave forth  the gnats were dancing up and down in airy companies the nasturtium flowers shone out in groups from the dark hedge over which they climbed and the mellow smell of the decline of summer was exhaled by everything  bob followed her as far as the gate looked after her thought of her as the same girl who had half encouraged him years ago when she seemed so superior to him though now they were almost equal she apparently thought him beneath her  it was with a new sense of pleasure that his mind flew to the fact that she was now an inmate of his fathers house  his obsequious bearing was continued during the next week  in the busy hours of the day they seldom met but they regularly encountered each other at meals and these cheerful occasions began to have an interest for him quite irrespective of dishes and cups  when anne entered and took her seat she was always loudly hailed by miller loveday as he whetted his knife but from bob she condescended to accept no such familiar greeting and they often sat down together as if each had a blind eye in the direction of the other  bob sometimes told serious and correct stories about seacaptains pilots boatswains mates able seamen and other curious fauna of the marine world but these were directly addressed to his father and mrs loveday anne being included at the clinchingpoint by a glance only  he sometimes opened bottles of sweet cider for her and then she thanked him but even this did not lead to her encouraging his chat  one day when anne was paring an apple she was left at table with the young man  i have made something for you he said  she looked all over the table nothing was there save the ordinary remnants  o i dont mean that it is here it is out by the bridge at the millhead  he arose and anne followed with curiosity in her eyes and with her firm little mouth pouted up to a puzzled shape  on reaching the mossy mill head she found that he had fixed in the keen damp draught which always prevailed over the wheel an aeolian harp of large size  at present the strings were partly covered with a cloth  he lifted it and the wires began to emit a weird harmony which mingled curiously with the plashing of the wheel  i made it on purpose for you miss garland he said  she thanked him very warmly for she had never seen anything like such an instrument before and it interested her  it was very thoughtful of you to make it she added  how came you to think of such a thing  o i dont know exactly he replied as if he did not care to be questioned on the point  i have never made one in my life till now  every night after this during the mournful gales of autumn the strange mixed music of water wind and strings met her ear swelling and sinking with an almost supernatural cadence  the character of the instrument was far enough removed from anything she had hitherto seen of bobs hobbies so that she marvelled pleasantly at the new depths of poetry this contrivance revealed as existent in that young seamans nature and allowed her emotions to flow out yet a little further in the old direction notwithstanding her late severe resolve to bar them back  one breezy night when the mill was kept going into the small hours and the wind was exactly in the direction of the watercurrent the music so mingled with her dreams as to wake her it seemed to rhythmically set itself to the words remember me think of me  she was much impressed the sounds were almost too touching and she spoke to bob the next morning on the subject  how strange it is that you should have thought of fixing that harp where the water gushes she gently observed  it affects me almost painfully at night  you are poetical captain bob  but it is tootoo sad  i will take it away said captain bob promptly  it certainly is too sad i thought so myself  i myself was kept awake by it one night  how came you to think of making such a peculiar thing  well said bob it is hardly worth saying why  it is not a good place for such a queer noisy machine and ill take it away  on second thoughts said anne i should like it to remain a little longer because it sets me thinking  of me he asked with earnest frankness  annes colour rose fast  well yes she said trying to infuse much plain matteroffact into her voice  of course i am led to think of the person who invented it  bob seemed unaccountably embarrassed and the subject was not pursued about halfanhour later he came to her again with something of an uneasy look  there was a little matter i didnt tell you just now miss garland he said  about that harp thing i mean  i did make it certainly but it was my brother john who asked me to do it just before he went away  john is very musical as you know and he said it would interest you but as he didnt ask me to tell i did not  perhaps i ought to have and not have taken the credit to myself  o it is nothing said anne quickly  it is a very incomplete instrument after all and it will be just as well for you to take it away as you first proposed  he said that he would but he forgot to do it that day and the following night there was a high wind and the harp cried and moaned so movingly that anne whose window was quite near could hardly bear the sound with its new associations  john loveday was present to her mind all night as an illused man and yet she could not own that she had illused him  the harp was removed next day  bob feeling that his credit for originality was damaged in her eyes by way of recovering it set himself to paint the summerhouse which anne frequented and when he came out he assured her that it was quite his own idea  it wanted doing certainly she said in a neutral tone  it is just about troublesome  yes you cant quite reach up  thats because you are not very tall is it not captain loveday  you never used to say things like that  o i dont mean that you are much less than tall  shall i hold the paint for you to save your stepping down  thank you if you would  she took the paintpot and stood looking at the brush as it moved up and down in his hand  i hope i shall not sprinkle your fingers he observed as he dipped  o that would not matter  you do it very well  i am glad to hear that you think so  but perhaps not quite so much art is demanded to paint a summerhouse as to paint a picture  thinking that as a painters daughter and a person of education superior to his own she spoke with a flavour of sarcasm he felt humbled and said  you did not use to talk like that to me  i was perhaps too young then to take any pleasure in giving pain she observed daringly  does it give you pleasure  anne nodded  i like to give pain to people who have given pain to me she said smartly without removing her eyes from the green liquid in her hand  i ask your pardon for that  i didnt say i meant youthough i did mean you  bob looked and looked at her side face till he was bewitched into putting down his brush  it was that stupid forgetting of ee for a time he exclaimed  well i hadnt seen you for so very longconsider how many years  o dear anne he said advancing to take her hand how well we knew one another when we were children  you was a queen to me then and so you are now and always  possibly anne was thrilled pleasantly enough at having brought the truant village lad to her feet again but he was not to find the situation so easy as he imagined and her hand was not to be taken yet  very pretty she said laughing  and only six weeks since miss johnson left  zounds dont say anything about that implored bob  i swear that i nevernever deliberately loved herfor a long time together that is it was a sudden sort of thing you know  but towards youi have more or less honoured and respectfully loved you off and on all my life  there thats true  anne retorted quickly  i am willing off and on to believe you captain robert  but i dont see any good in your making these solemn declarations  give me leave to explain dear miss garland  it is to get you to be pleased to renew an old promisemade years agothat youll think o me  not a word of any promise will i repeat  well well i wont urge ee today  only let me beg of you to get over the quite wrong notion you have of me and it shall be my whole endeavour to fetch your gracious favour  anne turned away from him and entered the house whither in the course of a quarter of an hour he followed her knocking at her door and asking to be let in  she said she was busy whereupon he went away to come back again in a short time and receive the same answer  i have finished painting the summerhouse for you he said through the door  i cannot come to see it  i shall be engaged till suppertime  she heard him breathe a heavy sigh and withdraw murmuring something about his bad luck in being cut away from the starn like this  but it was not over yet  when suppertime came and they sat down together she took upon herself to reprove him for what he had said to her in the garden  bob made his forehead express despair  now i beg you this one thing he said  just let me know your whole mind  then i shall have a chance to confess my faults and mend them or clear my conduct to your satisfaction  she answered with quickness but not loud enough to be heard by the old people at the other end of the tablethen captain loveday i will tell you one thing one fault that perhaps would have been more proper to my character than to yours  you are too easily impressed by new faces and that gives me a bad opinion of youyes a bad opinion  o thats it said bob slowly looking at her with the intense respect of a pupil for a master her words being spoken in a manner so precisely between jest and earnest that he was in some doubt how they were to be received  impressed by new faces  it is wrong certainly of me  the popping of a cork and the pouring out of strong beer by the miller with a view to giving it a head were apparently distractions sufficient to excuse her in not attending further to him and during the remainder of the sitting her gentle chiding seemed to be sinking seriously into his mind  perhaps her own heart ached to see how silent he was but she had always meant to punish him  day after day for two or three weeks she preserved the same demeanour with a selfcontrol which did justice to her character  and on his part considering what he had to put up withhow she eluded him snapped him off refused to come out when he called her refused to see him when he wanted to enter the little parlour which she had now appropriated to her private use his patience testified strongly to his goodhumour     xxiii  military preparations on an extended scale   christmas had passed  dreary winter with dark evenings had given place to more dreary winter with light evenings  rapid thaws had ended in rain rain in wind wind in dust  showery days had comethe season of pink dawns and white sunsets and people hoped that the march weather was over  the chief incident that concerned the household at the mill was that the miller following the example of all his neighbours had become a volunteer and duly appeared twice a week in a red longtailed military coat pipeclayed breeches black cloth gaiters a heelballed helmet hat with a tuft of green wool and epaulettes of the same colour and material  bob still remained neutral  not being able to decide whether to enrol himself as a seafencible a local militiaman or a volunteer he simply went on dancing attendance upon anne  mrs loveday had become awake to the fact that the pair of young people stood in a curious attitude towards each other but as they were never seen with their heads together and scarcely ever sat even in the same room she could not be sure what their movements meant  strangely enough or perhaps naturally enough since entering the loveday family herself she had gradually grown to think less favourably of anne doing the same thing and reverted to her original idea of encouraging festus this more particularly because he had of late shown such perseverance in haunting the precincts of the mill presumably with the intention of lighting upon the young girl  but the weather had kept her mostly indoors  one afternoon it was raining in torrents  such leaves as there were on trees at this time of yearthose of the laurel and other evergreensstaggered beneath the hard blows of the drops which fell upon them and afterwards could be seen trickling down the stems beneath and silently entering the ground  the surface of the millpond leapt up in a thousand spirts under the same downfall and clucked like a hen in the ratholes along the banks as it undulated under the wind  the only dry spot visible from the front windows of the millhouse was the inside of a small shed on the opposite side of the courtyard  while mrs loveday was noticing the threads of rain descending across its interior shade festus derriman walked up and entered it for shelter which owing to the lumber within it but scantily afforded to a man who would have been a match for one of frederick williams patagonians  it was an excellent opportunity for helping on her scheme  anne was in the back room and by asking him in till the rain was over she would bring him face to face with her daughter whom as the days went on she increasingly wished to marry other than a loveday now that the romance of her own alliance with the millet had in some respects worn off  she was better provided for than before she was not unhappy but the plain fact was that she had married beneath her  she beckoned to festus through the windowpane he instantly complied with her signal having in fact placed himself there on purpose to be noticed for he knew that miss garland would not be outofdoors on such a day  good afternoon mrs loveday said festus on entering  there nowif i didnt think thats how it would be  his voice had suddenly warmed to anger for he had seen a door close in the back part of the room a lithe figure having previously slipped through  mrs loveday turned observed that anne was gone and said what is it as if she did not know  o nothing nothing said festus crossly  you know well enough what it is maam only you make pretence otherwise  but ill bring her to book yet  you shall drop your haughty airs my charmer  she little thinks i have kept an account of em all  but you must treat her politely sir said mrs loveday secretly pleased at these signs of uncontrollable affection  dont tell me of politeness or generosity maam  she is more than a match for me  she regularly gets over me  i have passed by this house fiveandfifty times since last martinmas and this is all my reward fort  but you will stay till the rain is over sir  no  i dont mind rain  im off again  shes got somebody else in her eye  and the yeoman went out slamming the door  meanwhile the slippery object of his hopes had gone along the dark passage passed the trap which opened on the wheel and through the door into the mill where she was met by bob who looked up from the flour shoot inquiringly and said you want me miss garland  o no said she  i only want to be allowed to stand here a few minutes  he looked at her to know if she meant it and finding that she did returned to his post  when the mill had rumbled on a little longer he came back  bob she said when she saw him move remember that you are at work and have no time to stand close to me  he bowed and went to his original post again anne watching from the window till festus should leave  the mill rumbled on as before and at last bob came to her for the third time  now bob she began  on my honour tis only to ask a question  will you walk with me to church next sunday afternoon  perhaps i will she said  but at this moment the yeoman left the house and anne to escape further parley returned to the dwelling by the way she had come  sunday afternoon arrived and the family was standing at the door waiting for the church bells to begin  from that side of the house they could see southward across a paddock to the rising ground further ahead where there grew a large elmtree beneath whose boughs footpaths crossed in different directions like meridians at the pole  the tree was old and in summer the grass beneath it was quite trodden away by the feet of the many trysters and idlers who haunted the spot  the tree formed a conspicuous object in the surrounding landscape  while they looked a foot soldier in red uniform and white breeches came along one of the paths and stopping beneath the elm took from his pocket a paper which he proceeded to nail up by the four corners to the trunk  he drew back looked at it and went on his way  bob got his glass from indoors and levelled it at the placard but after looking for a long time he could make out nothing but a lion and a unicorn at the top  anne who was ready for church moved away from the door though it was yet early and showed her intention of going by way of the elm  the paper had been so impressively nailed up that she was curious to read it even at this theological time  bob took the opportunity of following and reminded her of her promise  then walk behind me not at all close she said  yes he replied immediately dropping behind  the ludicrous humility of his manner led her to add playfully over her shoulder it serves you right you know  i deserve anything but i must take the liberty to say that i hope my behaviour about matil in forgetting you awhile will not make ye wish to keep me always behind  she replied confidentially why i am so earnest not to be seen with you is that i may appear to people to be independent of you  knowing what i do of your weaknesses i can do no otherwise  you must be schooled into  o anne sighed bob you hit me hardtoo hard  if ever i do win you i am sure i shall have fairly earned you  you are not what you once seemed to be she returned softly  i dont quite like to let myself love you  the last words were not very audible and as bob was behind he caught nothing of them nor did he see how sentimental she had become all of a sudden  they walked the rest of the way in silence and coming to the tree read as follows     address to all ranks and descriptions of englishmen     friends and countrymenthe french are now assembling the largest    force that ever was prepared to invade this kingdom with the    professed purpose of effecting our complete ruin and destruction  they    do not disguise their intentions as they have often done to other    countries but openly boast that they will come over in such numbers    as cannot be resisted     wherever the french have lately appeared they have spared neither rich    nor poor old nor young but like a destructive pestilence have laid    waste and destroyed every thing that before was fair and flourishing     on this occasion no mans service is compelled but you are invited    voluntarily to come forward in defence of everything that is dear to    you by entering your names on the lists which are sent to the tything    man of every parish and engaging to act either as associated    volunteers bearing arms as pioneers and labourers or as drivers    of waggons     as associated volunteers you will be called out only once a week    unless the actual landing of the enemy should render your further    services necessary     as pioneers or labourers you will be employed in breaking up roads to    hinder the enemys advance     those who have pickaxes spades shovels billhooks or other working    implements are desired to mention them to the constable or tything    man of their parish in order that they may be entered on the lists    opposite their homes to be used if necessary        it is thought desirable to give you this explanation that you may not    be ignorant of the duties to which you may be called  but if the love    of true liberty and honest fame has not ceased to animate the hearts    of englishmen pay though necessary will be the least part of your    reward  you will find your best recompense in having done your duty    to your king and country by driving back or destroying your old and    implacable enemy envious of your freedom and happiness and therefore    seeking to destroy them in having protected your wives and children    from death or worse than death which will follow the success of such    inveterate foes     rouse therefore and unite as one man in the best of causes  united    we may defy the world to conquer us but victory will never belong to    those who are slothful and unprepared 207  i must go and join at once said bob  anne turned to him all the playfulness gone from her face  i wish we lived in the north of england bob so as to be further away from where hell land she murmured uneasily  where we are would be paradise to me if you would only make it so  it is not right to talk so lightly at such a serious time she thoughtfully returned going on towards the church  on drawing near they saw through the boughs of a clump of intervening trees still leafless but bursting into buds of amber hue a glittering which seemed to be reflected from points of steel  in a few moments they heard above the tender chiming of the church bells the loud voice of a man giving words of command at which all the metallic points suddenly shifted like the bristles of a porcupine and glistened anew  tis the drilling said loveday  they drill now between the services you know because they cant get the men together so readily in the week it makes me feel that i ought to be doing more than i am  when they had passed round the belt of trees the company of recruits became visible consisting of the ablebodied inhabitants of the hamlets thereabout more or less known to bob and anne  they were assembled on the green plot outside the churchyardgate dressed in their common clothes and the sergeant who had been putting them through their drill was the man who nailed up the proclamation  he was now engaged in untying a canvas moneybag from which he drew forth a handful of shillings giving one to each man in payment for his attendance  men i dismissed ye too soonparade parade again i say he cried my watch is fast i find  theres another twenty minutes afore the worship of god commences  now all of you that hant got firelocks fall in at the lower end  eyes right and dress  as every man was anxious to see how the rest stood those at the end of the line pressed forward for that purpose till the line assumed the form of a bow  look at ye now  why you are all a crooking in  dress dress  they dressed forthwith but impelled by the same motive they soon resumed their former figure and so they were despairingly permitted to remain  now i hope youll have a little patience said the sergeant as he stood in the centre of the arc and pay strict attention to the word of command just exactly as i give it out to ye and if i should go wrong i shall be much obliged to any friend wholl put me right again for i have only been in the army three weeks myself and we are all liable to mistakes  so we be so we be said the line heartily  tention the whole then  poise fawlocks  very well done  please what must we do that havent got no firelocks said the lower end of the line in a helpless voice  now was ever such a question  why you must do nothing at all but think how youd poise em if you had em  you middle men that are armed with hurdlesticks and cabbagestumps just to makebelieve must of course use em as if they were the real thing  now then cock fawlocks present  fire pretend to i mean and the same time throw yer imagination into the field o battle  very goodvery good indeed except that some of you were a little too soon and the rest a little too late  please sergeant can i fall out as i am masterplayer in the choir and my bassviol strings wont stand at this time o year unless they be screwed up a little before the passon comes in  how can you think of such trifles as churchgoing at such a time as this when your own native country is on the point of invasion said the sergeant sternly  and as you know the drill ends three minutes afore church begins and thats the law and it wants a quarter of an hour yet now at the word prime shake the powder supposing youve got it into the primingpan three last fingers behind the rammer then shut your pans drawing your right arm nimblelike towards your body  i ought to have told ye before this that at hand your katridge seize it and bring it with a quick motion to your mouth bite the top well

211  many of the company who had been drilled preferred to go off and spend their shillings instead of entering the church but anne and captain bob passed in  even the interior of the sacred edifice was affected by the agitation of the times  the religion of the country had in fact changed from love of god to hatred of napoleon buonaparte and as if to remind the devout of this alteration the pikes for the pikemen all those accepted men who were not otherwise armed were kept in the church of each parish  there against the wall they always stooda whole sheaf of them formed of new ash stems with a spike driven in at one end the stick being preserved from splitting by a ferule  and there they remained year after year in the corner of the aisle till they were removed and placed under the gallery stairs and thence ultimately to the belfry where they grew black rusty and wormeaten and were gradually stolen and carried off by sextons parish clerks whitewashers windowmenders and other church servants for use at home as rakestems benefitclub staves and pickhandles in which degraded situations they may still occasionally be found  but in their new and shining state they had a terror for anne whose eyes were involuntarily drawn towards them as she sat at bobs side during the service filling her with bloody visions of their possible use not far from the very spot on which they were now assembled  the sermon too was on the subject of patriotism so that when they came out she began to harp uneasily upon the probability of their all being driven from their homes  bob assured her that with the sixty thousand regulars the militia reserve of a hundred and twenty thousand and the three hundred thousand volunteers there was not much to fear  but i sometimes have a fear that poor john will be killed he continued after a pause  he is sure to be among the first that will have to face the invaders and the trumpeters get picked off  there is the same chance for him as for the others said anne  yesyesthe same chance such as it is  you have never liked john since that affair of matilda johnson have you  why she quickly asked  well said bob timidly as it is a ticklish time for him would it not be worth while to make up any differences before the crash comes  i have nothing to make up said anne with some distress  she still fully believed the trumpetmajor to have smuggled away miss johnson because of his own interest in that lady which must have made his professions to herself a mere pastime but that very conduct had in it the curious advantage to herself of setting bob free  since john has been gone continued her companion i have found out more of his meaning and of what he really had to do with that womans flight  did you know that he had anything to do with it  yes  that he got her to go away  she looked at bob with surprise  he was not exasperated with john and yet he knew so much as this  yes she said what did it mean  he did not explain to her then but the possibility of johns death which had been newly brought home to him by the military events of the day determined him to get poor johns character cleared  reproaching himself for letting her remain so long with a mistaken idea of him bob went to his father as soon as they got home and begged him to get mrs loveday to tell anne the true reason of johns objection to miss johnson as a sisterinlaw  she thinks it is because they were old lovers new met and that he wants to marry her he exclaimed to his father in conclusion  then thats the meaning of the split between miss nancy and jack said the miller  what were they any more than common friends asked bob uneasily  not on her side perhaps  well we must do it replied bob painfully conscious that common justice to john might bring them into hazardous rivalry yet determined to be fair  tell it all to mrs loveday and get her to tell anne     xxiv  a letter a visitor and a tin box   the result of the explanation upon anne was bitter selfreproach  she was so sorry at having wronged the kindly soldier that next morning she went by herself to the down and stood exactly where his tent had covered the sod on which he had lain so many nights thinking what sadness he must have suffered because of her at the time of packing up and going away  after that she wiped from her eyes the tears of pity which had come there descended to the house and wrote an impulsive letter to him in which occurred the following passages indiscreet enough under the circumstances     i find all justice all rectitude on your side john and all    impertinence all inconsiderateness on mine  i am so much convinced    of your honour in the whole transaction that i shall for the future    mistrust myself in everything  and if it be possible whenever i    differ from you on any point i shall take an hours time for    consideration before i say that i differ  if i have lost your    friendship i have only myself to thank for it but i sincerely hope    that you can forgive  after writing this she went to the garden where bob was shearing the spring grass from the paths  what is johns direction she said holding the sealed letter in her hand  exonbury barracks bob faltered his countenance sinking  she thanked him and went indoors  when he came in later in the day he passed the door of her empty sittingroom and saw the letter on the mantelpiece  he disliked the sight of it  hearing voices in the other room he entered and found anne and her mother there talking to cripplestraw who had just come in with a message from squire derriman requesting miss garland as she valued the peace of mind of an old and troubled man to go at once and see him  i cannot go she said not liking the risk that such a visit involved  an hour later cripplestraw shambled again into the passage on the same errand  maisters very poorly and he hopes that youll come misess anne  he wants to see ee very particular about the french  anne would have gone in a moment but for the fear that some one besides the farmer might encounter her and she answered as before  another hour passed and the wheels of a vehicle were heard  cripplestraw had come for the third time with a horse and gig he was dressed in his best clothes and brought with him on this occasion a basket containing raisins almonds oranges and sweet cakes  offering them to her as a gift from the old farmer he repeated his request for her to accompany him the gig and best mare having been sent as an additional inducement  i believe the old gentleman is in love with you anne said her mother  why couldnt he drive down himself to see me anne inquired of cripplestraw  he wants you at the house please  is mr festus with him  no hes away to budmouth  ill go said she  and i may come and meet you said bob  theres my letterwhat shall i do about that she said instead of answering him  take my letter to the postoffice and you may come she added  he said yes and went out cripplestraw retreating to the door till she should be ready  what letter is it said her mother  only one to john said anne  i have asked him to forgive my suspicions  i could do no less  do you want to marry him asked mrs loveday bluntly  mother  well he will take that letter as an encouragement  cant you see that he will you foolish girl  anne did see instantly  of course she said  tell robert that he need not go  she went to her room to secure the letter  it was gone from the mantelpiece and on inquiry it was found that the miller seeing it there had sent david with it to budmouth hours ago  anne said nothing and set out for oxwell hall with cripplestraw  william said mrs loveday to the miller when anne was gone and bob had resumed his work in the garden did you get that letter sent off on purpose  well i did  i wanted to make sure of it  john likes her and now twill be made up and why shouldnt he marry her  ill start him in business if so be shell have him  but she is likely to marry festus derriman  i dont want her to marry anybody but john said the miller doggedly  not if she is in love with bob and has been for years and he with her asked his wife triumphantly  in love with bob and he with her repeated loveday  certainly said she going off and leaving him to his reflections  when anne reached the hall she found old mr derriman in his customary chair  his complexion was more ashen but his movement in rising at her entrance putting a chair and shutting the door behind her were much the same as usual  thank god youve come my dear girl he said earnestly  ah you dont trip across to read to me now  why did ye cost me so much to fetch you fie  a horse and gig and a mans time in going three times  and what i sent ye cost a good deal in budmouth market now everything is so dear there and twould have cost more if i hadnt bought the raisins and oranges some months ago when they were cheaper  i tell you this because we are old friends and i have nobody else to tell my troubles to  but i dont begrudge anything to ye since youve come  i am not much pleased to come even now said she  what can make you so seriously anxious to see me  well you be a good girl and true and ive been thinking that of all people of the next generation that i can trust you are the best  tis my bonds and my titledeeds such as they be and the leases you know and a few guineas in packets and more than these my will that i have to speak about  now do ye come this way  o such things as those she returned with surprise  i dont understand those things at all  theres nothing to understand  tis just this  the french will be here within two months thats certain  i have it on the best authority that the army at boulogne is ready the boats equipped the plans laid and the first consul only waits for a tide  heaven knows what will become o the men o these parts  but most likely the women will he spared  now ill show ee  he led her across the hall to a stone staircase of semicircular plan which conducted to the cellars  down here she said  yes i must trouble ye to come down here  i have thought and thought who is the woman that can best keep a secret for six months and i say anne garland  you wont be married before then  o no murmured the young woman  i wouldnt expect ye to keep a close tongue after such a thing as that but it will not be necessary  when they reached the bottom of the steps he struck a light from a tinder box and unlocked the middle one of three doors which appeared in the whitewashed wall opposite  the rays of the candle fell upon the vault and sides of a long low cellar littered with decayed woodwork from other parts of the hall among the rest stairbalusters carved finials tracery panels and wainscoting  but what most attracted her eye was a small flagstone turned up in the middle of the floor a heap of earth beside it and a measuringtape  derriman went to the corner of the cellar and pulled out a clamped box from under the straw  you be rather heavy my dear eh he said affectionately addressing the box as he lifted it  but you are going to be put in a safe place you know or that rascal will get hold of ye and carry ye off and ruin me  he then with some difficulty lowered the box into the hole raked in the earth upon it and lowered the flagstone which he was a long time in fixing to his satisfaction  miss garland who was romantically interested helped him to brush away the fragments of loose earth and when he had scattered over the floor a little of the straw that lay about they again ascended to upper air  is this all sir said anne  just a moment longer honey  will you come into the great parlour  she followed him thither  if anything happens to me while the fighting is going onit may be on these very fieldsyou will know what to do he resumed  but first please sit down again theres a dear whilst i write whats in my head see theres the best paper and a new quill that ive afforded myself fort  what a strange business  i dont think i much like it mr derriman she said seating herself  he had by this time begun to write and murmured as he wrote  twentythree and a half from nw  sixteen and threequarters from nethere thats all  now i seal it up and give it to you to keep safe till i ask ye for it or you hear of my being trampled down by the enemy  what does it mean she asked as she received the paper  clk  ha ha  why thats the distance of the box from the two corners of the cellar  i measured it before you came  and my honey to make all sure if the french soldiery are after ye tell your mother the meaning ont or any other friend in case they should put ye to death and the secret be lost  but that i am sure i hope they wont do though your pretty face will be a sad bait to the soldiers  i often have wished you was my daughter honey and yet in these times the less cares a man has the better so i am glad you baint  shall my man drive you home  no no she said much depressed by the words he had uttered  i can find my way  you need not trouble to come down  then take care of the paper  and if you outlive me youll find i have not forgot you     xxv  festus shows his love   festus derriman had remained in the royal wateringplace all that day his horse being sick at stables but wishing to coax or bully from his uncle a remount for the coming summer he set off on foot for oxwell early in the evening  when he drew near to the village or rather to the hall which was a mile from the village he overtook a slim quickeyed woman sauntering along at a leisurely pace  she was fashionably dressed in a green spencer with mameluke sleeves and wore a velvet spanish hat and feather  good afternoon tye maam said festus throwing a swordandpistol air into his greeting  you are out for a walk  i am out for a walk captain said the lady who had criticized him from the crevice of her eye without seeming to do much more than continue her demure look forward and gave the title as a sop to his apparent character  from the townid swear it maam pon my honour i would  yes i am from the town sir said she  ah you are a visitor  i know every one of the regular inhabitants we soldiers are in and out there continually  festus derriman yeomanry cavalry you know  the fact is the wateringplace is under our charge the folks will be quite dependent upon us for their deliverance in the coming struggle  we hold our lives in our hands and theirs i may say in our pockets  what made you come here maam at such a critical time  i dont see that it is such a critical time  but it is though and so youd say if you was as much mixed up with the military affairs of the nation as some of us  the lady smiled  the king is coming this year anyhow said she  never said festus firmly  ah you are one of the attendants at court perhaps come on ahead to get the kings chambers ready in case boney should not land  no she said i am connected with the theatre though not just at the present moment  i have been out of luck for the last year or two but i have fetched up again  i join the company when they arrive for the season  festus surveyed her with interest  faith and is it so  well maam what part do you play  i am mostly the leading ladythe heroine she said drawing herself up with dignity  ill come and have a look at ye if alls well and the landing is put offhang me if i donthullo hullo what do i see  his eyes were stretched towards a distant field which anne garland was at that moment hastily crossing on her way from the hall to overcombe  i must be off  goodday to ye dear creature he exclaimed hurrying forward  the lady said o you droll monster as she smiled and watched him stride ahead  festus bounded on over the hedge across the intervening patch of green and into the field which anne was still crossing  in a moment or two she looked back and seeing the wellknown herculean figure of the yeoman behind her felt rather alarmed though she determined to show no difference in her outward carriage  but to maintain her natural gait was beyond her powers  she spasmodically quickened her pace fruitlessly however for he gained upon her and when within a few strides of her exclaimed well my darling  anne started off at a run  festus was already out of breath and soon found that he was not likely to overtake her  on she went without turning her head till an unusual noise behind compelled her to look round  his face was in the act of falling back he swerved on one side and dropped like a log upon a convenient hedgerowbank which bordered the path  there he lay quite still  anne was somewhat alarmed and after standing at gaze for two or three minutes drew nearer to him a step and a half at a time wondering and doubting as a meek ewe draws near to some strolling vagabond who flings himself on the grass near the flock  he is in a swoon she murmured  her heart beat quickly and she looked around  nobody was in sight she advanced a step nearer still and observed him again  apparently his face was turning to a livid hue and his breathing had become obstructed  tis not a swoon tis apoplexy she said in deep distress  i ought to untie his neck  but she was afraid to do this and only drew a little closer still  miss garland was now within three feet of him whereupon the senseless man who could hold his breath no longer sprang to his feet and darted at her saying ha ha a scheme for a kiss  she felt his arm slipping round her neck but twirling about with amazing dexterity she wriggled from his embrace and ran away along the field  the force with which she had extricated herself was sufficient to throw festus upon the grass and by the time that he got upon his legs again she was many yards off  uttering a word which was not exactly a blessing he immediately gave chase and thus they ran till anne entered a meadow divided down the middle by a brook about six feet wide  a narrow plank was thrown loosely across at the point where the path traversed this stream and when anne reached it she at once scampered over  at the other side she turned her head to gather the probabilities of the situation which were that festus derriman would overtake her even now  by a sudden forethought she stooped seized the end of the plank and endeavoured to drag it away from the opposite bank  but the weight was too great for her to do more than slightly move it and with a desperate sigh she ran on again having lost many valuable seconds  but her attempt though ineffectual in dragging it down had been enough to unsettle the little bridge and when derriman reached the middle which he did half a minute later the plank turned over on its edge tilting him bodily into the river  the water was not remarkably deep but as the yeoman fell flat on his stomach he was completely immersed and it was some time before he could drag himself out  when he arose dripping on the bank and looked around anne had vanished from the mead then festuss eyes glowed like carbuncles and he gave voice to fearful imprecations shaking his fist in the soft summer air towards anne in a way that was terrible for any maiden to behold  wading back through the stream he walked along its bank with a heavy tread the water running from his coattails wrists and the tips of his ears in silvery dribbles that sparkled pleasantly in the sun  thus he hastened away and went round by a bypath to the hall  meanwhile the author of his troubles was rapidly drawing nearer to the mill and soon to her inexpressible delight she saw bob coming to meet her  she had heard the flounce and feeling more secure from her pursuer had dropped her pace to a quick walk  no sooner did she reach bob than overcome by the excitement of the moment she flung herself into his arms  bob instantly enclosed her in an embrace so very thorough that there was no possible danger of her falling whatever degree of exhaustion might have given rise to her somewhat unexpected action and in this attitude they silently remained till it was borne in upon anne that the present was the first time in her life that she had ever been in such a position  her face then burnt like a sunset and she did not know how to look up at him  feeling at length quite safe she suddenly resolved not to give way to her first impulse to tell him the whole of what had happened lest there should be a dreadful quarrel and fight between bob and the yeoman and great difficulties caused in the loveday family on her account the miller having important wheat transactions with the derrimans  you seem frightened dearest anne said bob tenderly  yes she replied  i saw a man i did not like the look of and he was inclined to follow me  but worse than that i am troubled about the french  o bob i am afraid you will be killed and my mother and john and your father and all of us hunted down  now i have told you dear little heart that it cannot be  we shall drive em into the sea after a battle or two even if they land which i dont believe they will  weve got ninety sail of the line and though it is rather unfortunate that we should have declared war against spain at this ticklish time theres enough for all  and bob went into elaborate statistics of the navy army militia and volunteers to prolong the time of holding her  when he had done speaking he drew rather a heavy sigh  whats the matter bob  i havent been yet to offer myself as a seafencible and i ought to have done it long ago  you are only one  surely they can do without you  bob shook his head  she arose from her restful position her eye catching his with a shamefaced expression of having given way at last loveday drew from his pocket a paper and said as they slowly walked on heres something to make us brave and patriotic  i bought it in budmouth  isnt it a stirring picture  it was a hieroglyphic profile of napoleon  the hat represented a maimed french eagle the face was ingeniously made up of human carcases knotted and writhing together in such directions as to form a physiognomy a band or stock shaped to resemble the english channel encircled his throat and seemed to choke him his epaulette was a hand tearing a cobweb that represented the treaty of peace with england and his ear was a woman crouching over a dying child 225  it is dreadful said anne  i dont like to see it  she had recovered from her emotion and walked along beside him with a grave subdued face  bob did not like to assume the privileges of an accepted lover and draw her hand through his arm for conscious that she naturally belonged to a politer grade than his own he feared lest her exhibition of tenderness were an impulse which cooler moments might regret  a perfect paulandvirginia life had not absolutely set in for him as yet and it was not to be hastened by force  when they had passed over the bridge into the millfront they saw the miller standing at the door with a face of concern  since you have been gone he said a government man has been here and to all the houses taking down the numbers of the women and children and their ages and the number of horses and waggons that can be mustered in case they have to retreat inland out of the way of the invading army  the little family gathered themselves together all feeling the crisis more seriously than they liked to express  mrs loveday thought how ridiculous a thing social ambition was in such a conjuncture as this and vowed that she would leave anne to love where she would  anne too forgot the little peculiarities of speech and manner in bob and his father which sometimes jarred for a moment upon her more refined sense and was thankful for their love and protection in this looming trouble  on going upstairs she remembered the paper which farmer derriman had given her and searched in her bosom for it  she could not find it there  i must have left it on the table she said to herself  it did not matter she remembered every word  she took a pen and wrote a duplicate which she put safely away  but anne was wrong  she had after all placed the paper where she supposed and there it ought to have been  but in escaping from festus when he feigned apoplexy it had fallen out upon the grass  five minutes after that event when pursuer and pursued were two or three fields ahead the gailydressed woman whom the yeoman had overtaken peeped cautiously through the stile into the corner of the field which had been the scene of the scramble and seeing the paper she climbed over secured it loosened the wafer without tearing the sheet and read the memorandum within  unable to make anything of its meaning the saunterer put it in her pocket and dismissing the matter from her mind went on by the by path which led to the back of the mill  here behind the hedge she stood and surveyed the old building for some time after which she meditatively turned and retraced her steps towards the royal watering place     xxvi  the alarm   the night which followed was historic and memorable  mrs loveday was awakened by the boom of a distant gun she told the miller and they listened awhile  the sound was not repeated but such was the state of their feelings that mr loveday went to bobs room and asked if he had heard it  bob was wide awake looking out of the window he had heard the ominous sound and was inclined to investigate the matter  while the father and son were dressing they fancied that a glare seemed to be rising in the sky in the direction of the beacon hill  not wishing to alarm anne and her mother the miller assured them that bob and himself were merely going out of doors to inquire into the cause of the report after which they plunged into the gloom together  a few steps progress opened up more of the sky which as they had thought was indeed irradiated by a lurid light but whether it came from the beacon or from a more distant point they were unable to clearly tell  they pushed on rapidly towards higher ground  their excitement was merely of a piece with that of all men at this critical juncture  everywhere expectation was at fever heat  for the last year or two only fiveandtwenty miles of shallow water had divided quiet english homesteads from an enemys army of a hundred and fifty thousand men  we had taken the matter lightly enough eating and drinking as in the days of noe and singing satires without end  we punned on buonaparte and his gunboats chalked his effigy on stagecoaches and published the same in prints  still between these bursts of hilarity it was sometimes recollected that england was the only european country which had not succumbed to the mighty little man who was less than human in feeling and more than human in will that our spirit for resistance was greater than our strength and that the channel was often calm  boats built of wood which was greenly growing in its native forest three days before it was bent as wales to their sides were ridiculous enough but they might be after all sufficient for a single trip between two visible shores  the english watched buonaparte in these preparations and buonaparte watched the english  at the distance of boulogne details were lost but we were impressed on fine days by the novel sight of a huge army moving and twinkling like a school of mackerel under the rays of the sun  the regular way of passing an afternoon in the coast towns was to stroll up to the signal posts and chat with the lieutenant on duty there about the latest inimical object seen at sea  about once a week there appeared in the newspapers either a paragraph concerning some adventurous english gentleman who had sailed out in a pleasureboat till he lay near enough to boulogne to see buonaparte standing on the heights among his marshals or else some lines about a mysterious stranger with a foreign accent who after collecting a vast deal of information on our resources had hired a boat at a southern port and vanished with it towards france before his intention could be divined  in forecasting his grand venture buonaparte postulated the help of providence to a remarkable degree  just at the hour when his troops were on board the flatbottomed boats and ready to sail there was to be a great fog that should spread a vast obscurity over the length and breadth of the channel and keep the english blind to events on the other side  the fog was to last twentyfour hours after which it might clear away  a dead calm was to prevail simultaneously with the fog with the twofold object of affording the boats easy transit and dooming our ships to lie motionless  thirdly there was to be a spring tide which should combine its manoeuvres with those of the fog and calm  among the many thousands of minor englishmen whose lives were affected by these tremendous designs may be numbered our old acquaintance corporal tullidge who sported the crushed arm and poor old simon burden the dazed veteran who had fought at minden  instead of sitting snugly in the settle of the old ship in the village adjoining overcombe they were obliged to keep watch on the hill  they made themselves as comfortable as was possible in the circumstances dwelling in a hut of clods and turf with a brick chimney for cooking  here they observed the nightly progress of the moon and stars grew familiar with the heaving of moles the dancing of rabbits on the hillocks the distant hoot of owls the bark of foxes from woods further inland but saw not a sign of the enemy as night after night they walked round the two ricks which it was their duty to fire at a signalone being of furze for a quick flame the other of turf for a long slow radiancethey thought and talked of old times and drank patriotically from a large wood flagon that was filled every day  bob and his father soon became aware that the light was from the beacon by the time that they reached the top it was one mass of towering flame from which the sparks fell on the green herbage like a fiery dew the forms of the two old men being seen passing and repassing in the midst of it  the lovedays who came up on the smoky side regarded the scene for a moment and then emerged into the light  who goes there said corporal tullidge shouldering a pike with his sound arm  o tis neighbour loveday  did you get your signal to fire it from the east said the miller hastily  no from abbotsea beach  but you are not to go by a coast signal  chok it all wasnt the lordlieutenants direction whenever you see rainbarrows beacon burn to the noreastard or haggardon to the norwestard or the actual presence of the enemy on the shore  but is he here  no doubt ot  the beach light is only just gone down and simon heard the guns even better than i  hark hark  i hear em said bob  they listened with parted lips the night wind blowing through simon burdens few teeth as through the ruins of stonehenge  from far down on the lower levels came the noise of wheels and the tramp of horses upon the turnpike road  well there must be something in it said miller loveday gravely  bob well go home and make the womenfolk safe and then ill don my soldiers clothes and be off  god knows where our company will assemble  they hastened down the hill and on getting into the road waited and listened again  travellers began to come up and pass them in vehicles of all descriptions  it was difficult to attract their attention in the dim light but by standing on the top of a wall which fenced the road bob was at last seen  whats the matter he cried to a butcher who was flying past in his cart his wife sitting behind him without a bonnet  the french have landed said the man without drawing rein  where shouted bob  in west bay and all budmouth is in uproar replied the voice now faint in the distance  bob and his father hastened on till they reached their own house  as they had expected anne and her mother in common with most of the people were both dressed and stood at the door bonneted and shawled listening to the traffic on the neighbouring highway mrs loveday having secured what money and small valuables they possessed in a huge pocket which extended all round her waist and added considerably to her weight and diameter  tis true enough said the miller hes come  you and anne and the maid must be off to cousin jims at kingsbere and when you get there you must do as they do  i must assemble with the company  and i said bob  thoust better run to the church and take a pike before they be all gone  the horse was put into the gig and mrs loveday anne and the servant maid were hastily packed into the vehicle the latter taking the reins davids duties as a fightingman forbidding all thought of his domestic offices now  then the silver tankard teapot pair of candlesticks like ionic columns and other articles too large to be pocketed were thrown into a basket and put up behind  then came the leavetaking which was as sad as it was hurried  bob kissed anne and there was no affectation in her receiving that mark of affection as she said through her tears god bless you  at last they moved off in the dim light of dawn neither of the three women knowing which road they were to take but trusting to chance to find it  as soon as they were out of sight bob went off for a pike and his father first newflinting his firelock proceeded to don his uniform pipeclaying his breeches with such cursory haste as to bespatter his black gaiters with the same ornamental compound  finding when he was ready that no bugle had as yet sounded he went with david to the cart house dragged out the waggon and put therein some of the most useful and easilyhandled goods in case there might be an opportunity for conveying them away  by the time this was done and the waggon pushed back and locked in bob had returned with his weapon somewhat mortified at being doomed to this low form of defence  the miller gave his son a parting grasp of the hand and arranged to meet him at kingsbere at the first opportunity if the news were true if happily false here at their own house  bother it all he exclaimed looking at his stock of flints  what said bob  ive got no ammunition not a blessed round  then whats the use of going asked his son  the miller paused  o ill go he said  perhaps somebody will lend me a little if i get into a hot corner  lend ye a little  father you was always so simple said bob reproachfully  welli can bagnet a few anyhow said the miller  the bugle had been blown ere this and loveday the father disappeared towards the place of assembly his empty cartridgebox behind him  bob seized a brace of loaded pistols which he had brought home from the ship and armed with these and a pike he locked the door and sallied out again towards the turnpike road  by this time the yeomanry of the district were also on the move and among them festus derriman who was sleeping at his uncles and had been awakened by cripplestraw  about the time when bob and his father were descending from the beacon the stalwart yeoman was standing in the stable yard adjusting his straps while cripplestraw saddled the horse  festus clanked up and down looked gloomily at the beacon heard the retreating carts and carriages and called cripplestraw to him who came from the stable leading the horse at the same moment that uncle benjy peeped unobserved from a mullioned window above their heads the distant light of the beacon fire touching up his features to the complexion of an old brass clockface  i think that before i start cripplestraw said festus whose lurid visage was undergoing a bleaching process curious to look upon you shall go on to budmouth and make a bold inquiry whether the cowardly enemy is on shore as yet or only looming in the bay  id go in a moment sir said the other if i hadnt my bad leg again i should have joined my company afore this but they said at last drill that i was too old  so i shall wait up in the hayloft for tidings as soon as i have packed you off poor gentleman  do such alarms as these cripplestraw ever happen without foundation buonaparte is a wretch a miserable wretch and this may be only a false alarm to disappoint such as me  o no sir o no  but sometimes there are false alarms  well sir yes  there was a pretended sally o gunboats last year  and was there nothing else pretendedsomething more like this for instance  cripplestraw shook his head  i notice yer modesty mr festus in making light of things  but there never was sir  you may depend upon it hes come  thank god my duty as a local dont require me to go to the front but only the valiant men like my master  ah if boney could only see ee now sir hed know too well there is nothing to be got from such a determined skilful officer but blows and musketballs  yes yes  cripplestraw if i ride off to budmouth and meet em all my training will be lost  no skill is required as a forlorn hope  true thats a point sir  you would outshine em all and be picked off at the very beginning as a toodangerous brave man  but if i stay here and urge on the fainthearted ones or get up into the turretstair by that gateway and pop at the invaders through the loophole i shouldnt be so completely wasted should i  you would not mr derriman  but as you was going to say next the fire in yer veins wont let ye do that  you are valiant very good you dont want to husband yer valiance at home  the argment is plain  if my birth had been more obscure murmured the yeoman and i had only been in the militia for instance or among the humble pikemen so much wouldnt have been expected of meof my fiery nature  cripplestraw is there a drop of brandy to be got at in the house  i dont feel very well  dear nephew said the old gentleman from above whom neither of the others had as yet noticed i havent any spirits openedso unfortunate but theres a beautiful barrel of crabapple cider in draught and theres some cold tea from last night  what is he listening said festus staring up  now i warrant how glad he is to see me forced to gocalled out of bed without breakfast and he quite safe and sure to escape because hes an old mancripplestraw i like being in the yeomanry cavalry but i wish i hadnt been in the ranks i wish i had been only the surgeon to stay in the rear while the bodies are brought back to himi mean i should have thrown my heart at such a time as this more into the labour of restoring wounded men and joining their shattered limbs togetheruuughmore than i can into causing the woundsi am too humane cripplestraw for the ranks  yes yes said his companion depressing his spirits to a kindred level  and yet such is fate that instead of joining mens limbs together youll have to get your own joinedpoor young sojerall through having such a warlike soul  yes murmured festus and paused  you cant think how strange i feel here cripplestraw he continued laying his hand upon the centre buttons of his waistcoat  how i do wish i was only the surgeon  he slowly mounted and uncle benjy in the meantime sang to himself as he looked on twentythree and half from nw  sixteen and three quarters from ne  whats that old mummy singing said festus savagely  only a hymn for preservation from our enemies dear nephew meekly replied the farmer who had heard the remark  twentythree and half from nw  festus allowed his horse to move on a few paces and then turned again as if struck by a happy invention  cripplestraw he began with an artificial laugh i am obliged to confess after alli must see her tisnt nature that makes me draw backtis love  i must go and look for her  a woman sir  i didnt want to confess it but tis a woman  strange that i should be drawn so entirely against my natural wish to rush at em  cripplestraw seeing which way the wind blew found it advisable to blow in harmony  ah now at last i see sir  spite that few men live that be worthy to command ye spite that you could rush on marshal the troops to victory as i may say but thenwhat of it theres the unhappy fate of being smit with the eyes of a woman and you are unmanned  maister derriman who is himself when hes got a woman round his neck like a millstone  it is something like that  i feel the case  be you valianti know of course the words being a matter of formbe you valiant i ask  yes of course  then dont you waste it in the open field  hoard it up i say sir for a higher class of warthe defence of yer adorable lady  think what you owe her at this terrible time  now maister derriman once more i ask ye to cast off that first haughty wish to rush to budmouth and to go where your misess is defenceless and alone  i will cripplestraw now you put it like that  thank ye thank ye heartily maister derriman  go now and hide with her  but can i  now hang flatterycan a man hide without a stain  of course i would not hide in any mean sense no not i  if you be in love tis plain you may since it is not your own life but anothers that you are concerned for and you only save your own because it cant be helped  tis true cripplestraw in a sense  but will it be understood that way  will they see it as a brave hiding  now sir if you had not been in love i own to ye that hiding would look queer but being to save the tears groans fits swowndings and perhaps death of a comely young woman yer principle is good you honourably retreat because you be too gallant to advance  this sounds strange ye may say sir but it is plain enough to less fiery minds  festus did for a moment try to uncover his teeth in a natural smile but it died away  cripplestraw you flatter me or do you mean it  well theres truth in it  i am more gallant in going to her than in marching to the shore  but we cannot be too careful about our good names we soldiers  i must not be seen  im off  cripplestraw opened the hurdle which closed the arch under the portico gateway and festus passed under uncle benjamin singing twentythree and a half from nw with a sort of sublime ecstasy feeling as festus had observed that his money was safe and that the french would not personally molest an old man in such a ragged mildewed coat as that he wore which he had taken the precaution to borrow from a scarecrow in one of his fields for the purpose  festus rode on full of his intention to seek out anne and under cover of protecting her retreat accompany her to kingsbere where he knew the lovedays had relatives  in the lane he met granny seamore who having packed up all her possessions in a small basket was placidly retreating to the mountains till all should be over  well granny have ye seen the french asked festus  no she said looking up at him through her brazen spectacles  if i had i shouldnt ha seed thee  faugh replied the yeoman and rode on  just as he reached the old road which he had intended merely to cross and avoid his countenance fell  some troops of regulars who appeared to be dragoons were rattling along the road  festus hastened towards an opposite gate so as to get within the field before they should see him but as illluck would have it as soon as he got inside a party of six or seven of his own yeomanry troop were straggling across the same field and making for the spot where he was  the dragoons passed without seeing him but when he turned out into the road again it was impossible to retreat towards overcombe village because of the yeomen  so he rode straight on and heard them coming at his heels  there was no other gate and the highway soon became as straight as a bowstring  unable thus to turn without meeting them and caught like an eel in a waterpipe festus drew nearer and nearer to the fateful shore  but he did not relinquish hope  just ahead there were crossroads and he might have a chance of slipping down one of them without being seen  on reaching the spot he found that he was not alone  a horseman had come up the righthand lane and drawn rein  it was an officer of the german legion and seeing festus he held up his hand  festus rode up to him and saluted  it ist false report said the officer  festus was a man again  he felt that nothing was too much for him  the officer after some explanation of the cause of alarm said that he was going across to the road which led by the moor to stop the troops and volunteers converging from that direction upon which festus offered to give information along the casterbridge road  the german crossed over and was soon out of sight in the lane while festus turned back upon the way by which he had come  the party of yeomanry cavalry was rapidly drawing near and he soon recognized among them the excited voices of stubb of duddle hole noakes of muckleford and other comrades of his orgies at the hall  it was a magnificent opportunity and festus drew his sword  when they were within speaking distance he reined round his chargers head to budmouth and shouted on comrades on  i am waiting for you  you have been a long time getting up with me seeing the glorious nature of our deeds today  well said derriman well said replied the foremost of the riders have you heard anything new  only that hes here with his tens of thousands and that we are to ride to meet him sword in hand as soon as we have assembled in the town ahead here  o lord said noakes with a slight falling of the lower jaw  the man who quails now is unworthy of the name of yeoman said festus still keeping ahead of the other troopers and holding up his sword to the sun  o noakes fie fie  you begin to look pale man  faith perhaps youd look pale said noakes with an envious glance upon festuss daring manner if you had a wife and family depending upon ye  ill take three frogeating frenchmen singlehanded rejoined derriman still flourishing his sword  they have as good swords as you as you will soon find said another of the yeomen  if they were three times armed said festusay thrice three timesi would attempt em three to one  how do you feel now my old friend stubb turning to another of the warriors  o friend stubb no bouncing health to our ladyloves in oxwell hall this summer as last  eh brownjohn  i am afraid not said brownjohn gloomily  no rattling dinners at stacies hotel and the king below with his staff  no wrenching off doorknockers and sending em to the bakehouse in a pie that nobody calls for  weeks of cutandthrust work rather  i suppose so  fight how we may we shant get rid of the cursed tyrant before autumn and many thousand brave men will lie low before its done remarked a young yeoman with a calm face who meant to do his duty without much talking  no grinning matches at maidun castle this summer festus resumed no threadtheneedle at greenhill fair and going into shows and driving the showman crazy with cockadoodledoo  i suppose not  does it make you seem just a trifle uncomfortable noakes  keep up your spirits old comrade  come forward we are only ambling on like so many donkeywomen  we have to get into budmouth join the rest of the troop and then march along the coast westard as i imagine  at this rate we shant be well into the thick of battle before twelve oclock  spur on comrades  no dancing on the green lockham this year in the moonlight you was tender upon that girl gad what will become o her in the struggle  come come derriman expostulated lockhamthis is all very well but i dont care for t  i am as ready to fight as any man but  perhaps when you get into battle derriman and see what its like your courage will cool down a little added noakes on the same side but with secret admiration of festuss reckless bravery  i shall be bayoneted first said festus  now lets rally and on  since festus was determined to spur on wildly the rest of the yeomen did not like to seem behindhand and they rapidly approached the town  had they been calm enough to reflect they might have observed that for the last halfhour no carts or carriages had met them on the way as they had done further back  it was not till the troopers reached the turnpike that they learnt what festus had known a quarter of an hour before  at the intelligence derriman sheathed his sword with a sigh and the party soon fell in with comrades who had arrived there before them whereupon the source and details of the alarm were boisterously discussed  what didnt you know of the mistake till now asked one of these of the newcomers  why when i was dropping over the hill by the cross roads i looked back and saw that man talking to the messenger and he must have told him the truth  the speaker pointed to festus  they turned their indignant eyes full upon him  that he had sported with their deepest feelings while knowing the rumour to be baseless was soon apparent to all  beat him black and blue with the flat of our blades shouted two or three turning their horses heads to drop back upon derriman in which move they were followed by most of the party  but festus foreseeing danger from the unexpected revelation had already judiciously placed a few intervening yards between himself and his fellow yeomen and now clapping spurs to his horse rattled like thunder and lightning up the road homeward  his ready flight added hotness to their pursuit and as he rode and looked fearfully over his shoulder he could see them following with enraged faces and drawn swords a position which they kept up for a distance of more than a mile  then he had the satisfaction of seeing them drop off one by one and soon he and his panting charger remained alone on the highway     xxvii  danger to anne   he stopped and reflected how to turn this rebuff to advantage  baulked in his project of entering the wateringplace and enjoying congratulations upon his patriotic bearing during the advance he sulkily considered that he might be able to make some use of his enforced retirement by riding to overcombe and glorifying himself in the eyes of miss garland before the truth should have reached that hamlet  having thus decided he spurred on in a better mood  by this time the volunteers were on the march and as derriman ascended the road he met the overcombe company in which trudged miller loveday shoulder to shoulder with the other substantial householders of the place and its neighbourhood duly equipped with pouches crossbelts firelocks flintboxes pickers worms magazines priminghorns heel ball and pomatum  there was nothing to be gained by further suppression of the truth and briefly informing them that the danger was not so immediate as had been supposed festus galloped on  at the end of another mile he met a large number of pikemen including bob loveday whom the yeoman resolved to sound upon the whereabouts of anne  the circumstances were such as to lead bob to speak more frankly than he might have done on reflection and he told festus the direction in which the women had been sent  then festus informed the group that the report of invasion was false upon which they all turned to go homeward with greatly relieved spirits  bob walked beside derrimans horse for some distance  loveday had instantly made up his mind to go and look for the women and ease their anxiety by letting them know the good news as soon as possible  but he said nothing of this to festus during their return together nor did festus tell bob that he also had resolved to seek them out and by anticipating every one else in that enterprise make of it a glorious opportunity for bringing miss garland to her senses about him  he still resented the ducking that he had received at her hands and was not disposed to let that insult pass without obtaining some sort of sweet revenge  as soon as they had parted festus cantered on over the hill meeting on his way the longpuddle volunteers sixty rank and file under captain cunningham the casterbridge company ninety strong known as the consideration company in those days under captain strickland and othersall with anxious faces and covered with dust  just passing the word to them and leaving them at halt he proceeded rapidly onward in the direction of kingsbere  nobody appeared on the road for some time till after a ride of several miles he met a stray corporal of volunteers who told festus in answer to his inquiry that he had certainly passed no gig full of women of the kind described  believing that he had missed them by following the highway derriman turned back into a lane along which they might have chosen to journey for privacys sake notwithstanding the badness and uncertainty of its track  arriving again within five miles of overcombe he at length heard tidings of the wandering vehicle and its precious burden which like the ark when sent away from the country of the philistines had apparently been left to the instincts of the beast that drew it  a labouring man just at daybreak had seen the helpless party going slowly up a distant drive which he pointed out  no sooner had festus parted from this informant than he beheld bob approaching mounted on the millers second and heavier horse  bob looked rather surprised and festus felt his coming glory in danger  they went down that lane he said signifying precisely the opposite direction to the true one  i too have been on the lookout for missing friends  as festus was riding back there was no reason to doubt his information and loveday rode on as misdirected  immediately that he was out of sight festus reversed his course and followed the track which anne and her companions were last seen to pursue  this road had been ascended by the gig in question nearly two hours before the present moment  molly the servant held the reins mrs loveday sat beside her and anne behind  their progress was but slow owing partly to mollys want of skill and partly to the steepness of the road which here passed over downs of some extent and was rarely or never mended  it was an anxious morning for them all and the beauties of the early summer day fell upon unheeding eyes  they were too anxious even for conjecture and each sat thinking her own thoughts occasionally glancing westward or stopping the horse to listen to sounds from more frequented roads along which other parties were retreating  once while they listened and gazed thus they saw a glittering in the distance and heard the tramp of many horses  it was a large body of cavalry going in the direction of the kings wateringplace the same regiment of dragoons in fact which festus had seen further on in its course  the women in the gig had no doubt that these men were marching at once to engage the enemy  by way of varying the monotony of the journey molly occasionally burst into tears of horror believing buonaparte to be in countenance and habits precisely what the caricatures represented him mrs loveday endeavoured to establish cheerfulness by assuring her companions of the natural civility of the french nation with whom unprotected women were safe from injury unless through the casual excesses of soldiery beyond control  this was poor consolation to anne whose mind was more occupied with bob than with herself and a miserable fear that she would never again see him alive so paled her face and saddened her gaze forward that at last her mother said who was you thinking of my dear  annes only reply was a look at her mother with which a tear mingled  molly whipped the horse by which she quickened his pace for five yards when he again fell into the perverse slowness that showed how fully conscious he was of being the mastermind and chief personage of the four  whenever there was a pool of water by the road he turned aside to drink a mouthful and remained there his own time in spite of mollys tug at the reins and futile flyflapping on his rump  they were now in the chalk district where there were no hedges and a rough attempt at mending the way had been made by throwing down huge lumps of that glaring material in heaps without troubling to spread it or break them abroad the jolting here was most distressing and seemed about to snap the springs  how that wheel do wamble said molly at last  she had scarcely spoken when the wheel came off and all three were precipitated over it into the road  fortunately the horse stood still and they began to gather themselves up  the only one of the three who had suffered in the least from the fall was anne and she was only conscious of a severe shaking which had half stupefied her for the time  the wheel lay flat in the road so that there was no possibility of driving further in their present plight  they looked around for help  the only friendly object near was a lonely cottage from its situation evidently the home of a shepherd  the horse was unharnessed and tied to the back of the gig and the three women went across to the house  on getting close they found that the shutters of all the lower windows were closed but on trying the door it opened to the hand  nobody was within the house appeared to have been abandoned in some confusion and the probability was that the shepherd had fled on hearing the alarm  anne now said that she felt the effects of her fall too severely to be able to go any further just then and it was agreed that she should be left there while mrs loveday and molly went on for assistance the elder lady deeming molly too young and vacant minded to be trusted to go alone  molly suggested taking the horse as the distance might be great each of them sitting alternately on his back while the other led him by the head  this they did anne watching them vanish down the white and lumpy road  she then looked round the room as well as she could do so by the light from the open door  it was plain from the shutters being closed that the shepherd had left his house before daylight the candle and extinguisher on the table pointing to the same conclusion  here she remained her eyes occasionally sweeping the bare sunny expanse of down that was only relieved from absolute emptiness by the overturned gig hard by  the sheep seemed to have gone away and scarcely a bird flew across to disturb the solitude  anne had risen early that morning and leaning back in the withy chair which she had placed by the door she soon fell into an uneasy doze from which she was awakened by the distant tramp of a horse  feeling much recovered from the effects of the overturn she eagerly rose and looked out  the horse was not miller lovedays but a powerful bay bearing a man in full yeomanry uniform  anne did not wait to recognize further instantly reentering the house she shut the door and bolted it  in the dark she sat and listened not a sound  at the end of ten minutes thinking that the rider if he were not festus had carelessly passed by or that if he were festus he had not seen her she crept softly upstairs and peeped out of the window excepting the spot of shade formed by the gig as before the down was quite bare  she then opened the casement and stretched out her neck  ha young madam  there you are  i knew ee  now you are caught came like a clap of thunder from a point three or four feet beneath her and turning down her frightened eyes she beheld festus derriman lurking close to the wall  his attention had first been attracted by her shutting the door of the cottage then by the overturned gig and after making sure by examining the vehicle that he was not mistaken in her identity he had dismounted led his horse round to the side and crept up to entrap her  anne started back into the room and remained still as a stone  festus went oncome you must trust to me  the french have landed  i have been trying to meet with you every hour since that confounded trick you played me  you threw me into the water  faith it was well for you i didnt catch ye then  i should have taken a revenge in a better way than i shall now  i mean to have that kiss of ye  come miss nancy do you heartis no use for you to lurk inside there  youll have to turn out as soon as boney comes over the hillare you going to open the door i say and speak to me in a civil way  what do you think i am then that you should barricade yourself against me as if i was a wild beast or frenchman  open the door or put out your head or do something or pon my soul ill break in the door  it occurred to anne at this point of the tirade that the best policy would be to temporize till somebody should return and she put out her head and face now grown somewhat pale  thats better said festus  now i can talk to you  come my dear will you open the door  why should you be afraid of me  i am not altogether afraid of you i am safe from the french here said anne not very truthfully and anxiously casting her eyes over the vacant down  then let me tell you that the alarm is false and that no landing has been attempted  now will you open the door and let me in  i am tired  i have been on horseback ever since daylight and have come to bring you the good tidings  anne looked as if she doubted the news  come said festus  no i cannot let you in she murmured after a pause  dash my wig then he cried his face flaming up ill find a way to get in  now dont you provoke me  you dont know what i am capable of i ask you again will you open the door  why do you wish it she said faintly  i have told you i want to sit down and i want to ask you a question  you can ask me from where you are  i cannot ask you properly  it is about a serious matter whether you will accept my heart and hand  i am not going to throw myself at your feet but i ask you to do your duty as a woman namely give your solemn word to take my name as soon as the war is over and i have time to attend to you  i scorn to ask it of a haughty hussy who will only speak to me through a window however i put it to you for the last time madam  there was no sign on the down of anybodys return and she said ill think of it sir  you have thought of it long enough i want to know  will you or wont you  very well i think i will  and then she felt that she might be buying personal safety too dearly by shuffling thus since he would spread the report that she had accepted him and cause endless complication  no she said i have changed my mind  i cannot accept you mr derriman  thats how you play with me he exclaimed stamping  yes one moment no the next  come you dont know what you refuse  that old hall is my uncles own and he has nobody else to leave it to  as soon as hes dead i shall throw up farming and start as a squire  and now he added with a bitter sneer what a fool you are to hang back from such a chance  thank you i dont value it said anne  because you hate him who would make it yours  it may not lie in your power to do that  whathas the old fellow been telling you his affairs  no  then why do you mistrust me  now after this will you open the door and show that you treat me as a friend if you wont accept me as a lover i only want to sit and talk to you  anne thought she would trust him it seemed almost impossible that he could harm her  she retired from the window and went downstairs  when her hand was upon the bolt of the door her mind misgave her  instead of withdrawing it she remained in silence where she was and he began again  are you going to unfasten it  anne did not speak  now dash my wig i will get at you  youve tried me beyond endurance one kiss would have been enough that day in the mead now ill have forty whether you will or no  he flung himself against the door but as it was bolted and had in addition a great wooden bar across it this produced no effect  he was silent for a moment and then the terrified girl heard him attempt the shuttered window  she ran upstairs and again scanned the down  the yellow gig still lay in the blazing sunshine and the horse of festus stood by the corner of the gardennothing else was to be seen  at this moment there came to her ear the noise of a sword drawn from its scabbard and peeping over the windowsill she saw her tormentor drive his sword between the joints of the shutters in an attempt to rip them open  the sword snapped off in his hand  with an imprecation he pulled out the piece and returned the two halves to the scabbard  ha ha he cried catching sight of the top of her head  tis only a joke you know but ill get in all the same  all for a kiss  but never mind well do it yet  he spoke in an affectedly light tone as if ashamed of his previous resentful temper but she could see by the livid back of his neck that he was brimful of suppressed passion  only a jest you know he went on  how are we going to do it now  why in this way  i go and get a ladder and enter at the upper window where my love is  and theres the ladder lying under that cornrick in the first enclosed field  back in two minutes dear  he ran off and was lost to her view     xxviii  anne does wonders   anne fearfully surveyed her position  the upper windows of the cottage were of flimsiest leadwork and to keep him out would be hopeless  she felt that not a moment was to be lost in getting away  running downstairs she opened the door and then it occurred to her terrified understanding that there would be no chance of escaping him by flight afoot across such an extensive down since he might mount his horse and easily ride after her  the animal still remained tethered at the corner of the garden if she could release him and frighten him away before festus returned there would not be quite such odds against her  she accordingly unhooked the horse by reaching over the bank and then pulling off her muslin neckerchief flapped it in his eyes to startle him  but the gallant steed did not move or flinch she tried again and he seemed rather pleased than otherwise  at this moment she heard a cry from the cottage and turning beheld her adversary approaching round the corner of the building  i thought i should tole out the mouse by that trick cried festus exultingly  instead of going for a ladder he had simply hidden himself at the back to tempt her down  poor anne was now desperate  the bank on which she stood was level with the horses back and the creature seemed quiet as a lamb  with a determination of which she was capable in emergencies she seized the rein flung herself upon the sheepskin and held on by the mane  the amazed charger lifted his head sniffed wrenched his ears hither and thither and started off at a frightful speed across the down  o my heart and limbs said festus under his breath as thoroughly alarmed he gazed after her  she on champion  shell break her neck and i shall be tried for manslaughter and disgrace will be brought upon the name of derriman  champion continued to go at a stretchgallop but he did nothing worse had he plunged or reared derrimans fears might have been verified and anne have come with deadly force to the ground  but the course was good and in the horses speed lay a comparative security  she was scarcely shaken in her precarious halfhorizontal position though she was awed to see the grass loose stones and other objects pass her eyes like strokes whenever she opened them which was only just for a second at intervals of half a minute and to feel how wildly the stirrups swung and that what struck her knee was the bucket of the carbine and that it was a pistolholster which hurt her arm  they quickly cleared the down and anne became conscious that the course of the horse was homeward  as soon as the ground began to rise towards the outer belt of upland which lay between her and the coast champion now panting and reeking with moisture lessened his speed in sheer weariness and proceeded at a rapid jolting trot  anne felt that she could not hold on half so well the gallop had been childs play compared with this  they were in a lane ascending to a ridge and she made up her mind for a fall  over the ridge rose an animated spot higher and higher it turned out to be the upper part of a man and the man to be a soldier  such was annes attitude that she only got an occasional glimpse of him and though she feared that he might be a frenchman she feared the horse more than the enemy as she had feared festus more than the horse  anne had energy enough left to cry stop him stop him as the soldier drew near  he astonished at the sight of a military horse with a bundle of drapery across his back had already placed himself in the middle of the lane and he now held out his arms till his figure assumed the form of a latin cross planted in the roadway  champion drew near swerved and stood still almost suddenly a check sufficient to send anne slipping down his flank to the ground  the timely friend stepped forward and helped her to her feet when she saw that he was john loveday  are you hurt he said hastily having turned quite pale at seeing her fall  o no not a bit said anne gathering herself up with forced briskness to make light of the misadventure  but how did you get in such a place  there hes gone she exclaimed instead of replying as champion swept round john loveday and cantered off triumphantly in the direction of oxwell a performance which she followed with her eyes  but how did you come upon his back and whose horse is it  i will tell you  well  icannot tell you  john looked steadily at her saying nothing  how did you come here she asked  is it true that the french have not landed at all  quite true the alarm was groundless  ill tell you all about it  you look very tired  you had better sit down a few minutes  let us sit on this bank  he helped her to the slope indicated and continued still as if his thoughts were more occupied with the mystery of her recent situation than with what he was saying we arrived at budmouth barracks this morning and are to lie there all the summer  i could not write to tell father we were coming  it was not because of any rumour of the french for we knew nothing of that till we met the people on the road and the colonel said in a moment the news was false  buonaparte is not even at boulogne just now  i was anxious to know how you had borne the fright so i hastened to overcombe at once as soon as i could get out of barracks  anne who had not been at all responsive to his discourse now swayed heavily against him and looking quickly down he found that she had silently fainted  to support her in his arms was of course the impulse of a moment  there was no water to be had and he could think of nothing else but to hold her tenderly till she came round again  certainly he desired nothing more  again he asked himself what did it all mean  he waited looking down upon her tired eyelids and at the row of lashes lying upon each cheek whose natural roundness showed itself in singular perfection now that the customary pink had given place to a pale luminousness caught from the surrounding atmosphere  the dumpy ringlets about her forehead and behind her poll which were usually as tight as springs had been partially uncoiled by the wildness of her ride and hung in split locks over her forehead and neck  john who during the long months of his absence had lived only to meet her again was in a state of ecstatic reverence and bending down he gently kissed her  anne was just becoming conscious  o mr derriman never never she murmured sweeping her face with her hand  i thought he was at the bottom of it said john  anne opened her eyes and started back from him  what is it she said wildly  you are ill my dear miss garland replied john in trembling anxiety and taking her hand  i am not ill i am wearied out she said  cant we walk on  how far are we from overcombe  about a mile  but tell me somebody has been hurting youfrightening you  i know who it was it was derriman and that was his horse  now do you tell me all  anne reflected  then if i tell you she said will you discuss with me what i had better do and not for the present let my mother and your father know  i dont want to alarm them and i must not let my affairs interrupt the business connexion between the mill and the hall that has gone on for so many years  the trumpetmajor promised and anne told the adventure  his brow reddened as she went on and when she had done she said now you are angry  dont do anything dreadful will you  remember that this festus will most likely succeed his uncle at oxwell in spite of present appearances and if bob succeeds at the mill there should be no enmity between them  thats true  i wont tell bob  leave him to me  where is derriman now  on his way home i suppose  when i have seen you into the house i will deal with himquite quietly so that he shall say nothing about it  yes appeal to him do  perhaps he will be better then  they walked on together loveday seeming to experience much quiet bliss  i came to look for you he said because of that dear sweet letter you wrote  yes i did write you a letter she admitted with misgiving now beginning to see her mistake  it was because i was sorry i had blamed you  i am almost glad you did blame me said john cheerfully since if you had not the letter would not have come  i have read it fifty times a day  this put anne into an unhappy mood and they proceeded without much further talk till the mill chimneys were visible below them  john then said that he would leave her to go in by herself  ah you are going back to get into some danger on my account  i cant get into much danger with such a fellow as he can i said john smiling  well no she answered with a sudden carelessness of tone  it was indispensable that he should be undeceived and to begin the process by taking an affectedly light view of his personal risks was perhaps as good a way to do it as any  where friendliness was construed as love an assumed indifference was the necessary expression for friendliness  so she let him go and bidding him hasten back as soon as he could went down the hill while johns feet retraced the upland  the trumpetmajor spent the whole afternoon and evening in that long and difficult search for festus derriman  crossing the down at the end of the second hour he met molly and mrs loveday  the gig had been repaired they had learnt the groundlessness of the alarm and they would have been proceeding happily enough but for their anxiety about anne john told them shortly that she had got a lift home and proceeded on his way  the worthy object of his search had in the meantime been plodding homeward on foot sulky at the loss of his charger encumbered with his sword belts high boots and uniform and in his own discomfiture careless whether anne garlands life had been endangered or not  at length derriman reached a place where the road ran between high banks one of which he mounted and paced along as a change from the hard trackway  ahead of him he saw an old man sitting down with eyes fixed on the dust of the road as if resting and meditating at one and the same time  being pretty sure that he recognized his uncle in that venerable figure festus came forward stealthily till he was immediately above the old mans back  the latter was clothed in faded nankeen breeches speckled stockings a drab hat and a coat which had once been light blue but from exposure as a scarecrow had assumed the complexion and fibre of a dried puddingcloth  the farmer was in fact returning to the hall which he had left in the morning some time later than his nephew to seek an asylum in a hollow tree about two miles off  the tree was so situated as to command a view of the building and uncle benjy had managed to clamber up inside this natural fortification high enough to watch his residence through a hole in the bark till gathering from the words of occasional passersby that the alarm was at least premature he had ventured into daylight again  he was now engaged in abstractedly tracing a diagram in the dust with his walkingstick and muttered words to himself aloud  presently he arose and went on his way without turning round  festus was curious enough to descend and look at the marks  they represented an oblong with two semi diagonals and a little square in the middle  upon the diagonals were the figures 20 and 17 and on each side of the parallelogram stood a letter signifying the point of the compass  what crazy thing is running in his head now said festus to himself with supercilious pity recollecting that the farmer had been singing those very numbers earlier in the morning  being able to make nothing of it he lengthened his strides and treading on tiptoe overtook his relative saluting him by scratching his back like a hen  the startled old farmer danced round like a top and gasping said as he perceived his nephew what festy not thrown from your horse and killed then after all  no nunc  what made ye think that  champion passed me about an hour ago when i was in hidingpoor timid soul of me for i had nothing to lose by the french comingand he looked awful with the stirrups dangling and the saddle empty  tis a gloomy sight festy to see a horse cantering without a rider and i thought you had beenfeared you had been thrown off and killed as dead as a nit  bless your dear old heart for being so anxious  and what pretty picture were you drawing just now with your walkingstick  o that  that is only a way i have of amusing myself  it showed how the french might have advanced to the attack you know  such trifles fill the head of a weak old man like me  or the place where something is hid awaymoney for instance  festy said the farmer reproachfully you always know i use the old glove in the bedroom cupboard for any guinea or two i possess  of course i do said festus ironically  they had now reached a lonely inn about a mile and a half from the hall and the farmer not responding to his nephews kind invitation to come in and treat him festus entered alone  he was dusty draggled and weary and he remained at the tavern long  the trumpetmajor in the meantime having searched the roads in vain heard in the course of the evening of the yeomans arrival at this place and that he would probably be found there still  he accordingly approached the door reaching it just as the dusk of evening changed to darkness  there was no light in the passage but john pushed on at hazard inquired for derriman and was told that he would be found in the back parlour alone  when loveday first entered the apartment he was unable to see anything but following the guidance of a vigorous snoring he came to the settle upon which festus lay asleep his position being faintly signified by the shine of his buttons and other parts of his uniform john laid his hand upon the reclining figure and shook him and by degrees derriman stopped his snore and sat up  who are you he said in the accents of a man who has been drinking hard  is it you dear anne  let me kiss you yes i will  shut your mouth you pitiful blockhead ill teach you genteeler manners than to persecute a young woman in that way and taking festus by the ear he gave it a good pull  festus broke out with an oath and struck a vague blow in the air with his fist whereupon the trumpetmajor dealt him a box on the right ear and a similar one on the left to artistically balance the first  festus jumped up and used his fists wildly but without any definite result  want to fight do ye eh said john  nonsense you cant fight you great baby and never could  you are only fit to be smacked and he dealt festus a specimen of the same on the cheek with the palm of his hand  no sir no  o you are loveday the young man shes going to be married to i suppose  dash me i didnt want to hurt her sir  yes my name is loveday and youll know where to find me since we cant finish this tonight  pistols or swords whichever you like my boy  take that and that so that you may not forget to call upon me and again he smacked the yeomans ears and cheeks  do you know what it is for eh  no mr loveday siryes i mean i do  what is it for then  i shall keep smacking until you tell me  gad if you werent drunk id half kill you here tonight  it is because i served her badly  damned if i care  ill do it again and be hanged to ee  wheres my horse champion  tell me that and he hit at the trumpetmajor  john parried this attack and taking him firmly by the collar pushed him down into the seat saying here i hold ee till you beg pardon for your doings today  do you want any more of it do you  and he shook the yeoman to a sort of jelly  i do beg pardonno i dont  i say this that you shall not take such liberties with old squire derrimans nephew you dirty millers son you flourworm you smut in the corn  ill call you out tomorrow morning and have my revenge  of course you will thats what i came for  and pushing him back into the corner of the settle loveday went out of the house feeling considerable satisfaction at having got himself into the beginning of as nice a quarrel about anne garland as the most jealous lover could desire  but of one feature in this curious adventure he had not the least notionthat festus derriman misled by the darkness the fumes of his potations and the constant sight of anne and bob together never once supposed his assailant to be any other man than bob believing the trumpetmajor miles away  there was a moon during the early part of johns walk home but when he had arrived within a mile of overcombe the sky clouded over and rain suddenly began to fall with some violence  near him was a wooden granary on tall stone staddles and perceiving that the rain was only a thunderstorm which would soon pass away he ascended the steps and entered the doorway where he stood watching the halfobscured moon through the streaming rain  presently to his surprise he beheld a female figure running forward with great rapidity not towards the granary for shelter but towards open ground  what could she be running for in that direction  the answer came in the appearance of his brother bob from that quarter seated on the back of his fathers heavy horse  as soon as the woman met him bob dismounted and caught her in his arms they stood locked together the rain beating into their unconscious forms and the horse looking on  the trumpetmajor fell back inside the granary and threw himself on a heap of empty sacks which lay in the corner he had recognized the woman to be anne  here he reclined in a stupor till he was aroused by the sound of voices under him the voices of anne and his brother who having at last discovered that they were getting wet had taken shelter under the granary floor  i have been home said she  mother and molly have both got back long ago  we were all anxious about you and i came out to look for you  o bob i am so glad to see you again  john might have heard every word of the conversation which was continued in the same strain for a long time but he stopped his ears and would not  still they remained and still was he determined that they should not see him  with the conserved hope of more than half a year dashed away in a moment he could yet feel that the cruelty of a protest would be even greater than its inutility  it was absolutely by his own contrivance that the situation had been shaped  bob left to himself would long ere this have been the husband of another woman  the rain decreased and the lovers went on  john looked after them as they strolled aquatinted by the weak moon and mist  bob had thrust one of his arms through the rein of the horse and the other was round annes waist  when they were lost behind the declivity the trumpetmajor came out and walked homeward even more slowly than they  as he went on his face put off its complexion of despair for one of serene resolve  for the first time in his dealings with friends he entered upon a course of counterfeiting set his features to conceal his thought and instructed his tongue to do likewise  he threw fictitiousness into his very gait even now when there was nobody to see him and struck at stems of wild parsley with his regimental switch as he had used to do when soldiering was new to him and life in general a charming experience  thus cloaking his sickly thought he descended to the mill as the others had done before him occasionally looking down upon the wet road to notice how close annes little tracks were to bobs all the way along and how precisely a curve in his course was followed by a curve in hers but after this he erected his head and walked so smartly up to the front door that his spurs rang through the court  they had all reached home but before any of them could speak he cried gaily ah bob i have been thinking of you  by god how are you my boy  no french cutthroats after all you see  here we are well and happy together again  a good providence has watched over us said mrs loveday cheerfully yes in all times and places we are in gods hand  so we be so we be said the miller who still shone in all the fierceness of uniform  well now well hae a drop o drink  theres none said david coming forward with a drawn face  what said the miller  afore i went to church for a pike to defend my native country from boney i pulled out the spigots of all the barrels maister for thinks idamn himsince we cant drink it ourselves he shant have it nor none of his men  but you shouldnt have done it till you was sure hed come said the miller aghast  chok it all i was sure said david  id sooner see churches fall than good drink wasted but how was i to know better  well well what with one thing and another this day will cost me a pretty penny said loveday bustling off to the cellar which he found to be several inches deep in stagnant liquor  john how can i welcome ee he continued hopelessly on his return to the room  only go and see what hes done  ive ladled up a drap wi a spoon trumpetmajor said david  tisnt bad drinking though it do taste a little of the floor thats true  john said that he did not require anything at all and then they all sat down to supper and were very temperately gay with a drop of mild elder wine which mrs loveday found in the bottom of a jar  the trumpetmajor adhering to the part he meant to play gave humorous accounts of his adventures since he had last sat there  he told them that the season was to be a very lively onethat the royal family was coming as usual and many other interesting things so that when he left them to return to barracks few would have supposed the british army to contain a lighter hearted man  anne was the only one who doubted the reality of this behaviour  when she had gone up to her bedroom she stood for some time looking at the wick of the candle as if it were a painful object the expression of her face being shaped by the conviction that johns afternoon words when he helped her out of the way of champion were not in accordance with his words tonight and that the dimlyrealized kiss during her faintness was no imaginary one  but in the blissful circumstances of having bob at hand again she took optimist views and persuaded herself that john would soon begin to see her in the light of a sister     xxix  a dissembler   to cursory view john loveday seemed to accomplish this with amazing ease  whenever he came from barracks to overcombe which was once or twice a week he related news of all sorts to her and bob with infinite zest and made the time as happy a one as had ever been known at the mill save for himself alone  he said nothing of festus except so far as to inform anne that he had expected to see him and been disappointed on the evening after the kings arrival at his seaside residence john appeared again staying to supper and describing the royal entry the many tasteful illuminations and transparencies which had been exhibited the quantities of tallow candles burnt for that purpose and the swarms of aristocracy who had followed the king thither  when supper was over bob went outside the house to shut the shutters which had as was often the case been left open some time after lights were kindled within  john still sat at the table when his brother approached the window though the others had risen and retired  bob was struck by seeing through the pane how johns face had changed  throughout the suppertime he had been talking to anne in the gay tone habitual with him now which gave greater strangeness to the gloom of his present appearance  he remained in thought for a moment took a letter from his breastpocket opened it and with a tender smile at his weakness kissed the writing before restoring it to its place  the letter was one that anne had written to him at exonbury  bob stood perplexed and then a suspicion crossed his mind that john from brotherly goodness might be feigning a satisfaction with recent events which he did not feel  bob now made a noise with the shutters at which the trumpetmajor rose and went out bob at once following him  jack said the sailor ingenuously im terribly sorry that ive done wrong  how asked his brother  in courting our little anne  well you see john she was in the same house with me and somehow or other i made myself her beau  but i have been thinking that perhaps you had the first claim on her and if so jack ill make way for ee  ii dont care for her much you knownot so very much and can give her up very well  it is nothing serious between us at all  yes john you try to get her i can look elsewhere bob never knew how much he loved anne till he found himself making this speech of renunciation  o bob you are mistaken said the trumpetmajor who was not deceived when i first saw her i admired her and i admire her now and like her i like her so well that i shall be glad to see you marry her  but replied bob with hesitation i thought i saw you looking very sad as if you were in love i saw you take out a letter in short thats what it was disturbed me and made me come to you  o i see your mistake said john laughing forcedly  at this minute mrs loveday and the miller who were taking a twilight walk in the garden strolled round near to where the brothers stood  she talked volubly on events in budmouth as most people did at this time and they tell me that the theatre has been painted up afresh she was saying and that the actors have come for the season with the most lovely actresses that ever were seen  when they had passed by john continued i am in love bob butnot with anne  ah who is it then said the mate hopefully  one of the actresses at the theatre john replied with a concoctive look at the vanishing forms of mr and mrs loveday  she is a very lovely woman you know  but we wont say anything more about itit dashes a man so  o one of the actresses said bob with open mouth  but dont you say anything about it continued the trumpetmajor heartily  i dont want it known  no noi wont of course  may i not know her name  no not now bob  i cannot tell ee john answered and with truth for loveday did not know the name of any actress in the world  when his brother had gone captain bob hastened off in a state of great animation to anne whom he found on the top of a neighbouring hillock which the daylight had scarcely as yet deserted  you have been a long time coming sir said she in sprightly tones of reproach  yes dearest and youll be glad to hear why  ive found out the whole mysteryyeswhy hes queer and everything  anne looked startled  hes up to the gunnel in love  we must try to help him on in it or i fear hell go melancholymad like  we help him she asked faintly  hes lost his heart to one of the playactresses at budmouth and i think she slights him  o i am so glad she exclaimed  glad that his venture dont prosper  o no glad hes so sensible  how long is it since that alarm of the french  six weeks honey  why do you ask  men can forget in six weeks cant they bob  the impression that john had really kissed her still remained  well some men might observed bob judicially  i couldnt  perhaps john might  i couldnt forget you in twenty times as long  do you know anne i half thought it was you john cared about and it was a weight off my heart when he said he didnt  did he say he didnt  yes  he assured me himself that the only person in the hold of his heart was this lovely playactress and nobody else  how i should like to see her  yes  so should i  i would rather it had been one of our own neighbours girls whose birth and breeding we know of but still if that is his taste i hope it will end well for him  how very quick he has been  i certainly wish we could see her  i dont know so much as her name  he is very close and wouldnt tell a thing about her  couldnt we get him to go to the theatre with us and then we could watch him and easily find out the right one  then we would learn if she is a good young woman and if she is could we not ask her here and so make it smoother for him  he has been very gay lately that means budding love and sometimes between his gaieties he has had melancholy moments that means theres difficulty  bob thought her plan a good one and resolved to put it in practice on the first available evening  anne was very curious as to whether john did really cherish a new passion the story having quite surprised her possibly it was true six weeks had passed since john had shown a single symptom of the old attachment and what could not that space of time effect in the heart of a soldier whose very profession it was to leave girls behind him  after this john loveday did not come to see them for nearly a month a neglect which was set down by bob as an additional proof that his brothers affections were no longer exclusively centred in his old home when at last he did arrive and the theatregoing was mentioned to him the flush of consciousness which anne expected to see upon his face was unaccountably absent  yes bob i should very well like to go to the theatre he replied heartily  who is going besides  only anne bob told him and then it seemed to occur to the trumpet major that something had been expected of him  he rose and said privately to bob with some confusion o yes of course well go  as i am connected with one of thein short i can get you in for nothing you know  at least let me manage everything  yes yes  i wonder you didnt propose to take us before jack and let us have a good look at her  i ought to have  you shall go on a kings night  you wont want me to point her out bob i have my reasons at present for asking it  well be content with guessing said his brother  when the gallant john was gone anne observed bob how he is changed  i watched him  he showed no feeling even when you burst upon him suddenly with the subject nearest his heart  it must be because his suit dont fay said captain bob     xxx  at the theatre royal   in two or three days a message arrived asking them to attend at the theatre on the coming evening with the added request that they would dress in their gayest clothes to do justice to the places taken accordingly in the course of the afternoon they drove off bob having clothed himself in a splendid suit recently purchased as an attempt to bring himself nearer to annes style when they appeared in public together  as finished off by this dashing and really fashionable attire he was the perfection of a beau in the dogdays pantaloons and boots of the newest make yards and yards of muslin wound round his neck forming a sort of asylum for the lower part of his face two fancy waistcoats and coatbuttons like circular shaving glasses  the absurd extreme of female fashion which was to wear muslin dresses in january was at this time equalled by that of the men who wore clothes enough in august to melt them  nobody would have guessed from bobs presentation now that he had ever been aloft on a dark night in the atlantic or knew the hundred ingenuities that could be performed with a ropes end and a marlinespike as well as his mother tongue  it was a day of days  anne wore her celebrated celestial blue pelisse her leghorn hat and her muslin dress with the waist under the arms the latter being decorated with excellent honiton lace bought of the woman who travelled from that place to overcombe and its neighbourhood with a basketful of her own manufacture and a cushion on which she worked by the wayside  john met the lovers at the inn outside the town and after stabling the horse they entered the town together the trumpetmajor informing them that the wateringplace had never been so full before that the court the prince of wales and everybody of consequence was there and that an attic could scarcely be got for money  the king had gone for a cruise in his yacht and they would be in time to see him land  then drums and fifes were heard and in a minute or two they saw sergeant stanner advancing along the street with a firm countenance fiery poll and rigid staring eyes in front of his recruitingparty  the sergeants sword was drawn and at intervals of two or three inches along its shining blade were impaled fluttering onepound notes to express the lavish bounty that was offered  he gave a stern suppressed nod of friendship to our people and passed by  next they came up to a waggon bowered over with leaves and flowers so that the men inside could hardly be seen  come to see the king hiphip hurrah cried a voice within and turning they saw through the leaves the nose and face of cripplestraw  the waggon contained all derrimans workpeople  is your master here said john  no trumpetmajor sir  but young maister is coming to fetch us at nine oclock in case we should be too blind to drive home  o where is he now  never mind said anne impatiently at which the trumpetmajor obediently moved on  by the time they reached the pier it was six oclock the royal yacht was returning a fact announced by the ships in the harbour firing a salute the king came ashore with his hat in his hand and returned the salutations of the welldressed crowd in his old indiscriminate fashion while this cheering and waving of handkerchiefs was going on anne stood between the two brothers who protectingly joined their hands behind her back as if she were a delicate piece of statuary that a push might damage  soon the king had passed and receiving the military salutes of the piquet joined the queen and princesses at gloucester lodge the homely house of red brick in which he unostentatiously resided  as there was yet some little time before the theatre would open they strayed upon the velvet sands and listened to the songs of the sailors one of whom extemporized for the occasion     portland road the king aboard the king aboard    portland road the king aboard    we weighed and sailed from portland road 272  when they had looked on awhile at the combats at singlestick which were in progress hard by and seen the sum of five guineas handed over to the modest gentleman who had broken most heads they returned to gloucester lodge whence the king and other members of his family now reappeared and drove at a slow trot round to the theatre in carriages drawn by the hanoverian white horses that were so well known in the town at this date  when anne and bob entered the theatre they found that john had taken excellent places and concluded that he had got them for nothing through the influence of the lady of his choice  as a matter of fact he had paid full prices for those two seats like any other outsider and even then had a difficulty in getting them it being a kings night  when they were settled he himself retired to an obscure part of the pit from which the stage was scarcely visible  we can see beautifully said bob in an aristocratic voice as he took a delicate pinch of snuff and drew out the magnificent pockethandkerchief brought home from the east for such occasions  but i am afraid poor john cant see at all  but we can see him replied anne and notice by his face which of them it is he is so charmed with  the light of that corner candle falls right upon his cheek  by this time the king had appeared in his place which was overhung by a canopy of crimson satin fringed with gold  about twenty places were occupied by the royal family and suite and beyond them was a crowd of powdered and glittering personages of fashion completely filling the centre of the little building though the king so frequently patronized the local stage during these years that the crush was not inconvenient  the curtain rose and the play began  tonight it was one of colmans who at this time enjoyed great popularity and mr bannister supported the leading character  anne with her hand privately clasped in bobs and looking as if she did not know it partly watched the piece and partly the face of the impressionable john who had so soon transferred his affections elsewhere  she had not long to wait  when a certain one of the subordinate ladies of the comedy entered on the stage the trumpet major in his corner not only looked conscious but started and gazed with parted lips  this must be the one whispered anne quickly  see he is agitated  she turned to bob but at the same moment his hand convulsively closed upon hers as he too strangely fixed his eyes upon the newlyentered lady  what is it  anne looked from one to the other without regarding the stage at all  her answer came in the voice of the actress who now spoke for the first time the accents were those of miss matilda johnson  one thought rushed into both their minds on the instant and bob was the first to utter it  whatis she the woman of his choice after all  if so it is a dreadful thing murmured anne  but as may be imagined the unfortunate john was as much surprised by this rencounter as the other two  until this moment he had been in utter ignorance of the theatrical company and all that pertained to it moreover much as he knew of miss johnson he was not aware that she had ever been trained in her youth as an actress and that after lapsing into straits and difficulties for a couple of years she had been so fortunate as to again procure an engagement here  the trumpetmajor though not prominently seated had been seen by matilda already who had observed still more plainly her old betrothed and anne in the other part of the house  john was not concerned on his own account at being face to face with her but at the extraordinary suspicion that this conjuncture must revive in the minds of his best beloved friends  after some moments of pained reflection he tapped his knee  gad i wont explain it shall go as it is he said  let them think her mine  better that than the truth after all  had personal prominence in the scene been at this moment proportioned to intentness of feeling the whole audience regal and otherwise would have faded into an indistinct mist of background leaving as the sole emergent and telling figures bob and anne at one point the trumpetmajor on the left hand and matilda at the opposite corner of the stage  but fortunately the deadlock of awkward suspense into which all four had fallen was terminated by an accident  a messenger entered the kings box with despatches  there was an instant pause in the performance  the despatchbox being opened the king read for a few moments with great interest the eyes of the whole house including those of anne garland being anxiously fixed upon his face for terrible events fell as unexpectedly as thunderbolts at this critical time of our history  the king at length beckoned to lord  who was immediately behind him the play was again stopped and the contents of the despatch were publicly communicated to the audience  sir robert calder cruising off finisterre had come in sight of villeneuve and made the signal for action which though checked by the weather had resulted in the capture of two spanish lineofbattle ships and the retreat of villeneuve into ferrol  the news was received with truly national feeling if noise might be taken as an index of patriotism  rule britannia was called for and sung by the whole house  but the importance of the event was far from being recognized at this time and bob loveday as he sat there and heard it had very little conception how it would bear upon his destiny  this parenthetic excitement diverted for a few minutes the eyes of bob and anne from the trumpetmajor and when the play proceeded and they looked back to his corner he was gone  hes just slipped round to talk to her behind the scenes said bob knowingly  shall we go too and tease him for a sly dog  no i would rather not  shall we go home then  not unless her presence is too much for you  onot at all  well stay here  ah there she is again  they sat on and listened to matildas speeches which she delivered with such delightful coolness that they soon began to considerably interest one of the party  well what a nerve the young woman has he said at last in tones of admiration and gazing at miss johnson with all his might  after all jacks taste is not so bad  shes really deuced clever  bob ill go home if you wish to said anne quickly  o nolet us see how she fleets herself off that bit of a scrape shes playing at now  well what a hand she is at it to be sure  anne said no more but waited on supremely uncomfortable and almost tearful  she began to feel that she did not like life particularly well it was too complicated she saw nothing of the scene and only longed to get away and to get bob away with her  at last the curtain fell on the final act and then began the farce of no song no supper  matilda did not appear in this piece and anne again inquired if they should go home this time bob agreed and taking her under his care with redoubled affection to make up for the species of coma which had seized upon his heart for a time he quietly accompanied her out of the house  when they emerged upon the esplanade the august moon was shining across the sea from the direction of st aldhelms head  bob unconsciously loitered and turned towards the pier  reaching the end of the promenade they surveyed the quivering waters in silence for some time until a long dark line shot from behind the promontory of the nothe and swept forward into the harbour  what boat is that said anne  it seems to be some frigate lying in the roads said bob carelessly as he brought anne round with a gentle pressure of his arm and bent his steps towards the homeward end of the town  meanwhile miss johnson having finished her duties for that evening rapidly changed her dress and went out likewise  the prominent position which anne and captain bob had occupied side by side in the theatre left her no alternative but to suppose that the situation was arranged by bob as a species of defiance to herself and her heart such as it was became proportionately embittered against him  in spite of the rise in her fortunes miss johnson still rememberedand always would rememberher humiliating departure from overcombe and it had been to her even a more grievous thing that bob had acquiesced in his brothers ruling than that john had determined it  at the time of setting out she was sustained by a firm faith that bob would follow her and nullify his brothers scheme but though she waited bob never came  she passed along by the houses facing the sea and scanned the shore the footway and the open road close to her which illuminated by the slanting moon to a great brightness sparkled with minute facets of crystallized salts from the water sprinkled there during the day  the promenaders at the further edge appeared in dark profiles and beyond them was the grey sea parted into two masses by the tapering braid of moonlight across the waves  two forms crossed this line at a startling nearness to her she marked them at once as anne and bob loveday  they were walking slowly and in the earnestness of their discourse were oblivious of the presence of any human beings save themselves  matilda stood motionless till they had passed  how i love them she said treading the initial step of her walk onwards with a vehemence that walking did not demand  so do iespecially one said a voice at her elbow and a man wheeled round her and looked in her face which had been fully exposed to the moon  youwho are you she asked  dont you remember maam  we walked some way together towards overcombe earlier in the summer  matilda looked more closely and perceived that the speaker was derriman in plain clothes  he continued you are one of the ladies of the theatre i know  may i ask why you said in such a queer way that you loved that couple  in a queer way  well as if you hated them  i dont mind your knowing that i have good reason to hate them  you do too it seems  that man said festus savagely came to me one night about that very woman insulted me before i could put myself on my guard and ran away before i could come up with him and avenge myself  the woman tricks me at every turn  i want to part em  then why dont you  theres a splendid opportunity  do you see that soldier walking along  hes a marine he looks into the gallery of the theatre every night and hes in connexion with the pressgang that came ashore just now from the frigate lying in portland roads  they are often here for men  yes  our boatmen dread em  well we have only to tell him that loveday is a seaman to be clear of him this very night  done said festus  take my arm and come this way  they walked across to the footway  fine night sergeant  it is sir  looking for hands i suppose  it is not to be known sir  we dont begin till half past ten  it is a pity you dont begin now  i could show ee excellent game  what that little nest of fellows at the old rooms in cove row  i have just heard of em  nocome here  festus with miss johnson on his arm led the sergeant quickly along the parade and by the time they reached the narrows the lovers who walked but slowly were visible in front of them  theres your man he said  that buck in pantaloons and halfbootsa looking like a squire  twelve months ago he was mate of the brig pewit but his father has made money and keeps him at home  faith now you tell of it theres a hint of sea legs about him  whats the young beaus name  dont tell whispered matilda impulsively clutching festuss arm  but festus had already said robert loveday son of the miller at overcombe  you may find several likely fellows in that neighbourhood  the marine said that he would bear it in mind and they left him  i wish you had not told said matilda tearfully  shes the worst  dash my eyes now listen to that  why you chickenhearted old stager you was as well agreed as i  come now hasnt he used you badly  matildas acrimony returned  i was down on my luck or he wouldnt have had the chance she said  well then let things be     xxxi  midnight visitors   miss garland and loveday walked leisurely to the inn and called for horse andgig  while the hostler was bringing it round the landlord who knew bob and his family well spoke to him quietly in the passage  is this then because you want to throw dust in the eyes of the black diamond chaps with an admiring glance at bobs costume  the black diamond said bob and anne turned pale  she hove in sight just after dark and at nine oclock a boat having more than a dozen marines on board with cloaks on rowed into harbour  bob reflected  then therell be a press tonight depend upon it he said  they wont know you will they bob said anne anxiously  they certainly wont know him for a seaman now remarked the landlord laughing and again surveying bob up and down  but if i was you two i should drive homealong straight and quiet and be very busy in the mill all tomorrow mr loveday  they drove away and when they had got onward out of the town anne strained her eyes wistfully towards portland  its dark contour lying like a whale on the sea was just perceptible in the gloom as the background to halfadozen ships lights nearer at hand  they cant make you go now you are a gentleman tradesman can they she asked  if they want me they can have me dearest  i have often said i ought to volunteer  and not care about me at all  it is just that that keeps me at home  i wont leave you if i can help it  it cannot make such a vast difference to the country whether one man goes or stays  but if you want to go you had better and not mind us at all  bob put a period to her speech by a mark of affection to which history affords many parallels in every age  she said no more about the black diamond but whenever they ascended a hill she turned her head to look at the lights in portland roads and the grey expanse of intervening sea  though captain bob had stated that he did not wish to volunteer and would not leave her if he could help it the remark required some qualification  that anne was charming and loving enough to chain him anywhere was true but he had begun to find the millwork terribly irksome at times  often during the last month when standing among the rumbling cogs in his new millers suit which ill became him he had yawned thought wistfully of the old peajacket and the waters of the deep blue sea  his dread of displeasing his father by showing anything of this change of sentiment was great yet he might have braved it but for knowing that his marriage with anne which he hoped might take place the next year was dependent entirely upon his adherence to the mill business  even were his father indifferent mrs loveday would never intrust her only daughter to the hands of a husband who would be away from home fivesixths of his time  but though apart from anne he was not averse to seafaring in itself to be smuggled thither by the machinery of a pressgang was intolerable and the process of seizing stunning pinioning and carrying off unwilling hands was one which bob as a man had always determined to hold out against to the utmost of his power  hence as they went towards home he frequently listened for sounds behind him but hearing none he assured his sweetheart that they were safe for that night at least  the mill was still going when they arrived though old mr loveday was not to be seen he had retired as soon as he heard the horses hoofs in the lane leaving bob to watch the grinding till three oclock when the elder would rise and bob withdraw to beda frequent arrangement between them since bob had taken the place of grinder  having reached the privacy of her own room anne threw open the window for she had not the slightest intention of going to bed just yet  the tale of the black diamond had disturbed her by a slow insidious process that was worse than sudden fright  her window looked into the court before the house now wrapped in the shadow of the trees and the hill and she leaned upon its sill listening intently  she could have heard any strange sound distinctly enough in one direction but in the other all low noises were absorbed in the patter of the mill and the rush of water down the race  however what she heard came from the hitherto silent side and was intelligible in a moment as being the footsteps of men  she tried to think they were some late stragglers from budmouth  alas no the tramp was too regular for that of villagers  she hastily turned extinguished the candle and listened again  as they were on the main road there was after all every probability that the party would pass the bridge which gave access to the mill court without turning in upon it or even noticing that such an entrance existed  in this again she was disappointed they crossed into the front without a pause  the pulsations of her heart became a turmoil now for why should these men if they were the pressgang and strangers to the locality have supposed that a sailor was to be found here the younger of the two millers loveday being never seen now in any garb which could suggest that he was other than a miller pure like his father  one of the men spoke  i am not sure that we are in the right place he said  this is a mill anyhow said another  theres lots about here  then come this way a moment with your light  two of the group went towards the carthouse on the opposite side of the yard and when they reached it a dark lantern was opened the rays being directed upon the front of the millers waggon  loveday and son overcombe mill continued the man reading from the waggon  son you see is lately painted in  thats our man  he moved to turn off the light but before he had done so it flashed over the forms of the speakers and revealed a sergeant a naval officer and a file of marines  anne waited to see no more  when bob stayed up to grind as he was doing tonight he often sat in his room instead of remaining all the time in the mill and this room was an isolated chamber over the bakehouse which could not be reached without going downstairs and ascending the stepladder that served for his staircase  anne descended in the dark clambered up the ladder and saw that light strayed through the chink below the door  his window faced towards the garden and hence the light could not as yet have been seen by the pressgang  bob dear bob she said through the keyhole  put out your light and run out of the backdoor  why said bob leisurely knocking the ashes from the pipe he had been smoking  the pressgang  they have come  by god who can have blown upon me  all right dearest  im game  anne scarcely knowing what she did descended the ladder and ran to the backdoor hastily unbolting it to save bobs time and gently opening it in readiness for him  she had no sooner done this than she felt hands laid upon her shoulder from without and a voice exclaiming thats how we doos itquite an obleeging young man  though the hands held her rather roughly anne did not mind for herself and turning she cried desperately in tones intended to reach bobs ears they are at the backdoor try the front  but inexperienced miss garland little knew the shrewd habits of the gentlemen she had to deal with who well used to this sort of pastime had already posted themselves at every outlet from the premises  bring the lantern shouted the fellow who held her  whytis a girl i half thought sohere is a way in he continued to his comrades hastening to the foot of the ladder which led to bobs room  what dye want said bob quietly opening the door and showing himself still radiant in the full dress that he had worn with such effect at the theatre royal which he had been about to change for his mill suit when anne gave the alarm  this gentleman cant be the right one observed a marine rather impressed by bobs appearance  yes yes thats the man said the sergeant  now take it quietly my young cockowax  you look as if you meant to and tis wise of ye  where are you going to take me said bob  only aboard the black diamond  if you choose to take the bounty and come voluntarily youll be allowed to go ashore whenever your ships in port  if you dont and weve got to pinion ye you will not have your liberty at all  as you must come willynilly youll do the first if youve any brains whatever  bobs temper began to rise  dont you talk so large about your pinioning my man  when ive settled  now or never young blowhard interrupted his informant  come what jabber is this going on said the lieutenant stepping forward  bring your man  one of the marines set foot on the ladder but at the same moment a shoe from bobs hand hit the lantern with wellaimed directness knocking it clean out of the grasp of the man who held it  in spite of the darkness they began to scramble up the ladder  bob thereupon shut the door which being but of slight construction was as he knew only a momentary defence  but it gained him time enough to open the window gather up his legs upon the sill and spring across into the appletree growing without  he alighted without much hurt beyond a few scratches from the boughs a shower of falling apples testifying to the force of his leap  here he is shouted several below who had seen bobs figure flying like a ravens across the sky  there was stillness for a moment in the tree  then the fugitive made haste to climb out upon a lowhanging branch towards the garden at which the men beneath all rushed in that direction to catch him as he dropped saying you may as well come down old boy  twas a spry jump and we give ye credit for t  the latter movement of loveday had been a mere feint  partly hidden by the leaves he glided back to the other part of the tree from whence it was easy to jump upon a thatchcovered outhouse  this intention they did not appear to suspect which gave him the opportunity of sliding down the slope and entering the back door of the mill  hes here hes here the men exclaimed running back from the tree  by this time they had obtained another light and pursued him closely along the back quarters of the mill  bob had entered the lower room seized hold of the chain by which the floursacks were hoisted from story to story by connexion with the millwheel and pulled the rope that hung alongside for the purpose of throwing it into gear  the foremost pursuers arrived just in time to see captain bobs legs and shoebuckles vanishing through the trapdoor in the joists overhead his person having been whirled up by the machinery like any bag of flour and the trap falling to behind him  hes gone up by the hoist said the sergeant running up the ladder in the corner to the next floor and elevating the light just in time to see bobs suspended figure ascending in the same way through the same sort of trap into the second floor  the second trap also fell together behind him and he was lost to view as before  it was more difficult to follow now there was only a flimsy little ladder and the men ascended cautiously  when they stepped out upon the loft it was empty  he must ha let go here said one of the marines who knew more about mills than the others  if he had held fast a moment longer he would have been dashed against that beam  they looked up  the hook by which bob had held on had ascended to the roof and was winding round the cylinder  nothing was visible elsewhere but boarded divisions like the stalls of a stable on each side of the stage they stood upon these compartments being more or less heaped up with wheat and barley in the grain  perhaps hes buried himself in the corn  the whole crew jumped into the cornbins and stirred about their yellow contents but neither arm leg nor coattail was uncovered  they removed sacks peeped among the rafters of the roof but to no purpose the lieutenant began to fume at the loss of time  what cursed fools to let the man go  why look here whats this  he had opened the door by which sacks were taken in from waggons without and dangling from the cathead projecting above it was the rope used in lifting them  theres the way he went down the officer continued the mans gone  amidst mumblings and curses the gang descended the pair of ladders and came into the open air but captain bob was nowhere to be seen  when they reached the front door of the house the miller was standing on the threshold half dressed  your son is a clever fellow miller said the lieutenant but it would have been much better for him if he had come quiet  thats a matter of opinion said loveday  i have no doubt that hes in the house  he may be and he may not  do you know where he is  i do not and if i did i shouldnt tell  naturally  i heard steps beating up the road sir said the sergeant  they turned from the door and leaving four of the marines to keep watch round the house the remainder of the party marched into the lane as far as where the other road branched off  while they were pausing to decide which course to take one of the soldiers held up the light  a black object was discernible upon the ground before them and they found it to be a hatthe hat of bob loveday  we are on the track cried the sergeant deciding for this direction  they tore on rapidly and the footsteps previously heard became audible again increasing in clearness which told that they gained upon the fugitive who in another five minutes stopped and turned  the rays of the candle fell upon anne  what do you want she said showing her frightened face  they made no reply but wheeled round and left her  she sank down on the bank to rest having done all she could  it was she who had taken down bobs hat from a nail and dropped it at the turning with the view of misleading them till he should have got clear off     xxxii  deliverance   but anne garland was too anxious to remain long away from the centre of operations  when she got back she found that the pressgang were standing in the court discussing their next move  waste no more time here the lieutenant said  two more villages to visit tonight and the nearest three miles off  theres nobody else in this place and we cant come back again  when they were moving away one of the private marines who had kept his eye on anne and noticed her distress contrived to say in a whisper as he passed her we are coming back again as soon as it begins to get light thats only said to deceive ee  keep your young man out of the way  they went as they had come and the little household then met together mrs loveday having by this time dressed herself and come down  a long and anxious discussion followed  somebody must have told upon the chap loveday remarked  how should they have found him out else now hes been home from sea this twelvemonth  anne then mentioned what the friendly marine had told her and fearing lest bob was in the house and would be discovered there when daylight came they searched and called for him everywhere  what clothes has he got on said the miller  his lovely new suit said his wife  i warrant it is quite spoiled  hes got no hat said anne  well said loveday you two go and lie down now and ill bide up and as soon as he comes in which hell do most likely in the course of the night ill let him know that they are coming again  anne and mrs loveday went to their bedrooms and the miller entered the mill as if he were simply staying up to grind  but he continually left the flourshoot to go outside and walk round each time he could see no living being near the spot  anne meanwhile had lain down dressed upon her bed the window still open her ears intent upon the sound of footsteps and dreading the reappearance of daylight and the gangs return  three or four times during the night she descended to the mill to inquire of her stepfather if bob had shown himself but the answer was always in the negative  at length the curtains of her bed began to reveal their pattern the brass handles of the drawers gleamed forth and day dawned  while the light was yet no more than a suffusion of pallor she arose put on her hat and determined to explore the surrounding premises before the men arrived  emerging into the raw loneliness of the daybreak she went upon the bridge and looked up and down the road  it was as she had left it empty and the solitude was rendered yet more insistent by the silence of the millwheel which was now stopped the miller having given up expecting bob and retired to bed about three oclock  the footprints of the marines still remained in the dust on the bridge all the heelmarks towards the house showing that the party had not as yet returned  while she lingered she heard a slight noise in the other direction and turning saw a woman approaching  the woman came up quickly and to her amazement anne recognized matilda  her walk was convulsive face pale almost haggard and the cold light of the morning invested it with all the ghostliness of death  she had plainly walked all the way from budmouth for her shoes were covered with dust  has the pressgang been here she gasped  if not they are coming  they have been  and got himi am too late  no they are coming back again  why did you  i came to try to save him  can we save him  where is he  anne looked the woman in the face and it was impossible to doubt that she was in earnest  i dont know she answered  i am trying to find him before they come  will you not let me help you cried the repentant matilda  without either objecting or assenting anne turned and led the way to the back part of the homestead  matilda too had suffered that night  from the moment of parting with festus derriman a sentiment of revulsion from the act to which she had been a party set in and increased till at length it reached an intensity of remorse which she could not passively bear  she had risen before day and hastened thitherward to know the worst and if possible hinder consequences that she had been the first to set in train  after going hither and thither in the adjoining field anne entered the garden  the walks were bathed in grey dew and as she passed observantly along them it appeared as if they had been brushed by some foot at a much earlier hour  at the end of the garden bushes of broom laurel and yew formed a constantly encroaching shrubbery that had come there almost by chance and was never trimmed  behind these bushes was a gardenseat and upon it lay bob sound asleep  the ends of his hair were clotted with damp and there was a foggy film upon the mirrorlike buttons of his coat and upon the buckles of his shoes  his bunch of new gold seals was dimmed by the same insidious dampness his shirtfrill and muslin neckcloth were limp as seaweed  it was plain that he had been there a long time  anne shook him but he did not awake his breathing being slow and stertorous  bob wake tis your own anne she said with innocent earnestness and then fearfully turning her head she saw that matilda was close behind her  you neednt mind me said matilda bitterly  i am on your side now shake him again  anne shook him again but he slept on  then she noticed that his forehead bore the mark of a heavy wound  i fancy i hear something said her companion starting forward and endeavouring to wake bob herself  he is stunned or drugged she said there is no rousing him  anne raised her head and listened  from the direction of the eastern road came the sound of a steady tramp  they are coming back she said clasping her hands  they will take him ill as he is  he wont open his eyesno it is no use  o what shall we do  matilda did not reply but running to the end of the seat on which bob lay tried its weight in her arms  it is not too heavy she said  you take that end and ill take this well carry him away to some place of hiding  anne instantly seized the other end and they proceeded with their burden at a slow pace to the lower gardengate which they reached as the tread of the pressgang resounded over the bridge that gave access to the mill court now hidden from view by the hedge and the trees of the garden  we will go down inside this field said anne faintly  no said the other they will see our foottracks in the dew  we must go into the road  it is the very road they will come down when they leave the mill  it cannot be helped it is neck or nothing with us now  so they emerged upon the road and staggered along without speaking occasionally resting for a moment to ease their arms then shaking him to arouse him and finding it useless seizing the seat again  when they had gone about two hundred yards matilda betrayed signs of exhaustion and she asked is there no shelter near  when we get to that little field of corn said anne  it is so very far  surely there is some place near  she pointed to a few scrubby bushes overhanging a little stream which passed under the road near this point  they are not thick enough said anne  let us take him under the bridge said matilda  i can go no further  entering the opening by which cattle descended to drink they waded into the weedy water which here rose a few inches above their ankles  to ascend the stream stoop under the arch and reach the centre of the roadway was the work of a few minutes  if they look under the arch we are lost murmured anne  there is no parapet to the bridge and they may pass over without heeding  they waited their heads almost in contact with the reeking arch and their feet encircled by the stream which was at its summer lowness now for some minutes they could hear nothing but the babble of the water over their ankles and round the legs of the seat on which bob slumbered the sounds being reflected in a musical tinkle from the hollow sides of the arch  annes anxiety now was lest he should not continue sleeping till the search was over but start up with his habitual imprudence and scorning such means of safety rush out into their arms  a quarter of an hour dragged by and then indications reached their ears that the reexamination of the mill had begun and ended  the wellknown tramp drew nearer and reverberated through the ground over their heads where its volume signified to the listeners that the party had been largely augmented by pressed men since the night preceding  the gang passed the arch and the noise regularly diminished as if no man among them had thought of looking aside for a moment  matilda broke the silence  i wonder if they have left a watch behind she said doubtfully  i will go and see said anne  wait till i return  no i can do no more  when you come back i shall be gone  i ask one thing of you  if all goes well with you and him and he marries youdont be alarmed my plans lie elsewherewhen you are his wife tell him who helped to carry him away  but dont mention my name to the rest of your family either now or at any time  anne regarded the speaker for a moment and promised after which she waded out from the archway  matilda stood looking at bob for a moment as if preparing to go till moved by some impulse she bent and lightly kissed him once  how can you cried anne reproachfully  when leaving the mouth of the arch she had bent back and seen the act  matilda flushed  you jealous baby she said scornfully  anne hesitated for a moment then went out from the water and hastened towards the mill  she entered by the garden and seeing no one advanced and peeped in at the window  her mother and mr loveday were sitting within as usual  are they all gone said anne softly  yes  they did not trouble us much beyond going into every room and searching about the garden where they saw steps  they have been lucky tonight they have caught fifteen or twenty men at places further on so the loss of bob was no hurt to their feelings  i wonder where in the world the poor fellow is  i will show you said anne  and explaining in a few words what had happened she was promptly followed by david and loveday along the road she lifted her dress and entered the arch with some anxiety on account of matilda but the actress was gone and bob lay on the seat as she had left him  bob was brought out and water thrown upon his face but though he moved he did not rouse himself until some time after he had been borne into the house  here he opened his eyes and saw them standing round and gathered a little consciousness  you are all right my boy said his father  what hev happened to ye where did ye get that terrible blow  ahi can mind now murmured bob with a stupefied gaze around  i fell in slipping down the topsail halyardthe rope that is was too shortand i fell upon my head  and then i went away  when i came back i thought i wouldnt disturb ye so i lay down out there to sleep out the watch but the pain in my head was so great that i couldnt get to sleep so i picked some of the poppyheads in the border which i once heard was a good thing for sending folks to sleep when they are in pain so i munched up all i could find and dropped off quite nicely  i wondered who had picked em said molly  i noticed they were gone  why you might never have woke again said mrs loveday holding up her hands  how is your head now  i hardly know replied the young man putting his hand to his forehead and beginning to doze again  where be those fellows that boarded us with thissmooth water andfine breeze we ought to get away from em haul inthe larboard braces andbring her to the wind  you are at home dear bob said anne bending over him and the men are gone  come along upstairs th beest hardly awake now said his father and bob was assisted to bed     xxxiii  a discovery turns the scale   in fourandtwenty hours bob had recovered  but though physically himself again he was not at all sure of his position as a patriot  he had that practical knowledge of seamanship of which the country stood much in need and it was humiliating to find that impressment seemed to be necessary to teach him to use it for her advantage  many neighbouring young men less fortunate than himself had been pressed and taken and their absence seemed a reproach to him  he went away by himself into the millroof and surrounded by the cornheaps gave vent to selfcondemnation  certainly i am no man to lie here so long for the pleasure of sighting that young girl forty times a day and letting her sight mebless her eyestill i must needs want a pressgang to teach me what ive forgot and is it then all over with me as a british sailor  well see  when he was thrown under the influence of annes eyes again which were more tantalizingly beautiful than ever just now so it seemed to him his intention of offering his services to the government would wax weaker and he would put off his final decision till the next day  anne saw these fluctuations of his mind between love and patriotism and being terrified by what she had heard of seafights used the utmost art of which she was capable to seduce him from his forming purpose  she came to him in the mill wearing the very prettiest of her morning jacketsthe one that only just passed the waist and was laced so tastefully round the collar and bosom  then she would appear in her new hat with a bouquet of primroses on one side and on the following sunday she walked before him in lemoncoloured boots so that her feet looked like a pair of yellowhammers flitting under her dress  but dress was the least of the means she adopted for chaining him down she talked more tenderly than ever asked him to begin small undertakings in the garden on her account she sang about the house that the place might seem cheerful when he came in  this singing for a purpose required great effort on her part leaving her afterwards very sad  when bob asked her what was the matter she would say nothing only i am thinking how you will grieve your father and cross his purposes if you carry out your unkind notion of going to sea and forsaking your place in the mill  yes bob would say uneasily  it will trouble him i know  being also quite aware how it would trouble her he would again postpone and thus another week passed away  all this time john had not come once to the mill  it appeared as if miss johnson absorbed all his time and thoughts  bob was often seen chuckling over the circumstance  a sly rascal he said  pretending on the day she came to be married that she was not good enough for me when it was only that he wanted her for himself  how he could have persuaded her to go away is beyond me to say  anne could not contest this belief of her lovers and remained silent but there had more than once occurred to her mind a doubt of its probability  yet she had only abandoned her opinion that john had schemed for matilda to embrace the opposite error that finding he had wronged the young lady he had pitied and grown to love her  and yet jack when he was a boy was the simplest fellow alive resumed bob  by george though i should have been hot against him for such a trick if in losing her i hadnt found a better  but shell never come down to him in the world she has high notions now  i am afraid hes doomed to sigh in vain  though bob regretted this possibility the feeling was not reciprocated by anne  it was true that she knew nothing of matildas temporary treachery and that she disbelieved the story of her lack of virtue but she did not like the woman  perhaps it will not matter if he is doomed to sigh in vain she said  but i owe him no illwill  i have profited by his doings incomprehensible as they are  and she bent her fair eyes on bob and smiled  bob looked dubious  he thinks he has affronted me now i have seen through him and that i shall be against meeting him  but of course i am not so touchy  i can stand a practical joke as can any man who has been afloat  ill call and see him and tell him so  before he started bob bethought him of something which would still further prove to the misapprehending john that he was entirely forgiven he went to his room and took from his chest a packet containing a lock of miss johnsons hair which she had given him during their brief acquaintance and which till now he had quite forgotten  when at starting he wished anne goodbye it was accompanied by such a beaming face that she knew he was full of an idea and asked what it might be that pleased him so  why this he said smacking his breastpocket  a lock of hair that matilda gave me  anne sank back with parted lips  i am going to give it to jackhell jump for joy to get it  and it will show him how willing i am to give her up to him fine piece as she is  will you see her today bob anne asked with an uncertain smile  o nounless it is by accident  on reaching the outskirts of the town he went straight to the barracks and was lucky enough to find john in his room at the lefthand corner of the quadrangle  john was glad to see him but to bobs surprise he showed no immediate contrition and thus afforded no room for the brotherly speech of forgiveness which bob had been going to deliver  as the trumpetmajor did not open the subject bob felt it desirable to begin himself  i have brought ye something that you will value jack he said as they sat at the window overlooking the large square barrackyard  i have got no further use for it and you should have had it before if it had entered my head  thank you bob what is it said john looking absently at an awkward squad of young men who were drilling in the enclosure  tis a young womans lock of hair  ah said john quite recovering from his abstraction and slightly flushing  could bob and anne have quarrelled  bob drew the paper from his pocket and opened it  black said john  yesblack enough  whose  why matildas  o matildas  whose did you think then  instead of replying the trumpetmajors face became as red as sunset and he turned to the window to hide his confusion  bob was silent and then he too looked into the court  at length he arose walked to his brother and laid his hand upon his shoulder jack he said in an altered voice you are a good fellow  now i see it all  o nothats nothing said john hastily  youve been pretending that you care for this woman that i mightnt blame myself for heaving you out from the otherwhich is what ive done without knowing it  what does it matter  but it does matter  ive been making you unhappy all these weeks and weeks through my thoughtlessness  they seemed to think at home you know john that you had grown not to care for her or i wouldnt have done it for all the world  you stick to her bob and never mind me  she belongs to you  she loves you  i have no claim upon her and she thinks nothing about me  she likes you john thoroughly well so does everybody and if i hadnt come home putting my foot in it  that coming home of mine has been a regular blight upon the family  i ought never to have stayed  the sea is my home and why couldnt i bide there  the trumpetmajor drew bobs discourse off the subject as soon as he could and bob after some unconsidered replies and remarks seemed willing to avoid it for the present  he did not ask john to accompany him home as he had intended and on leaving the barracks turned southward and entered the town to wander about till he could decide what to do  it was the 3rd of september but the kings wateringplace still retained its summer aspect  the royal bathingmachine had been drawn out just as bob reached gloucester buildings and he waited a minute in the lack of other distraction to look on  immediately that the kings machine had entered the water a group of florid men with fiddles violoncellos a trombone and a drum came forward packed themselves into another machine that was in waiting and were drawn out into the waves in the kings rear  all that was to be heard for a few minutes were the slow pulsations of the sea and then a deafening noise burst from the interior of the second machine with power enough to split the boards asunder it was the condensed mass of musicians inside striking up the strains of god save the king as his majestys head rose from the water  bob took off his hat and waited till the end of the performance which intended as a pleasant surprise to george iii by the loyal burghers was possibly in the watery circumstances tolerated rather than desired by that dripping monarch 303  loveday then passed on to the harbour where he remained awhile looking at the busy scene of loading and unloading craft and swabbing the decks of yachts at the boats and barges rubbing against the quay wall and at the houses of the merchants some ancient structures of solid stone others greenshuttered with heavy wooden bowwindows which appeared as if about to drop into the harbour by their own weight  all these things he gazed upon and thought of one thingthat he had caused great misery to his brother john  the town clock struck and bob retraced his steps till he again approached the esplanade and gloucester lodge where the morning sun blazed in upon the house fronts and not a spot of shade seemed to be attainable  a huzzaing attracted his attention and he observed that a number of people had gathered before the kings residence where a brown curricle had stopped out of which stepped a hale man in the prime of life wearing a blue uniform gilt epaulettes cocked hat and sword who crossed the pavement and went in  bob went up and joined the group whats going on he said  captain hardy replied a bystander  what of him  just gone inwaiting to see the king  but the captain is in the west indies  no  the fleet is come home they cant find the french anywhere  will they go and look for them again asked bob  o yes  nelson is determined to find em  as soon as hes refitted hell put to sea again  ah heres the king coming in  bob was so interested in what he had just heard that he scarcely noticed the arrival of the king and a body of attendant gentlemen  he went on thinking of his new knowledge captain hardy was come  he was doubtless staying with his family at their small manorhouse at posham a few miles from overcombe where he usually spent the intervals between his different cruises  loveday returned to the mill without further delay and shortly explaining that john was very well and would come soon went on to talk of the arrival of nelsons captain  and is he come at last said the miller throwing his thoughts years backward  well can i mind when he first left home to go on board the helena as midshipman  thats not much to remember  i can remember it too said mrs loveday  tis more than twenty years ago anyhow  and more than that i can mind when he was born i was a lad serving my prenticeship at the time  he has been in this house often and often when a was young  when he came home after his first voyage he stayed about here a long time and used to look in at the mill whenever he went past  what will you be next sir said mother to him one day as he stood with his back to the doorpost  a lieutenant dame loveday says he  and what next says she  a commander  and next  next postcaptain  and then  then it will be almost time to die  id warrant that hed mind it to this very day if you were to ask him  bob heard all this with a manner of preoccupation and soon retired to the mill  thence he went to his room by the back passage and taking his old seafaring garments from a dark closet in the wall conveyed them to the loft at the top of the mill where he occupied the remaining spare moments of the day in brushing the mildew from their folds and hanging each article by the window to get aired  in the evening he returned to the loft and dressing himself in the old salt suit went out of the house unobserved by anybody and ascended the road towards captain hardys native village and present temporary home  the shadeless downs were now brown with the droughts of the passing summer and few living things met his view the natural rotundity of the elevation being only occasionally disturbed by the presence of a barrow a thornbush or a piece of dry wall which remained from some attempted enclosure  by the time that he reached the village it was dark and the larger stars had begun to shine when he walked up to the door of the old fashioned house which was the family residence of this branch of the southwessex hardys  will the captain allow me to wait on him tonight inquired loveday explaining who and what he was  the servant went away for a few minutes and then told bob that he might see the captain in the morning  if thats the case ill come again replied bob quite cheerful that failure was not absolute  he had left the door but a few steps when he was called back and asked if he had walked all the way from overcombe mill on purpose  loveday replied modestly that he had done so  then will you come in  he followed the speaker into a small study or office and in a minute or two captain hardy entered  the captain at this time was a bachelor of thirtyfive rather stout in build with light eyes bushy eyebrows a square broad face plenty of chin and a mouth whose corners played between humour and grimness  he surveyed loveday from top to toe  robert loveday sir son of the miller at overcombe said bob making a low bow  ah  i remember your father loveday the gallant seaman replied well what do you want to say to me  seeing that bob found it rather difficult to begin he leant leisurely against the mantelpiece and went on is your father well and hearty  i have not seen him for many many years  quite well thank ee  you used to have a brother in the army i think  what was his namejohn  a very fine fellow if i recollect  yes capn hes there still  and you are in the merchantservice  late first mate of the brig pewit  how is it youre not on board a manofwar  ay sir thats the thing ive come about said bob recovering confidence  i should have been but tis womankind has hampered me ive waited and waited on at home because of a young womanlady i might have said for shes sprung from a higher class of society than i  her father was a landscape paintermaybe youve heard of him sir  the name is garland  he painted that view of our village here said captain hardy looking towards a dark little picture in the corner of the room  bob looked and went on as if to the picture well sir i have found that  however the pressgang came a week or two ago and didnt get hold of me  i didnt care to go aboard as a pressed man  there has been a severe impressment  it is of course a disagreeable necessity but it cant be helped  since then sir something has happened that makes me wish they had found me and i have come tonight to ask if i could enter on board your ship the victory  the captain shook his head severely and presently observed i am glad to find that you think of entering the service loveday smart men are badly wanted  but it will not be in your power to choose your ship  well well sir then i must take my chance elsewhere said bob his face indicating the disappointment he would not fully express  twas only that i felt i would much rather serve under you than anybody else my father and all of us being known to ye captain hardy and our families belonging to the same parts  captain hardy took bobs altitude more carefully  are you a good practical seaman he asked musingly  ay sir i believe i am  active  fond of skylarking  well i dont know about the last  i think i can say i am active enough  i could walk the yardarm if required cross from mast to mast by the stays and do what most fellows do who call themselves spry  the captain then put some questions about the details of navigation which loveday having luckily been used to square rigs answered satisfactorily  as to reefing topsails he added if i dont do it like a flash of lightning i can do it so that they will stand blowing weather  the pewit was not a dull vessel and when we were convoyed home from lisbon she could keep well in sight of the frigate scudding at a distance by putting on full sail  we had enough hands aboard to reef topsails manowar fashion which is a rare thing in these days sir now that able seamen are so scarce on trading craft  and i hear that men from squarerigged vessels are liked much the best in the navy as being more ready for use  so that i shouldnt be altogether so raw said bob earnestly if i could enter on your ship sir  still if i cant i cant  i might ask for you loveday said the captain thoughtfully and so get you there that way  in short i think i may say i will ask for you so consider it settled  my thanks to you sir said loveday  you are aware that the victory is a smart ship and that cleanliness and order are of necessity more strictly insisted upon there than in some others  sir i quite see it  well i hope you will do your duty as well on a lineofbattle ship as you did when mate of the brig for it is a duty that may be serious  bob replied that it should be his one endeavour and receiving a few instructions for getting on board the guardship and being conveyed to portsmouth he turned to go away  youll have a stiff walk before you fetch overcombe mill this dark night loveday concluded the captain peering out of the window  ill send you in a glass of grog to help ee on your way  the captain then left bob to himself and when he had drunk the grog that was brought in he started homeward with a heart not exactly light but large with a patriotic cheerfulness which had not diminished when after walking so fast in his excitement as to be beaded with perspiration he entered his fathers door  they were all sitting up for him and at his approach anxiously raised their sleepy eyes for it was nearly eleven oclock  there i knew hed not be much longer cried anne jumping up and laughing in her relief  they have been thinking you were very strange and silent today bob you were not were you  whats the matter bob said the miller for bobs countenance was sublimed by his recent interview like that of a priest just come from the penetralia of the temple  hes in his mates clothes just as when he came home observed mrs loveday  they all saw now that he had something to tell  i am going away he said when he had sat down  i am going to enter on board a manofwar and perhaps it will be the victory  going said anne faintly  now dont you mind it theres a dear he went on solemnly taking her hand in his own  and you father dont you begin to take it to heart the miller was looking grave  the pressgang has been here and though i showed them that i was a free man i am going to show everybody that i can do my duty  neither of the other three answered anne and the miller having their eyes bent upon the ground and the former trying to repress her tears  now dont you grieve either of you he continued nor vex yourselves that this has happened  please not to be angry with me father for deserting you and the mill where you want me for i must go  for these three years we and the rest of the country have been in fear of the enemy trade has been hindered poor folk made hungry and many rich folk made poor  there must be a deliverance and it must be done by sea  i have seen captain hardy and i shall serve under him if so be i can  captain hardy  yes  i have been to his house at posham where hes staying with his sisters walked there and back and i wouldnt have missed it for fifty guineas  i hardly thought he would see me but he did see me  and he hasnt forgot you  bob then opened his tale in order relating graphically the conversation to which he had been a party and they listened with breathless attention  well if you must go you must said the miller with emotion but i think it somewhat hard that of my two sons neither one of em can be got to stay and help me in my business as i get old  dont trouble and vex about it said mrs loveday soothingly  they are both instruments in the hands of providence chosen to chastise that corsican ogre and do what they can for the country in these trying years  thats just the shape of it mrs loveday said bob  and hell come back soon she continued turning to anne  and then hell tell us all he has seen and the glory that hes won and how he has helped to sweep that scourge buonaparty off the earth  when be you going bob his father inquired  tomorrow if i can  i shall call at the barracks and tell john as i go by  when i get to portsmouth  a burst of sobs in quick succession interrupted his words they came from anne who till that moment had been sitting as before with her hand in that of bob and apparently quite calm  mrs loveday jumped up but before she could say anything to soothe the agitated girl she had calmed herself with the same singular suddenness that had marked her giving way i dont mind bobs going she said  i think he ought to go  dont suppose bob that i want you to stay  after this she left the apartment and went into the little side room where she and her mother usually worked  in a few moments bob followed her  when he came back he was in a very sad and emotional mood  anybody could see that there had been a parting of profound anguish to both  she is not coming back tonight he said  you will see her tomorrow before you go said her mother  i may or i may not he replied  father and mrs loveday do you go to bed now  i have got to look over my things and get ready and it will take me some little time  if you should hear noises you will know it is only myself moving about  when bob was left alone he suddenly became brisk and set himself to overhaul his clothes and other possessions in a businesslike manner  by the time that his chest was packed such things as he meant to leave at home folded into cupboards and what was useless destroyed it was past two oclock  then he went to bed so softly that only the creak of one weak stair revealed his passage upward  at the moment that he passed annes chamberdoor her mother was bending over her as she lay in bed and saying to her wont you see him in the morning  no no said anne  i would rather not see him  i have said that i may  but i shall not  i cannot see him again  when the family got up next day bob had vanished  it was his way to disappear like this to avoid affecting scenes at parting  by the time that they had sat down to a gloomy breakfast bob was in the boat of a budmouth waterman who pulled him alongside the guardship in the roads where he laid hold of the manrope mounted and disappeared from external view  in the course of the day the ship moved off set her royals and made sail for portsmouth with five hundred new hands for the service on board consisting partly of pressed men and partly of volunteers among the latter being robert loveday     xxxiv  a speck on the sea   in parting from john who accompanied him to the quay bob had said now jack these be my last words to you i give her up  i go away on purpose and i shall be away a long time  if in that time she should list over towards ye ever so little mind you take her  you have more right to her than i  you chose her when my mind was elsewhere and you best deserve her for i have never known you forget one woman while ive forgot a dozen  take her then if she will come and god bless both of ye  another person besides john saw bob go  that was derriman who was standing by a bollard a little further up the quay  he did not repress his satisfaction at the sight  john looked towards him with an open gaze of contempt for the cuffs administered to the yeoman at the inn had not so far as the trumpetmajor was aware produced any desire to avenge that insult john being of course quite ignorant that festus had erroneously retaliated upon bob in his peculiar though scarcely soldierly way finding that he did not even now approach him john went on his way and thought over his intention of preserving intact the love between anne and his brother  he was surprised when he next went to the mill to find how glad they all were to see him  from the moment of bobs return to the bosom of the deep anne had had no existence on land people might have looked at her human body and said she had flitted thence  the sea and all that belonged to the sea was her daily thought and her nightly dream  she had the whole twoandthirty winds under her eye each passing gale that ushered in returning autumn being mentally registered and she acquired a precise knowledge of the direction in which portsmouth brest ferrol cadiz and other such likely places lay  instead of saying her own familiar prayers at night she substituted with some confusion of thought the forms of prayer to be used at sea  john at once noticed her lorn abstracted looks pitied herhow much he pitied herand asked when they were alone if there was anything he could do  there are two things she said with almost childish eagerness in her tired eyes  they shall be done  the first is to find out if captain hardy has gone back to his ship and the other iso if you will do it johnto get me newspapers whenever possible  after this duologue john was absent for a space of three hours and they thought he had gone back to barracks  he entered however at the end of that time took off his foragecap and wiped his forehead  you look tired john said his father  o no  he went through the house till he had found anne garland  i have only done one of those things he said to her  what already  i didnt hope for or mean today  captain hardy is gone from posham  he left some days ago  we shall soon hear that the fleet has sailed  you have been all the way to posham on purpose  how good of you  well i was anxious to know myself when bob is likely to leave  i expect now that we shall soon hear from him  two days later he came again  he brought a newspaper and what was better a letter for anne franked by the first lieutenant of the victory  then hes aboard her said anne as she eagerly took the letter  it was short but as much as she could expect in the circumstances and informed them that the captain had been as good as his word and had gratified bobs earnest wish to serve under him  the ship with admiral lord nelson on board and accompanied by the frigate euryalus was to sail in two days for plymouth where they would be joined by others and thence proceed to the coast of spain  anne lay awake that night thinking of the victory and of those who floated in her  to the best of annes calculation that ship of war would during the next twentyfour hours pass within a few miles of where she herself then lay  next to seeing bob the thing that would give her more pleasure than any other in the world was to see the vessel that contained himhis floating city his sole dependence in battle and stormupon whose safety from winds and enemies hung all her hope  the morrow was marketday at the seaport and in this she saw her opportunity  a carrier went from overcombe at six oclock thither and having to do a little shopping for herself she gave it as a reason for her intended days absence and took a place in the van  when she reached the town it was still early morning but the borough was already in the zenith of its daily bustle and show  the king was always outof doors by six oclock and such cockcrow hours at gloucester lodge produced an equally forward stir among the population  she alighted and passed down the esplanade as fully thronged by persons of fashion at this time of mist and level sunlight as a wateringplace in the present day is at four in the afternoon  dashing bucks and beaux in cocked hats black feathers ruffles and frills stared at her as she hurried along the beach was swarming with bathing women wearing waistbands that bore the national refrain god save the king in gilt letters the shops were all open and sergeant stanner with his swordstuck banknotes and heroic gaze was beating up at two guineas and a crown the crown to drink his majestys health  she soon finished her shopping and then crossing over into the old town pursued her way along the coastroad to portland  at the end of an hour she had been rowed across the fleet which then lacked the convenience of a bridge and reached the base of portland hill  the steep incline before her was dotted with houses showing the pleasant peculiarity of one mans doorstep being behind his neighbours chimney and slabs of stone as the common material for walls roof floor pig sty stablemanger doorscraper and gardenstile  anne gained the summit and followed along the central track over the huge lump of freestone which forms the peninsula the wide sea prospect extending as she went on  weary with her journey she approached the extreme southerly peak of rock and gazed from the cliff at portland bill or beal as it was in those days more correctly called  the wild herbless weatherworn promontory was quite a solitude and saving the one old lighthouse about fifty yards up the slope scarce a mark was visible to show that humanity had ever been near the spot  anne found herself a seat on a stone and swept with her eyes the tremulous expanse of water around her that seemed to utter a ceaseless unintelligible incantation  out of the three hundred and sixty degrees of her complete horizon two hundred and fifty were covered by waves the coup doeil including the area of troubled waters known as the race where two seas met to effect the destruction of such vessels as could not be mastered by one  she counted the craft within her view there were five no there were only four no there were seven some of the specks having resolved themselves into two  they were all small coasters and kept well within sight of land  anne sank into a reverie  then she heard a slight noise on her left hand and turning beheld an old sailor who had approached with a glass he was levelling it over the sea in a direction to the southeast and somewhat removed from that in which her own eyes had been wandering  anne moved a few steps thitherward so as to unclose to her view a deeper sweep on that side and by this discovered a ship of far larger size than any which had yet dotted the main before her  its sails were for the most part new and clean and in comparison with its rapid progress before the wind the small brigs and ketches seemed standing still  upon this striking object the old mans glass was bent  what do you see sailor she asked  almost nothing he answered  my sight is so gone off lately that things one and all be but a november mist to me  and yet i fain would see today  i am looking for the victory  why she said quickly  i have a son aboard her  hes one of three from these parts  theres the captain theres my son ned and theres young loveday of overcombehe that lately joined  shall i look for you said anne after a pause  certainly misess if so be you please  anne took the glass and he supported it by his arm  it is a large ship she said with three masts three rows of guns along the side and all her sails set  i guessed as much  there is a little flag in frontover her bowsprit  the jack  and theres a large one flying at her stern  the ensign  and a white one on her foretopmast  thats the admirals flag the flag of my lord nelson  what is her figurehead my dear  a coatofarms supported on this side by a sailor  her companion nodded with satisfaction  on the other side of that figurehead is a marine  she is twisting round in a curious way and her sails sink in like old cheeks and she shivers like a leaf upon a tree  she is in stays for the larboard tack  i can see what shes been doing  shes been reching close in to avoid the flood tide as the wind is to the souwest and shes bound down but as soon as the ebb made dye see they made sail to the westard  captain hardy may be depended upon for that he knows every current about here being a native  and now i can see the other side it is a soldier where a sailor was before  you are sure it is the victory  i am sure  after this a frigate came into viewthe euryalussailing in the same direction  anne sat down and her eyes never left the ships  tell me more about the victory she said  she is the best sailer in the service and she carries a hundred guns the heaviest be on the lower deck the next size on the middle deck the next on the main and upper decks  my son neds place is on the lower deck because hes short and they put the short men below  bob though not tall was not likely to be specially selected for shortness  she pictured him on the upper deck in his snowwhite trousers and jacket of navy blue looking perhaps towards the very point of land where she then was  the great silent ship with her population of bluejackets marines officers captain and the admiral who was not to return alive passed like a phantom the meridian of the bill  sometimes her aspect was that of a large white bat sometimes that of a grey one  in the course of time the watching girl saw that the ship had passed her nearest point the breadth of her sails diminished by foreshortening till she assumed the form of an egg on end  after this something seemed to twinkle and anne who had previously withdrawn from the old sailor went back to him and looked again through the glass  the twinkling was the light falling upon the cabin windows of the ships stern  she explained it to the old man  then we see now what the enemy have seen but once  that was in seventy nine when she sighted the french and spanish fleet off scilly and she retreated because she feared a landing  well tis a brave ship and she carries brave men  annes tender bosom heaved but she said nothing and again became absorbed in contemplation  the victory was fast dropping away  she was on the horizon and soon appeared hull down  that seemed to be like the beginning of a greater end than her present vanishing  anne garland could not stay by the sailor any longer and went about a stonesthrow off where she was hidden by the inequality of the cliff from his view  the vessel was now exactly end on and stood out in the direction of the start her width having contracted to the proportion of a feather  she sat down again and mechanically took out some biscuits that she had brought foreseeing that her waiting might be long  but she could not eat one of them eating seemed to jar with the mental tenseness of the moment and her undeviating gaze continued to follow the lessened ship with the fidelity of a balanced needle to a magnetic stone all else in her being motionless  the courses of the victory were absorbed into the main then her topsails went and then her topgallants  she was now no more than a dead flys wing on a sheet of spiders web and even this fragment diminished  anne could hardly bear to see the end and yet she resolved not to flinch  the admirals flag sank behind the watery line and in a minute the very truck of the last topmast stole away  the victory was gone  annes lip quivered as she murmured without removing her wet eyes from the vacant and solemn horizon they that go down to the sea in ships that do business in great waters  these see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep was returned by a mans voice from behind her  looking round quickly she saw a soldier standing there and the grave eyes of john loveday bent on her  tis what i was thinking she said trying to be composed  you were saying it he answered gently  was ii did not know it     how came you here she presently added  i have been behind you a good while but you never turned round  i was deeply occupied she said in an undertone  yesi too came to see him pass  i heard this morning that lord nelson had embarked and i knew at once that they would sail immediately  the victory and euryalus are to join the rest of the fleet at plymouth  there was a great crowd of people assembled to see the admiral off they cheered him and the ship as she dropped down  he took his coffin on board with him they say  his coffin said anne turning deadly pale  something terrible then is meant by that  o why would bob go in that ship doomed to destruction from the very beginning like this  it was his determination to sail under captain hardy and under no one else said john  there may be hot work but we must hope for the best  and observing how wretched she looked he added but wont you let me help you back  if you can walk as far as hope cove it will be enough  a lerret is going from there across the bay homeward to the harbour in the course of an hour it belongs to a man i know and they can take one passenger i am sure  she turned her back upon the channel and by his help soon reached the place indicated  the boat was lying there as he had said  she found it to belong to the old man who had been with her at the bill and was in charge of his two younger sons  the trumpetmajor helped her into it over the slippery blocks of stone one of the young men spread his jacket for her to sit on and as soon as they pulled from shore john climbed up the bluegrey cliff and disappeared over the top to return to the mainland by road  anne was in the town by three oclock  the trip in the stern of the lerret had quite refreshed her with the help of the biscuits which she had at last been able to eat  the van from the port to overcombe did not start till four oclock and feeling no further interest in the gaieties of the place she strolled on past the kings house to the outskirts her mind settling down again upon the possibly sad fate of the victory when she found herself alone  she did not hurry on and finding that even now there wanted another halfhour to the carriers time she turned into a little lane to escape the inspection of the numerous passersby  here all was quite lonely and still and she sat down under a willowtree absently regarding the landscape which had begun to put on the rich tones of declining summer but which to her was as hollow and faded as a theatre by day  she could hold out no longer burying her face in her hands she wept without restraint  some yards behind her was a little spring of water having a stone margin round it to prevent the cattle from treading in the sides and filling it up with dirt  while she wept two elderly gentlemen entered unperceived upon the scene and walked on to the springs brink  here they paused and looked in afterwards moving round it and then stooping as if to smell or taste its waters  the spring was in fact a sulphurous one then recently discovered by a physician who lived in the neighbourhood and it was beginning to attract some attention having by common report contributed to effect such wonderful cures as almost passed belief  after a considerable discussion apparently on how the pool might be improved for better use one of the two elderly gentlemen turned away leaving the other still probing the spring with his cane  the first stranger who wore a blue coat with gilt buttons came on in the direction of anne garland and seeing her sad posture went quickly up to her and said abruptly what is the matter  anne who in her grief had observed nothing of the gentlemens presence withdrew her handkerchief from her eyes and started to her feet  she instantly recognised her interrogator as the king  what what crying his majesty inquired kindly  how is this  ihave seen a dear friend go away sir she faltered with downcast eyes  ahpartings are sadvery sadfor us all  you must hope your friend will return soon  where is he or she gone  i dont know your majesty  dont knowhow is that  he is a sailor on board the victory  then he has reason to be proud said the king with interest  he is your brother  anne tried to explain what he was but could not and blushed with painful heat  well well well what is his name  in spite of annes confusion and low spirits her womanly shrewdness told her at once that no harm could be done by revealing bobs name and she answered his name is robert loveday sir  lovedaya good name  i shall not forget it  now dry your cheeks and dont cry any more  lovedayrobert loveday  anne curtseyed the king smiled goodhumouredly and turned to rejoin his companion who was afterwards heard to be dr  the physician in attendance at gloucester lodge  this gentleman had in the meantime filled a small phial with the medicinal water which he carefully placed in his pocket and on the king coming up they retired together and disappeared  thereupon anne now thoroughly aroused followed the same way with a gingerly tread just in time to see them get into a carriage which was in waiting at the turning of the lane  she quite forgot the carrier and everything else in connexion with riding home  flying along the road rapidly and unconsciously when she awoke to a sense of her whereabouts she was so near to overcombe as to make the carrier not worth waiting for  she had been borne up in this hasty spurt at the end of a weary day by visions of bob promoted to the rank of admiral or something equally wonderful by the kings special command the chief result of the promotion being in her arrangement of the piece that he would stay at home and go to sea no more  but she was not a girl who indulged in extravagant fancies long and before she reached home she thought that the king had probably forgotten her by that time and her troubles and her lovers name     xxxv  a sailor enters   the remaining fortnight of the month of september passed away with a general decline from the summers excitements  the royal family left the wateringplace the first week in october the german legion with their artillery about the same time  the dragoons still remained at the barracks just out of the town and john loveday brought to anne every newspaper that he could lay hands on especially such as contained any fragment of shipping news  this threw them much together and at these times john was often awkward and confused on account of the unwonted stress of concealing his great love for her  her interests had grandly developed from the limits of overcombe and the town life hard by to an extensiveness truly european  during the whole month of october however not a single grain of information reached her or anybody else concerning nelson and his blockading squadron off cadiz there were the customary bad jokes about buonaparte especially when it was found that the whole french army had turned its back upon boulogne and set out for the rhine  then came accounts of his march through germany and into austria but not a word about the victory  at the beginning of autumn john brought news which fearfully depressed her  the austrian general mack had capitulated with his whole army  then were revived the old misgivings as to invasion  instead of having to cope with him weary with waiting we shall have to encounter this man fresh from the fields of victory ran the newspaper article  but the week which had led off with such a dreary piping was to end in another key  on the very day when macks army was piling arms at the feet of its conqueror a blow had been struck by bob loveday and his comrades which eternally shattered the enemys force by sea  four days after the receipt of the austrian news corporal tullidge ran into the millers house to inform him that on the previous monday at eleven in the morning the pickle schooner lieutenant lapenotiere had arrived at falmouth with despatches from the fleet that the stagecoaches on the highway through wessex to london were chalked with the words great victory glorious triumph and so on and that all the country people were wild to know particulars  on friday afternoon john arrived with authentic news of the battle off cape trafalgar and the death of nelson  captain hardy was alive though his escape had been narrow enough his shoebuckle having been carried away by a shot  it was feared that the victory had been the scene of the heaviest slaughter among all the ships engaged but as yet no returns of killed and wounded had been issued beyond a rough list of the numbers in some of the ships  the suspense of the little household in overcombe mill was great in the extreme  john came thither daily for more than a week but no further particulars reached england till the end of that time and then only the meagre intelligence that there had been a gale immediately after the battle and that many of the prizes had been lost  anne said little to all these things and preserved a superstratum of calmness on her countenance but some inner voice seemed to whisper to her that bob was no more  miller loveday drove to posham several times to learn if the captains sisters had received any more definite tidings than these flying reports but that family had heard nothing which could in any way relieve the millers anxiety  when at last at the end of november there appeared a final and revised list of killed and wounded as issued by admiral collingwood it was a useless sheet to the lovedays  to their great pain it contained no names but those of officers the friends of ordinary seamen and marines being in those good old days left to discover their losses as best they might  annes conviction of her loss increased with the darkening of the early winter time  bob was not a cautious man who would avoid needless exposure and a hundred and fifty of the victorys crew had been disabled or slain  anybody who had looked into her room at this time would have seen that her favourite reading was the office for the burial of the dead at sea beginning we therefore commit his body to the deep  in these first days of december several of the victorious fleet came into port but not the victory  many supposed that that noble ship disabled by the battle had gone to the bottom in the subsequent tempestuous weather and the belief was persevered in till it was told in the town and port that she had been seen passing up the channel  two days later the victory arrived at portsmouth  then letters from survivors began to appear in the public prints which john so regularly brought to anne but though he watched the mails with unceasing vigilance there was never a letter from bob  it sometimes crossed johns mind that his brother might still be alive and well and that in his wish to abide by his expressed intention of giving up anne and home life he was deliberately lax in writing  if so bob was carrying out the idea too thoughtlessly by half as could be seen by watching the effects of suspense upon the fair face of the victim and the anxiety of the rest of the family  it was a clear day in december  the first slight snow of the season had been sifted over the earth and one side of the appletree branches in the millers garden was touched with white though a few leaves were still lingering on the tops of the younger trees  a short sailor of the royal navy who was not bob nor anything like him crossed the mill court and came to the door  the miller hastened out and brought him into the room where john mrs loveday and anne garland were all present  im from aboard the victory said the sailor  my names jim cornick and your lad is alive and well  they breathed rather than spoke their thankfulness and relief the millers eyes being moist as he turned aside to calm himself while anne having first jumped up wildly from her seat sank back again under the almost insupportable joy that trembled through her limbs to her utmost finger  ive come from spithead to posham the sailor continued and now i am going on to father at budmouth  ahi know your father cried the trumpetmajor old james cornick  it was the man who had brought anne in his lerret from portland bill  and bob hasnt got a scratch said the miller  not a scratch said cornick  loveday then bustled off to draw the visitor something to drink  anne garland with a glowing blush on her face had gone to the back part of the room where she was the very embodiment of sweet content as she slightly swayed herself without speaking  a little tide of happiness seemed to ebb and flow through her in listening to the sailors words moving her figure with it  the seaman and john went on conversing  bob had a good deal to do with barricading the hawseholes afore we were in action and the adml and capn both were very much pleased at how twas done  when the adml went up the quarterdeck ladder capn hardy said a word or two to bob but what it was i dont know for i was quartered at a gun some ways off  however bob saw the adml stagger when a was wownded and was one of the men who carried him to the cockpit  after that he and some other lads jumped aboard the french ship and i believe they was in her when she struck her flag  what a did next i cant say for the wind had dropped and the smoke was like a cloud  but a got a good deal talked about and they say theres promotion in store forn  at this point in the story jim cornick stopped to drink and a low unconscious humming came from anne in her distant corner the faint melody continued more or less when the conversation between the sailor and the lovedays was renewed  we heard afore that the victory was near knocked to pieces said the miller  knocked to pieces  youd say so if so be you could see her  gad her sides be battered like an old penny piece the shot be still sticking in her wales and her sails be like so many clapnets we have run all the way home under jury topmasts and as for her decks you may swab wi hot water and you may swab wi cold but theres the bloodstains and there theyll bide     the capn had a narrow escape like many o the resta shot shaved his ankle like a razor  you should have seen that mans face in the het o battle his features were as if theyd been cast in steel  we rather expected a letter from bob before this  well said jim cornick with a smile of toleration you must make allowances  the truth ot is hes engaged just now at portsmouth like a good many of the rest from our ship     tis a very nice young woman that hes a courting of and i make no doubt that shell be an excellent wife for him  ah said mrs loveday in a warning tone  courtingwife said the miller  they instinctively looked towards anne  anne had started as if shaken by an invisible hand and a thick mist of doubt seemed to obscure the intelligence of her eyes  this was but for two or three moments  very pale she arose and went right up to the seaman  john gently tried to intercept her but she passed him by  do you speak of robert loveday as courting a wife she asked without the least betrayal of emotion  i didnt see you miss replied cornick turning  yes your brother hev his eye on a wife and he deserves one  i hope you dont mind  not in the least she said with a stage laugh  i am interested naturally  and what is she  a very nice young masterbakers daughter honey  a very wise choice of the young mans  is she fair or dark  her hair is rather light  i like light hair and her name  her name is caroline  but can it be that my story hurts ye  if so  yes yes said john interposing anxiously  we dont care for more just at this moment  we do care for more said anne vehemently  tell it all sailor that is a very pretty name caroline  when are they going to be married  i dont know as how the day is settled answered jim even now scarcely conscious of the devastation he was causing in one fair breast  but from the rate the courting is scudding along at i should say it wont be long first  if you see him when you go back give him my best wishes she lightly said as she moved away  and she added with solemn bitterness say that i am glad to hear he is making such good use of the first days of his escape from the valley of the shadow of death  she went away expressing indifference by audibly singing in the distance     shall we go dance the round the round the round       shall we go dance the round  your sister is lively at the news observed jim cornick  yes murmured john gloomily as he gnawed his lower lip and kept his eyes fixed on the fire  well continued the man from the victory i wont say that your brothers intended hant got some ballast which is very lucky forn as he might have picked up with a girl without a single copper nail  to be sure there was a time we had when we got into port  it was open house for us all  and after mentally regarding the scene for a few seconds jim emptied his cup and rose to go  the miller was saying some last words to him outside the house annes voice had hardly ceased singing upstairs john was standing by the fireplace and mrs loveday was crossing the room to join her daughter whose manner had given her some uneasiness when a noise came from above the ceiling as of some heavy body falling  mrs loveday rushed to the staircase saying ah i feared something and she was followed by john  when they entered annes room which they both did almost at one moment they found her lying insensible upon the floor  the trumpetmajor his lips tightly closed lifted her in his arms and laid her upon the bed after which he went back to the door to give room to her mother who was bending over the girl with some hartshorn  presently mrs loveday looked up and said to him she is only in a faint john and her colour is coming back  now leave her to me i will be downstairs in a few minutes and tell you how she is  john left the room  when he gained the lower apartment his father was standing by the chimneypiece the sailor having gone  the trumpetmajor went up to the fire and grasping the edge of the high chimneyshelf stood silent  did i hear a noise when i went out asked the elder in a tone of misgiving  yes you did said john  it was she but her mother says she is better now  father he added impetuously bob is a worthless blockhead  if there had been any good in him he would have been drowned years ago  john johnnot too fast said the miller  thats a hard thing to say of your brother and you ought to be ashamed of it  well he tries me more than i can bear  good god what can a man be made of to go on as he does  why didnt he come home or if he couldnt get leave why didnt he write  tis scandalous of him to serve a woman like that  gently gently  the chap hev done his duty as a sailor and though there might have been something between him and anne her mother in talking it over with me has said many times that she couldnt think of their marrying till bob had settled down in business with me  folks that gain victories must have a little liberty allowed em  look at the admiral himself for that matter  john continued looking at the red coals till hearing mrs lovedays foot on the staircase he went to meet her  she is better said mrs loveday but she wont come down again to day  could john have heard what the poor girl was moaning to herself at that moment as she lay writhing on the bed he would have doubted her mothers assurance  if he had been dead i could have borne it but this i cannot bear     xxxvi  derriman sees chances   meanwhile sailor cornick had gone on his way as far as the forking roads where he met festus derriman on foot  the latter attracted by the seamans dress and by seeing him come from the mill at once accosted him  jim with the greatest readiness fell into conversation and told the same story as that he had related at the mill  bob loveday going to be married repeated festus  you all seem struck of a heap wi that  no i never heard news that pleased me more  when cornick was gone festus instead of passing straight on halted on the little bridge and meditated  bob being now interested elsewhere would probably not resent the siege of annes heart by another there could at any rate be no further possibility of that looming duel which had troubled the yeomans mind ever since his horseplay on anne at the house on the down  to march into the mill and propose to mrs loveday for anne before johns interest could revive in her was to this heros thinking excellent discretion  the day had already begun to darken when he entered and the cheerful fire shone red upon the floor and walls  mrs loveday received him alone and asked him to take a seat by the chimneycorner a little of the old hankering for him as a soninlaw having permanently remained with her  your servant mrs loveday he said and i will tell you at once what i come for  you will say that i take time by the forelock when i inform you that it is to push on my longwishedfor alliance wi your daughter as i believe she is now a free woman again  thank you mr derriman said the mother placably  but she is ill at present  ill mention it to her when she is better  ask her to alter her cruel cruel resolves against me on the score ofof my consuming passion for her  in short continued festus dropping his parlour language in his warmth ill tell thee what dame loveday i want the maid and must have her  mrs loveday replied that that was very plain speaking  well tis  but bob has given her up  he never meant to marry her ill tell you mrs loveday what i have never told a soul before  i was standing upon budmouth quay on that very day in last september that bob set sail and i heard him say to his brother john that he gave your daughter up  then it was very unmannerly of him to trifle with her so said mrs loveday warmly  who did he give her up to  festus replied with hesitation he gave her up to john  to john  how could he give her up to a man already over head and ears in love with that actress woman  o  you surprise me  which actress is it  that miss johnson  anne tells me that he loves her hopelessly  festus arose  miss johnson seemed suddenly to acquire high value as a sweetheart at this announcement  he had himself felt a nameless attractiveness in her and john had done likewise  john crossed his path in all possible ways  before the yeoman had replied somebody opened the door and the firelight shone upon the uniform of the person they discussed  festus nodded on recognizing him wished mrs loveday good evening and went out precipitately  so bob told you he meant to break off with my anne when he went away mrs loveday remarked to the trumpetmajor  i wish i had known of it before  john appeared disturbed at the sudden charge  he murmured that he could not deny it and then hastily turned from her and followed derriman whom he saw before him on the bridge  derriman he shouted  festus started and looked round  well trumpetmajor he said blandly  when will you have sense enough to mind your own business and not come here telling things you have heard by sneaking behind peoples backs demanded john hotly  if you cant learn in any other way i shall have to pull your ears again as i did the other day  you pull my ears  how can you tell that lie when you know twas somebody else pulled em  o no no  i pulled your ears and thrashed you in a mild way  youll swear to it  surely twas another man  it was in the parlour at the publichouse you were almost in the dark and john added a few details as to the particular blows which amounted to proof itself  then i heartily ask your pardon for saying twas a lie cried festus advancing with extended hand and a genial smile  sure if i had known twas you i wouldnt have insulted you by denying it  that was why you didnt challenge me then  that was it  i wouldnt for the world have hurt your nice sense of honour by letting ee go unchallenged if i had known  and now you see unfortunately i cant mend the mistake  so long a time has passed since it happened that the heat of my temper is gone off  i couldnt oblige ee try how i might for i am not a man trumpetmajor that can butcher in cold bloodno not i nor you neither from what i know of ee  so willynilly we must fain let it pass eh  we must i suppose said john smiling grimly  who did you think i was then that night when i boxed you all round  no dont press me replied the yeoman  i cant reveal it would be disgracing myself to show how very wide of the truth the mockery of wine was able to lead my senses  we will let it be buried in eternal mixens of forgetfulness  as you wish said the trumpetmajor loftily  but if you ever should think you knew it was me why you know where to find me  and loveday walked away  the instant that he was gone festus shook his fist at the evening star which happened to lie in the same direction as that taken by the dragoon  now for my revenge  duels  lifelong disgrace to me if ever i fight with a man of blood below my own  there are other remedies for upper class souls    matildathats my way  festus strode along till he reached the hall where cripplestraw appeared gazing at him from under the arch of the porters lodge  derriman dashed open the entrancehurdle with such violence that the whole row of them fell flat in the mud  mercy maister festus said cripplestraw  surely i says to myself when i see ye acoming surely maister festus is fuming like that because theres no chance of the enemy coming this year after all  crrripplestraw  i have been wounded to the heart replied derriman with a lurid brow  and the man yet lives and you wants yer horsepistols instantly certainly maister f  no cripplestraw not my pistols but my newcut clothes my heavy gold seals my silvertopped cane and my buckles that cost more money than he ever saw  yes i must tell somebody and ill tell you because theres no other fool near  he loves her heart and soul  hes poor shes tip top genteel and not rich  i am rich by comparison  ill court the pretty playactress and win her before his eyes  playactress maister derriman  yes  i saw her this very day met her by accident and spoke to her shes still in the townperhaps because of him  i can meet her at any hour of the day  but i dont mean to marry her not i  i will court her for my pastime and to annoy him  it will be all the more death to him that i dont want her  then perhaps he will say to me you have taken my one ewe lambmeaning that i am the king and hes the poor man as in the church verse and hell beg for mercy when tis too lateunless meanwhile i shall have tired of my new toy  saddle the horse cripplestraw tomorrow at ten  full of this resolve to scourge john loveday to the quick through his passion for miss johnson festus came out booted and spurred at the time appointed and set off on his morning ride  miss johnsons theatrical engagement having long ago terminated she would have left the royal wateringplace with the rest of the visitors had not matrimonial hopes detained her there  these had nothing whatever to do with john loveday as may be imagined but with a stout staid boat builder in cove row by the quay who had shown much interest in her impersonations  unfortunately this substantial man had not been quite so attentive since the end of the season as his previous manner led her to expect and it was a great pleasure to the lady to see mr derriman leaning over the harbour bridge with his eyes fixed upon her as she came towards it after a stroll past her elderly wooers house  od take it maam you didnt tell me when i saw you last that the tooting man with the blue jacket and lace was yours devoted began festus  who do you mean  in matildas everchanging emotional interests john loveday was a stale and unprofitable personality  why that trumpetmajor man  o  what of him  come he loves you and you know it maam  she knew at any rate how to take the current when it served  so she glanced at festus folded her lips meaningly and nodded  ive come to cut him out  she shook her head it being unsafe to speak till she knew a little more of the subject  what said festus reddening do you mean to say that you think of him seriouslyyou who might look so much higher  constant dropping will wear away a stone and you should only hear his pleading  his handsome face is impressive and his manners areo so genteel  i am not rich i am in short a poor lady of decayed family who has nothing to boast of but my blood and ancestors and they wont find a body in food and clothingi hold the world but as the world derrimanioa stage where every man must play a part and mine a sad one  she dropped her eyes thoughtfully and sighed  we will talk of this said festus much affected  let us walk to the lookout  she made no objection and said as they turned that way mr derriman a long time ago i found something belonging to you but i have never yet remembered to return it  and she drew from her bosom the paper which anne had dropped in the meadow when eluding the grasp of festus on that summer day  zounds i smell fresh meat cried festus when he had looked it over tis in my uncles writing and tis what i heard him singing on the day the french didnt come and afterwards saw him marking in the road  tis something hes got hid away  give me the paper theres a dear tis worth sterling gold  halves then said matilda tenderly  gad yesanything replied festus blazing into a smile for she had looked up in her best new manner at the possibility that he might be worth the winning  they went up the steps to the summit of the cliff and dwindled over it against the sky     xxxvii  reaction   there was no letter from bob though december had passed and the new year was two weeks old  his movements were however pretty accurately registered in the papers which john still brought but which anne no longer read  during the second week in december the victory sailed for sheerness and on the 9th of the following january the public funeral of lord nelson took place in st pauls  then there came a meagre line addressed to the family in general  bobs new portsmouth attachment was not mentioned but he told them he had been one of the eightandforty seamen who walked twoandtwo in the funeral procession and that captain hardy had borne the banner of emblems on the same occasion  the crew was soon to be paid off at chatham when he thought of returning to portsmouth for a few days to see a valued friend after that he should come home  but the spring advanced without bringing him and john watched anne garlands desolation with augmenting desire to do something towards consoling her  the old feelings so religiously held in check were stimulated to rebelliousness though they did not show themselves in any direct manner as yet  the miller in the meantime who seldom interfered in such matters was observed to look meaningly at anne and the trumpetmajor from day to day and byandby he spoke privately to john  his words were short and to the point anne was very melancholy she had thought too much of bob  now twas plain that they had lost him for many years to come  well he had always felt that of the two he would rather john married her  now john might settle down there and succeed where bob had failed  so if you could get her my sonny to think less of him and more of thyself it would be a good thing for all  an inward excitement had risen in john but he suppressed it and said firmly  fairness to bob before everything  he hev forgot her and theres an end ont  shes not forgot him  well well think it over  this discourse was the cause of his penning a letter to his brother  he begged for a distinct statement whether as john at first supposed bobs verbal renunciation of anne on the quay had been only a momentary ebullition of friendship which it would be cruel to take literally or whether as seemed now it had passed from a hasty resolve to a standing purpose persevered in for his own pleasure with not a care for the result on poor anne  john waited anxiously for the answer but no answer came and the silence seemed even more significant than a letter of assurance could have been of his absolution from further support to a claim which bob himself had so clearly renounced  thus it happened that paternal pressure brotherly indifference and his own released impulse operated in one delightful direction and the trumpetmajor once more approached anne as in the old time  but it was not till she had been left to herself for a full five months and the bluebells and raggedrobins of the following year were again making themselves common to the rambling eye that he directly addressed her  she was tying up a group of tall flowering plants in the garden she knew that he was behind her but she did not turn  she had subsided into a placid dignity which enabled her when watched to perform any little action with seeming composurevery different from the flutter of her inexperienced days  are you never going to turn round he at length asked goodhumouredly  she then did turn and looked at him for a moment without speaking a certain suspicion looming in her eyes as if suggested by his perceptible want of ease  how like summer it is getting to feel is it not she said  john admitted that it was getting to feel like summer and bending his gaze upon her with an earnestness which no longer left any doubt of his subject went on to ask  have you ever in these last weeks thought of how it used to be between us  she replied quickly o john you shouldnt begin that again  i am almost another woman now  well thats all the more reason why i should isnt it  anne looked thoughtfully to the other end of the garden faintly shaking her head i dont quite see it like that she returned  you feel yourself quite free dont you  quite free she said instantly and with proud distinctness her eyes fell and she repeated more slowly quite free  then her thoughts seemed to fly from herself to him  but you are not  i am not  miss johnson  othat woman  you know as well as i that was all makeup and that i never for a moment thought of her  i had an idea you were acting but i wasnt sure  well thats nothing now  anne i want to relieve your life to cheer you in some way to make some amends for my brothers bad conduct  if you cannot love me liking will be well enough  i have thought over every side of it so many timesfor months have i been thinking it overand i am at last sure that i do right to put it to you in this way that i dont wrong bob i am quite convinced  as far as he is concerned we be both free  had i not been sure of that i would never have spoken father wants me to take on the mill and it will please him if you can give me one little hope it will make the house go on altogether better if you can think o me  you are generous and good john she said as a big round tear bowled helterskelter down her face and hatstrings  i am not that i fear i am quite the opposite he said without looking at her  it would be all gain to me  but you have not answered my question  she lifted her eyes  john i cannot she said with a cheerless smile positively i cannot  will you make me a promise  what is it  i want you to promise first  yes it is dreadfully unreasonable she added in a mild distress  but do promise  john by this time seemed to have a feeling that it was all up with him for the present  i promise he said listlessly  it is that you wont speak to me about this for ever so long she returned with emphatic kindliness  very good he replied very good  dear anne you dont think i have been unmanly or unfair in starting this anew  anne looked into his face without a smile  you have been perfectly natural she murmured  and so i think have i  john mournfully you will not avoid me for this or be afraid of me  i will not break my word  i will not worry you any more  thank you john  you need not have said worry it isnt that  well i am very blind and stupid  i have been hurting your heart all the time without knowing it  it is my fate i suppose  men who love women the very best always blunder and give more pain than those who love them less  anne laid one of her hands on the other as she softly replied looking down at them no one loves me as well as you john nobody in the world is so worthy to be loved and yet i cannot anyhow love you rightly  and lifting her eyes but i do so feel for you that i will try as hard as i can to think about you  well that is something he said smiling  you say i must not speak about it again for ever so long how long  now thats not fair anne retorted going down the garden and leaving him alone  about a week passed  then one afternoon the miller walked up to anne indoors a weighty topic being expressed in his tread  i was so glad my honey he began with a knowing smile to see that from the millwindow last week  he flung a nod in the direction of the garden  anne innocently inquired what it could be  jack and you in the garden together he continued laying his hand gently on her shoulder and stroking it  it would so please me my dear little girl if you could get to like him better than that weathercock master bob  anne shook her head not in forcible negation but to imply a kind of neutrality  cant you  come now said the miller  she threw back her head with a little laugh of grievance  how you all beset me she expostulated  it makes me feel very wicked in not obeying you and being faithfulfaithful to  but she could not trust that side of the subject to words  why would it please you so much she asked  john is as steady and staunch a fellow as ever blowed a trumpet  ive always thought you might do better with him than with bob  now ive a plan for taking him into the mill and letting him have a comfortable time ot after his long knocking about but so much depends upon you that i must bide a bit till i see what your pleasure is about the poor fellow mind my dear i dont want to force ye i only just ask ye  anne meditatively regarded the miller from under her shady eyelids the fingers of one hand playing a silent tattoo on her bosom  i dont know what to say to you she answered brusquely and went away  but these discourses were not without their effect upon the extremely conscientious mind of anne  they were moreover much helped by an incident which took place one evening in the autumn of this year when john came to tea  anne was sitting on a low stool in front of the fire her hands clasped across her knee  john loveday had just seated himself on a chair close behind her and mrs loveday was in the act of filling the teapot from the kettle which hung in the chimney exactly above anne the kettle slipped forward suddenly whereupon john jumped from the chair and put his own two hands over annes just in time to shield them and the precious knee she clasped from the jet of scalding water which had directed itself upon that point  the accidental overflow was instantly checked by mrs loveday but what had come was received by the devoted trumpetmajor on the back of his hands  anne who had hardly been aware that he was behind her started up like a person awakened from a trance  what have you done to yourself poor john to keep it off me she cried looking at his hands  john reddened emotionally at her words it is a bit of a scald thats all he replied drawing a finger across the back of one hand and bringing off the skin by the touch  you are scalded painfully and i not at all  she gazed into his kind face as she had never gazed there before and when mrs loveday came back with oil and other liniments for the wound anne would let nobody dress it but herself  it seemed as if her coyness had all gone and when she had done all that lay in her power she still sat by him  at his departure she said what she had never said to him in her life before come again soon  in short that impulsive act of devotion the last of a series of the same tenor had been the added drop which finally turned the wheel johns character deeply impressed her  his determined steadfastness to his lode star won her admiration the more especially as that star was herself  she began to wonder more and more how she could have so persistently held out against his advances before bob came home to renew girlish memories which had by that time got considerably weakened  could she not after all please the miller and try to listen to john  by so doing she would make a worthy man happy the only sacrifice being at worst that of her unworthy self whose future was no longer valuable  as for bob the woman is to be pitied who loves him she reflected indignantly and persuaded herself that whoever the woman might be she was not anne garland  after this there was something of recklessness and something of pleasantry in the young girls manner of making herself an example of the triumph of pride and common sense over memory and sentiment  her attitude had been epitomized in her defiant singing at the time she learnt that bob was not leal and true  john as was inevitable came again almost immediately drawn thither by the sun of her first smile on him and the words which had accompanied it  and now instead of going off to her little pursuits upstairs downstairs across the room in the corner or to any place except where he happened to be as had been her custom hitherto she remained seated near him returning interesting answers to his general remarks and at every opportunity letting him know that at last he had found favour in her eyes  the day was fine and they went out of doors where anne endeavoured to seat herself on the sloping stone of the windowsill  how good you have become lately said john standing over her and smiling in the sunlight which blazed against the wall  i fancy you have stayed at home this afternoon on my account  perhaps i have she said gaily     do whatever we may for him dame we cannot do too much       for hes one that has guarded our land  and he has done more than that he has saved me from a dreadful scalding  the back of your hand will not be well for a long time john will it  he held out his hand to regard its condition and the next natural thing was to take hers  there was a glow upon his face when he did it his star was at last on a fair way towards the zenith after its long and weary declination  the least penetrating eye could have perceived that anne had resolved to let him woo possibly in her temerity to let him win  whatever silent sorrow might be locked up in her it was by this time thrust a long way down from the light  i want you to go somewhere with me if you will he said still holding her hand  yes  where is it  he pointed to a distant hillside which hitherto green had within the last few days begun to show scratches of white on its face  up there he said  i see little figures of men moving about  what are they doing  cutting out a huge picture of the king on horseback in the earth of the hill  the kings head is to be as big as our millpond and his body as big as this garden he and the horse will cover more than an acre  when shall we go  whenever you please said she  john cried mrs loveday from the front door  heres a friend come for you  john went round and found his trusty lieutenant trumpeter buck waiting for him  a letter had come to the barracks for john in his absence and the trumpeter who was going for a walk had brought it along with him buck then entered the mill to discuss if possible a mug of last years mead with the miller and john proceeded to read his letter anne being still round the corner where he had left her  when he had read a few words he turned as pale as a sheet but he did not move and perused the writing to the end  afterwards he laid his elbow against the wall and put his palm to his head thinking with painful intentness  then he took himself vigorously in hand as it were and gradually became natural again  when he parted from anne to go home with buck she noticed nothing different in him  in barracks that evening he read the letter again  it was from bob and the agitating contents were these     dear johni have drifted off from writing till the present time    because i have not been clear about my feelings but i have discovered    them at last and can say beyond doubt that i mean to be faithful to    my dearest anne after all  the fact is john ive got into a bit of    a scrape and ive a secret to tell you about it which must go no    further on any account  on landing last autumn i fell in with a    young woman and we got rather warm as folks do in short we liked    one another well enough for a while  but i have got into shoal water    with her and have found her to be a terrible takein  nothing in her    at allno sense no niceness all tantrums and empty noise john    though she seemed monstrous clever at first  so my heart comes back    to its old anchorage  i hope my return to faithfulness will make no    difference to you  but as you showed by your looks at our parting    that you should not accept my offer to give her upmade in too much    haste as i have since foundi feel that you wont mind that i have    returned to the path of honour  i dare not write to anne as yet and    please do not let her know a word about the other young woman or    there will be the devil to pay  i shall come home and make all things    right please god  in the meantime i should take it as a kindness    john if you would keep a brotherly eye upon anne and guide her mind    back to me  i shall die of sorrow if anybody sets her against me for    my hopes are getting bound up in her again quite strong  hoping you    are jovial as times go i amyour affectionate brother     robert  when the cold daylight fell upon johns face as he dressed himself next morning the incipient yesterdays wrinkle in his forehead had become permanently graven there  he had resolved for the sake of that only brother whom he had nursed as a baby instructed as a child and protected and loved always to pause in his procedure for the present and at least do nothing to hinder bobs restoration to favour if a genuine even though temporarily smothered love for anne should still hold possession of him  but having arranged to take her to see the excavated figure of the king he started for overcombe during the day as if nothing had occurred to check the smooth course of his love     xxxviii  a delicate situation   i am ready to go said anne as soon as he arrived  he paused as if taken aback by her readiness and replied with much uncertainty would itwouldnt it be better to put it off till there is less sun  the very slightest symptom of surprise arose in her as she rejoined but the weather may change or had we better not go at all  o noit was only a thought  we will start at once  and along the vale they went john keeping himself about a yard from her right hand  when the third field had been crossed they came upon halfa dozen little boys at play  why dont he clasp her to his side like a man said the biggest and rudest boy  why dont he clasp her to his side like a man echoed all the rude smaller boys in a chorus  the trumpetmajor turned and after some running succeeded in smacking two of them with his switch returning to anne breathless  i am ashamed they should have insulted you so he said blushing for her  they said no harm poor boys she replied reproachfully  poor john was dumb with perception  the gentle hint upon which he would have eagerly spoken only one short day ago was now like fire to his wound  they presently came to some steppingstones across a brook  john crossed first without turning his head and anne just lifting the skirt of her dress crossed behind him  when they had reached the other side a village girl and a young shepherd approached the brink to cross  anne stopped and watched them  the shepherd took a hand of the young girl in each of his own and walked backward over the stones facing her and keeping her upright by his grasp both of them laughing as they went  what are you staying for miss garland asked john  i was only thinking how happy they are she said quietly and withdrawing her eyes from the tender pair she turned and followed him not knowing that the seeming sound of a passing bumblebee was a suppressed groan from john  when they reached the hill they found forty navvies at work removing the dark sod so as to lay bare the chalk beneath  the equestrian figure that their shovels were forming was scarcely intelligible to john and anne now they were close and after pacing from the horses head down his breast to his hoof back by way of the kings bridlearm past the bridge of his nose and into his cockedhat anne said that she had had enough of it and stepped out of the chalk clearing upon the grass  the trumpetmajor had remained all the time in a melancholy attitude within the rowel of his majestys right spur  my shoes are caked with chalk she said as they walked downwards again and she drew back her dress to look at them  how can i get some of it cleared off  if you was to wipe them in the long grass there said john pointing to a spot where the blades were rank and dense some of it would come off having said this he walked on with religious firmness  anne raked her little feet on the right side on the left side over the toe and behind the heel but the tenacious chalk held its own  panting with her exertion she gave it up and at length overtook him  i hope it is right now he said looking gingerly over his shoulder  no indeed said she  i wanted some assistancesome one to steady me  it is so hard to stand on one foot and wipe the other without support  i was in danger of toppling over and so gave it up  merciful stars what an opportunity thought the poor fellow while she waited for him to offer help but his lips remained closed and she went on with a pouting smile  you seem in such a hurry  why are you in such a hurry  after all the fine things you have said aboutabout caring so much for me and all that you wont stop for anything  it was too much for john  upon my heart and life my dea he began here bobs letter crackled warningly in his waistcoat pocket as he laid his hand asseveratingly upon his breast and he became suddenly scaled up to dumbness and gloom as before  when they reached home anne sank upon a stool outside the door fatigued with her excursion  her first act was to try to pull off her shoeit was a difficult matter but john stood beating with his switch the leaves of the creeper on the wall  motherdavidmolly or somebodydo come and help me pull off these dirty shoes she cried aloud at last  nobody helps me in anything  i am very sorry said john coming towards her with incredible slowness and an air of unutterable depression  o i can do without you  david is best she returned as the old man approached and removed the obnoxious shoes in a trice  anne was amazed at this sudden change from devotion to crass indifference  on entering her room she flew to the glass almost expecting to learn that some extraordinary change had come over her pretty countenance rendering her intolerable for evermore  but it was if anything fresher than usual on account of the exercise  well she said retrospectively  for the first time since their acqaintance she had this week encouraged him and for the first time he had shown that encouragement was useless  but perhaps he does not clearly understand she added serenely  when he next came it was to her surprise to bring her newspapers now for some time discontinued  as soon as she saw them she said i do not care for newspapers  the shipping news is very full and long today though the print is rather small  i take no further interest in the shipping news she replied with cold dignity  she was sitting by the window inside the table and hence when in spite of her negations he deliberately unfolded the paper and began to read about the royal navy she could hardly rise and go away  with a stoical mien he read on to the end of the report bringing out the name of bobs ship with tremendous force  no she said at last ill hear no more  let me read to you  the trumpetmajor sat down  anne turned to the military news delivering every detail with much apparent enthusiasm  thats the subject i like she said fervently  butbut bob is in the navy now and will most likely rise to be an officer  and then  what is there like the army she interrupted  there is no smartness about sailors  they waddle like ducks and they only fight stupid battles that no one can form any idea of  there is no science nor stratagem in seafightsnothing more than what you see when two rams run their heads together in a field to knock each other down  but in military battles there is such art and such splendour and the men are so smart particularly the horsesoldiers  o i shall never forget what gallant men you all seemed when you came and pitched your tents on the downs  i like the cavalry better than anything i know and the dragoons the best of the cavalryand the trumpeters the best of the dragoons  o if it had but come a little sooner moaned john within him  he replied as soon as he could regain selfcommand i am glad bob is in the navy at lasthe is so much more fitted for that than the merchantserviceso brave by nature ready for any daring deed  i have heard ever so much more about his doings on board the victory  captain hardy took special notice that when he  i dont want to know anything more about it said anne impatiently of course sailors fight theres nothing else to do in a ship since you cant run away  you may as well fight and be killed as be killed not fighting  still it is his character to be careless of himself where the honour of his country is concerned john pleaded  if you had only known him as a boy you would own it  he would always risk his own life to save anybody elses  once when a cottage was afire up the lane he rushed in for a baby although he was only a boy himself and he had the narrowest escape  we have got his hat now with the hole burnt in it  shall i get it and show it to you  noi dont wish it  it has nothing to do with me  but as he persisted in his course towards the door she added ah you are leaving because i am in your way  you want to be alone while you read the paperi will go at once  i did not see that i was interrupting you and she rose as if to retreat  no no  i would rather be interrupted by you thano miss garland excuse me  ill just speak to father in the mill now i am here  it is scarcely necessary to state that anne whose unquestionable gentility amid somewhat homely surroundings has been many times insisted on in the course of this history was usually the reverse of a woman with a comingon disposition but whether from pique at his manner or from wilful adherence to a course rashly resolved on or from coquettish maliciousness in reaction from long depression or from any other thingso it was that she would not let him go  trumpetmajor she said recalling him  yes he replied timidly  the bow of my capribbon has come untied has it not  she turned and fixed her bewitching glance upon him  the bow was just over her forehead or more precisely at the point where the organ of comparison merges in that of benevolence according to the phrenological theory of gall  john thus brought to endeavoured to look at the bow in a skimming duckanddrake fashion so as to avoid dipping his own glance as far as to the plane of his interrogators eyes it is untied he said drawing back a little  she came nearer and asked will you tie it for me please  as there was no help for it he nerved himself and assented  as her head only reached to his fourth button she necessarily looked up for his convenience and john began fumbling at the bow  try as he would it was impossible to touch the ribbon without getting his finger tips mixed with the curls of her forehead  your hand shakesah you have been walking fast she said  yesyes  have you almost done it  she inquiringly directed her gaze upward through his fingers  nonot yet he faltered in a warm sweat of emotion his heart going like a flail  then be quick please  yes i will miss garland  bbbob is a very good fel  not that mans name to me she interrupted  john was silent instantly and nothing was to be heard but the rustling of the ribbon till his hands once more blundered among the curls and then touched her forehead  o good god ejaculated the trumpetmajor in a whisper turning away hastily to the cornercupboard and resting his face upon his hand  whats the matter john said she  i cant do it  what  tie your capribbon  why not  because you are sobecause i am clumsy and never could tie a bow  you are clumsy indeed answered anne and went away  after this she felt injured for it seemed to show that he rated her happiness as of meaner value than bobs since he had persisted in his idea of giving bob another chance when she had implied that it was her wish to do otherwise  could miss johnson have anything to do with his firmness  an opportunity of testing him in this direction occurred some days later  she had been up the village and met john at the milldoor  have you heard the news  matilda johnson is going to be married to young derriman  anne stood with her back to the sun and as he faced her his features were searchingly exhibited  there was no change whatever in them unless it were that a certain light of interest kindled by her question turned to complete and blank indifference  well as times go it is not a bad match for her he said with a phlegm which was hardly that of a lover  john on his part was beginning to find these temptations almost more than he could bear  but being quartered so near to his fathers house it was unnatural not to visit him especially when at any moment the regiment might be ordered abroad and a separation of years ensue and as long as he went there he could not help seeing her  the year changed from green to gold and from gold to grey but little change came over the house of loveday  during the last twelve months bob had been occasionally heard of as upholding his countrys honour in denmark the west indies gibraltar malta and other places about the globe till the family received a short letter stating that he had arrived again at portsmouth  at portsmouth bob seemed disposed to remain for though some time elapsed without further intelligence the gallant seaman never appeared at overcombe  then on a sudden john learnt that bobs longtalkedof promotion for signal services rendered was to be an accomplished fact  the trumpetmajor at once walked off to overcombe and reached the village in the early afternoon  not one of the family was in the house at the moment and john strolled onwards over the hill towards casterbridge without much thought of direction till lifting his eyes he beheld anne garland wandering about with a little basket upon her arm  at first john blushed with delight at the sweet vision but recalled by his conscience the blush of delight was at once mangled and slain  he looked for a means of retreat  but the field was open and a soldier was a conspicuous object there was no escaping her  it was kind of you to come she said with an inviting smile  it was quite by accident he answered with an indifferent laugh  i thought you was at home  anne blushed and said nothing and they rambled on together  in the middle of the field rose a fragment of stone wall in the form of a gable known as faringdon ruin and when they had reached it john paused and politely asked her if she were not a little tired with walking so far  no particular reply was returned by the young lady but they both stopped and anne seated herself on a stone which had fallen from the ruin to the ground  a church once stood here observed john in a matteroffact tone  yes i have often shaped it out in my mind she returned  here where i sit must have been the altar  true this standing bit of wall was the chancel end  anne had been adding up her little studies of the trumpetmajors character and was surprised to find how the brightness of that character increased in her eyes with each examination  a kindly and gentle sensation was again aroused in her  here was a neglected heroic man who loving her to distraction deliberately doomed himself to pensive shade to avoid even the appearance of standing in a brothers way  if the altar stood here hundreds of people have been made man and wife just there in past times she said with calm deliberateness throwing a little stone on a spot about a yard westward  john annihilated another tender burst and replied yes this field used to be a village  my grandfather could call to mind when there were houses here  but the squire pulled em down because poor folk were an eyesore to him  do you know john what you once asked me to do she continued not accepting the digression and turning her eyes upon him  in what sort of way  in the matter of my future life and yours  i am afraid i dont  john loveday  he turned his back upon her for a moment that she might not see his face  ahi do remember he said at last in a dry small repressed voice  wellneed i say more  isnt it sufficient  it would be sufficient answered the unhappy man  but  she looked up with a reproachful smile and shook her head  that summer she went on you asked me ten times if you asked me once  i am older now much more of a woman you know and my opinion is changed about some people especially about one  o anne anne he burst out as racked between honour and desire he snatched up her hand  the next moment it fell heavily to her lap  he had absolutely relinquished it halfway to his lips  i have been thinking lately he said with preternaturally sudden calmness that men of the military profession ought not to mought to be like st paul i mean  fie john pretending religion she said sternly  it isnt that at all  its bob  yes cried the miserable trumpetmajor  i have had a letter from him today he pulled out a sheet of paper from his breast  thats it hes promotedhes a lieutenant and appointed to a sloop that only cruises on our own coast so that hell be at home on leave half his timehell be a gentleman some day and worthy of you  he threw the letter into her lap and drew back to the other side of the gablewall  anne jumped up from her seat flung away the letter without looking at it and went hastily on  john did not attempt to overtake her  picking up the letter he followed in her wake at a distance of a hundred yards  but though anne had withdrawn from his presence thus precipitately she never thought more highly of him in her life than she did five minutes afterwards when the excitement of the moment had passed  she saw it all quite clearly and his selfsacrifice impressed her so much that the effect was just the reverse of what he had been aiming to produce  the more he pleaded for bob the more her perverse generosity pleaded for john  today the crisis had comewith what results she had not foreseen  as soon as the trumpetmajor reached the nearest penandink he flung himself into a seat and wrote wildly to bob     dear roberti write these few lines to let you know that if you    want anne garland you must come at onceyou must come instantly and    posthasteor she will be gone  somebody else wants her and she    wants him  it is your last chance in the opinion of     your faithful brother and wellwisher    john     psglad to hear of your promotion  tell me the day and ill meet    the coach     xxxix  bob loveday struts up and down   one night about a week later two men were walking in the dark along the turnpike road towards overcombe one of them with a bag in his hand  now said the taller of the two the squareness of whose shoulders signified that he wore epaulettes now you must do the best you can for yourself bob  i have done all i can but thhast thy work cut out i can tell thee  i wouldnt have run such a risk for the world said the other in a tone of ingenuous contrition  but thoust see jack i didnt think there was any danger knowing you was taking care of her and keeping my place warm for me  i didnt hurry myself thats true but thinks i if i get this promotion i am promised i shall naturally have leave and then ill go and see em all  gad i shouldnt have been here now but for your letter  you little think what risks youve run said his brother  however try to make up for lost time  all right  and whatever you do jack dont say a word about this other girl  hang the girli was a great fool i know still it is over now and i am come to my senses  i suppose anne never caught a capful of wind from that quarter  she knows all about it said john seriously  knows  by george then im ruined said bob standing stockstill in the road as if he meant to remain there all night  thats what i meant by saying it would be a hard battle for ee returned john with the same quietness as before  bob sighed and moved on  i dont deserve that woman he cried passionately thumping his three upper ribs with his fist  ive thought as much myself observed john with a dryness which was almost bitter  but it depends on how thoust behave in future  john said bob taking his brothers hand ill be a new man  i solemnly swear by that eternal milestone staring at me there that ill never look at another woman with the thought of marrying her whilst that darling is freeno not if she be a mermaiden of light  its a lucky thing that im slipped in on the quarterdeck it may help me with herhey  it may with her mother i dont think it will make much difference with anne  still it is a good thing and i hope that some day youll command a big ship  bob shook his head  officers are scarce but im afraid my luck wont carry me so far as that  did she ever tell you that she mentioned your name to the king  the seaman stood still again  never he said  how did such a thing as that happen in heavens name  john described in detail and they walked on lost in conjecture  as soon as they entered the house the returned officer of the navy was welcomed with acclamation by his father and david with mild approval by mrs loveday and by anne not at allthat discreet maiden having carefully retired to her own room some time earlier in the evening  bob did not dare to ask for her in any positive manner he just inquired about her health and that was all  why whats the matter with thy face my son said the miller staring david show a light here  and a candle was thrust against bobs cheek where there appeared a jagged streak like the geological remains of a lobster  othats where that rascally frenchmans grenade busted and hit me from the redoubtable you know as i told ee in my letter  not a word  what didnt i tell ee  ah no i meant to but i forgot it  and heres a sort of dint in yer forehead too what do that mean my dear boy said the miller putting his finger in a chasm in bobs skull  that was done in the indies  yes that was rather a troublesome chopa cutlass did it  i should have told ee but i found twould make my letter so long that i put it off and put it off and at last thought it wasnt worth while  john soon rose to take his departure  its all up with me and her you see said bob to him outside the door shes not even going to see me  wait a little said the trumpetmajor  it was easy enough on the night of the arrival in the midst of excitement when blood was warm for anne to be resolute in her avoidance of bob loveday  but in the morning determination is apt to grow invertebrate rules of pugnacity are less easily acted up to and a feeling of live and let live takes possession of the gentle soul  anne had not meant even to sit down to the same breakfasttable with bob but when the rest were assembled and had got some way through the substantial repast which was served at this hour in the millers house anne entered  she came silently as a phantom her eyes cast down her cheeks pale  it was a good long walk from the door to the table and bob made a full inspection of her as she came up to a chair at the remotest corner in the direct rays of the morning light where she dumbly sat herself down  it was altogether different from how she had expected  here was she who had done nothing feeling all the embarrassment and bob who had done the wrong feeling apparently quite at ease  youll speak to bob wont you honey said the miller after a silence to meet bob like this after an absence seemed irregular in his eyes  if he wish me to she replied so addressing the miller that no part scrap or outlying beam whatever of her glance passed near the subject of her remark  hes a lieutenant you know dear said her mother on the same side and hes been dreadfully wounded  oh said anne turning a little towards the false one at which bob felt it to be time for him to put in a spoke for himself  i am glad to see you he said contritely and how do you do  very well thank you  he extended his hand  she allowed him to take hers but only to the extent of a niggardly inch or so  at the same moment she glanced up at him when their eyes met and hers were again withdrawn  the hitch between the two younger members of the household tended to make the breakfast a dull one  bob was so depressed by her unforgiving manner that he could not throw that sparkle into his stories which their substance naturally required and when the meal was over and they went about their different businesses the pair resembled the two dromios in seldom or never being thanks to annes subtle contrivances both in the same room at the same time  this kind of performance repeated itself during several days  at last after dogging her hither and thither leaning with a wrinkled forehead against doorposts taking an oblique view into the room where she happened to be picking up worsted balls and getting no thanks placing a splinter from the victory several bullets from the redoubtable a strip of the flag and other interesting relics carefully labelled upon her table and hearing no more about them than if they had been pebbles from the nearest brook he hit upon a new plan  to avoid him she frequently sat upstairs in a window overlooking the garden  lieutenant loveday carefully dressed himself in a new uniform which he had caused to be sent some days before to dazzle admiring friends but which he had never as yet put on in public or mentioned to a soul  when arrayed he entered the sunny garden and there walked slowly up and down as he had seen nelson and captain hardy do on the quarterdeck but keeping his right shoulder on which his one epaulette was fixed as much towards annes window as possible  but she made no sign though there was not the least question that she saw him  at the end of halfanhour he went in took off his clothes and gave himself up to doubt and the best tobacco  he repeated the programme on the next afternoon and on the next never saying a word within doors about his doings or his notice  meanwhile the results in annes chamber were not uninteresting  she had been looking out on the first day and was duly amazed to see a naval officer in full uniform promenading in the path  finding it to be bob she left the window with a sense that the scene was not for her then from mere curiosity peeped out from behind the curtain  well he was a pretty spectacle she admitted relieved as his figure was by a dense mass of sunny closetrimmed hedge over which nasturtiums climbed in wild luxuriance and if she could care for him one bit which she couldnt his form would have been a delightful study surpassing in interest even its splendour on the memorable day of their visit to the town theatre  she called her mother mrs loveday came promptly  o it is nothing said anne indifferently only that bob has got his uniform  mrs loveday peeped out and raised her hands with delight  and he has not said a word to us about it  what a lovely epaulette  i must call his father  no indeed  as i take no interest in him i shall not let people come into my room to admire him  well you called me said her mother  it was because i thought you liked fine clothes  it is what i dont care for  notwithstanding this assertion she again looked out at bob the next afternoon when his footsteps rustled on the gravel and studied his appearance under all the varying angles of the sunlight as if fine clothes and uniforms were not altogether a matter of indifference  he certainly was a splendid gentlemanly and gallant sailor from end to end of him but then what were a dashing presentment a naval rank and telling scars if a man was ficklehearted  however she peeped on till the fourth day and then she did not peep  the window was open she looked right out and bob knew that he had got a rise to his bait at last  he touched his hat to her keeping his right shoulder forwards and said goodday miss garland with a smile  anne replied goodday with funereal seriousness and the acquaintance thus revived led to the interchange of a few words at suppertime at which mrs loveday nodded with satisfaction  but anne took especial care that he should never meet her alone and to insure this her ingenuity was in constant exercise  there were so many nooks and windings on the millers rambling premises that she could never be sure he would not turn up within a foot of her particularly as his thin shoes were almost noiseless  one fine afternoon she accompanied molly in search of elderberries for making the family wine which was drunk by mrs loveday anne and anybody who could not stand the rougher and stronger liquors provided by the miller  after walking rather a long distance over the down they came to a grassy hollow where elderbushes in knots of twos and threes rose from an uneven bank and hung their heads towards the south black and heavy with bunches of fruit  the charm of fruitgathering to girls is enhanced in the case of elderberries by the inoffensive softness of the leaves boughs and bark which makes getting into the branches easy and pleasant to the most indifferent climbers  anne and molly had soon gathered a basketful and sending the servant home with it anne remained in the bush picking and throwing down bunch by bunch upon the grass  she was so absorbed in her occupation of pulling the twigs towards her and the rustling of their leaves so filled her ears that it was a great surprise when on turning her head she perceived a similar movement to her own among the boughs of the adjoining bush  at first she thought they were disturbed by being partly in contact with the boughs of her bush but in a moment robert lovedays face peered from them at a distance of about a yard from her own  anne uttered a little indignant well recovered herself and went on plucking  bob thereupon went on plucking likewise  i am picking elderberries for your mother said the lieutenant at last humbly  so i see  and i happen to have come to the next bush to yours  so i see but not the reason why  anne was now in the westernmost branches of the bush and bob had leant across into the eastern branches of his  in gathering he swayed towards her back again forward again  i beg pardon he said when a further swing than usual had taken him almost in contact with her  then why do you do it  the wind rocks the bough and the bough rocks me  she expressed by a look her opinion of this statement in the face of the gentlest breeze and bob pursued i am afraid the berries will stain your pretty hands  i wear gloves  ah thats a plan i should never have thought of  can i help you  not at all  you are offended thats what that means  no she said  then will you shake hands  anne hesitated then slowly stretched out her hand which he took at once  that will do she said finding that he did not relinquish it immediately  but as he still held it she pulled the effect of which was to draw bobs swaying person bough and all towards her and herself towards him  i am afraid to let go your hand said that officer for if i do your spar will fly back and you will be thrown upon the deck with great violence  i wish you to let me go  he accordingly did and she flew back but did not by any means fall  it reminds me of the times when i used to be aloft clinging to a yard not much bigger than this treestem in the midatlantic and thinking about you  i could see you in my fancy as plain as i see you now  me or some other woman retorted anne haughtily  no declared bob shaking the bush for emphasis ill protest that i did not think of anybody but you all the time we were dropping down channel all the time we were off cadiz all the time through battles and bombardments  i seemed to see you in the smoke and thinks i if i go to davys locker what will she do  you didnt think that when you landed after trafalgar  well now said the lieutenant in a reasoning tone that was a curious thing  youll hardly believe it maybe but when a man is away from the woman he loves best in the portworld i meanhe can have a sort of temporary feeling for another without disturbing the old one which flows along under the same as ever  i cant believe it and wont said anne firmly  molly now appeared with the empty basket and when it had been filled from the heap on the grass anne went home with her bidding loveday a frigid adieu  the same evening when bob was absent the miller proposed that they should all three go to an upper window of the house to get a distant view of some rockets and illuminations which were to be exhibited in the town and harbour in honour of the king who had returned this year as usual  they accordingly went upstairs to an empty attic placed chairs against the window and put out the light anne sitting in the middle her mother close by and the miller behind smoking  no sign of any pyrotechnic display was visible over the port as yet and mrs loveday passed the time by talking to the miller who replied in monosyllables while this was going on anne fancied that she heard some one approach and presently felt sure that bob was drawing near her in the surrounding darkness but as the other two had noticed nothing she said not a word  all at once the swarthy expanse of southward sky was broken by the blaze of several rockets simultaneously ascending from different ships in the roads  at the very same moment a warm mysterious hand slipped round her own and gave it a gentle squeeze  o dear said anne with a sudden start away  how nervous you are child to be startled by fireworks so far off said mrs loveday  i never saw rockets before murmured anne recovering from her surprise  mrs loveday presently spoke again  i wonder what has become of bob  anne did not reply being much exercised in trying to get her hand away from the one that imprisoned it and whatever the miller thought he kept to himself because it disturbed his smoking to speak  another batch of rockets went up  o i never said anne in a halfsuppressed tone springing in her chair  a second hand had with the rise of the rockets leapt round her waist  poor girl you certainly must have change of scene at this rate said mrs loveday  i suppose i must murmured the dutiful daughter  for some minutes nothing further occurred to disturb annes serenity then a slow quiet ahem came from the obscurity of the apartment  what bob  how long have you been there inquired mrs loveday  not long said the lieutenant coolly  i heard you were all here and crept up quietly not to disturb ye  why dont you wear heels to your shoes like christian people and not creep about so like a cat  well it keeps your floors clean to go slipshod  thats true  meanwhile anne was gently but firmly trying to pull bobs arm from her waist her distressful difficulty being that in freeing her waist she enslaved her hand and in getting her hand free she enslaved her waist finding the struggle a futile one owing to the invisibility of her antagonist and her wish to keep its nature secret from the other two she arose and saying that she did not care to see any more felt her way downstairs  bob followed leaving loveday and his wife to themselves  dear anne he began when he had got down and saw her in the candle light of the large room  but she adroitly passed out at the other door at which he took a candle and followed her to the small room  dear anne do let me speak he repeated as soon as the rays revealed her figure  but she passed into the bakehouse before he could say more whereupon he perseveringly did the same  looking round for her here he perceived her at the end of the room where there were no means of exit whatever  dear anne he began again setting down the candle you must try to forgive me really you must  i love you the best of anybody in the wide wide world  try to forgive me come  and he imploringly took her hand  annes bosom began to surge and fall like a small tide her eyes remaining fixed upon the floor till when loveday ventured to draw her slightly towards him she burst out crying  i dont like you bob i dont she suddenly exclaimed between her sobs  i did once but i dont nowi cant i cant you have been very cruel to me  she violently turned away weeping  i have i have been terribly bad i know answered bob consciencestricken by her grief  butif you could only forgive mei promise that ill never do anything to grieve ee again  do you forgive me anne  annes only reply was crying and shaking her head  lets make it up  come say we have made it up dear  she withdrew her hand and still keeping her eyes buried in her handkerchief said no  very well then exclaimed bob with sudden determination  now i know my doom  and whatever you hear of as happening to me mind this you cruel girl that it is all your causing  saying this he strode with a hasty tread across the room into the passage and out at the door slamming it loudly behind him  anne suddenly looked up from her handkerchief and stared with round wet eyes and parted lips at the door by which he had gone  having remained with suspended breath in this attitude for a few seconds she turned round bent her head upon the table and burst out weeping anew with thrice the violence of the former time  it really seemed now as if her grief would overwhelm her all the emotions which had been suppressed bottled up and concealed since bobs return having made themselves a sluice at last  but such things have their end and left to herself in the large vacant old apartment she grew quieter and at last calm  at length she took the candle and ascended to her bedroom where she bathed her eyes and looked in the glass to see if she had made herself a dreadful object  it was not so bad as she had expected and she went downstairs again  nobody was there and sitting down she wondered what bob had really meant by his words  it was too dreadful to think that he intended to go straight away to sea without seeing her again and frightened at what she had done she waited anxiously for his return     xl  a call on business   her suspense was interrupted by a very gentle tapping at the door and then the rustle of a hand over its surface as if searching for the latch in the dark  the door opened a few inches and the alabaster face of uncle benjy appeared in the slit  o squire derriman you frighten me  all alone he asked in a whisper  my mother and mr loveday are somewhere about the house  that will do he said coming forward  i be wherrited out of my life and i have thought of you againyou yourself dear anne and not the miller  if you will only take this and lock it up for a few days till i can find another good place for itif you only would  and he breathlessly deposited the tin box on the table  what obliged to dig it up from the cellar  ay my nephew hath a scent of the placehow i dont know but he and a young woman hes met with are searching everywhere  i worked like a wire drawer to get it up and away while they were scraping in the next cellar now where could ye put it dear  tis only a few documents and my will and such like you know  poor soul o me im worn out with running and fright  ill put it here till i can think of a better place said anne lifting the box  dear me how heavy it is  yes yes said uncle benjy hastily the box is iron you see  however take care of it because i am going to make it worth your while  ah you are a good girl anne  i wish you was mine  anne looked at uncle benjy  she had known for some time that she possessed all the affection he had to bestow  why do you wish that she said simply  now dont ye argue with me  where dye put the coffer  here said anne going to the windowseat which rose as a flap disclosing a boxed receptacle beneath as in many old houses  tis very well for the present he said dubiously and they dropped the coffer in anne locking down the seat and giving him the key  now i dont want ye to be on my side for nothing he went on  i never did now did i  this is for you  he handed her a little packet of paper which anne turned over and looked at curiously  i always meant to do it continued uncle benjy gazing at the packet as it lay in her hand and sighing  come open it my dear i always meant to do it  she opened it and found twenty new guineas snugly packed within  yes they are for you  i always meant to do it he said sighing again  but you owe me nothing returned anne holding them out  dont say it cried uncle benjy covering his eyes  put em away    well if you dont want embut put em away dear anne they are for you because you have kept my counsel  goodnight tye  yes they are for you  he went a few steps and turning back added anxiously you wont spend em in clothes or waste em in fairings or ornaments of any kind my dear girl  i will not said anne  i wish you would have them  no no said uncle benjy rushing off to escape their shine  but he had got no further than the passage when he returned again  and you wont lend em to anybody or put em into the bankfor no bank is safe in these troublous times    if i was you id keep them exactly as they be and not spend em on any account  shall i lock them into my box for ye  certainly said she and the farmer rapidly unlocked the windowbench opened the box and locked them in  tis much the best plan he said with great satisfaction as he returned the keys to his pocket  there they will always be safe you see and you wont be exposed to temptation  when the old man had been gone a few minutes the miller and his wife came in quite unconscious of all that had passed  annes anxiety about bob was again uppermost now and she spoke but meagrely of old derrimans visit and nothing of what he had left  she would fain have asked them if they knew where bob was but that she did not wish to inform them of the rupture  she was forced to admit to herself that she had somewhat tried his patience and that impulsive men had been known to do dark things with themselves at such times  they sat down to supper the clock ticked rapidly on and at length the miller said bob is later than usual  where can he be  as they both looked at her she could no longer keep the secret  it is my fault she cried i have driven him away  what shall i do  the nature of the quarrel was at once guessed and her two elders said no more  anne rose and went to the front door where she listened for every sound with a palpitating heart  then she went in then she went out and on one occasion she heard the miller say i wonder what hath passed between bob and anne  i hope the chap will come home  just about this time light footsteps were heard without and bob bounced into the passage  anne who stood back in the dark while he passed followed him into the room where her mother and the miller were on the point of retiring to bed candle in hand  i have kept ye up i fear began bob cheerily and apparently without the faintest recollection of his tragic exit from the house  but the truth ont is i met with fess derriman at the duke of york as i went from here and there we have been playing put ever since not noticing how the time was going  i havent had a good chat with the fellow for years and years and really he is an out and out good comradea regular hearty  poor fellow hes been very badly used  i never heard the rights of the story till now but it seems that old uncle of his treats him shamefully  he has been hiding away his money so that poor fess might not have a farthing till at last the young man has turned like any other worm and is now determined to ferret out what he has done with it  the poor young chap hadnt a farthing of ready money till i lent him a couple of guineasa thing i never did more willingly in my life  but the man was very honourable  no no says he dont let me deprive ye  hes going to marry and what may you think he is going to do it for  for love i hope said annes mother  for money i suppose since hes so short said the miller  no said bob for spite  he has been badly serveddeuced badly servedby a woman  i never heard of a more heartless case in my life the poor chap wouldnt mention names but it seems this young woman has trifled with him in all manner of cruel wayspushed him into the river tried to steal his horse when he was called out to defend his countryin short served him rascally  so i gave him the two guineas and said now lets drink to the hussys downfall  o said anne having approached behind him  bob turned and saw her and at the same moment mr and mrs loveday discreetly retired by the other door  is it peace he asked tenderly  o yes she anxiously replied  ididnt mean to make you think i had no heart  at this bob inclined his countenance towards hers  no she said smiling through two incipient tears as she drew back  you are to show good behaviour for six months and you must promise not to frighten me again by running off when ishow you how badly you have served me  i am yours obedientin anything cried bob  but am i pardoned  youth is foolish and does a woman often let her reasoning in favour of the worthier stand in the way of her perverse desire for the less worthy at such times as these  she murmured some soft words ending with do you repent  it would be superfluous to transcribe bobs answer  footsteps were heard without  o begad i forgot said bob  hes waiting out there for a light  who  my friend derriman  but bob i have to explain  but festus had by this time entered the lobby and anne with a hasty get rid of him at once vanished upstairs  here she waited and waited but festus did not seem inclined to depart and at last foreboding some collision of interests from bobs new friendship for this man she crept into a storeroom which was over the apartment into which loveday and festus had gone  by looking through a knothole in the floor it was easy to command a view of the room beneath this being unceiled with moulded beams and rafters  festus had sat down on the hollow windowbench and was continuing the statement of his wrongs  if he only knew what he was sitting upon she thought apprehensively how easily he could tear up the flap lock and all with his strong arm and seize upon poor uncle benjys possessions but he did not appear to know unless he were acting which was just possible  after a while he rose and going to the table lifted the candle to light his pipe  at the moment when the flame began diving into the bowl the door noiselessly opened and a figure slipped across the room to the windowbench hastily unlocked it withdrew the box and beat a retreat  anne in a moment recognized the ghostly intruder as festus derrimans uncle  before he could get out of the room festus set down the candle and turned  whatuncle benjyhaw haw  here at this time of night  uncle benjys eyes grew paralyzed and his mouth opened and shut like a frogs in a drought the action producing no sound  what have we got herea tin boxthe box of boxes  why ill carry it for ee unclei am going home  nnono thanky festus it is nnnot heavy at all thanky gasped the squireen  o but i must said festus pulling at the box  dont let him have it bob screamed the excited anne through the hole in the floor  no dont let him cried the uncle  tis a plottheres a woman at the window waiting to help him  annes eyes flew to the window and she saw matildas face pressed against the pane  bob though he did not know whence annes command proceeded obeyed with alacrity pulled the box from the two relatives and placed it on the table beside him  now look here hearties whats the meaning o this he said  hes trying to rob me of all i possess cried the old man  my heart strings seem as if they were going crack crack crack  at this instant the miller in his shirtsleeves entered the room having got thus far in his undressing when he heard the noise  bob and festus turned to him to explain and when the latter had had his say bob added well all i know is that this boxhere he stretched out his hand to lay it upon the lid for emphasis  but as nothing but thin air met his fingers where the box had been he turned and found that the box was gone uncle benjy having vanished also  festus with an imprecation hastened to the door but though the night was not dark farmer derriman and his burden were nowhere to be seen  on the bridge festus joined a shadowy female form and they went along the road together followed for some distance by bob lest they should meet with and harm the old man  but the precaution was unnecessary nowhere on the road was there any sign of farmer derriman or of the box that belonged to him  when bob reentered the house anne and mrs loveday had joined the miller downstairs and then for the first time he learnt who had been the heroine of festuss lamentable story with many other particulars of that yeomans history which he had never before known  bob swore that he would not speak to the traitor again and the family retired  the escape of old mr derriman from the annoyances of his nephew not only held good for that night but for next day and for ever  just after dawn on the following morning a labouring man who was going to his work saw the old farmer and landowner leaning over a rail in a mead near his house apparently engaged in contemplating the water of a brook before him  drawing near the man spoke but uncle benjy did not reply  his head was hanging strangely his body being supported in its erect position entirely by the rail that passed under each arm  on afterexamination it was found that uncle benjys poor withered heart had cracked and stopped its beating from damages inflicted on it by the excitements of his life and of the previous night in particular  the unconscious carcass was little more than a light empty husk dry and fleshless as that of a dead heron found on a moor in january  but the tin box was not discovered with or near him  it was searched for all the week and all the month  the millpond was dragged quarries were examined woods were threaded rewards were offered but in vain  at length one day in the spring when the millhouse was about to be cleaned throughout the chimneyboard of annes bedroom concealing a yawning fireplace had to be taken down  in the chasm behind it stood the missing deedbox of farmer derriman  many were the conjectures as to how it had got there then anne remembered that on going to bed on the night of the collision between festus and his uncle in the room below she had seen mud on the carpet of her room and the miller remembered that he had seen footprints on the back staircase  the solution of the mystery seemed to be that the late uncle benjy instead of running off from the house with his box had doubled on getting out of the front door entered at the back deposited his box in annes chamber where it was found and then leisurely pursued his way home at the heels of festus intending to tell anne of his trick the next dayan intention that was for ever frustrated by the stroke of death  mr derrimans solicitor was a casterbridge man and anne placed the box in his hands  uncle benjys will was discovered within and by this testament annes queer old friend appointed her sole executrix of his said will and more than that gave and bequeathed to the same young lady all his real and personal estate with the solitary exception of five small freehold houses in a back street in budmouth which were devised to his nephew festus as a sufficient property to maintain him decently without affording any margin for extravagances  oxwell hall with its muddy quadrangle archways mullioned windows cracked battlements and weedgrown garden passed with the rest into the hands of anne     xli  john marches into the night   during this exciting time john loveday seldom or never appeared at the mill  with the recall of bob in which he had been sole agent his mission seemed to be complete  one midday before anne had made any change in her manner of living on account of her unexpected acquisition lieutenant bob came in rather suddenly  he had been to budmouth and announced to the arrested senses of the family that the th dragoons were ordered to join sir arthur wellesley in the peninsula  these tidings produced a great impression on the household  john had been so long in the neighbourhood either at camp or in barracks that they had almost forgotten the possibility of his being sent away and they now began to reflect upon the singular infrequency of his calls since his brothers return  there was not much time however for reflection if they wished to make the most of johns farewell visit which was to be paid the same evening the departure of the regiment being fixed for next day  a hurried valedictory supper was prepared during the afternoon and shortly afterwards john arrived  he seemed to be more thoughtful and a trifle paler than of old but beyond these traces which might have been due to the natural wear and tear of time he showed no signs of gloom  on his way through the town that morning a curious little incident had occurred to him  he was walking past one of the churches when a weddingparty came forth the bride and bridegroom being matilda and festus derriman  at sight of the trumpetmajor the yeoman had glared triumphantly matilda on her part had winked at him slily as much as to say  but what she meant heaven knows the trumpetmajor did not trouble himself to think and passed on without returning the mark of confidence with which she had favoured him  soon after johns arrival at the mill several of his friends dropped in for the same purpose of bidding adieu  they were mostly the men who had been entertained there on the occasion of the regiments advent on the down when anne and her mother were coaxed in to grace the party by their superior presence and their welltrained gallant manners were such as to make them interesting visitors now as at all times  for it was a period when romance had not so greatly faded out of military life as it has done in these days of short service heterogeneous mixing and transient campaigns when the esprit de corps was strong and long experience stamped noteworthy professional characteristics even on rank and file while the millers visitors had the additional advantage of being picked men  they could not stay so long tonight as on that earlier and more cheerful occasion and the final adieus were spoken at an early hour  it was no mere playing at departure as when they had gone to exonbury barracks and there was a warm and prolonged shaking of hands all round  youll wish the poor fellows goodbye said bob to anne who had not come forward for that purpose like the rest  they are going away and would like to have your good word  she then shyly advanced and every man felt that he must make some pretty speech as he shook her by the hand  goodbye  may you remember us as long as it makes ye happy and forget us as soon as it makes ye sad said sergeant brett  goodnight  health wealth and long life to ye said sergeantmajor wills taking her hand from brett  i trust to meet ye again as the wife of a worthy man said trumpeter buck  well drink your health throughout the campaign and so goodbye tye said saddlersergeant jones raising her hand to his lips  three others followed with similar remarks to each of which anne blushingly replied as well as she could wishing them a prosperous voyage easy conquest and a speedy return  but alas for that  battles and skirmishes advances and retreats fevers and fatigues told hard on annes gallant friends in the coming time  of the seven upon whom these wishes were bestowed five including the trumpetmajor were dead men within the few following years and their bones left to moulder in the land of their campaigns  john lingered behind  when the others were outside expressing a final farewell to his father bob and mrs loveday he came to anne who remained within  but i thought you were going to look in again before leaving she said gently  no i find i cannot  goodbye  john said anne holding his right hand in both hers i must tell you something  you were wise in not taking me at my word that day  i was greatly mistaken about myself  gratitude is not love though i wanted to make it so for the time  you dont call me thoughtless for what i did  my dear anne cried john with more gaiety than truthfulness dont let yourself be troubled  what happens is for the best  soldiers love here today and there tomorrow  who knows that you wont hear of my attentions to some spanish maid before a month is gone by  tis the way of us you know a soldiers heart is not worth a weeks purchaseha ha  goodbye goodbye  anne felt the expediency of his manner received the affectation as real and smiled her reply not knowing that the adieu was for evermore  then with a tear in his eye he went out of the door where he bade farewell to the miller mrs loveday and bob who said at parting its all right jack my dear fellow  after a coaxing that would have been enough to win three ordinary englishwomen five french and ten mulotters she has to day agreed to bestow her hand upon me at the end of six months  goodbye jack goodbye  the candle held by his father shed its waving light upon johns face and uniform as with a farewell smile he turned on the doorstone backed by the black night and in another moment he had plunged into the darkness the ring of his smart step dying away upon the bridge as he joined his companionsinarms and went off to blow his trumpet till silenced for ever upon one of the bloody battlefields of spain     footnotes   207  vide preface  211  vide
