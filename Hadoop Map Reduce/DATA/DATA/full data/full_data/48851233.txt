48851233	captains all  by ww jacobs    the madness of mr lister  illustration the madness of mr lister  old jem lister of the susannah was possessed of two devilsthe love of strong drink and avariceand the only thing the twain had in common was to get a drink without paying for it  when mr lister paid for a drink the demon of avarice masquerading as conscience preached a teetotal lecture and when he showed signs of profiting by it the demon of drink would send him hanging round publichouse doors cadging for drinks in a way which his shipmates regarded as a slur upon the entire ships company  many a healthy thirst reared on salt beef and tickled with strong tobacco had been spoiled by the sight of mr lister standing by the entrance with a propitiatory smile waiting to be invited in to share it and on one occasion they had even seen him him jem lister ab holding a horses head with ulterior motives  it was pointed out to mr lister at last that his conduct was reflecting discredit upon men who were fully able to look after themselves in that direction without having any additional burden thrust upon them  bill henshaw was the spokesman and on the score of violence miscalled firmness his remarks left little to be desired  on the score of profanity bill might recall with pride that in the opinion of his fellows he had left nothing unsaid  you ought to ha been a member o parliament bill said harry lea when he had finished  it wants money said henshaw shaking his head  mr lister laughed a senile laugh but not lacking in venom  thats what weve got to say said henshaw turning upon him suddenly if theres anything i hate in this world its a drinking miser  you know our opinion and the best thing you can do is to turn over a new leaf now  take us all in to the goat and compasses urged lea bring out some o those sovrins youve been hoarding  mr lister gazed at him with frigid scorn and finding that the conversation still seemed to centre round his unworthy person went up on deck and sat glowering over the insults which had been heaped upon him his futile wrath when bill dogged his footsteps ashore next day and revealed his character to a bibulous individual whom he had almost persuaded to be a christianfrom his point of viewbordered upon the maudlin and he wandered back to the ship wildeyed and dry of throat  for the next two months it was safe to say that every drink he had he paid for  his eyes got brighter and his complexion clearer nor was he as pleased as one of the other sex might have been when the selfsatisfied henshaw pointed out these improvements to his companions and claimed entire responsibility for them  it is probable that mr lister under these circumstances might in time have lived down his taste for strong drink but that at just that time they shipped a new cook  he was a big cadaverous young fellow who looked too closely after his own interests to be much of a favourite with the other men forward  on the score of thrift it was soon discovered that he and mr lister had much in common and the latter pleased to find a congenial spirit was disposed to make the most of him and spent despite the heat much of his spare time in the galley  you keep to it said the greybeard impressively money was made to be took care of if you dont spend your money youve always got it  ive always been a saving manwhats the result  the cook waiting some time in patience to be told gently inquired what it was  ere am i said mr lister goodnaturedly helping him to cut a cabbage at the age of sixtytwo with a bankbook down below in my chest with one hundered an ninety pounds odd in it  one undered and ninety pounds repeated the cook with awe  to say nothing of other things continued mr lister with joyful appreciation of the effect he was producing  altogether ive got a little over four undered pounds  the cook gasped and with gentle firmness took the cabbage from him as being unfit work for a man of such wealth  its very nice he said slowly  its very nice  youll be able to live on it in your old age  mr lister shook his head mournfully and his eyes became humid  theres no old age for me he said sadly but you neednt tell them and he jerked his thumb towards the forecastle  no no said the cook  ive never been one to talk over my affairs said mr lister in a low voice  ive never yet took fancy enough to anybody so to do  no my lad im saving up for somebody else  what are you going to live on when youre past work then demanded the other  mr lister took him gently by the sleeve and his voice sank with the solemnity of his subject im not going to have no old age he said resignedly  not going to live repeated the cook gazing uneasily at a knife by his side  how do you know  i went to a orsepittle in london said mr lister  ive been to two or three altogether while the money ive spent on doctors is more than i like to think of and theyre all surprised to think that ive lived so long  im so chockfull o complaints that they tell me i cant live more than two years and i might go off at any moment  well youve got money said the cook why dont you knock off work now and spend the evenin of your life ashore  why should you save up for your relatives  ive got no relatives said mr lister im all alone  i spose i shall leave my money to some nice young feller and i hope itll do im good  with the dazzling thoughts which flashed through the cooks brain the cabbage dropped violently into the saucepan and a shower of cooling drops fell on both men  i spose you take medicine he said at length  a little rum said mr lister faintly the doctors tell me that it is the only thing that keeps me upo course the chaps down there he indicated the forecastle again with a jerk of his headaccuse me o taking too much  what do ye take any notice of em for inquired the other indignantly  i spose it is foolish admitted mr lister but i dont like being misunderstood  i keep my troubles to myself as a rule cook  i dont know whats made me talk to you like this  i eard the other day you was keeping company with a young woman  well i wont say as i aint replied the other busying himself over the fire  an the best thing too my lad said the old man warmly  it keeps you stiddy keeps you out of publicouses not as they aint good in moderationi ope youll be appy  a friendship sprang up between the two men which puzzled the remainder of the crew not a little  the cook thanked him and noticed that mr lister was fidgeting with a piece of paper  a little something i wrote the other day said the old man catching his eye  if i let you see it will you promise not to tell a soul about it and not to give me no thanks  the wondering cook promised and the old man being somewhat emphatic on the subject backed his promise with a home made affidavit of singular power and profanity  here it is then said mr lister  the cook took the paper and as he read the letters danced before him he blinked his eyes and started again slowly  in plain black and white and nondescriptcoloured fingermarks mr lister after a general statement as to his bodily and mental health left the whole of his estate to the cook  the will was properly dated and witnessed and the cooks voice shook with excitement and emotion as he offered to hand it back  i dont know what ive done for you to do this he said  mr lister waved it away again  keep it he said simply while youve got it on you youll know its safe  from this moment a friendship sprang up between the two men which puzzled the remainder of the crew not a little  the attitude of the cook was as that of a son to a father the benignancy of mr lister beautiful to behold  it was noticed too that he had abandoned the reprehensible practice of hanging round tavern doors in favour of going inside and drinking the cooks health  illustration a friendship sprang up between the two men which puzzled the remainder of the crew not a little  for about six months the cook although always in somewhat straitened circumstances was well content with the tacit bargain and then bit by bit the character of mr lister was revealed to him  it was not a nice character but subtle and when he made the startling discovery that a will could be rendered invalid by the simple process of making another one the next day he became as a man possessed  when he ascertained that mr lister when at home had free quarters at the house of a married niece he used to sit about alone and try and think of ways and means of securing capital sunk in a concern which seemed to show no signs of being woundup  ive got a touch of the art again lad said the elderly invalid as they sat alone in the forecastle one night at seacole  you move about too much said the cook  why not turn in and rest  mr lister who had not expected this fidgeted  i think ill go ashore a bit and try the air he said suggestively  ill just go as far as the black horse and back  you wont have me long now my lad  no i know said the cook thats whats worrying me a bit dont worry about me said the old man pausing with his hand on the others shoulder im not worth it  dont look so glum lad  ive got something on my mind jem said the cook staring straight in front of him  what is it inquired mr lister  you know what you told me about those pains in your inside said the cook without looking at him  jem groaned and felt his side  and what you said about its being a relief to die continued the other only you was afraid to commit suicide  well said mr lister  it used to worry me continued the cook earnestly  i used to say to myself poor old jem i ses why should e suffer like this when he wants to die  it seemed ard  it is ard said mr lister but what about it  the other made no reply but looking at him for the first time surveyed him with a troubled expression  what about it repeated mr lister with some emphasis  you did say you wanted to die didnt you  said the cook  now suppose suppose  suppose what inquired the old man sharply  why dont you say what youre agoing to say  suppose said the cook some one what liked you jemwhat liked you mindeard you say this over and over again an see you sufferin and eard you groanin and not able to do nothin for you except lend you a few shillings here and there for medicine or stand you a few glasses o rum suppose they knew a chap in a chemists shop  suppose they did said the other turning pale  a chap what knows all about pisons continued the cook pisons what a man can take without knowing it in is grub  would it be wrong do you think if that friend i was speaking about put it in your food to put you out of your misery  wrong said mr lister with glassy eyes  wrong  look ere cook  i dont mean anything to give him pain said the other waving his hand you aint felt no pain lately ave you jem  do you mean to say shouted mr lister  i dont mean to say anything said the cook  answer my question  you aint felt no pain lately ave you  haveyoubeenputtingpisoninmywittles demanded mr lister in trembling accents  if i ad jem supposin that i ad said the cook in accents of reproachful surprise do you mean to say that youd mind  mind said mr lister with fervour  id ave you ung  but you said you wanted to die said the surprised cook  mr lister swore at him with startling vigour  ill ave you ung he repeated wildly  me said the cook artlessly  what for  for giving me pison said mr lister frantically  do you think you can deceive me by your roundabouts  do you think i cant see through you  the other with a sphinxlike smile sat unmoved  prove it he said darkly  but supposin if anybody ad been givin you pison would you like to take something to prevent its acting  id take gallons of it said mr lister feverishly  the other sat pondering while the old man watched him anxiously  its a pity you dont know your own mind jem he said at length still you know your own business best  but its very expensive stuff  how much inquired the other  well they wont sell more than two shillingsworth at a time said the cook trying to speak carelessly but if you like to let me ave the money ill go ashore to the chemists and get the first lot now  mr listers face was a study in emotions which the other tried in vain to decipher  then he slowly extracted the amount from his trouserspocket and handed it over without a word  ill go at once said the cook with a little feeling and ill never take a man at his word again jem  he ran blithely up on deck and stepping ashore spat on the coins for luck and dropped them in his pocket  down below mr lister with his chin in his hand sat in a state of mind pretty evenly divided between rage and fear  the cook who was in no mood for company missed the rest of the crew by two publichouses and having purchased a babys teething powder and removed the label had a congratulatory drink or two before going on board again  a chatter of voices from the forecastle warned him that the crew had returned but the tongues ceased abruptly as he descended and three pairs of eyes surveyed him in grim silence  whats up he demanded  wot ave you been doin to poor old jem demanded henshaw sternly  nothin said the other shortly  you aint been pisoning im demanded henshaw  certainly not said the cook emphatically  he ses you told im you pisoned im said henshaw solemnly and e give you two shillings to get something to cure im  its too late now  what stammered the bewildered cook  he looked round anxiously at the men  they were all very grave and the silence became oppressive where is he he demanded  henshaw and the others exchanged glances  hes gone mad said he slowly  mad repeated the horrified cook and seeing the aversion of the crew in a broken voice he narrated the way in which he had been victimized  well youve done it now said henshaw when he had finished  hes gone right orf is ed  where is he inquired the cook  where you cant follow him said the other slowly  heaven hazarded the unfortunate cook  no skippers bunk said lea  oh cant i foller im said the cook starting up  ill soon ave im out o that  better leave im alone said henshaw  he was that wild we couldnt do nothing with im singing an larfin and crying all togetheri certainly thought he was pisoned  ill swear i aint touched him said the cook  well youve upset his reason said henshaw therell be an awful row when the skipper comes aboard and finds im in is bed  well come an elp me to get im out said the cook  i aint going to be mixed up in it said henshaw shaking his head  dont you bill said the other two  wot the skipperll say i dont know said henshaw anyway itll be said to you not  ill go and get im out if e was five madmen said the cook compressing his lips  youll harve to carry im out then said henshaw  i dont wish you no arm cook and perhaps it would be as well to get im out afore the skipper or mate comes aboard  if it was me i know what i should do  what inquired the cook breathlessly  draw a sack over his head said henshaw impressively hell scream like blazes as soon as you touch him and rouse the folks ashore if you dont  besides that if you draw it well down itll keep his arms fast  the cook thanked him fervently and routing out a sack rushed hastily on deck his departure being the signal for mr henshaw and his friends to make preparations for retiring for the night so hastily as almost to savour of panic  the cook after a hasty glance ashore went softly below with the sack over his arm and felt his way in the darkness to the skippers bunk  the sound of deep and regular breathing reassured him and without undue haste he opened the mouth of the sack and gently raised the sleepers head  eh  wha began a sleepy voice  the next moment the cook had bagged him and gripping him tightly round the middle turned a deaf ear to the smothered cries of his victim as he strove to lift him out of the bunk  in the exciting time which followed he had more than one reason for thinking that he had caught a centipede  now you keep still he cried breathlessly  im not going to hurt you  he got his burden out of bed at last and staggered to the foot of the companionladder with it  then there was a halt two legs sticking obstinately across the narrow way and refusing to be moved while a furious humming proceeded from the other end of the sack  four times did the exhausted cook get his shoulder under his burden and try and push it up the ladder and four times did it wriggle and fight its way down again  half crazy with fear and rage he essayed it for the fifth time and had got it halfway up when there was a sudden exclamation of surprise from above and the voice of the mate sharply demanding an explanation  what the blazes are you up to he cried  its all right sir said the panting cook old jems had a drop too much and got down aft and im getting im forard again  jem said the astonished mate  why hes sitting up here on the forehatch  he came aboard with me  sitting began the horrified cook sitoh lor  he stood with his writhing burden wedged between his body and the ladder and looked up despairingly at the mate  im afraid ive made a mistake he said in a trembling voice  the mate struck a match and looked down  take that sack off he demanded sternly  the cook placed his burden upon its feet and running up the ladder stood by the mate shivering  the latter struck another match and the twain watched in breathless silence the writhings of the strange creature below as the covering worked slowly upwards  in the fourth match it got free and revealed the empurpled visage of the master of the susannah  for the fraction of a second the cook gazed at him in speechless horror and then with a hopeless cry sprang ashore and ran for it hotly pursued by his enraged victim  at the time of sailing he was still absent and the skipper loth to part two such friends sent mr james lister at the urgent request of the anxious crew to look for him
