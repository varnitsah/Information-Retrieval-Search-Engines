87396114	charlie to the rescue by rm ballantyne    chapter one  introduces the hero  to be generally helpful was one of the chief points in the character of charlie brooke  he was evidently born to aid mankind  he began by helping himself to everything in life that seemed at all desirable  this was natural not selfish  at first there were few things apparently that did seem to his infant mind desirable for his earliest days were marked by a sort of chronic crossness that seemed quite unaccountable in one so healthy but this was eventually traced to the influence of pins injudiciously disposed about the person by nurse  possibly this experience may have tended to develop a spirit of brave endurance and might perhaps account for the beautiful modifications of character that were subsequently observed in him  at all events sweet patient amiability was a prevailing feature in the boy long before the years of infancy were over and this heavenly aspect of him was pleasantly diversified in course of time by occasional displays of resolutewe might almost say heroicselfwill which proved a constant source of mingled pride and alarm to his widowed mother  from a very early period of life little charlie manifested an intense desire purpose and capacity for what may be called his lifework of rescuing human beings from trouble and danger  it became a passion with him as years rolled on and was among the chief means that brought about the changes in his chequered career  appropriately enough he beganalmost in babyhoodby rescuing himself  it happened thus  one day when he had reached the immature age of five he was left in the nursery for a few moments in company with a washtub in which his mother had been cleansing the household linen  mrs brooke it may be remarked although in the middle ranks of life was very much below the middle ranks in financial prosperity and had therefore to perform much household drudgery  charlies earnest desire to please and obey his mother constantly came into collision with that selfwill to which we have referred separately these qualities may perhaps work quietly at least as regards their possessor but unitedly they form a mixture which is apt to become explosive in early youth  dont touch the tub charlie ill be back directly said mrs brooke as she was leaving the nursery  dont even go near it  no muvver i wont  he spoke with much decision for he adored waternot to drink but to play withand seemed to realise the danger of his position and the necessity for selfcontrol  the temptation to avail himself of the chance however was almost too much for him  feeling that an internal conflict was pending he toddled to the fire turned his back to it a la paterfamilias and glared at the tub resolved come what might to be dood  but fate was against him  suddenly he became aware that something more than radiated heat was operating in rear  he glanced behind  his cotton tunic was in flames in the twinkling of an eye he was seated in the washtub his hands clasped in horror as he thought of his guilt and the flames thoroughly extinguished  the solemn glare and pursed mouth with which he met his mothers look of blank amazement may be imagined but cannot be describedhe looked so quiet too and so evidently contented for the warm water was congenial  o charlie did i not say that  yes muvver but im bunt  the fearsome and dripping black patch which presented itself to the agonised mother when she lifted him out of the tub sufficiently enlightened her and exonerated the child but her anxiety was not relieved till she had stripped him naked and ascertained for certain that no scrap of his fair skin had been injured  this may be said to have been the real commencement of charlie brookes career  we mention it chiefly to show that our hero was gifted with some power of ready resource even in childhood  he was also gifted with a fearless and daring disposition a quietly enthusiastic spirit a modest mien and a strong muscular body  of course these admirable qualities were not fully developed in childhood but the seeds were there  in due time the plants came up and the flowers bloomed  we would here caution the readerespecially the youthful reader against supposing that from this point our hero was engaged in rescuework and continued at it ever after without intermission  like samson with his great strength he exercised his powers only now and thenmore than half unconscious of what was in himand on many occasions without any definite purpose in view  his first act of heroism was exercised when he had reached the age of nine in behalf of a kitten  it was on a magnificent summer day soon after he had been sent to the village school that the incident occurred  charlie was walking at the time with one of his schoolfellows named shank leather  shank was a little older than himself and a good enough fellow in his way but much given to boasting and possessed of very few of the fine qualities that characterised our hero  the two were out for a holidayramble a long way from home and had reached a river on the banks of which they sat down to enjoy their midday meal  the meal was simple and carried in their pockets  it consisted of two inchandahalfthick slices of bread with two lumps of cheese to match  i wish this river was nearer home said shank leather as they sat down under a spreading oak to dine  why asked his companion with a felicitous brevity and straightforwardness which occasionally marked his conversation  because then i would have a swim in it everyday  can you swim asked charlie a slight elevation of the eyebrows indicating surprise not unmingled with admirationfor our hero was a heroworshipper  he could not well have been a hero otherwise  of course i can swim returned shank that is to say a little but i feel sure that ill be a splendid swimmer some day  his companions look of admiration increased  whatll you take to drink asked shank drawing a large flask from the pocket in which he had concealed it up to that moment with the express purpose of giving his companion a pleasant surprise  it may be well to add that the variety of dunks implied in his question was imaginary  shank had only one flask but in the exuberance of convivial generosity he quoted his own fatherwho was addicted to the bottle  what is it asked brooke in curious expectancy  taste and see said his friend uncorking the flask  charlie tasted but did not see apparently for he looked solemn and tasted again  its liquoricewater said shank with the look of one who expects approval  i made it myself  nauseous in the extreme it might have served the purpose of an emetic had not the digestion of the boys been ostrichlike but on hearing how it came into existence charlie put it a third time to his lips took a good gulp and then nodding his head as he wiped his mouth with his cuff declared that it was wonderful  yes isnt it  theres not many fellows could make stuff like that  no indeed assented the other heartily as he attacked the bread and cheese  does your father know you made it  oh yes and he tasted it toohed taste anything in the shape of drinkbut he spat it out and then washed his mouth with brandy an water  mother took some too and she said she had tasted worse drinks and she only wished that father would take to it  that made father laugh heartily  then i gave some to little may and she said it was so nice  ay  that was like little may remarked charlie with a quiet laugh shed say that a mess o tar an shoeblacking was nice if you made it  but i say shank lets see you swim  id give anything if i could swim  do like a brick as you are  theres a fine deep hole here under the bank  he pointed to a pool in the river where the gurgling eddies certainly indicated considerable depth of water but his friend shook his head  no charlie he said you dont understand the danger as i do  dont you see that the water runs into the hole at such a rate that theres a treemendous eddy that would sweep any man off his legs  but youre goin to swim you know interrupted his friend an have got to be off your legs anyhow  thats all you know returned the other  if a mans swept round by an eddy dont you know hell be banged against things and then the water rushes out of the hole with such a gush an goes thunderin down below over boulders and stones andandont you see  thats true shank it does look dangerous even for a man that can swim  he put such emphasis on the man that his comrade glanced sharply at him but the genuine innocence of our heros face was too obvious to suggest irony  he simply saw that the use of the word man pleased his friend therefore he used it  conversation was cut short at this point by the sudden appearance on the scene of two strangersa kitten and a dog  the assertion that dogs delight to bark and bite is perhaps too sweeping but then it was made by a poet and poets have an acknowledged licencethough not necessarily a doglicence  certain it is however that this doga mongrel curdid bark with savage delight and display all its teeth with an evident desire to bite as it chased a delirious tortoiseshell kitten towards the river  it was a round soft lively kitten with the hair on its little body sticking straight out its heart in its mouth and horror in its lovely eyes  it made straight for the tree under which the dinner was going on  both boys started up  enemies in front and rear  even a human general might have stood appalled  two courses were still openright and left  the kitten turned right and went wrong for that was the riverside  no time for thought  barking cur and yelling boys  it reached the edge of the pool spread out all its legs with a caterwaul of despair and went headlong into the water  shank leather gazedsomething like glee mingled with his look of consternation  not so our hero  pity was bursting his bosom  with one magnificent bound he went into the pool caught the kitten in his right hand and carried it straight to the bottom  next moment he reappeared on the surface wildly beating the water with one hand and holding the kitten aloft in the other  shank to do him justice plunged into the river up to his waist but his courage carried him no further  there he stuck vainly holding out a hand and shouting for help  but no help was near and it seemed as if the pair of strugglers were doomed to perish when a pitiful eddy swept them both out of the deep pool into the foaming rapid below  shank followed them in howling despair for here things looked ten times worse his comrade being tossed from billow to breaker was turned heels over head bumped against boulders stranded on shallows overturned and swept away againbut ever with the left arm beating wildly and the right hand with the kitten held high in air  but the danger except from being dashed against the boulders was not really as great as it seemed for every time that brooke got a foothold for an instant or was driven on a rock or was surged rightendup on a shoot of water he managed to gasp a little airincluding a deal of water  the kitten of course had the same chances and being passive perhaps suffered less  at the foot of the rapid they were whirled as if contemptuously into an eddy  shank was there as deep as he dared venture  he even pushed in up to the armpits and catching his comrade by the hair dragged him to bank  o charlie ive saved ye he exclaimed as his friend crawled out and sat down  ay an youve saved the kitten too replied his friend examining the poor animal  its dead said shank dead as mutton  no only stunned  no wonder poor beast  with tender care the rescuer squeezed the water from the fur of the rescued  then pulling open his vest and shirt he was about to place the kitten in his bosom to warm it  no use doin that said leather  youre as wet an nigh as cold as itself  thats true  sit down here returned brooke in a tone of command which surprised his comrade  open your shirt  again shank obeyed wonderingly  next moment he gave a gasp as the cold wet creature was thrust into his warm bosom  it makes me shiver all over he said  never mind replied his friend coolly as he got up and wrung the water out of his own garments  its beginning to move charlie said shank after a few minutes  give it here then  the creature was indeed showing feeble symptoms of revival so brooke whose bosom was not only recovering its own heat but was beginning to warm the wet garmentsthrust it into his own breast and the two friends set off homeward at a run  at the nearest house they made inquiry as to the owner of the kitten but failed to find one  our hero therefore resolved to carry it home long before that haven was reached however his clothes were nearly dry and the rescued one was purring sweetly in childlike innocence all the horrors sufferings and agonies of the past forgotten apparently in the enjoyment of the present    chapter two  the shipwreck  we have no intention of carrying our reader on step by step through all the adventures and deeds of charlie brooke  it is necessary to hasten over his boyhood leaving untold the many battles fought risks run and dangers encountered  he did not cut much of a figure at the village schoolthough he did his best and was fairly successfulbut in the playground he reigned supreme  at football cricket gymnastics and ultimately at swimming no one could come near him  this was partly owing to his great physical strength for as time passed by he shot upwards and outwards in a way that surprised his companions and amazed his mother who was a distinctly little womana neat graceful little womanwith like her stalwart son a modest opinion of herself  as a matter of course charlies schoolfellows almost worshipped him and he was always so willing to help and lead them in all cases of danger or emergency that charlie to the rescue became quite a familiar cry on the playground  indeed it would have been equally appropriate in the school for the lad never seemed to be so thoroughly happy as when he was assisting some boy less capable than himself to master his lessons  about the time that charlie left school while yet a stripling he had the shoulders of samson the chest of hercules and the limbs of apollo he was tall alsoover six feetbut his unusual breadth deceived people as to this till they stood close to him  fair hair close and curly with bright blue eyes and a permanent look of grave benignity completes our description of him  rowing shooting fishing boxing and swimming seemed to come naturally to him and all of them in a superlative degree  swimming was perhaps his most loved amusement and in this art he soon far outstripped his friend leather  some men are endowed with exceptional capacities in regard to water  we have seen men go into the sea warm and come out warmer even in cold weather  experience teaches that the reverse is usually true of mankind in northern regions yet we once saw a man enter the sea to all appearance a white human being after remaining in it upwards of an hour and swimming away from shore like a vessel outward bound he came back at last the colour of a boiled lobster  such exceptional qualities did charlie brooke possess  a south sea islander might have envied but could not have excelled him  it was these qualities that decided the course of his career just after he left school  charlie said his mother as they sat eating their midday meal alone one daythe mother being as we have said a widow and charlie an only childwhat do you think of doing now that you have left school for you know my income renders it impossible that i should send you to college  i dont know what to think mother  of course i intend to do something  if you had only influence with some one in power who could enable a fellow to get his foot on the first round of any sort of ladder something might be done for you know im not exactly useless though i cant boast of brilliant talents but  your talents are brilliant enough charlie said his mother interrupting besides you have been sent into this world for a purpose and you may be sure that you will discover what that purpose is and receive help to carry it out if you only ask god to guide you not otherwise she added after a pause  do you really believe mother that every one who is born into the world is sent for a purpose and with a specific work to do  i do indeed charlie  what all the cripples invalids imbeciles even the very infants who are born to wail out their sad lives in a few weeks or even days  yesall of them without exception  to suppose the opposite and imagine that a wise loving and almighty being would create anything for no purpose seems to me the very essence of absurdity  our only difficulty is that we do not always see the purpose  all things are ours but we must ask if we would have them  but i have asked mother said the youth with an earnest flush on his brow  you know i have done so often yet a way has not been opened up  i believe in your faith mother but i dont quite believe in my own  there surely must be something wronga screw loose somewhere  he laid down his knife and fork and looked out at the window with a wistful perplexed expression  how i wish he continued that the lines had been laid down for the human race more distinctly so that we could not err  and yet responded his mother with a peculiar look such lines as are obviously laid down we dont always follow  for instance it is written ask and it shall be given you and we stop there but the sentence does not stop seek and ye shall find implies care and trouble knock and it shall be opened unto you hints at perseverance does it not  theres something in that mother said charlie casting another wistful glance out of the window  come i will go out and seek  i see shank leather waiting for me  we agreed to go to the shore together for we both like to watch the waves roaring in on a breezy day like this  the youth rose and began to encase his bulky frame in a great pilotcloth coat each button of which might have done duty as an afternoon teasaucer  i wish you would choose any companion to walk with but young leather said the widow with a sigh  hes far too like his father to do you any good  mother would you have me give up an old playmate and schoolfellow because he is not perfect asked the youth in grave tones as he tied on a souwester  well nonot exactly but  not having a good reason ready the worthy woman only smiled a remonstrance  the stalwart son stooped kissed her and was soon outside battling with the stormfor what he styled a breezy day was in reality a wild and stormy one  long before the period we have now reached mrs brooke had changed her residence to the seacoast in the small town of sealford  her cottage stood in the centre of the village about halfamile from the shore and close to that of her bosom friend mrs leather who had migrated along with her partly to be near her and partly for the sake of her son shank who was anxious to retain the companionship of his friend brooke partly also to get her tippling husband away from old comrades and scenes in the faint hope that she might rescue him from the great curse of his life  when charlie went out as we have said he found that shank had brought his sister may with him  this troubled our hero a good deal for he had purposed having a confidential talk with his old comrade upon future plans and prospects to the accompaniment of the roaring sea and a third party was destructive of such intention  besides poor may although exceedingly unselfish and sweet and good was at that transition period of life when girlhood is least attractiveat least to young men when bones are obtrusive and angles too conspicuous and the form generally is too suggestive of flatness and longitude while shyness marks the manners and inexperience dwarfs the mind  we would not however suggest for a moment that may was ugly  by no means but she had indeed reached what may be styled a plain period of lifea period in which some girls become silently sheepish and others tomboyish may was among the former and therefore a drag upon conversation  but after all it mattered little for the rapidly increasing gale rendered speech nearly impossible  its too wild a day for you may said brooke as he shook hands with her i wonder you care to be out  she doesnt care to be out but i wanted her to come and shes a good obliging girl so she came said shank drawing her arm through his as they pressed forward against the blast in the direction of the shore  shank leather had become a sturdy young fellow by that time but was much shorter than his friend  there was about him however an unmistakable look of dissipationor rather the beginning of itwhich accounted for mrs brookes objection to him as a companion for her son  we have said that the cottage lay about halfamile from the shore which could be reached by a winding lane between high banks  these effectually shut out the view of the sea until one was close to it though at certain times the roar of the waves could be heard even in sealford itself  such a time was the present for the gale had lashed the sea into wildest fury and not only did the three friends hear it as with bent heads they forced their way against the wind but they felt the foam of ocean on their faces as it was carried inland sometimes in lumps and flakes  at last they came to the end of the lane and the sea lashed to its wildest condition lay before them like a sheet of tortured foam  grand isnt it said brooke stopping and drawing himself up for a moment as if with a desire to combat the opposing elements  if may leather could not speak she could at all events gaze for she had superb brown eyes and they glittered just then like glowing coals while a wealth of rippling brown hair was blown from its fastenings and flew straight out behind her  look look there shouted her brother with a wild expression as he pointed to a part of the rocky shore where a vessel was dimly seen through the drift  shes trying to weather the point exclaimed brooke clearing the moisture from his eyes and endeavouring to look steadily  shell never weather it  see the fishermen are following her alongshore cried young leather dropping his sisters arm and bounding away  oh dont leave me behind shank pleaded may  shank was beyond recall but our hero who had also sprung forward heard the pleading voice and turned back  here hook on to me he cried quickly for he was in no humour to delay  the girl grasped his arm at once and to say truth she was not much of a hindrance for although somewhat inelegant as we have said she was lithe as a lizard and fleet as a young colt  a few minutes brought them to the level shore where brooke left may to shelter herself with some fisherwomen behind a low wall while he ran along to a spot where a crowd of fishermen and old salts enveloped in oilskins were discussing the situation as they leaned against the shrieking wind  will she weather it grinder think you he asked of an elderly man whose rugged features resembled mahogany the result of having bid defiance to wind and weather for nigh half a century  she may mr brooke an she maynt answered the matteroffact man of the sea in the gruff monotone with which he would have summoned all hands to close reef in a hurricane  if her tackle holds shell do it if it dont she wont  weve sent round for the rocket anyhow said a smart young fisherman who seemed to rejoice in opposing his broad chest to the blast and in listening to the thunder of the waves as they rolled into the exposed bay in great battalions chasing each other in wild tumultuous fury as if each were bent on being first in the mad assault upon the shore  has the lifeboat coxswain been called asked charlie after a few minutes silence for the voice of contending elements was too great to render converse easy or agreeable  yes sir answered the man nearest to him but shes bin called to a wreck in mussel bay an that brig will be all right or in davy joness locker long afore th lifeboat ud fetch round here  silence again fell on the group as they gazed out to sea pushing eagerly down the beach until they were ankledeep in the foam of each expended wave for the brig was by that time close on the point of rocks staggering under more sail than she could carry with safety  shell do it exclaimed the smart young fisherman ready to cheer with enthusiastic hope  done for  lost cried one while something like a groan burst from the others as they saw the brigs topmasts go over the side and one of her sails blown to ribbons  she fell away towards the rocks at once  like great black teeth these rocks seemed to leap in the midst of the foam as if longing to grasp the illfated vessel which had indeed all but weathered the dangerous point and all might have been well if her gear had only held but now as if paralysed she drifted into the bay where certain destruction awaited her  just at that moment a great cheer arose for the rocketcart drawn by the men of the coastguard was seen rattling over the downs towards them  anxiety for the fate of the doomed brig was now changed into eager hope for the rescue of her crew  the fishermen crowded round the coastguard men as they ran the cart close down to the waters edge and some of themspecially the smart young fellow already mentionedmade eager offer of their services  charlie brooke stood aloof looking on with profound interest for it was the first time he had ever seen the manby rocket apparatus brought into action  he made no hasty offer to assist for he was a cool youtheven while burning with impatient enthusiasm and saw at a glance that the men of the coastguard were well able to manage their own affairs and required no aid from him  as the brig was coming straight in they could easily calculate where she would strike so that the rocket men could set up their triangle and arrange their tackle without delay  this was fortunate for the wreck was carried shoreward with great rapidity  she struck at last when within a short distance of the beach and the faces of those on board could be distinctly seen and their cries heard as both masts snapped off and were swept over the side where they tore at the shrouds like wild creatures or charged the hulk like batteringrams  instantly the billows that had borne the vessel on their crests burst upon her sides and spurted high in air over her falling back on her deck and sweeping off everything that was moveable  it could be seen that only three or four men were on deck and these kept well under the lee of the bulwarks near the stern where they were strongest  no passengers i think said one of the fishermen no women anyhow  not likely theyd be lowed on deck even if there was growled grinder in his monotone  now then out o the way cried the leader of the coastguard men as he laid a rocket in its place  line all clear fred  all clear  next moment there was a burst of flame a crash and a vicious whizz as the powerful projectile leaped from its stand and sped out to sea in grand defiance of the opposing gale with its light line behind it  a cheer marked its flight but a groan told of its descent into the boiling sea considerably to the left of the wreck  what a pity cried shank leather who had come close to his friend when the rocketcart arrived  no matter said brooke whose compressed lips and flashing eyes told of deep but suppressed feelings  there are more rockets  he was right  while he was speaking another rocket was placed and fired  it was well directed but fell short  another and yet another rose and fell but failed to reach its mark and the remainder of the rockets refused to go off from some unknown causeeither because they had been too long in stock or had become damp  meantime the brig was tossed farther and farther in until she stuck quite fast  then it became evident that she must soon break up and her crew perish  hasty plans and eager advice were proposed and given then the smart young fisherman suddenly sprang forward and threw off his oilcoat and souwester  here hold on he cried catching up the end of the rocket line and fastening it round his waist while he kicked off his heavy boots  you cant do it bill cried some  too far to swim cried others  the seas ll knock the life out o ye said grinder afore youre clear o the sand  despite these warnings the brave young fellow dashed into the foam and plunged straight into the first mighty breaker that towered over his head  but he was too much excited to act effectively  he failed to time his plunge well  the wave fell upon him with a roar and crushed him down  in a few seconds he was dragged ashore almost insensible  example whether good or bad is infectious  another strapping young fellow stirred to emulation ran forward and seizing the rope tied it round his own waist while they helped poor bill up the beach and seated him on a sandbank  the second youth was more powerful than the firstand cooler  he made a better attempt but only got past the first wave when his comrades seeing that he was exhausted drew him back  then a thirda broad burly youthcame forward  at this point the soul of shank leather took fire for he was by no means destitute of generous impulses and he tried to get hold of the rope  out o the way cried the burly youth giving leather a rough push that almost sent him on his back we dont want no landlubbers for this kind o work  up to this point charlie brooke although burning with eager desire to take some active part in the rescue had restrained himself and held back believing with characteristic modesty that the fishermen knew far better than he did how to face the sea and use their appliances but when he saw his friend stagger backward he sprang to the front caught hold of the line and seizing the burly fisherman by the arm exclaimed youll let this landlubber try it anyhow and sent him spinning away like a capsized ninepin  there was a short laugh as well as a cheer at this but next moment all were gazing at the sea in breathless anxiety for brooke had rushed deep into the surf  he paused one moment as the great wave curled over him then went through it headfirst with such force that he shot waisthigh out of the sea on the other side  his exceptional swimmingpowers now served him well for his otterlike rapidity of action enabled him to avoid the crushing billows either by diving through them at the right moment or holding back until they fell and left him only the mad swirling foam to contend with  this last was bad enough but here his great muscular strength and his inexhaustible caloric with his corklike power of flotation enabled him to hold his own without exhaustion until another opportunity of piercing an unbroken wave offered  thus he gradually forced his way through and beyond the worst breakers which are always those nearest shore  had any one been close to him and able calmly to watch his movements it would have been seen that great as were the youths powers he did not waste them in useless battling with a force against which no man could effectively contend that with a cool head he gave way to every irresistible force swimming for a moment as it were with the currentor rather floating easily in the whirlpoolsso as to conserve his strength that ever and anon he struck out with all his might rushing through foam and wave like a fish and that in the midst of it all he saw and seized the brief moments in which he could take a gasping inhalation  those who watched him with breathless anxiety on shore saw little of all this as they paid out the line or perched themselves on tiptoe on the few boulders that here and there strewed the sand  haul him back shouted the man who was farthest out on the line hes used up  no hes not i know him well roared shank leather  pay out men pay out line  ay ease away said grinder in a thunderous growl  hes a rigler walrus he is  niver seed sich a feller since i left the southern seas  ease away boys  a cheer followed his remark for at that moment it was seen that our hero had reached the tail of the eddy which was caused by the hull of the wreck and that one of her crew had darted from the cover of the vessels bulwarks and taken shelter under the stump of the mainmast his object was seen in a moment for he unhooked a coil of rope from the belayingpins and stood ready to heave it to the approaching swimmer in making even this preparation the man ran very great risk for the stump was but a partial sheltereach wave that burst over the side sweeping wildly round it and leaping on the man higher than his waist so that it was very difficult for him to avoid being torn from his position  charlies progress was now comparatively easy  a few vigorous strokes brought him under the lea of the wreck which however was by no means a quiet spot for each divided wave rushing round bow and stern met there in a tumult of foam that almost choked the swimmer while each billow that burst over the wreck poured a small niagara on his head  how to get on board in such circumstances was a subject that had troubled charlies mind as he drew near but the action of the sailor unhooking the coil of rope at once relieved him  the moment he came within reach the sailor watching his opportunity between waves threw out the coil  it was aimed by an accustomed hand and fell on the rescuers head  another minute and young brooke stood on the deck without waiting an instant he leaped under the shelter of the stump of the mainmast beside the seaman  he was only just in time for a wave burst in thunder on the weather side of the quivering brig and pouring over the bulwarks almost dragged him from the belayingpins to which he clung  the instant the strain was off he passed a rope round his waist and gave the end of it to the sailor  here make it fast he said beginning to haul with all his might on the line which he had brought from shore  youre the skippereh  yes  dont waste your breath in speech  i know what to do  alls ready  these few words were an unspeakable relief to our hero who was well aware that the working of the rocket apparatus required a slight amount of knowledge and who felt from his manner and tone that the skipper was a thorough man  he glanced upwards as he hauled in the line assisted by his companion and saw that a stout rope with two loops on it had been fixed to the stump of the mast  just as he noted this with satisfaction a large block with a thin line rove through it emerged from the boiling sea  it had been attached by the men on shore to the rocket line which charlie had been hauling out with so much energy  its name was indicated by the skipper  here comes the whip he cried catching hold of the block when it reached him  hold me up lad while i make it fast to them loops  while charlie obeyed he saw that by fixing the taillines of the block quickly to the loops prepared for them instead of winding them round the masta difficult process in such a seamuch time was saved  there our part o the job is done now said the skipper pulling off his souwester as he spoke and holding it up as a signal to the men on shore  meanwhile those to whom he signalled had been watching every movement with intense eagerness and with the expressions of men whose gaze has to penetrate with difficulty through a haze of blinding spray  theyve got the block now cried one man  does that young feller know about fixin of it asked another  clap a stopper on your mugs theyre afixin of it now said old grinder  theres the signal  haul away lads  we must explain here that the whip above mentioned was a double or endless line passing through the block which had been hauled out to the wreck by our hero  by means of this whip one end of a stout cable was sent off to the wreck and on this cable a slinglifebuoy was hung to a pulley and also run out to the wreck  the working of the apparatus though simple enough to seamen would entail a complicated perhaps incomprehensible description to landsmen we therefore pass it by with the remark that connection with the shore having been established and the slinglifebuoyor lifesaving machinerun out the crew received it with what was meant for a hearty cheer but which exhaustion modified to a feeble shout  now lads cried the skipper to his men look sharp  let out the passengers  passengers exclaimed charlie brooke in surprise  aymy wife an little gurl two women and an old gentleman  you dont suppose id keep em on deck to be washed overboard  as he spoke two of the men opened the doors of the companionhatch and caught hold of a little girl of about five years of age who was handed up by a woman  stay keep her under cover till i get hold of her cried the skipper  as he was passing from the mast to the companion a heavy sea burst over the bulwarks and swept him into the scuppers  the same wave wrenched the child from the grasp of the man who held it and carried it right overboard  like an eel rather than a man charlie cleft the foam close behind her caught her by the skirt and bore her to the surface when a few strokes of his free arm brought him close under the lee of the wreck just in time to prevent the agonised father from leaping after his child  there was terrible suspense for a few minutes  at one moment our hero with his burden held high aloft was far down in the hollow of the watery turmoil with the black hull like a great wall rising above him while the skipper in the mainchains pale as death but sternly silent held on with his left hand and reached down with his rightevery finger rigid and ready  next moment a waterspout so to speak bore the rescuer upward on its crest but not near enoughthey went downward again  once more the leaping water surged upwards the skippers strong hand closed like the grip of death on the dress and the child was safe while its rescuer sank away from it  help him shouted the skipper as he staggered to the shelter of the companion  but charlie required no help  a loose rope hanging over the side caught his eye he seized it and was on deck again in a few seconds  a minute later and he was down in the cabin  there terrorstricken sat the skippers wife never venturing to move because she had been told to remain there till called  happily she knew nothing of the incident just described  beside her sat the other women and near to them a stern old gentleman who with compressed lips quietly awaited orders  come quick said charlie grasping by the arm one of the women  it was the skippers wife  she jumped up right willingly and went on deck  there she found her child already in the lifebuoy and was instantly lifted in beside it by her husband who looked hastily round  come here dick he said to a little cabinboy who clung to a stanchion near by  get in  the boy looked surprised and drew back  get in i say repeated the skipper sternly  theres more women sir said the boy still holding back  truebrave lad but youre wanted to keep these from getting washed out  i am too heavy you know  the boy hesitated no longer  he squeezed himself into the machine beside the woman and child  then up at armslength went the skippers souwester as a signal that all was ready and the fishermen began to haul the lifebuoy to the shore  it was an awful trip  part of the distance indeed the trio were borne along well out of the sea though the waves leaped hungrily up and sent spray over them but as they drew near the shore they were dipped again and again into the foam so that the little cabin boy needed all his energy and knowledge as well as his bravery and strength to prevent his charge being washed out  amid ringing cheers from the fishermen and a treble echo from the women behind the wallthey were at last safely landed  my lass that friend o yourn be a braave cheeld said an old woman to may leather who crouched beside her  ay that he is exclaimed may with a gush of enthusiasm in tone and eyes that made them all turn to look at her  your brother asked a handsome strapping young woman  noi wish he was  hm ha exclaimed the strapping young womanwhereat there was exchanged a significant laugh but may took no notice of it being too deeply engrossed with the proceedings on shore and sea  again the fishermen ran out the lifebuoy and soon hauled it back with another woman then a third  after that came the old gentleman quite selfpossessed and calm though very pale and dishevelled and following him the crew one by one were rescued  then came the hero of the hour and last of all as in duty bound the skippernot much too soon for he had barely reached the land when the brig was overwhelmed and engulfed in the raging sea    chapter three  its an ill wind that blaws naebody guid  that many if not most names have originated in the character or condition of individuals seems obvious else why is it that so many people take after their names  we have no desire to argue the question but hasten on to remark that old jacob crossley was said to beobserve we do not say that he wasa notable illustration of what we refer to  jacob was as cross as two sticks if we are to believe mrs bland his housekeeperand mrs bland was worthy of belief for she was an honest widow who held prevarication to be equivalent to lying and who besides having been in the old bachelors service for many years had on one occasion been plucked by him from under the feet of a pair of horses when attempting the more dangerous than norwest passage of a london crossing  gratitude therefore rendered it probable that mrs bland spake truly when she said that her master was as cross as two sticks of course we admit that her judgment may have been faulty  strange to say mr crossley had no reasonat least no very apparent reasonfor being cross unless indeed the mere fact of his being an old bachelor was a sufficient reason  perhaps it was  but in regard to everything else he had as the saying goes nothing to complain of  he was a prosperous east india merchantnot a miser though a cross old bachelor and not a millionaire though comfortably rich  his business was prosperous his friends were numerous his digestion was good his nervous system was apparently all that could be desired and he slept well  standing one morning in the familiar british position before his diningroom fire in london he frowningly contemplated his housekeeper as that indefatigable woman removed the breakfast equipage  has the young man called this morning  not yet sir  well when he comes tell him i had business in the city and could wait no  a ring and a sharp knock interrupted him  a few moments later charlie brooke was ushered into the room  it was a smallish room for mr crossley although well off did not see the propriety of wasting money on unnecessary space or rent and the doorway was so low that charlies hair brushed against the top as he entered  i called mr crossley in accordance with the wish expressed in your letter  although being a stranger i do not  the young man stopped at this point and looked steadily at the old gentleman with a peculiarly questioning expression  you recognise me i see said the old man with a very slight smile  welli may be mistaken but you do bear some resemblance to  just so im the man that you hauled so violently out of the cabin of the wreck last week and shoved so unceremoniously into the lifebuoy and i have sent for you first to thank you for saving my life because they tell me that but for your swimming off with a rope we should certainly have all been lost and secondly to offer you aid in any course of life you may wish to adopt for i have been informed that you are not at present engaged in any special employment  you are very kind sir very kind returned charlie somewhat embarrassed  i can scarcely claim however to have saved your life though i thankfully admit having had the opportunity to lend a hand the rocketmen in reality did the work for without their splendid working of the apparatus my swimming off would have been useless  mr crossley frowned while the youth was speaking and regarded him with some suspicion  you admit i suppose he rejoined sternly that if you had not swum off the rocket apparatus would have been equally useless  by no means returned charlie with that benignant smile that always accompanied his opposition in argument  i do not admit that because if i had not done it assuredly some one else would  in fact a friend of mine was on the point of making the attempt when i pulled him back and prevented him  and why did you prevent him  because he was not so well able to do it as i  oh  i see  in other words you have a pretty high opinion of your own powers  possibly i have returned the youth somewhat sharply  i lay claim to no exemption from the universal law of vanity which seems to affect the entire human raceespecially the cynical part of it  at the same time knowing from long experience that i am physically stronger can swim better and have greater power of endurance though not greater courage than my friend it would be mere pretence were i to assume that in such matters i was his inferior  you asked me why i prevented him i gave you the reason exactly and straightforwardly  i now repeat it  dont be so ready to fire up young man said crossley with a deprecating smile  i had no intention of hurting your feelings  you have not hurt them sir returned charlie with almost provoking urbanity of manner and sweetness of voice you have only misunderstood me  well well let it pass  tell me now can i do anything for you  nothing thank you  eh exclaimed the old gentleman in surprise  nothing thank you repeated his visitor  i did not save you for the purpose of being rewarded and i refuse to accept reward for saving you  for a second or two mr crossley regarded his visitor in silence with a conflicting mixture of frown and smilea sort of acidulateddrop expression on his rugged face  then he asked  what is the name of this friend whom you prevented from swimming off to us  shank leather  is he a very great friend of yours  very  we have been playmates from childhood and schoolfellows till now  what is hehis profession i mean  nothing at present  that is to say he has like myself been trained to no special profession and the failure of the firm in the countinghouse of which we have both served for some months has cast us adrift at the same time  would it give you much satisfaction if i were to find good employment for your friend  indeed it wouldthe highest possible satisfaction exclaimed charlie with the first symptom of enthusiasm in his tone and look  what can your friend shank leather do asked the old man brusquely  oh many things  hes capital at figures thoroughly understands bookkeeping andand is a hardworking fellow whatever he puts his hand to  is he steady  charlie was silent for a few moments  well one cannot be sure he answered with some hesitation what meaning you attach to the word steady  i  yes yes i see interrupted crossley consulting his watch  no time to discuss meanings of words just now  will you tell your friend to call on me here the day after tomorrow at six oclock  you live in sealford i have been told does he live near you  yes within a few minutes walk  well tell him to be punctual  punctuality is the soul of business hope i wont find your friend as independent as you seem to be  you are quite sure are you that i can do nothing for you  i have both money and influence  the more determined that our hero became to decline all offers of assistance from the man who had misconstrued his motives the more of urbanity marked his manner and it was with a smile of ineffable goodnature on his masculine features that he repeated nothing thank youquite sure  you will have done me the greatest possible service when you help my friend  yetstay  you mentioned money  there is an institution in which i am much interested and which you might appropriately remember just now  what is that  the lifeboat institution  but it was not the lifeboat institution that saved me  it was the rocket apparatus  true but it might have been a lifeboat that saved you  the rockets are in charge of the coastguard and need no assistance whereas the lifeboat service depends on voluntary contributions and the fact that it did not happen to save mr crossley from a grave in the sea does not affect its claim to the nations gratitude for the hundreds of lives saved by its boats every year  admitted my young friend your reasoning is just said the old gentleman sitting down at a writing table and taking a chequebook from a drawer what shall i put down  you know your circumstances best said charlie somewhat amused by the question  most people in ordinary circumstances returned the old man slowly as he wrote contribute a guinea to such charities  many people remarked charlie with a feeling of pity rather than contempt contribute five or even fifteen  ah indeedyes well mr brooke will you condescend to be the bearer of my contribution  fourteen saint john street adelphi is not far from this and it will save a penny of postage you know  mr crossley rose and handed the cheque to his visitor who felt half disposedon the strength of the postage remarkto refuse it and speak his mind somewhat freely on the subject but his eye happening to fall on the cheque at the moment he paused  you have made a mistake i think he said  this is for five hundred pounds  i make no mistakes mr brooke returned the old man sternly  you said something about five or fifteen  i could not well manage fifteen hundred just now for it is bad times in the city at present  indeed according to some people it is always bad times there and to say truth some people are not far wrongat least as regards their own experiences  now i must be off to business  goodbye  dont forget to impress on your friend the importance of punctuality  jacob crossley held out his hand with an expression of affability which was for him quite marvellous  youre a much better man than i thought exclaimed charlie grasping the proffered hand with a fervour that caused the other to wince  young sir returned crossley regarding the fingers of his right hand somewhat pitifully people whose physique is moulded on the pattern of samson ought to bear in mind that rheumatism is not altogether unknown to elderly men  your opinion of me was probably erroneous to begin with and it is certainly false to end with  let me advise you to remember that the gift of money does not necessarily prove anything except that a man has money to givenay it does not always prove even that for many people are notoriously prone to give away money that belongs to somebody else  five hundred pounds is to some men not of much more importance than five pence is to others  everything is relative  goodbye  while he was speaking mr crossley rang the bell and politely opened the diningroom door so that our hero found himself in the street before he had quite recovered from his astonishment  please sir said mrs bland to her master after charlie was gone capen stride is awaitin in the library  send him here said crossley once more consulting his watch  well captain stride ive had a talk with him he said as an exceedingly broad heavy shortlegged man entered with a bald head and a general air of salt water tar and whiskers about him  sit down have you made up your mind to take command of the walrus  well mr crossley since youre so very good said the seacaptain with a modest look i had feared that the loss o  never mind the loss of the brig captain  it was no fault of yours that she came to grief  other shipowners may do as they please  i shall take the liberty of doing as i please  so if you are ready the ship is ready  i have seen captain stuart and i find that he is down with typhoid fever poor fellow and wont be fit for duty again for many weeks  the walrus must sail not later than a week or ten days hence  she cant sail without a captain and i know of no better man than yourself so if you agree to take command there she is if not ill find another man  im agreeable sir said captain stride with a gratified meek look on his large bronzed facea look so very different from the leonine glare with which he was wont to regard tempestuous weather or turbulent men  of course itll come rather sudden on the missus but wen it blows hard whats a man got to do but make all snug and stand by  quite true stride i have no doubt that you are nautically as well as morally correct so i leave it to you to bring round the mistress and consider that matter as settled  by the way i hope that she and your little girl have not suffered from the wetting and rough handling experienced when being rescued  not in the least sir thankee  in fact i incline to the belief that they are rather more frisky than usual in consekince  leastwise little maggie is  glad to hear it  now about that young fellow  by which i spose you mean mr brooke sir  the same  he has just left me and upon my word hes about the coolest young fellow i ever met with  thats just what i said to the missus sir the very night arter we was rescued  the way that young feller come off maggie says i is most extraornar  no fish that  yes yes stride i know but thats not exactly what i mean its his being so amazingly independent that  zactly what i said sir  maggie says i that young feller seemed to be quite independent of fin or tail for he came right off in the teeth o wind and tide  thats not what i mean either captain interrupted the old gentleman with slight impatience  its his independent spirit i refer to  oh  i ax your pardon sir  well now listen and dont interrupt me  but first let me ask does he know that i am the owner of the brig that was lost  yes he knows that  does he know that i also own the walrus  no im pretty sure he dont  leastwise i didnt tell him an theres nobody else down there as knows anything about you  so far good  now stride i want you to help me  the young goose is so proud or i know not what that he wont accept any favours or rewards from me and i find that he is out of work just now so im determined to give him something to do in spite of himself  the present supercargo of the walrus is a young man who will be pleased to fall in with anything i propose to him  i mean therefore to put him in another ship and appoint young brooke to the walrus  fortunately the firm of withers and company does not reveal my namei having been company originally though im the firm now so that he wont suspect anything and what i want is that you should do the engaging of him being authorised by withers and companyyou understand  i follow you sir  but what if he objects  he wont object  i have privately inquired about him  he is anxious to get employment and has strong leanings to an adventurous life on the sea  theres no accounting for taste captain  right you are sir replied the captain with an approving nod thats what i said only this mornin to my missus  maggie says i salt water hasnt a good taste as even the stoopidest of mortals knows but wen a man has had to lick it off his lips at sea for the better part of half a century its astonishin how he not only gits used to it but even comes to like the taste of it  pooh says she dont tell me you likes it for you dont  its all a dlusion an a snare  i hates both the taste an the smell of it  maggie says i quite solemnlike that may be so but youre not me  no thank goodness says shewhich you mustnt suppose sir meant as she didnt like me for shes a truehearted affectionate creeturthough i say it as shouldntbut she meant that shed have had to go to sea reglar if she had been me an that would have done for her in about six weeks more or less for the first time she ever went she was all but turned inside  if youre going citywards interrupted mr crossley again pulling out his watch we may as well finish our talk in the street  as captain stride was quite agreeable to this proposal the two left the house together and hailing a hansom drove off in the direction of the city    chapter four  drifting on the rocks  on the seashore not far from the spot where the brig had been wrecked charlie brooke and shank leather walked up and down engaged in earnest conversation soon after the interviews just described  very different was the day from that on which the wreck had taken place it seemed almost beyond possibility that the serene sky above and the calm glinting ocean which rippled so softly at their feet could be connected with the same world in which inky clouds and snowy foam and roaring billows had but a short time before held high revelry  well charlie said his friend after a pause it was very good of you old boy and i hope that ill do credit to your recommendation the old man seems a decent sort of chap though somewhat crossgrained  he is kindhearted shank i feel quite sure of that and hope sincerely that you will get on well with him  with him repeated leather you dont seem to understand that the situation he is to get for me is not in connection with his own business whatever that may be  it is in some other city firm the name of which he has not yet mentioned  i cant myself understand why he is so close  perhaps because he has been born with a secretive nature suggested charlie  may be so  however thats no business of mine and it doesnt do to be too inquisitive when a man is offering you a situation of two hundred a year  it would be like looking a gifthorse in the mouth  all i care about is that im to go to london next week and begin workwhy you dont seem pleased to hear of my good fortune continued leather turning a sharp look on his friend who was gazing gravely at the sand in which he was poking holes with his stick  i congratulate you shank with all my heart and you know it butim sorry to find that you are not to be in connection with mr crossley himself for there is more good in him than appears on the surface  did he then make no mention of the nature of his own business  none whatever  to say truth that mysteriousness or secrecy is the only point about the old fellows character that i dont like said leather with a frown of virtuous disapproval  all fair and aboveboard thats my motto  speak out your mind and fear nothing  at these noble sentiments a faint smile if we may say so hovered somewhere in the recesses of charlie brookes interior but not the quiver of a muscle disturbed the solemnity of his face  the secrecy of his nature seems even to have infected that skipper withor rather bywhom he was wrecked continued leather for when i asked him yesterday about the old gentleman he became suddenly silent and when i pressed him he made me a rigmarole speech something like this young man i make it a rule to know nothin whatever about my passengers  as i said only two days past to my missus maggie says i its of no use your axin me  my passengers business is their business and my business is mine  all ive got to do is to sail my ship an see to it that i land my passengers in safety  you made a pretty mess of your business then the last trip said i for i was bothered with his obvious determination not to give me any information  right you are young man said he and it would have been a still prettier mess if your friend mr brooke hadnt come off wi that there line  i laughed at this and recovered my temper but i could pump nothing more out of him  perhaps there was nothing to pumpbut now tell me how is itfor i cannot understandthat you refused all offers to yourself  you are as much out of work just now as i am  thats true shank and really i feel almost as incapable of giving you an answer as captain stride himself  you see during our conversation mr crossley attributed meanat all events wrongmotives to me and somehow i felt that i could not accept any favour at his hands just then  i suspect i was too hasty  i fear it was false pride  ha ha laughed leather pride  i wonder in what secret chamber of your big corpus your pride lies  well i dont know  it must be pretty deep  perhaps it is engrained and cannot be easily recognised  that last is true charlie  assuredly it cant be recognised for its not there at all  why if you had been born with a scrap of false pride you and i could never have been friendsfor i hate it  shank leather in saying this had hit the nail fairly on the head although he had not intelligently probed the truth to the bottom  in fact a great deal of the friendship which drew these young men together was the result of their great dissimilarity of character  they acted on each other somewhat after the fashion of a welladjusted piece of mechanism the ratchets of selfishness and cogwheels of vanity in shank fitting easily into the pinions of goodwill and modesty which characterised his friend so that there was no jarring in their intercourse  this alone would not perhaps have induced the strong friendship that existed if it had not been coupled with their intimacy from childhood and if brooke had not been particularly fond of shanks invalid mother and recognised a few of her good characteristics faintly reproduced in her son while shank fully appreciated in charlie that amiable temperament which inclines its happy possessor to sympathise much with others to talk little of self to believe all things and to hope all things to the verge almost of infantine credulity  well well resumed charlie with a laugh however that may be i did decline mr crossleys offers but it does not matter much now for that same worthy captain who bothered you so much has told me of a situation of which he has the gift and has offered it to me  you dont say so  is it a good one  yes and well paid im told though i dont know the exact amount of the salary yet  and have you accepted  i have  mother agreed after some demur that it is better than nothing so like you i begin work in a few days  well now how strangely things do happen sometimes said leather stopping and looking out seaward where the remains of the brig could still be distinguished on the rocks that had fixed her doom  but for that fortunate wreck and our saving the people in her you and i might still have been whistling in the ranks of the great unemployedand what sort of a situation is it charlie  you will smile perhaps when i tell you  it is to act as supercargo of the walrus which is commanded by captain stride himself  young leathers countenance fell  why charlie he said that means that youre going away to sea  i fear it does  soon  in a week or two  for some little time leather did not speak  the news fell upon him with a shock of disagreeable surprise for apart from the fact that he really loved his friend he was somehow aware that there were not many other young men who cared much for himselfin regard to which he was not a little surprised for it never occurred to him that egotism and selfishness had anything to do with the coolness of his friends or that none but men like our hero with sweet tempers and selfforgetting dispositions could by any possibility put up with him  who are the owners of the walrus charlie he asked as they turned into the lane that led from the beach to the village  withers and company of london  hmdont know them  they must be trustful fellows however to take a captain into their employ who has just lost his vessel  they have not taken him into their employ said charlie  captain stride tells me he has been in their service for more than a quarter of a century and they exonerate him from all blame in the loss of the brig  it does seem odd to me however that he should be appointed so immediately to a new ship but as you remarked thats none of my business  come ill go in with you and congratulate your mother and may on your appointment  they had reached the door of shank leathers house by that time  it was a poorlooking house in a poor side street or blind alley of the village the haunt of riotous children during the daytime and of maddening cats at night  stray dogs now and then invaded the alley but for the most part it was to children and cats that the region was given over  here for the purpose of enabling the proverbial two ends to meet dwelt a considerable population in houses of diminutive size and small accommodation  a few of these were persons who having seen better days were anxious to hide their poverty and existence from the friends of those better days  there was likewise a sprinkling of individuals and families who having grown callous to the sorrows of earth had reached that condition wherein the meeting of the two ends is a matter of comparative indifference because they never met and were never more expected to meetthe blank annually left gaping being filled up somehow by a sort of compromise between bankruptcy charity and starvation  to the second of these the leather family belonged  they had been brought to their sad condition by that prolific source of human misery the bottle  to do the family justice it was only the father who had succumbed  he had been a gentleman he was now a sot  his wifedelicate owing to bad treatment sorrow and insufficient nourishmentwas ever had been and ever would be a lady and a christian  owing to the last priceless condition she was still alive  it is despair that kills and despair had been banished from her vocabulary ever since she had laid down the arms of her rebellion and accepted the saviour of mankind as her guide and consolation  but sorrow suffering toil had not departed when the demon despair fled away  they had however been wonderfully lightened and one of the brightest gleams of hope in her sad life was that she might possibly be used as the means of saving her husband  there were other gleams of light however one of the brightest of them being that may her only daughter was loving and sympatheticor as she sometimes expressed it as good as gold  but there was also a very dark spot in her life shank her only son was beginning to show a tendency to tread in his fathers steps  many golden texts were enshrined in the heart of poor mrs leather and not a few of thesepainted by the hand of mayhung on the walls of their little sittingroom but the word to which she turned her eyes in seasons of profoundest obscurity and which served her as a sheetanchor in the midst of the wildest storms was hope thou in god for thou shalt yet praise him  and alongside of that text whenever she thought of it or chanced to look at it there invariably flashed another immanuel god with us  may and her mother were alone when the young men entered the former was at her lessons the latter busy with knittingneedles  knitting was the means by which mrs leather with constant labour and inexhaustible perseverance managed to fill up the gap between the beforementioned two ends which her dissolute husband failed to draw together  she could read or assist may with her lessons while her delicate fingers working below the table performed miraculous gyrations with steel and worsted  to most male minds we presume this is utterly incomprehensible  it is well not to attempt the description of that which one does not understand  the good lady knitted socks and stockings and mittens and cuffs and comforters and other things in absolutely overwhelming quantities so that the accumulation in the press in which she stored them was at times quite marvellous  yet that press never quite filled up owing to the fact that there was an incurable leak in ita sort of secret channelthrough which the products of her toil flowed out nearly as fast as she poured them in  this leak in the worsted press strange to say increased wonderfully just after the wreck described in a previous chapter and the rivulet to which it gave rise flowed in the direction of the backdoor of the house emptying itself into a reservoir which always took the form of a little elderly lady with a plain but intensely lovable countenance who had been perhaps still was governess in a family in a neighbouring town where mrs leather had spent some of her better days  her name was molloy  like a burglar miss molloy came in a stealthy manner at irregular intervals to the backdoor of the house and swept the press of its contents made them up into a bundle of enormous size and carried them off on the shoulders of an appropriately disreputable blackguard boyas shank called himwhom she retained for the purpose  unlike a burglar however miss molloy did not bolt with the swag but honestly paid for everything from the hugest pair of gentlemens fishing socks to the smallest pair of childrens cuffs  what miss molloy did with this perennial flow of woollen work whom she came from where she went to who discovered her and why she did it were subjects of inquiry which baffled investigation and always simmered in the minds of shank and may though the mind of mrs leather herself seemed to be little if at all exercised by it  at all events she was uncommunicative on the point and her childrens curiosity was never gratified for the mother was obdurate and torture being illegal at that time in england they had no means of compelling disclosure  it was sometimes hinted by shank that their little dog scraggy appropriately namedknew more than he chose to tell about the subject for he was generally present at the halfsecret interviews and always closed the scene with a sham but furious assault on the ever contemptuous blackguard boy  but scraggy was faithful to his trust and revealed nothing  i cant tell you how glad i am mrs leather about shanks good fortune said charlie with a gentle shake of the hand which mr crossley would have appreciated  like the nasmyth steamhammer which flattens a ton of iron or gently cracks a hazelnut our herculean hero could accommodate himself to circumstances as your son says it has been a lucky wreck for us  lucky indeed for him responded the lady instantly resuming her knitting which she generally kept down near her lap well hidden by the table while she looked at her visitor and talked but not very pleasant for those who have lost by it  pooh mother nobody has lost by it said shank in his freeandeasy style  the owners dont lose because of course it was insured and the insurance companies cant be said to lose for the value of a small brig will be no more felt by them than the losing of a pin would be felt by yourself and the captain wont loseexcept a few seagarments and things o that kindfor he has been appointed to another ship already by the way mother that reminds me that charlie has also got a situation through this lucky wreck for captain stride feels so grateful that he has offered him the situation of supercargo in his new ship  for once mrs leathers knittingneedles came to a sudden stop and she looked inquiringly at her young friend  so did may  have you accepted it  well yes  i have  im so sorry said may i dont know what shank will do without you  at that moment a loud knocking was heard at the door  may rose to open it and mrs leather looked anxiously at her son  a savage undertoned growl and an unsteady step told all too plainly that the head of the house had returned home  with sudden interest in worsted fabrics which he was far from feeling charlie brooke turned his back to the door and leaning forward took up an end of the work with which the knitter was busy  thats an extremely pretty pattern mrs leather  does it take you long to make things of the kind  not long ii make a good many of them  she said this with hesitation and with her eyes fixed on the doorway through the opening of which her husband thrust a shaggy dishevelled head with dissipation stamped on a countenance which had evidently been handsome once  but charlie saw neither the husbands head nor the poor wifes gaze for he was still bending over the worstedwork in mild admiration  under the impression that he had not been observed mr leather suddenly withdrew his head and was heard to stumble upstairs under the guidance of may  then the bang of a door followed by a shaking of the slimlybuilt house suggested the idea that the poor man had flung himself on his bed  shank leather said charlie brooke that same night as they strolled on the seashore you gave expression to some sentiments today which i highly approved of  one of them was speak out your mind and fear nothing  i mean to do so now and expect that you will not be hurt by my following your advice  well exclaimed shank with a dubious glance for he disliked the seriousness of his friends tone  your father began charlie  please dont speak about him interrupted the other  i know all that you can say  his case is hopeless and i cant bear to speak about it  well i wont speak about him though i cannot agree with you that his case is hopeless  but it is yourself that i wish to speak about  you and i are soon to separate it must be for a good long whileit may be for ever  now i must speak out my mind before i go  my old playmate schoolfellow and chum you have begun to walk in your poor fathers footsteps and you may be sure that if you dont turn round all your hopes will be blastedat least for this lifeperhaps also for that which is to come  now dont be angry or hurt shank  remember that you not only encouraged me but advised me to speak out my mind  yes but i did not advise you to form a false uncharitable judgment of your chum returned leather with a dash of bitterness in his tone  i admit that im fond of a social glass and that i sometimes though rarely take a littlea very littlemore than perhaps is necessary but that is very different from being a drunkard which you appear to assume that i am  nay shank i dont assume that  what i said was that you are beginning to walk in your dear fathers footsteps  no man ever yet became a drunkard without beginning  and i feel certain that no man ever when beginning had the most distant intention or expectation of becoming a drunkard  your danger dear old fellow lies in your not seeing the danger  you admit that you like a social glass  shank i candidly make the same admissioni like itbut after seeing your father and hearing your defence the danger has been so deeply impressed on me that from this hour i resolve god helping me never more to taste a social glass  well charlie you know yourself best returned his friend airily and if you think yourself in so great danger of course your resolve is a very prudent one but for myself i admit that i see no danger and i dont feel any particular weakness of will in regard to temptation  ah shank you remind me of an eccentric old lady i have heard of who was talking with a friend about the difficulties of life  my dear said the friend i do find it such a difficult thing to resist temptationdont you  no replied the eccentric old lady i dont for i never resist temptation i always give way to it  i cant quite make out how your anecdote applies to me charlie  dont you see  you feel no weakness of will in regard to temptation because you never give your will an opportunity of resisting it  you always give way to it  you see i am speaking out my mind freelyas you have advised  yes and you take the whole of my advice and fear nothing else you would not risk a quarrel by doing so  but really my boy its of no use your troubling your head on that subject for i feel quite safe and i dont mean to give in so theres an end ont  our hero persevered notwithstanding and for some time longer sought to convince or move his friend both by earnest appeal and light pleasantry but to all appearance without success although he reduced him to silence  he left him at last and went home meditating on the truth of the proverb that a man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still    chapter five  all things to all men  under the influence of favouring breezes and bright skies the walrus swept gaily over the ocean at the beginning of her voyage with stunsls slow and aloft royals and skyscrapers according to captain stride  at least if these were not the exact words he used they express pretty well what he meant namely a cloud of canvas  but this felicitous state of things did not last  the tropics were reached where calms prevailed with roasting heat  the southern atlantic was gained and gales were met with  the celebrated cape was doubled and the gales if we may say so were trebled  the indian ocean was crossed and the china seas were entered where typhoons blew some of the sails to ribbons and snapped off the topmasts like pipestems  then she sailed into the great pacific and for a time the walrus sported pleasantly among the coral islands  during all this time and amid all these changes charlie brooke true to his character was the busiest and most active man on board  not that his own special duties gave him much to do for until the vessel should reach port these were rather light but our heroas stride expressed itmust always be doing  if he had not work to do he made itchiefly in the way of assisting other people  indeed there was scarcely a man or boy on board who did not have the burden of his toil whatever it was lightened in consequence of young brookes tendency to put his powerful shoulder voluntarily to the wheel  he took the daily observations with the captain and worked out the ships course during the previous twentyfour hours  he handled the adze and saw with the carpenter learned to knot and splice and to sew canvas with the bosns mate commented learnedly and interestingly on the preparation of food with the cook and spun yarns with the men on the forecastle or listened to the longwinded stories of the captain and officers in the cabin  he was a splendid listener being much more anxious to ascertain exactly the opinions of his friends and mates than to advance his own of course it followed that charlie was a favourite  with his insatiable desire to acquire information of every kind he had naturally when at home learned a little roughandtumble surgery with a slight smattering of medicine  it was not much but it proved to be useful as far as it went and his little knowledge was not dangerous because he modestly refused to go a single step beyond it in the way of practice unless indeed he was urgently pressed to do so by his patients  in virtue of his attainments real and supposed he came to be recognised as the doctor of the ship for the walrus carried no medical man  look here brooke said the only passenger on boarda youth of somewhat delicate constitution who was making the voyage for the sake of his healthive got horrible toothache  dyou think you can do anything for me  lets have a look at it said charlie with kindly interest though he felt half inclined to smile at the intensely lugubrious expression of the youths face  why raywood that is indeed a bad tooth nothing that i know of will improve it  theres a cavern in it big and black enough to call to remembrance the black hole of calcutta  a redhot wire might destroy the nerve but i never saw one used and should not like to try it  horrible exclaimed raywood  ive been mad with pain all the morning and cant afford to be driven madder  perhaps somewhere or other in the ship there may be aathingumy  a whatumy inquired the other  a key ororpincers groaned raywood for extractingoh man couldnt you pull it out  easily said charlie with a smile  ive got a pair of forceps always carry them in case of need but never use them unless the patient is very bad and must have it out  poor raywood protested with another groan that his was a case in point and it must come out so charlie sought for and found his forceps  it wont take long i suppose said the patient rather nervously as he opened his mouth  oh no  only a moment or  a fearful yell followed by a gasp announced to the whole ships company that a crisis of some sort had been passed by some one and the expert though amateur dentist congratulated his patient on his deliverance from the enemy  only three of the ships company however had witnessed the operation one was dick darvall the seaman who chanced to be steering at the time and who could see through the open skylight what was being enacted in the cabin  another was the captain who stood beside him  the third was the cabinboy will ward who chanced to be cleaning some brasses about the skylight at the time and was transfixed by what we may style delightfully horrible sensations  these three watched the proceedings with profound interest some sympathy and not a little amusement  mind your helm darvall said the captain stifling a laugh as the yell referred to burst on his ears  ay ay sir responded the seaman bringing his mind back to his duty as he bestowed a wink on the brasspolishing cabinboy  hes up to everything said darvall in a low voice referring to our hero  from pitchandtoss to manslaughter responded the boy with a broad grin  i do believe mr brooke that you can turn your hand to anything said captain stride as charlie came on deck a few minutes later  did you ever study doctoring or surgery  not regularly answered charlie but occasionally ive had the chance of visiting hospitals and dissectingrooms besides hearing lectures on anatomy and i have taken advantage of my opportunities  besides im fond of mechanics and toothdrawing is somewhat mechanical  of course i make no pretension to a knowledge of regular dentistry which involves i believe a scientific and prolonged education  may be so mr brooke returned the captain but your knowledge seems deep and extensive enough to me for except in the matter o navigation i havent myself had much schoolin but i do like to see a fellow that can use his hands  as i said to my missus not two days before i left er maggie says i a man that cant turn his hands to anything aint worth his salt  for why  hes useless at sea an by consequence cant be of much value on land  your reasoning is unanswerable returned charlie with a laugh  not so sure o that rejoined the captain with a modestly dubious shake of his head leastwise however unanswerable it may be my missus always manages to answer itsomehow  at that moment one of the sailors came aft to relieve the manatthewheel  dick darvall was a grave tall dark and handsome man of about fiveandtwenty with a huge black beard as fine a seaman as one could wish to see standing at a ships helm but he limped when he left his post and went forward  hows the leg today darvall asked young brooke as the man passed  better sir thankee  thats well  ill change the dressing in halfanhour  dont disturb it till i come  thankee sir i wont  now then raywood said charlie descending to the cabin where his patient was already busy reading maurys physical geography of the sea lets have a look at the gum  oh its all right said raywood  dyou know i think one of the uses of severe pain is to make one inexpressibly thankful for the mere absence of it  of course there is a little sensation of pain left which might make me growl at other times but that positively feels comfortable now by contrast  there is profound sagacity in your observations returned charlie as he gave the gum a squeeze that for a moment or two removed the comfort there now dont suck it else youll renew the bleeding  keep your mouth shut  with this caution the amateur dentist left the cabin and proceeded to the forepart of the vessel  in passing the stewards pantry a youthful voice arrested him  oh please sir said will ward the cabinboy advancing with a slate in his hand i cant make out the sum you set me yesterday an im quite sure ive tried and tried as hard as ever i could to understand it  let me see said his friend taking the slate and sitting down on a locker  have you read over the rule carefully  yes sir i have a dozen times at least but it wont come right answered the boy with wrinkles enough on his young brow to indicate the very depths of puzzlement  fetch the book will and lets examine it  the book was brought and at his teachers request the boy read  add the interest to the principal and then multiply by  multiply said charlie interrupting  look  he pointed to the sum on the slate and repeated multiply  oh exclaimed the cabinboy with a gasp of relief and wideopen eyes ive divided  thats so will and theres a considerable difference between division and multiplication as youll find all through life remarked the teacher with a peculiar lift of his eyebrows as he handed back the slate and went on his way  more than once in his progress forard he was arrested by men who wished hint to give advice or clear up difficulties in reference to subjects which his encouragement or example had induced them to take up and to these claims on his attention or assistance he accorded such a ready and cheerful response that his pupils felt it to be a positive pleasure to appeal to him though they each professed to regret giving him trouble  the boatswain who was an amiable though gruff man in his way expressed pretty well the feelings of the ships company towards our hero when he said i tell you mates id sooner be rubbed up the wrong way an kicked down the fore hatch by mr brooke than id be smoothed or buttered by anybody else  at last the focsl was reached and there our surgeon found his patient dick darvall awaiting him  the stout seamans leg had been severely bruised by a block which had fallen from aloft and struck it during one of the recent gales  a good deal better today said charlie  does it pain you much  not nearly as much as it did yesterday sir  its my opinion that ill be all right in a day or two  seems to me outrageous to make so much ado about it  if we didnt take care of it my man it might cost you your limb and we cant afford to bury such a wellmade member before its time  you must give it perfect rest for a day or two  ill speak to the captain about it  id rather you didnt sir objected the seaman  i feel able enough to go about and my matesll think im shirkin dooty  theres not a man aboard asll think that o dick darvall growled the boatswain who had just entered and heard the last remark  right bosn said brooke you have well expressed the thought that came into my own head  have ye seen samson yet sir asked the boatswain with an unusually grave look  no i was just going to inquire about him  no worse i hope  i think he is sir  seems to me that he aint long for this world the lifes bin too much for him he never was cut out for a sailor an he takes things so much to heart that i do believe worry is doin more than work to drive him on the rocks  ill go and see him at once said our hero  fred samson the sick man referred to had been put into a swingcot in a berth amidships to give him as much rest as possible  to all appearance he was slowly dying of consumption  when brooke entered he was leaning on one elbow gazing wistfully through the porthole close to his head  his countenance on which the stamp of death was evidently imprinted was unusually refined for one in his station in life  im glad you have come mr brooke he said slowly as his visitor advanced and took his thin hand  my poor fellow said charlie in a tone of low but tender sympathy i wish with all my heart i could do you any good  the sight of your kind face does me good returned the sailor with a pause for breath between almost every other word  i dont want you to doctor me any more  i feel that im past that but i want to give you a message and a packet for my mother  of course you will be in london when you return to england  will you find her out and deliver the packet  it contains only the testament she gave me at parting and a letter  my dear fellowyou may depend on me replied brooke earnestly where does she live  in whitechapel  the full address is on the packet  the letter enclosed tells all that i have to say  but you spoke of a message said brooke seeing that he paused and shut his eyes  yes yes returned the dying man eagerly i forgot  give her my dear love and say that my last thoughts were of herself and god  she always feared that i was trusting too much in myselfin my own good resolutions and reformation so i have beenbut thats past  tell her that god in his mercy has snapped that broken reed altogether and enabled me to rest my soul on jesus  as the dying man was much exhausted by his efforts to speak his visitor refrained from asking more questions  he merely whispered a comforting text of scripture and left him apparently sinking into a state of repose  then having bandaged the finger of a man who had carelessly cut himself while using his knife aloft charlie returned to the cabin to continue an interrupted discussion with the first mate on the subject of astronomy  from all which it will be seen that our heros tendencies inclined him to be as much as possible all things to all men    chapter six  disaster starvation and death  the least observant of mortals must have frequently been impressed with the fact that events and incidents of an apparently trifling description often lead to momentoussometimes tremendousresults  soon after the occurrence of the incidents referred to in the last chapter a colony of busy workers in the pacific ocean were drawing towards the completion of a building on which they had been engaged for a long time  like some lighthouses this building had its foundations on a rock at the bottom of the sea  steadily perseveringly and with little cessation the workers had toiled for years  they were small insignificant creatures each being bent on simply performing the little bit of work which he she or it had been created to do probably without knowing or caring what the result might be and then ending his her or its modest labours with life  it was when this marine building had risen to within eight or ten feet of the surface of the sea that the walrus chanced to draw near to it but no one on board was aware of the existence of that coralreef for up to the period we write of it had failed to attract the attention of chartmakers  the vessel was bowling along at a moderate rate over a calm sea for the light breeze overhead that failed to ruffle the water filled her topsails  had the wind been stormy a line of breakers would have indicated the dangerous reef  as it was there was nothing to tell that the good ship was rushing on her doom till she struck with a violent shock and remained fast  of course captain stride was equal to the emergency  by the quiet decision with which he went about and gave his orders he calmed the fears of such of his crew as were apt to lose their heads in the midst of sudden catastrophe  lower away the boats lads  well get her off right a way he said in a quick but quiet tone  charlie brooke being a strong believer in strict discipline at once ran to obey the order accompanied by the most active among the men while others ran to slack off the sheets and lower the topsails  in a few minutes nearly all the men were in the boats with hawsers fixed to the stern of the vessel doing their uttermost to pull her off  charlie had been ordered to remain on deck when the crew took to the boats  come here mr brooke i want you said the captain leading his young friend to the taffrail  its pretty clear to me that the poor old walrus is done for  i sincerely hope not sir said charlie with anxious looks  a short time will settle the question returned the captain with unwonted gravity  if she dont move in a few minutes ill try what heaving out some o the cargo will do  as supercargo you know where its all stowed so if youll pint out to me which is the least valooable an at the same time heaviest part of it ill send the mate and four men to git it on deck  but to tell you the truth even if we do git her off i dont think shell float  shes an oldish craft not fit to have her bottom rasped on coral rocks  but well soon see  charlie could not help observing that there was something peculiarly sad in the tone of the old mans voice  whether it was that the poor captain knew the case to be utterly hopeless or that he was overwhelmed by this calamity coming upon him so soon after the wreck of his last ship charlie could not tell but he had no time to think for after he had pointed out to the mate the bales that could be most easily spared he was again summoned aft  she dont move said the captain gloomily  we must git the boats ready for if it comes on to blow only a little harder well have to take to em  so do you and the stooard putt your heads together an git up as much provisions as you think the boats will safely carry  only necessaries of course an take plenty o water  ill see to it that charts compasses canvas and other odds and ends are ready  again young brooke went off without saying a word to carry out his instructions  meanwhile one of the boats was recalled and her crew set to lighten the ship by heaving part of the cargo overboard  still the walrus remained immovable on the reef for the force with which she struck had sent her high upon it  if we have to take to the boats sir said charlie when he was disengaged it may be well to put some medicines on board for poor samson will  ay ay do so lad said the captain interrupting ive been thinkin o that an you may as well rig up some sort o couch for the poor fellow in the longboat for i mean to take him along wi myself  are you so sure then that there is no chance of our getting her off  quite sure  look there  he pointed as he spoke to the horizon to windward where a line of cloud rested on the sea  thatll not be long o comin here  it wont blow very hard but itll be hard enough to smash the old walrus to bits  if youve got any valooables aboard that youd rather not lose youd better stuff em in your pockets now when things come to the wust mind your helm an look out as i used to say to my missus  he stopped abruptly and turned away  evidently the thought of the missus was too much for him just then  charlie brooke hurried off to visit the sick man and prepare him for the sad change in his position that had now become unavoidable  but another visitor had been to see the invalid before him  entering the berth softly and with a quiet look so as not to agitate the patient needlessly he found to his regret though not surprise that poor fred samson was dead  there was a smile on the pale face which was turned towards the port window as if the dying man had been taking a last look of the sea and sky when death laid a hand gently on his brow and smoothed away the wrinkles of suffering and care  a letter from his mother held tightly in one hand and pressed upon his breast told eloquently what was the subject of his last thoughts  charlie cut a lock of hair from the sailors brow with his claspknife and taking the letter gently from the dead hand wrapped it therein  theres no time to bury him now  his berth must be the poor fellows coffin said captain stride when the death was reported to him  the swell o the coming squall has reached us already  look alive wi the boats men  by that time the rising swell was in truth lifting the vessel every few seconds and letting her down with a soft thud on the coral reef  it soon became evident to every one on board that the walrus had not many hours to liveperhaps not many minutesfor the squall to which the captain had referred was rapidly bearing down and each successive thud became more violent than the previous one  knowing their danger full well the men worked with a will and in a few minutes three boats well provisioned were floating on the sea  the need for haste soon became apparent for the depth of water alongside was so insufficient that the longboatdrawing as she did considerably more water than the otherstouched twice when the swells let her drop into their hollows  it was arranged that charlie should go in the longboat with the captain raywood the passenger and ten men of the crew  the remainder were to be divided between the other two boats which were to be in charge of the first and second officers respectively  jump in brooke cried the captain as he sat in the sternsheets looking up at our hero who was busily engaged assisting the first mate to complete the arrangements of his boat weve struck twice already i must shove off  is raywood ready  hes in the cabin looking for something sir ill run and fetch him  stay  weve touched again shouted the captain  you an raywood can come off with one o the other boats  ill take you on board when in deep watershove off lads  jump in with me sir said the first mate as he hastily descended the side  come along raywood shouted charlie as he followed  no time to lose  the passenger rushed on deck scrambled down the side and took his seat beside charlie just as the long threatened squall burst upon them  the painter was cut and they drifted into deep water with the second mates boat which had already cast off  fortunate was it for the whole crew that captain stride had provided for every emergency and that among other safeguards he had put several tarpaulins into each boat for with these they were enabled to form a covering which turned off the waves and prevented their being swamped the squall turned out to be a very severe one and in the midst of it the three boats were so far separated that the prospect of their being able to draw together again until evening was very remote  indeed the waves soon ran so high that it required the utmost attention of each steersman to keep his craft afloat and when at last the light began to fade the boats were almost out of sight of each other  no chance i fear of our ever meeting again remarked the mate as he cast a wistful look at the southern horizon where the sail of the longboat could be barely seen like the wing of a seagull  your lot has been cast with us mr brooke so youll have to make the best of it  i always try to make the best of things replied charlie  my chief regret at present is that raywood and i being two extra hands will help to consume your provisions too fast  luckily my appetite is a poor one said raywood with a faint smile and its not likely to improve in the circumstances  im not so sure o that sir returned the mate with an air that was meant to be reassuring fresh air and exposure have effected wonders before now in the matter of healthso they say  another pull on the halyards dick that looks like a fresh squall  mind your sheets will ward  a prompt ay ay sir from dick darvall and the cabinboy showed that each was alive to the importance of the duty required of him while the other menof whom there were sixbusied themselves in making the tarpaulin coverings more secure or in baling out the water which in spite of them had found its way into the boat  charlie rose and seated himself on the thwart beside the finelooking seaman dick darvall so as to have a clearer view ahead under the sail  longboat nowhere to be seen now he murmured half to himself after a long look  no sirnor the other boat either said darvall in a quiet voice we shall never see em no more  i hope you are wrong returned charlie indeed i feel sure that the weather will clear during the night and that we shall find both boats becalmed not far off  maybe so sir rejoined the sailor in the tone of one willing to be but not yet convinced  our hero was right as to the first but not as to the second point the weather did clear during the night but when the sun arose next morning on a comparatively calm sea neither of the other boats was to be seen  in fact every object that could arrest the eye had vanished from the scene leaving only a great circular shield of blue of which their tiny craft formed the centre    chapter seven  adrift on the sea  you are ill will ward was dick darvalls first remark when there was sufficient daylight to distinguish faces  youre another was the cabinboys quick facetious retort which caused darvall to smile and had the effect of rousing the halfsleeping crew  but you are ill my boy repeated the seaman earnestly  no dick not exactly ill returned will with a faint smile but im queer  each man had spent that stormy night on the particular thwart on which he had chanced to sit down when he first entered the boat so that all were looking more or less weary but seamen are used to uncomfortable and interrupted slumbers  they soon roused themselves and began to look about and make a few comments on the weather  some recurring naturally to their beloved indulgence pulled out their pipes and filled them  have ee a light jim asked a rugged man in a sleepy tone of a comrade behind him  no jack i havent answered jim in a less sleepy tone slapping all his pockets and thrusting his hands into them  have you dick asked the rugged man in some anxiety  no i havent replied darvall in a very serious voice as he also took to slapping his pockets nonor baccy  it was curious to note at this point how every seaman in that boat became suddenly sympathetic and wide awake and took to hasty anxious examination of all his pocketsvest jacket and trousers  the result was the discovery of a good many clay pipes more or less blackened and shortened with a few plugs of tobacco but not a single match either fusee or congreve  the men looked at each other with something akin to despair  was no matches putt on board wi the grub an other things asked jim in a solemn tone  and no tobacco inquired the mate  no one could answer in the affirmative  a general sighlike a miniature squallburst from the sailors and relieved them a little jim put his pipe between his lips and meekly began if we may say so to smoke his tobacco dry  at an order from the mate the men got out the oars and began to pull for there was barely enough wind to fill the sail  no rest for us lads cept when it blows said the mate  the nearest land that i know of is five hundred miles off as the crow flies weve got a compass by good luck so we can make for it but the grub on board wont hold out for quarter o that distance so unless we fall in with a ship or fish jump aboard of us ye know whats before us  have we any spirits aboard asked the rugged man in a growling somewhat sulky voice  hearhear exclaimed jim  no jack returned the mate at least not for the purpose o lettin you have a short life an a merry one  now look here men it has pleased providence to putt you an me in something of a fix and i shouldnt wonder if we was to have some stiffish experiences before we see the end of it  it has also pleased providence to putt me here in command  you know im not given to boastin but there are times when it is advisable to have plain speakin  there is a small supply of spirits aboard and i just want to tell eemerely as a piece of useful information and to prevent any chance o future troublethat as ive got charge o them spirits i mean to keep charge of em  the mate spoke in a low soft voice without the slightest appearance of threat or determination in his manner but as he concluded he unbuttoned his pilotcloth coat and pointed to the butt of a revolver which protruded from one of his vest pockets  the men made no reply but instinctively glanced at the two biggest and strongest men in the boat  these were charlie brooke and dick darvall obviously before committing themselves further they wished if possible to read in the faces of these two what they thought of the mates speech  they failed to read much if anything at all for charlies eyes were fixed in dreamy expressionless abstraction on the horizon and dick was gazing up into the clouds with a look of intense benignitysuggesting that he was holding pleasant intercourse with any celestial creatures who might be resident there  without a word the whole crew bent to their oars and resigned themselves to the inevitable  perhaps if each man had expressed his true feelings at that moment he would have said that he was glad to know there was a firm hand at the helm  for there are few things more uncomfortable in any community large or small than the absence of discipline or the presence of a weak will in a position of power  but i say will remarked darvall who pulled the strokeoar you really do look ill  is anything the matter with ee  nothin dick cept that im tired answered the cabinboy  breakfast will put that right said our hero in an encouraging tone lets feel your pulse  hm  well might be slower  come captain he added giving the mate his new title as he turned to him will you allow me to prescribe breakfast for this patient  certainly doctor returned the mate cheerily  come lads well all have breakfast together  in a few minutes the biscuit and salt junk barrels were opened and the mate measured out an exactly equal proportion of food to each man then following the example of a celebrated commander and in order to prevent dissatisfaction on the part of any with his portion he caused one of the men to turn his back on the food and pointing to one of the portions said who shall have this  the doctor sir returned the man promptly  the portion was immediately handed to charlie brooke amid a general laugh  thus every portion was disposed of and the men sat down to eat in good humour in spite of the too evident fact that they had been at once placed on short allowance for when each had finished he assuredly wished for more though no one ventured to give expression to the wish  the only exception was the little cabinboy who made a brave attempt to eat but utterly failed at the second mouthful  come will said charlie in a kindly tone pretending to misunderstand the state of matters dont try to deceive yourself by prolonging your breakfast  that wont make more of it  see here im not up to eating much today somehow so ill be greatly obliged if you will dispose of half of mine as well as your own  next time i am hungry and you are not ill expect you to do the same  but will ward could not be thus induced to eat  he was really ill and before night was in a high fever  you may be sure that dr brooke as every one now called him did his best to help the little sufferer but of course he could do very little for all the medicines which he had prepared had been put into the longboat and in a small open boat with no comforts no medicines and on short allowance of food little could be done except to give the boy a space of the floor on which to lie to shield him from spray and to cover him with blankets  for a week the boat was carried over the sea by a fresh steady breeze during which time the sun shone out frequently so that things seemed not so wretched as one might suppose to the shipwrecked mariners  of course the poor cabinboy was an exception  although his feverish attack was a slight one he felt very weak and miserable after it  his appetite began to return however and it was evident that the short daily allowance would be insufficient for him  when this point was reached dick darvall one day when rations were being served out ventured to deliver an opinion  captain and mates all he said while a sort of bashful smile played upon his sunburnt features it do seem to me that we should agree each man to give up a share of our rations to little will ward so that he may be able to feed up a bit an git the better o this here sickness we wont feel the want of such a little crumb each an hell be ever so much the better for it  agreed chorused the men apparently without exception  all right lads said the mate while a rare smile lighted up for a moment his usually stern countenance when the need for such selfdenial comes ill call on ye to exercise it but it aint called for yet because ive been lookin after the interests o will ward while hes been ill  justice you see stands first o the virtues in my mind an its my opinion that it wouldnt be justice but something very much the reverse if we were to rob the poor boy of his victuals just because he couldnt eat them  right you are sir interposed dick darvall  well then holdin these views continued the mate i have put aside will wards share every time the rations were served so heres what belongs to himin this keg for the meat and this bag for the biscuit ready for him to fallto whenever his twist is strong enough  there were marks of hearty approval mingled with laughter among the men on hearing this but they stopped abruptly and listened for more on observing a perplexed look on their leaders face  but theres something that puzzles me about it lads resumed the mate and it is this that the grub has somehow accumulated faster than i can account for considering the smallness o the addition to the lot each time  on hearing this the men were a little surprised but charlie brooke burst into a short laugh  what he exclaimed you dont mean to say that the victuals have taken root and begun to grow do you  i dont mean to say anything returned the mate quietly but im inclined to think a good deal if youve no objection doctor  how dee feel now will said charlie stooping forward at the moment for he observed that the boywhose bed was on the floor at his feet had moved and was gazing up at him with eyes that seemed to have grown enormously since their owner fell sick  i feel queerandandim inclined to think too returned will in a faint voice  nothing more was said at that time for a sudden shift in the wind necessitated a shift of the sail but dick darvall nodded his head significantly and it came to be understood that doctor brooke had regularly robbed himself of part of his meagre allowance in order to increase the store of the cabinboy  whether they were right in this conjecture has never been distinctly ascertained  but all attempts to benefit the boy were soon after frustrated for while life was little more than trembling in the balance with will ward a gale burst upon them which sealed his fate  it was not the rougher motion of the boat that did it for the boy was used to that nor the flashing of the salt spray inboard for his comrades guarded him to some extent from that  during the alarm caused by a wave which nearly swamped the boat two of the crew in their panic seized the first things that came to hand and flung them overboard to prevent their sinking while the rest baled with cans and souwesters for their lives  the portion of lading thus sacrificed turned out to be the staff of lifethe casks of biscuit and pork  it was a terrible shock to these unfortunates when the full extent of the calamity was understood and the firmness of the mate with a sight of the revolvers alone prevented summary vengeance being executed on the wretched men who had acted so hastily in their blind terror  only a small keg of biscuit remained to them  this was soon expended and then the process of absolute starvation began  every nook and cranny of the boat was searched again and again in the hope of something eatable being found but only a small pot of lardintended probably to grease the tacklingwas discovered  with a dreadful expression in their eyes some of the men glared at it and there would no doubt have been a deadly struggle for it if the mate had not said fetch it here in a voice which none dared to disobey  it formed but a mouthful to each yet the poor fellows devoured it with the greed of ravening wolves and carefully licked their fingers when it was done  the little cabinboy had three portions allotted to him because charlie brooke and dick darvall added their allowance to his without allowing him to be aware of the fact  but the extra allowance and kindness although they added greatly to his comfort could not stay the hand of death  slowly but surely the destroyer came and claimed the young life  it was a sweet calm evening when the summons came  the sea was like glass with only that long gentle swell which tells even in the profoundest calm of oceans instability  the sky was intensely blue save on the western horizon where the sun turned it into gold  it seemed as if all nature were quietly indifferent to the sufferings of the shipwrecked men some of whom had reached that terrible condition of starvation when all the softer feelings of humanity seem dead for although no whisper of their intention passed their lips their looks told all too plainly that they awaited the death of the cabinboy with impatience that they might appease the intolerable pangs of hunger by resorting to cannibalism  charlie brooke who had been comforting the dying lad all day and whispering to him words of consolation from gods book from time to time knew well what those looks meant  so did the mate who sat grim gaunt and silent at his post taking no notice apparently of what went on around him  fortunately the poor boy was too far gone to observe the looks of his mates  there was a can of paraffin oil which had been thrown into the boat under the impression that it was something else  this had been avoided hitherto by the starving men who deemed it to be poisonous  that evening the man called jim lost control of himself seized the can and took a long draught of the oil  whether it was the effect of that we cannot tell but it seemed to drive him mad for no sooner had he swallowed it than he uttered a wild shout drew his knife sprang up and leaped towards the place where the cabinboy lay  the mate who had foreseen something of the kind drew and levelled his revolver but before he could fire charlie had caught the uplifted arm wrested the knife from the man and thrust him violently back  thus foiled jim sprang up again and with a maniacs yell leaped into the sea and swam resolutely away  even in their dire extremity the sailors could not see a comrade perish with indifference  they jumped up hastily got out the oars and pulled after him but their arms were very weak before they could overtake him the man had sunk to rise no more  it was while this scene was being enacted that the spirit of the cabinboy passed away  on ascertaining that he was dead charlie covered him with a tarpaulin where he lay but no word was uttered by any one and the mate with revolver still in hand sat theregrim and silent holding the tiller as if steering and gazing sternly on the horizon yet it was not difficult to divine the thoughts of those unhappy and sorely tried men  some by their savage glare at the cover that concealed the dead body showed plainly their dreadful desires  brooke darvall and the mate showed as clearly by their compressed lips and stern brows that they would resist any attempt to gratify these  suddenly the mates brow cleared and his eyes opened wide as he muttered under his breath a sail  a sail a sail shrieked the man in the bow at the same moment as he leaped up and tried to cheer but he only gasped and fell back in a swoon into a comrades arms  it was indeed a sail which soon grew larger and ere long a ship was descried bearing straight towards them before a very light breeze  in less than an hour the castaways stood upon her decksaved    chapter eight  ingratitude  a year or more passed away and then there came a cablegram from new york to jacob crossley esquire from captain stride  the old gentleman was at breakfast when he received it and his housekeeper mrs bland was in the act of setting before him a dish of buttered toast when he opened the envelope  at the first glance he started up overturned his cup of coffee without paying the least attention to the fact and exclaimed with emphasisas i expected  it is lost  ow could you expect it sir to be anythink else wen youve sent it all over the tablecloth said mrs bland in some surprise  it is not that mrs bland said mr crossley in a hurried manner it is my ship the walrus  of course i knew long ago that it must have been lost continued the old gentleman speaking his thoughts more to himself than to the housekeeper who was carefully spooning up the spilt coffee but the best of it is that the captain has escaped  well im sure sir said mrs bland condescending to be interested and to ignore if not to forget the coffee im very glad to ear it sir for captain stride is a pleasant cheery sort of man and would be agreeable company if e didnt use so much sealangwidge and speak so much of is missis  an im glad to ear it too sir on account o that fine young man that sailed with immr book i think was  no mrs bland it was brooke but thats the worst of the business said the old gentleman im not quite sure whether young brooke is among the saved  here is what the telegram says  from captain stride to jacob crossley  just arrived thats in new york mrs bland walrus lost  all hands left her in three boats  our boat made uninhabited island and knocked to pieces  eight months on the island  rescued by american barque  fate of other boats unknown  will be home within a couple of weeks  why it sounds like robinson crusoe sir dont it which i read when i was quite a gurl but i dont believe it myself though they do say its all true  young mr leather will be glad to ear the good noos of is friend  but this is not good news of his friend it is only uncertain news interrupted the old gentleman quickly  now i think of it mrs bland mr leather is to call here by appointment this very morning so you must be particularly careful not to say a word to him about this telegram or captain stride or anything i have told you about the lost shipyou understand mrs bland  certainly sir said the housekeeper somewhat hurt by the doubt thus implied as to the capacity of her understanding  shall i bring you some more toast sir she added with the virtuous feeling that by this question she was returning good for evil  no thank you  now mrs bland dont forget  not a word about this to any one  ooks an redot pincers wouldnt draw a syllable out of me sir returned the good woman departing with an offended air and leaving her master to understand that in her opinion such instruments might have a very different effect upon him  ass that i was to speak of it to her at all muttered mr crossley walking up and down the room with spectacles on forehead and with both hands in his trouserspockets creating disturbance among the keys and coppers  i might have known that she could not hold her tongue  it would never do to let mrs brooke remain on the tenterhooks till stride comes home to clear the matter up  poor mrs brooke  no wonder she is almost broken down  this hoping against hope is so wearing  and shes so lonely  to be sure sweet may leather runs out and in like a beam of sunshine but it must be hard very hard to lose an only son in this way  it would be almost better to know that he was dead  hm and theres that goodfornothing shank  the rascal and yet hes not absolutely good for nothingif he would only give up drink  well while theres life theres hope thank god  ill give him another trial  the old mans brow was severely wrinkled while he indulged in these mutterings but it cleared and a kindly look beamed on his countenance as he gave vent to the last expression  just then the door bell rang  mr crossley resumed the grave look that was habitual to hint and next minute shank leather was ushered into the room  the youth was considerably changed since we last met him  the year which had passed had developed him into a man and clothed his upper lip with something visible to the naked eye  it had also lengthened his limbs deepened his chest and broadened his shoulders  but here the change for the better ended  in that space of time there had come over him a decided air of dissipation and the freshness suitable to youth had disappeared  with a look that was somewhat defiant he entered the room and looked boldly at his employer  be seated mr leather said the old gentleman in a voice so soft that the young man evidently felt abashed but he as evidently steeled himself against better feelings for he replied  thank you mr crossley id rather stand  as you please returned the other restraining himself  i sent for you mr leather to tell you that i have heard with sincere regret of your last outbreak and  yes sir said shank rudely interrupting and i came here not so much to hear what you have to say about my outbreakas you are pleased to style a little jollificationas to tell you that you had better provide yourself with another clerk for i dont intend to return to your office  ive got a better situation  oh indeed exclaimed crossley in surprise  yes indeed replied shank insolently  it was evident that the youth was even at that moment under the influence of his great enemy else his better feelings would have prevented him from speaking so rudely to a man who had never shown him anything but kindness  but he was nettled by some of his bad companions having taunted him with his slavery to his besetting sin and had responded to mr crossleys summons under the impression that he was going to get what he styled a wigging  he was therefore taken somewhat aback when the old gentleman replied to his last remark gently  i congratulate you mr leather on getting a better situation if it really should turn out to be better and i sincerely hope it mayfor your mothers sake as well as your own  this therefore disposes of part of my object in asking you to callwhich was to say that i meant to pass over this offence and retain you in my employment  but it does not supersede the necessity of my urging you earnestly to give up drink not so much on the ground that it will surely lead you to destruction as on the consideration that it grieves the loving father who has bestowed on you the very powers of enjoyment which you are now prostituting and who is at this moment holding out his hands to you and waiting to be gracious  the old man stopped abruptly and shank stood with eyes fixed on the floor and frowning brow  have you anything more to say to me asked mr crossley  nothing  then goodmorning  as i can do nothing else to serve you i will pray for you  shank found himself in the street with feelings of surprise strong upon him  pray for me he muttered as he walked slowly along  it never occurred to me before that he prayed at all  the old humbug has more need to pray for himself    chapter nine  shank reveals something more of his character  taking his way to the railway station shank leather found himself ere long at his mothers door  he entered without knocking  shank exclaimed mrs leather and may in the same breath  ay mother its me  a bad shilling they say always turns up  i always turn up therefore i am a bad shilling  sound logic that eh may  im glad to see you dear shank said careworn mrs leather laying her knittingneedles on the table you know im always glad to see you but im naturally surprised for this visit is out of your regular time  has anything happened asked may anxiously  and may looked very sweet almost pretty when she was anxious  a year had refined her features developed her mind and body and almost converted her into a little woman  indeed mentally she had become more of a woman than many girls in her neighbourhood who were much older  this was in all likelihood one of the good consequences of adversity  ay may something has happened answered the youth flinging himself gaily into an armchair and stretching out his legs towards the fire i have thrown up my situation  struck work  thats all  shank  just so  dont look so horrified mother youve no occasion to for i have the offer of a better situation  besidesha ha old crossley closefisted crabbed moneymaking skinflint old crossleyis going to pray for me  think o that mothergoing to pray for me  shank dear boy returned his mother dont jest about religious things  you dont call old crossley a religious thing do you  why mother i thought you had more respect for him than that comes to you ought at least to consider his years  come shank returned mrs leather with a deprecating smile be a good boy and tell me what you meanand about this new situation  i just mean that my friend and chum and old schoolfellow ralph ritson jovial dashing musical handsome ralphyou remember himhas got me a situation in california  ralph ritson repeated mrs leather with a little sigh and an uneasy glance at her daughter whose face had flushed at the mention of the youths name  yes continued shank in a graver tone for he had observed the flush on mays face  ralphs father who is manager of a gold mine in california has asked his son to go out and assist him at a good salary and to take a clerk out with hima stout vigorous fellow well up in figures bookkeeping carpenting etcetera and ready to turn his hand to anything and ralph has chosen me  what dee think o that  from her silence and expression it was evident that the poor ladys thoughts were not quite what her son had hoped  why dont you congratulate me mother he asked somewhat petulantly  would it not be almost premature she replied with a forced smile to congratulate you before i know anything about the salary or the prospects held out to you  besides i cannot feel as enthusiastic about your friend ralph as you do  i dont doubt that he is a wellmeaning youth but he is reckless  if he had only been a man like your former friend poor charlie brooke it would have been different but  well mother its of no use wishing somebody to be like somebody else we must just take folk as we find them and i find ralph ritson a remarkably fine sensible fellow who has a proper appreciation of his friends  and hes not a bad fellow  he and charlie brooke were fond of each other when we were all schoolboys togetherat least he was fond of charlie like everybody else  but whether we like him or not does not matter now for the thing is fixed  i have accepted his offer and thrown old jacob overboard  dear shank dont be angry if i am slow to appreciate this offer said the poor lady laying aside her knitting and clasping her hands before her on the table as she looked earnestly into her sons face but you must see that it has come on me very suddenly and im so sorry to hear that you have parted with good old mr crossley in anger  we didnt part in anger interrupted shank  we were only a little less sweet on each other than usual  there was no absolute quarrel dyou think hed have promised to pray for me if there was  have you spoken yet to your father asked the lady  how could i  ive not seen him since the thing was settled  besides whats the use  he can do nothing for me an dont care a button what i do or where i go  you are wrong shank in thinking so  i know that he cares for you very much indeed  if he can do nothing for you now he has at least given you your education without which you could not do much for yourself  well of course i shall tell him whenever i see him returned the youth somewhat softened and im aware he has a sort of sneaking fondness for me but im not going to ask his advice because he knows nothing about the business  besides mother i am old enough to judge for myself and mean to take the advice of nobody  you are indeed old enough to judge for yourself said mrs leather resuming her knitting and i dont wish to turn you from your plans on the contrary i will pray that gods blessing and protection may accompany you wherever you go but you should not expect me to be instantaneously jubilant over an arrangement which will take you away from me for years perhaps  this last consideration seemed to have some weight with the selfish youth  well well mother he said rising dont take on about that travelling is not like what it used to be  a trip over the atlantic and the rocky mountains is nothing to speak of nowa mere matter of a few weeksso that a fellow can take a run home at any time to say how do to his people  im going down now to see smithers and tell him the news  stay ill go with youa bit of the way cried may jumping up and shaking back the curly brown hair which still hung in native freedom and girlish fashionon her shoulders  may had a charming and rare capacity for getting ready to go out at a moments notice  she merely threw on a coquettish straw hat which had a knack of being always at hand and which clung to her pretty head with a tenacity that rendered strings or elastic superfluous  one of her brothers companionswe dont know whichwas once heard to say with fervour that no hat would be worth its ribbons that didnt cling powerfully to such a head without assistance  a shawl too or cloak was always at hand somehow and had this not been so may would have thrown over her shoulders an antimacassar or tablecloth rather than cause delayat least we think so though we have no absolute authority for making the statement  dear shank she said clasping both hands over his arm as they walked slowly down the path that led to the shore is it really all true that you have been telling us  have you fixed to go off withwith mr ritson to california  quite true i never was more in earnest in my life  by the way sister mine what made you colour up so when ralphs name was mentioned there youre flushing again  are you in love with him  no certainly not answered the girl with an air and tone of decision that made her brother laugh  well you neednt flare up so fiercely  you might be in love with a worse man  but why then do you blush  may was silent and hung down her head  come may youve never had any secrets from me  surely youre not going to begin nowon the eve of my departure to a foreign land  i would rather not talk about him at all said the girl looking up entreatingly  but shank looked down upon her sternly  he had assumed the parental role  may there is something in this that you ought not to conceal i have a right to know it as your brotheryour protector  innocent though may was she could not repress a faint smile at the idea of a protector who had been little else than a cause of anxiety in the past and was now about to leave her to look after herself probably for years to come  but she answered frankly while another and a deeper blush overspread her face  i did not mean to speak of it shank as you knew nothing and i had hoped would never know anything about it but since you insist i must tell you thatthat mr ritson im afraid loves me at least he  afraid loves you  how do you know interrupted shank quickly  well he said sothe last time we met  the rascal  had he the audacity to ask you to marry himhima beggar without a sixpence except what his father gives him  no shank i would not let him get the length of that  i told him i was too young toto think about such matters at all and said that he must not speak to me again in such a way  but i was so surprised flurried and distressed that i dont clearly remember what i said  and what did he say asked shank forgetting the parental role for a moment and looking at may with a humorous smile  indeed i can hardly tell  he made a great many absurd protestations begged me to give him no decided answer just then and said something about letting him write to me but all i am quite sure of is that at last i had the courage to utter a very decided no and then ran away and left him  that was too sharp may  ralph is a firstrate fellow with capital prospects  his father is rich and can give him a good start in life he may come back in a few years with a fortunenot a bad kind of husband for a penniless lass  shank exclaimed may letting go her brothers arm and facing him with flashing eyes and heightened colour do you really think that a fortune would make me marry a man whom i did not love  certainly not my dear sis said the youth taking mays hand and drawing it again through his arm with an approving smile  i never for a moment thought you capable of such meanness but that is a very different thing from slamming the door in a poor fellows face  youre not in love with anybody else  ralph is a fine handsome young fellow you might grow to like him in timeand if you did a fortune of course would be no disadvantage  besides he is to be my travelling companion and might write to you about me if i were ill or chanced to meet with an accident and were unable to write myselfdont you know  he could in that case write to mother said may simply  so he could returned shank laughing  i never thought o that my sharp sister  they had reached the shore by that time  the tide was out the sea was calm and the sun glinted brightly on the wavelets that sighed rather than broke upon the sands  for some distance they sauntered in silence by the margin of the sea the mind of each was busy with the same thought  each was aware of that and for some time neither seemed able to break the silence  the timid girl recovered her courage before the selfreliant man  dear shank she said pressing his arm you will probably be away for years  yes mayat least for a good long time  oh forgive me brother continued the girl with sudden earnestness butbutyou know youryour weakness  ay may i know it  call it sin if you willand my knowledge of it has something to do with my present determination for weak though i am and bad though you think me  but i dont think you bad dear shank cried may with tearful eyes i never said so and never thought so and  come come may interrupted the youth with something of banter in his manner you dont think me good do you  well nonot exactly returned may faintly smiling through her tears  well then if im not good i must be bad you know  theres no halfway house in this matter  is there not shank  is there not very good and very bad  oh well if you come to that theres prettygood and ratherbad and a host of other houses between these such as goodish and baddish but not one of them can be a halfway house  oh yes one of them canmust be  which one you little argumentative creature asked shank  why middlinggood of course  wrong cried her brother doesnt middlingbad stand beside it with quite as good a claim to be considered halfway  however i wont press my victory too far  for the sake of peace we will agree that these are semidetached houses in one blockand that will block the subject but to be serious again he added stopping and looking earnestly into his sisters face i wanted to speak to you on this weaknessthis sinand i thank you for breaking the ice  the truth is that i have felt for a good while past that conviviality  strong drink brother call it by its right name said may gently pressing the arm on which she leaned  wellhave it so  strong drink has been getting the better of memind i dont admit it has got the better of me yetonly is gettingand convivial comrades have had a great deal to do with it  now as you know im a man of some decision of character and i had long ago made up my mind to break with my companions  of course i could not very well do this whilewhile i waswell no matter why but this offer just seemed to be a sort of godsend for it will enable me to cut myself free at once and the sea breezes and rocky mountain air and goldhunting will i expect take away the desire for strong drink altogether  i hope it willindeed i am sure it will if it is gods way of leading you said may with an air of confidence  well i dont know whether it is god who is leading me or  did you not call it a godsend just now  oh but thats a mere form of speech you know  however i do know that it was on this very beach where we now stand that a friend led me for the first time to think seriously of this mattermore than a year ago  indeedwho was it asked may eagerly  my chum and old schoolfellow poor charlie brooke returned shank in a strangely altered voice  then he went on to tell of the conversation he and his friend had had on that beach and it was not till he had finished that he became aware that his sister was weeping  why may youre crying  whats the matter  god bless him said may in fervent yet tremulous tones as she looked up in her brothers face  can you wonder at my feeling so strongly when you remember how kind charlie always was to youto all of us indeedever since he was a little boy at school with you what a truehearted and steady friend he has always been  and you called him poor charlie just now as if he were dead  true indeed it is very very sad for we have great reason to fear the worst and i have strong doubt that i shall never see my old chum again but i wont give up hope for it is no uncommon thing for men to be lost at sea for years even and to turn up at last having been cast away on a desert island like robinson crusoe or something of that sort  the thoughts which seemed to minister consolation to shank leather did not appear to afford much comfort to his sister who hung her head and made no answer while her companion went on  yes may and poor charlie was the first to make me feel as if i were a little selfish though that as you know is not one of my conspicuous failings  his straightforwardness angered me a little at first but his kindness made me think much of what he said andwell the upshot of it all is that i am going to california  i am gladso glad and thankful he has had so much influence over you dear shank and now dont you thinkthatthat if charlie were with you at this moment he would advise you not to go to mr smithers to consult about your plans  for a few moments the brothers face betrayed a feeling of annoyance but it quickly cleared away  you are right may  smithers is too much of a convivial harumscarum fellow to be of much use in the way of giving sound advice  ill go to see jamieson instead  you can have no objection to himsurely  hes a quiet sober sort of man and never tries to tempt people or lead them into mischiefwhich is more than can be said of the other fellow  that is a very negative sort of goodness returned may smiling however if you must go to see some one jamieson is better than smithers but why not come home and consult with mother and me  pooh what can women know about such matters  no no may when a fellow has to go into the pros and cons of californian life it must be with men  hm the men you associate with having been at school and the desk all their lives up till now must be eminently fitted to advise on californian life  that did not occur to me at the first blush said may demurely  go home you cynical baggage and help mother to knit retorted shank with a laugh  i intend to go and see jamieson  and he went  and the negatively good jamieson who never led people into temptation had no objection to be led into that region himself so they went together to make a passing calla mere look inon smithers who easily induced them to remain  the result was that the unselfish man with decision of character returned home in the early hours of morningscrewed    chapter ten  homecoming and unexpected surprises  upwards of another year passed away and at the end of that time a ship might have been seen approaching one of the harbours on the eastern seaboard of america  her sails were worn and patched  her spars were broken and spliced  her rigging was ragged and slack and the state of her hull can be best described by the word battered  everything in and about her bore evidence of a prolonged and hard struggle with the elements and though she had at last come off victorious her dilapidated appearance bore strong testimony to the deadly nature of the fight  her crew presented similar evidence  not only were their garments ragged threadbare and patched but the very persons of the men seemed to have been riven and battered by the tear and wear of the conflict and no wonder for the vessel was a south sea whaler returning home after a three years cruise  at first she had been blown far out of her course then she was very successful in the fishing and then she was stranded on the reef of a coral island in such a position that though protected from absolute destruction by the fury of the waves she could not be got off for many months  at last the ingenuity and perseverance of one of her crew were rewarded by success  she was hauled once more into deep water and finally returned home  the man who had been thus successful in saving the ship and probably the lives of his matesfor it was a desolate isle far out of the tracks of commercewas standing in the bow of the vessel watching the shore with his companions as they drew near  he was a splendid specimen of manhood clad in a red shirt and canvas trousers while a wideawake took the place of the usual seafaring cap  he stood head and shoulders above his fellows  just as the ship rounded the end of the pier which formed one side of the harbour a small boat shot out from it  a little boy sculled the boat and apparently had been ignorant of the ships approach for he gave a shout of alarm on seeing it and made frantic efforts to get out of its way  in his wild attempts to turn the boat he missed a stroke and went backwards into the sea  at the same moment the lookout on the ship gave the order to put the helm hard astarboard in a hurried shout  prompt obedience caused the ship to sheer off a little and her side just grazed the boat  all hands on the forecastle gazed down anxiously for the boys reappearance  up he came next moment with a bubbling cry and clutching fingers  he cant swim cried one  out with a lifebelt shouted another  our tall seaman bent forward as they spoke and just as the boy sank a second time he shot like an arrow into the water  hes all safe now remarked a seaman quietly and with a nod of satisfaction even before the rescuer had reappeared  and he was right  the redshirted sailor rose a moment later with the boy in his arms  chucking the urchin into the boat he swam to the pierhead with the smooth facility and speed of an otter climbed the wooden piles with the ease of an athlete walked rapidly along the pier and arrived at the head of the harbour almost as soon as his own ship  thats the tenth life hes saved since he came aboardto say nothin o savin the ship herself remarked the captain to an inquirer after the vessel had reached her moorings  an none o the lives was as easy to manage as that one  some o them much harder  we will follow this magnificent seaman for a time good reader  having obtained permission to quit the south sea whaler he walked straight to the office of a steam shipping company and secured a forecabin passage to england  he went on board dressed as he had arrived in the red shirt ducks and wideawakeminus the salt water the only piece of costume which he had added to his wardrobe was a huge doublebreasted pilotcloth coat with buttons the size of an eggcup he was so unused however to such heavy clothing that he flung it off the moment he got on board the steamer and went about thereafter in his red flannel shirt and ducks  hence he came to be known by every one as red shirt  this man with his darkblue eyes deeply bronzed cheeks fair hair moustache and beard and tall herculean form was nevertheless so soft and gentle in his manners so ready with his smile and help and sympathy that every man woman and child in the vessel adored him before the third day was over  previous to that day many of the passengers owing to internal derangements were incapable of any affection except selflove and to do them justice they had not much even of that  arrived at liverpool red shirt after seeing a poor invalid passenger safely to his abode in that city and assisting one or two families with young children to find the stations boats or coaches that were more or less connected with their homes got into a thirdclass carriage for london  on reaching the metropolis he at once took a ticket for sealford  just as the train was on the point of starting two elderly gentlemen came on the platform in that eager haste and confusion of mind characteristic of late passengers  this way captain cried one hailing the other and pointing energetically with his brown silk umbrella to the sealford carriages  no no  its at the next platform returned the captain frantically  i say it is here shouted the first speaker sternly  come sir obey orders  they both made for an open carriagedoor  it chanced to be a third class  a strong hand was held out to assist them in  thank you said the eldest elderly gentlemanhe with the brown silk umbrellaturning to red shirt as he sat down and panted slightly  i feared that wed be late sir remarked the other elderly gentleman on recovering breath  we are not late captain but we should have been late for certain if your obstinacy had held another half minute  well mr crossley i admit that i made a mistake about the place but you must allow that i made no mistake about the hour  i was sure that my chronometer was right  if theres one thing on earth that i can trust to as reglar as the sun it is this chronometer pulling it out as he spoke and it never fails  as i always said to my missus maggie i used to say when you find this chronometer fail oh bother you an your chronometer she would reply takin the wind out o my sailsfor my missus has a freeaneasy way o doin that  youve just come off a voyage young sir if i mistake not said crossley turning to red shirt for he had quite as freeandeasy a way of taking the wind out of captain strides sails as the missus  yes i have just returned answered red shirt in a low soft voice which scarcely seemed appropriate to his colossal frame  his red garment by the way was at the time all concealed by the pilotcoat excepting the collar  going home for a spell i suppose said crossley  yes  may i ask where you last hailed from said captain stride with some curiosity for there was something in the appearance of this nautical stranger which interested him  from the southern seas  i have been away a long while in a south sea whaler  ah indeeda rough service that  rather rough but i didnt enter it intentionally  i was picked up at sea with some of my mates in an open boat by the whaler  she was on the outward voyage and couldnt land us anywhere so we were obliged to make up our minds to join as hands  strange murmured captain stride  then you were wrecked somewhere or your ship foundered mayhapeh  yes we were wreckedon a coral reef  well now young man that is a strange coincidence  i was wrecked myself on a coral reef in the very same seas nigh three years ago isnt that odd  dear me this is very interesting put in mr crossley and as captain stride says a somewhat strange coincidence  is it so very strange after all returned red shirt seeing that the pacific is full of sunken coral reefs and vessels are wrecked there more or less every year  well theres some truth in that observed the captain  did you say it was a sunk reef your ship struck on  yes quite sunk  no part visible  it was calm weather at the time and a clear night  another coincidence exclaimed stride becoming still more interested calm and clear too when i was wrecked  curious remarked red shirt in a cool indifferent tone that began to exasperate the captain  yet after all there are a good many calm and clear nights in the pacific as well as coral reefs  why young man cried stride in a tone that made old crossley smile you seem to think nothing at all of coincidences  its very seldom almost neverthat one hears of so many coincidences happening on this side o the line all at oncedont you see  i see returned red shirt and the same exactly may be said of the other side o the line  i very seldomalmost neverheard of so many out there which itself may be called a coincidence dee see a sort of negative similarity  young man i would suspect you were jesting with me returned the captain but for the fact that you told me of your experiences first before you could know that mine would coincide with them so exactly  your conclusions are very just sir rejoined red shirt with a grave and respectful air but of course coincidences never go on in an unbroken chain  they must cease sooner or later  we left our wreck in three boats  no doubt you  there again cried the captain in blazing astonishment as he removed his hat and wiped his heated brow while mr crossleys eyes opened to their widest extent  we left our wreck in three boats  my ships name was  the walrus said red shirt quietly and her captains name was stride  old crossley had reached the stage that is known as petrified with astonishment  the captain being unable to open his eyes wider dropped his lower jaw instead  surely continued red shirt removing his wideawake and looking steadily at his companions i must have changed very much indeed when two of my  brooke exclaimed crossley grasping one of the sailors hands  charlie gasped the captain seizing the other hand  what they all said after reaching this point it is neither easy nor necessary to record  perhaps it may be as well to leave it to the readers vivid imagination  suffice it to say that our hero irritated the captain no longer by his callous indifference to coincidences  in the midst of the confusion of hurried question and short reply he pulled them up with the sudden query anxiously put  but now what of my mother  wellexcellently well in health my boy said crossley but woefully low in spirits about yourselfcharlie  yet nothing will induce her to entertain the idea that you have been drowned  of course we have been rather glad of thisthough most of our friends charlie have given you up for lost long ago  may leather too has been much the same way of thinking so she has naturally been a great comfort to your mother  god bless her for that  shes a good little girl said charlie  little girl repeated both elderly gentlemen in a breath and bursting into a laugh  you forget lad said the captain that three years or so makes a considerable change in girls of her age  shes a tall handsome young woman now ay and a goodlooking one too  almost as goodlookin as what my missus was about her agean not unlike my little mag in the facethe one you rescued you rememberwho is also a strappin lass now  im very glad to hear they are well captain said charlie and shank what of  he stopped for the grave looks of his friends told him that something was wrong  gone to the dogs said the captain  nay not quite gonebut goingfast  and the father  much as he was charlie only somewhat more deeply sunk  the fact is continued crossley it is this very matter that takes us down to sealford today  we have just had fresh news of shankwho is in americaand i want to consult with mrs leather about him  you see i have agents out there who may be able to help us to save him  from drink i suppose interposed our hero  from himself charlie and that includes drink and a great deal more i dare say you are awareat least if you are not i now tell youthat i have long taken great interest in mrs leather and her family and would go a long way and give a great deal to save shank  you know no of course you dont i forgotthat he threw up his situation in my officewithers and company  ay you may smile my lad but we humbugged you and got the better of you that time  didnt we captain well shank was induced by that fellow ralph ritson to go away to some goldmine or other worked by his father in california but when they reached america they got news of the failure of the company and the death of old ritson  of course the poor fellows were at once thrown on their own resources but instead of facing life like men they took to gambling  the usual results followed  they lost all they had and went off to texas or some such wild place and for a long time were no more heard of  at last just the other day a letter came from ritson to mrs leather telling her that her son is very illperhaps dyingin some out o the way place  ritson was nursing him but being ill himself unable to work and without means it would help them greatly if some money could be senteven though only a small sum  charlie brooke listened to this narrative with compressed brows and remained silent a few seconds  my poor chum he exclaimed at length then a flash of fire seemed to gleam in his blue eyes as he added if i had that fellow ritson by the  he stopped abruptly and the fire in the eyes died out for it was no part of our heros character to boastmuch less to speak harshly of men behind their backs  has money been sent he asked  not yet  it is about that business that im going to call on poor mrs leather now  we must be careful you see  i have no reason it is true to believe that ritson is deceiving us but when a youth of no principle writes to make a sudden demand for money it behoves people to think twice before they send it  ay to think three timesperhaps even four or five broke in the captain with stern emphasis  i know ralph ritson well the scoundrel an if i had aught to do wi it id not send him a penny  as i said to my  does your mother know of your arrival asked mr crossley abruptly  no i meant to take her by surprise  humph  just like you young fellows  in some things you have no more brains than geese  being made of castiron and shoeleather you assume that everybody else is or ought to be made of the same raw material dont you know that surprises of this sort are apt to kill delicate people  charlie smiled by way of reply  no sir continued the old gentleman firmly i wont let you take her by surprise  while i go round to the leathers my good friend captain stride will go in advance of you to mrs brookes and break the news to her  he is accustomed to deal with ladies  right you are sir said the gratified captain removing his hat and wiping his brow  as i said no later than yesterday to  a terrific shriek from the steamwhistle and a plunge into the darkness of a tunnel stoppedand thus lost to the world for everwhat the captain said upon that occasion    chapter eleven  tells of happy meetings and serious consultations  whether captain stride executed his commission well or not we cannot tell and whether the meeting of mrs brooke with her longlost son came to near killing or not we will not tell  enough to know that they met and that the captainwith that delicacy of feeling so noticeable in seafaring menwent outside the cottage door and smoked his pipe while the meeting was in progress  after having given sufficient time as he said for the first o the squall to blow over he summarily snubbed his pipe put it into his vest pocket and reentered  now missus youll excuse me maam for cuttin in atween you but this business o the leathers is pressin an if we are to hold a confabulation wi the family about it why  ah to be sure captain stride is right said mrs brooke turning to her stalwart son who was seated on the sofa beside her  this is a very very sad business about poor shank  you had better go to them charlie  i will follow you in a short time  mr crossley is with them at this moment  i forgot to say so mother  is he  im very glad of that returned the widow  he has been a true friend to us all  go charlie  but stay  i see may coming  the dear child always comes to me when there is anything good or sorrowful to tell  but she comes from the wrong direction  perhaps she does not yet know of mr crossleys arrival  may  can it be exclaimed charlie in an undertone of surprise as he observed through the window the girl who approached  and well might he be surprised for this although the same may was very different from the girl he left behind him  the angles of girlhood had given place to the rounded lines of young womanhood  the rich curly brown hair which used to whirl wildly in the seabreezes was gathered up in a luxuriant mass behind her graceful head and from the forehead it was drawn back in two wavy bands in defiance of fashion which at that time was beginning to introduce the detestable modern fringe perhaps we are not quite unbiassed in our judgment of the said fringe far it is intimately associated in our mind with the savages of north america whose dirty red faces in years past were wont to glower at us from beneath just such a fringe long before it was adopted by the fair dames of england  in other respects however may was little changed except that the slightest curl of sadness about her eyebrows made her face more attractive than ever as she nodded pleasantly to the captain who had hastened to the door to meet her  so glad to see you captain stride she said shaking hands with unfeminine heartiness  have you been to see mother  i have just been having a walk before  she stopped as if transfixed for at that moment she caught sight of charlie and his mother through the open door  poor may flushed to the roots of her hair then she turned deadly pale and would have fallen had not the gallant captain caught her in his arms  but by a powerful effort of will she recovered herself in time to avoid a scene  the sight of you reminded me so strongly of our dear shank she stammered when charlie hastening forward grasped both her hands and shook them warmly  besidessome of us thought you were dead  no wonder you thought of shank returned charlie for he and i used to be so constantly together  but dont be cast down may  well get shank out of his troubles yet  yes and you know he has ritson with him said mrs brooke and he although not quite as steady as we could wish will be sure to care for such an old friend in his sickness  but youd better go charlie and see mrs leather  they will be sure to want you and captain stride may will remain here with me  sit down beside me dear i want to have a chat with you  perhaps maam if i make so bold interposed the captain mr crossley may want to have miss may also at the council of war  mr crossley is he with my mother asked the girl eagerly  yes miss may he is  then i must be there  excuse me dear mrs brooke  and without more ado may ran out of the house  she was followed soon after by charlie and the captain and mrs brooke was left alone expressing her thankfulness and joy of heart in a few silent tears over her knitting  there was a wonderful similarity in many respects between mrs brooke and her friend mrs leather  they both knittedcontinuously and persistently  this was a convenient if not a powerful bond for it enabled them to sit for hours togetherbusy yet free to talk  they were both invalidsa sympathetic bond of considerable strength  they held the same religious viewsan indispensable bond where two people have to be much together and are in earnest  they were both poora natural bond which draws people of a certain kind very close together physically as well as spirituallyand both up to this time at least had longabsent and semilost sons  even in the matter of daughters they might be said in a sense to be almost equal for may loving each was a daughter to both  lastly in this matter of similarity the two ladies were goodgood as gold according to captain stride and he ought to have been an authority for he frequently visited them and knew all their affairs  fortunately for both ladies mrs brooke was by far the strongermindedhence they never quarrelled  in mrs leathers parlour a solemn conclave was seated round the parlour table  they were very earnest for the case under consideration was urgent as well as very pitiful  poor mrs leathers face was wet with tears and the pretty brown eyes of may were not dry  they had had a long talk over the letter from ritson which was brief and to the point but meagre as to details  i rather like the letter considering who wrote it observed mr crossley laying it down after a fourth perusal  you see he makes no whining or discontented reference to the hardness of their luck which young scapegraces are so fond of doing nor does he make effusive professions of regret or repentance which hypocrites are so prone to do  i think it bears the stamp of being genuine on the face of it  at least it appears to be straightforward  im so glad you think so mr crossley said mrs leather for mr ritson is such a pleasant young manand so goodlooking too  the old gentleman and the captain both burst into a laugh at this  im afraid said the former that good looks are no guarantee for good behaviour  however i have made up my mind to send him a small sum of moneynot to shank mrs leather so you need not begin to thank me i shall send it to ritson  well thank you all the same interposed the lady taking up her knitting and resuming operations below the table gazing placidly all the while at her friends like some consummate conjuror for ralph will be sure to look after shank  the only thing that puzzles me is how are we to get it sent to such an outotheway placetraitors trap  its a bad name and the stupid fellow makes no mention of any known town near to it though he gives the postoffice  if i only knew its exact whereabouts i might get some one to take the money to him for i have agents in many parts of america  after prolonged discussion of the subject mr crossley returned to town to make inquiries and the captain went to take his favourite walk by the seashore where he was wont when paying a visit to sealford to drive the leathers little dog halfmad with delight by throwing stones into the sea for scraggy to go in forwhich he always did though he never fetched them out  in the course of that day charlie brooke left his mother to take a stroll and naturally turned in the direction of the sea  when halfway through the lane with the high banks on either side he encountered may  what a pleasant pretty girl she has become was his thought as she drew near  nobler and handsomer than ever was hers as he approached  the thoughts of both sent a flush to the face of each but the colour scarcely showed through the bronzed skin of the man  why what a woman you have grown may said charlie grasping her hand and attempting to resume the old familiar termswith however imperfect success  isnt that natural asked may with a glance and a little laugh  that glance and that little laugh insignificant in themselves tore a veil from the eyes of charlie brooke  he had always been fond of may leather after a fashion  now it suddenly rushed upon him that he was fond of her after another fashion  he was a quick thinker and just reasoner  a poor man without a profession and no prospects has no right to try to gain the affections of a girl  he became grave instantly  may he said will you turn back to the shore with me for a little i want to have a talk about shank  i want you to tell me all you know about him  dont conceal anything  i feel as if i had a right to claim your confidence for as you know well he and i have been like brothers since we were little boys  may had turned at once and the tears filled her eyes as she told the sad story  it was long and the poor girl was graphic in detail  we can give but the outline here  shank had gone off with ritson not long after the sailing of the walrus  on reaching america and hearing of the failure of the company that worked the gold mine and of old ritsons death they knew not which way to turn  it was a tremendous blow and seemed to have rendered them reckless for they soon took to gambling  at first they remained in new york and letters came home pretty regularly in which shank always expressed hopes of getting more respectable work  he did not conceal their mode of gaining a livelihood but defended it on the ground that a man must live  for a time the letters were cheerful  the young men were lucky  then came a change of luck and a consequent change in the letters which came less frequently  at last there arrived one from shank both the style and penmanship of which told that he had not forsaken the great curse of his lifestrong drink  it told of disaster and of going off to the rockies with a party of discoverers though what they were to discover was not mentioned  from that date till now said may in conclusion we have heard nothing about them till this letter came from mr ritson telling of dear shank being so ill and asking for money  i wish any one were with shank rather than that man said charlie sternly i have no confidence in him whatever and i knew him well as a boy  nevertheless i think we may trust him  indeed i feel sure he wont desert his wounded comrade returned may with a blush  the youth did not observe the blush  his thoughts were otherwise engaged and his eyes were at the moment fixed on a faroff part of the shore where captain stride could be seen urging on the joyful scraggy to his fruitless labours  i wish i could feel as confident of him as you do may  however misfortune as well as experience may have made him a wiser perhaps a better man  but what troubles me most is the uncertainty of the money that mr crossley is going to send ever reaching its destination  oh if we only knew some one in new york who would take it to them said may looking piteously at the horizon as if she were apostrophising some one on the other side of the atlantic  why you talk as if new york and traitors trap were within a few miles of each other said charlie smiling gently  they are hundreds of miles apart  well i suppose they are  but i feel so anxious about shank when i think of the dear boy lying ill perhaps dying in a lonely place far far away from us all and no one but mr ritson to care for him  if i were only a man i would go to him myself  she broke down at this point and put her handkerchief to her face  dont cry may began the youth in sore perplexity for he knew not how to comfort the poor girl in the circumstances but fortunately captain stride caught sight of them at the moment and gave them a stentorian hail  hi halloo back your tooopsls  ill overhaul ye in a jiffy  how long a nautical jiffy may be we know not but in a remarkably brief space of time considering the shortness and thickness of his sealegs the captain was alongside blowing as he said like a grampus  that night charlie brooke sat with his mother in her parlour  they were alonetheir friends having considerately left them to themselves on this their first night  they had been talking earnestly about past and present for the son had much to learn about old friends and comrades and the mother had much to tell  and now mother said charlie at the end of a brief pause what about the future  surely my boy it is time enough to talk about that tomorrow or next day  you are not obliged to think of the future before you have spent even one night in your old room  not absolutely obliged mother  nevertheless i should like to speak about it  poor shank is heavy on my mind and when i heard all about him today from may i  shes wonderfully improved that girl mother  grown quite pretty  indeed she isand as good as shes pretty returned mrs brooke with a furtive glance at her son  she broke down when talking about shank today and i declare she looked quite beautiful  evidently shanks condition weighs heavily on her mind  can you wonder charlie  of course not  its natural and i quite sympathised with her when she exclaimed if i were only a man i would go to him myself  thats natural too my son  i have no doubt she would poor dear girl if she were only a man  do you know mother ive not been able to get that speech out of my head all this afternoon  if i were a manif i were a man keeps ringing in my ears like the chorus of an old song and then  well charlie what then asked mrs brooke with a puzzled glance  why then somehow the chorus has changed in my brain and it runsi am a man  i am a man  well asked the mother with an anxious look  wellthat being so i have made up my mind that i will go out to traitors trap and carry the money to shank and look after him myself that is if you will let me  o charlie how can you talk of it said mrs brooke with a distressed look  i have scarcely had time to realise the fact that you have come home and to thank god for it when you begin to talk of leaving me againperhaps for years as before  nay mother mine you jump to conclusions too hastily  what i propose is not to go off again on a long voyage but to take a run of a few days in a firstclass steamer across what the americans call the big fishpond then go across country comfortably by rail after that hire a horse and have a gallop somewhere or other find out shank and bring him home  the whole thing might be done in a few weeks and no chance almost of being wrecked  i dont know charlie returned mrs brooke in a sad tone as she laid her hand on her sons arm and stroked it  as you put it the thing sounds all very easy and no doubt it would be a grand a noble thing to rescue shankbutbut why talk of it tonight my dear boy it is late  go to bed charlie and we will talk it over in the morning  how pleasantly familiar that go to bed charlie sounds said the son laughing as he rose up  you did not always think it pleasant returned the good lady with a sad smile  thats true but i think it uncommonly pleasant now  goodnight mother  goodnight my son and god bless you    chapter twelve  changes the scene considerably  we must transport our reader now to a locality somewhere in the region lying between new mexico and colorado  here in a meanlooking outoftheway tavern a number of roughlooking men were congregated drinking gambling and spinning yarns  some of them belonged to the class known as cowboysmen of rugged exterior iron constitutions powerful frames and apparently reckless dispositions though underneath the surface there was considerable variety of character to be found  the landlord of the innif we may so call it for it was little better than a big shantywas known by the name of david  he was a man of cool courage  his customers knew this latter fact well and were also aware that although he carried no weapon on his person he had several revolvers in handy places under his counter with the use of which he was extremely familiar and expert  in the midst of a group of rather noisy characters who smoked and drank in one corner of this inn or shanty there was seated on the end of a packingcase a man in the prime of life who even in such rough company was conspicuously rugged  his leathern costume betokened him a hunter or trapper and the sheepskin leggings with the wool outside showed that he was at least at that time a horseman  unlike most of his comrades he wore indian moccasins with spurs strapped to them  also a cap of the broadbrimmed order  the point about him that was most striking at first sight was his immense breadth of shoulder and depth of chest though in height he did not equal many of the men around him  as one became acquainted with the man however his massive proportions had not so powerful an effect on the mind of an observer as the quiet simplicity of his expression and manner  goodnature seemed to lurk in the lines about his eyes and the corners of his mouth which latter had the peculiarity of turning down instead of up when he smiled yet withal there was a stern gravity about him that forbade familiarity  the name of the man was hunky ben and the strangest thing about him that which puzzled these wild men mostwas that he neither drank nor smoked nor gambled  he made no pretence of abstaining on principle one of the younger men who was blowing a stiff cloud ventured to ask him whether he really thought these things wrong  well now he replied quietly with a twinkle in his eye im no parson boys that i should set up to diskiver whats right an whats wrong  ive got my own notions on them points you bet but im not goin to preach em  as to smokin i wont make a smoked herrin o my tongue to please anybody  besides i dont want to smoke an why should i do a thing i dont want to just because other people does it why should i make a new want when ive got no end o wants aready thats hard enough to purvide for  drinkins all very well if a man wants dutch courage but i dont want itno nor french courage nor german nor chinee havin got enough o the article homegrowed to sarve my purpus  when thats used up i may take to drinkinwho knows same wi gamblin  ive no desire to bust up any man an i dont want to be busted up myself you bet  no doubt drinkin smokin an gamblin makes men jollythem at least thats tough an that winsbut im jolly without em boysjolly as a cottontail rabbit just come of age  an ye look it old man returned the young fellow puffing cloudlets with the utmost vigour but come ben wont ye spin us a yarn about your frontier life  yes do hunky cried another in an entreating voice for it was well known all over that region that the bold hunter was a good storyteller and as he had served a good deal on the frontier as guide to the united states troops it was understood that he had much to tell of a thrilling and adventurous kind but although the men about him ceased to talk and looked at him with expectancy he shook his head and would not consent to be drawn out  no boys it cant be done today he said ive no time for im bound for quester creek in hot haste an am only waitin here for my pony to freshen up a bit  the redskins are goin to give us trouble there by all accounts  the red devils exclaimed one of the men with a savage oath theyre always givin us trouble  that returned hunky ben in a soft voice as he glanced mildly at the speakerthat is a sentiment i heerd expressed almost exactly in the same words though in capatchee lingo some time ago by a redskin chiefonly he said it was palefaced devils who troubled him  i wonder which is worst  they cant both be worst you know  this remark was greeted with a laugh and a noisy discussion thereupon began as to the comparative demerits of the two races which was ere long checked by the sound of a galloping horse outside  next moment the door opened and a very tall man of commanding presence and bearing entered the room took off his hat and looked round with a slight bow to the company  there was nothing commanding however in the quiet voice with which he asked the landlord if he and his horse could be put up there for the night  the company knew at once from the cut of the strangers tweed suit as well as his tongue that he was an englishman not much used to the ways of the countrythough from the revolver and knife in his belt and the repeating rifle in his hand he seemed to be ready to meet the country on its own terms by doing in rome as rome does  on being told that he could have a space on the floor to lie on which he might convert into a bed if he had a blanket with him he seemed to make up his mind to remain asked for food and while it was preparing went out to attend to his horse  then returning he went to a retired corner of the room and flung himself down at full length on a vacant bench as if he were pretty well exhausted with fatigue  the simple fare of the hostelry was soon ready and when the stranger was engaged in eating it he asked a cowboy beside him how far it was to traitors trap  at the question there was a perceptible lull in the conversation and the cowboy who was a very coarse forbidding specimen of his class said that he guessed traitors trap was distant about twenty mile or so  are you goin thar stranger he asked eyeing his questioner curiously  yes im going there answered the englishman but from what ive heard of the road at the place where i stayed last night i dont like to go on without a guide and daylightthough i would much prefer to push on tonight if it were possible  wall stranger whether possible or not returned the cowboy its an ugly place to go past for theres a gang o cutthroats there thats kep the country fizzin like gingerbeer for some time past  a man thats got to go past traitors trap should go by like a greased thunderbolt an he should never go alone  is it then such a dangerous place asked the englishman with a smile that seemed to say he thought his informant was exaggerating  dangerous exclaimed the cowboy  ay an will be as long as buck tom an his boys are unhung  why stranger id get my life insured you bet before id go thar againexcept with a big crowd o men  it was along in june last year i went up that way there was nobody to go with me an i was forced to do it by myselffor i had to goso i spunked up saddled bluefire an sloped  i got on lovely till i came to a pass just on tother side o traitors trap when i began to cheer up thinkin id got off square but i hadnt gone another hundred yards when up starts buck tom an his men with hands up  i went head down flat on my saddle instead i was so riled  bang went a sixshooter an the ball just combed my back hair  i suppose buck was so took by surprise at a single man darin to disobey his orders that he missed anyhow i socked spurs into bluefire an made a break for the open country ahead  they made after me like locomotives wi the safetyvalves blocked but bluefire was moren a match for em  they kep blazin away all the time too but never touched me though i heard the balls whistlin past for a good while  bluefire an me went you bet like a noreaster in a passion an at last they gave it up  no stranger take my advice an dont go past traitors trap alone  i wouldnt go there at all if i could help it  i dont intend to go past it  i mean to go into it said the englishman with a short laugh as he laid down his knife and fork having finished his slight meal and as i cannot get a guide i shall be forced to go alone  stranger said the cowboy in surprise dye want to meet wi buck tom  not particularly  an are ye aware that buck tom is one o the most hardened sanguinacious blackguards in all colorado  i did not know it before but i suppose i may believe it now  as he spoke the englishman rose and went out to fetch the blanket which was strapped to his saddle  in going out he brushed close past a man who chanced to enter at the same moment  the newcomer was also a tall and strikingly handsome man clothed in the picturesque garments of the cowboy and fully armed  he strode up to the counter with an air of proud defiance and demanded drink  it was supplied him  he tossed it off quickly without deigning a glance at the assembled company  then in a deeptoned voice he asked  has the rankin creek company sent that account and the money  profound silence had fallen on the whole party in the room the moment this man entered  they evidently looked at him with profound interest if not respect  yes buck tom answered the landlord in his grave offhand manner they have sent it and authorised me to pay you the balance  he turned over some papers for a few minutes during which buck tom did not condescend to glance to one side or the other but kept his eye fixed sternly on the landlord  at that moment the englishman reentered went to his corner spread his blanket on the floor lay down put his wideawake over his eyes and resigned himself to repose apparently unaware that anything special was going on and obtusely blind to the quiet but eager signals wherewith the cowboy was seeking to direct his attention to buck tom  in a few minutes the landlord found the paper he wanted and began to look over it  the company owes you he said three hundred dollars ten cents for the work done said the landlord slowly  buck nodded his head as if satisfied with this  your account has run on a long while continued the landlord and they bid me explain that there is a debit of two hundred and ninetynine dollars against you  balance in your favour one dollar ten cents  a dark frown settled on buck toms countenance as the landlord laid the balance due on the counter and for a few moments he seemed in uncertainty as to what he should do while the landlord stood conveniently near to a spot where one of his revolvers lay  then buck turned on his heel and was striding towards the door when the landlord called him back  excuse my stopping you buck tom he said but theres a gentleman here who wants a guide to traitors trap  mayhap you wouldnt object to  where is he demanded buck wheeling round with a look of slight surprise  there said the landlord pointing to the dark corner where the big englishman lay apparently fast asleep with his hat pulled well down over his eyes  buck tom looked at the sleeping figure for a few moments  hm well i might guide him he said with something of a grim smile but im travelling too fast for comfort  he might hamper me  by the way he added looking back as he laid his hand on the door you may tell the rankin creek company with my compliments to buy a new lock to their office door for i intend to call on them some day soon and balance up that little account on a new system of rithmetic  tell them i give em leave to clap the one dollar ten cents to the credit of their charity account  another moment and buck tom was gone  before the company in the tavern had quite recovered the use of their tongues the hoofs of his horse were heard rattling along the road which led in the direction of traitors trap  was that really buck tom asked hunky ben in some surprise  ayor his ghost answered the landlord  i can swear to him for i saw him as clear as i see you the night he split after me said the cowboy who had warned the englishman  why didnt you put a bullet into him tonight crux asked a comrade  just soyou had a rare chance remarked another of the cowboys with something of a sneer in his tone  because im not yet tired o my life replied crux indignantly back tom has got eyes in the back o his head i do believe and shoots dead like a flash  not that time he missed you at traitors trap i think said the other  of course notcause we was both mounted that time and scurryin over rough ground like wildcats  the best o shots would miss thar an thus  besides buck tom took nothin from me an ye wouldnt have me shoot a man for missin mesurely  if youre so fond o killin why didnt you shoot him yourselfyou had a rare chance  crux grinnedfor his ugly mouth could not compass a smileas he thought thus to turn the tables on his comrade  well hes got clear off anyhow returned the comrade an its a pity for  he was interrupted by the englishman raising himself and asking in a sleepy tone if there was likely to be moonlight soon  the company seemed to think him moonstruck to ask such a question but one of them replied that the moon was due in half an hour  youve lost a good chance sir said crux who had a knack of making all his communications as disagreeably as possible unless they chanced to be unavoidably agreeable in which case he made the worst of them buck tom hisself has just bin here an might have agreed to guide you to traitors trap if youd made him a good offer  why did you not awake me asked the englishman in a reproachful tone as he sprang up grasped his blanket hastily threw down a piece of money on the counter and asked if the road wasnt straight and easy for a considerable distance  straight as an arrow for ten mile said the landlord as he laid down the change which the englishman put into an apparently wellfilled purse  ill guide you stranger for five dollars said crux  i want no guide returned the other somewhat brusquely as he left the room  a minute or two later he was heard to pass the door on horseback at a sharp trot  poor lad hell run straight into the wolfs den but why he wants to do it puzzles me remarked the landlord as he carefully cleaned a tankard  but he would take no warning  the wolf doesnt seem half as bad as hes bin painted said hunky ben rising and offering to pay his score  hallo hunkynot goin to skip are ye asked crux  i told ye i was in a hurry  only waitin to rest my pony  my road is the same as the strangers at least part o the way  ill overhaul an warn him  a few minutes more and the broadshouldered scout was also galloping along the road or track which led towards the rocky mountains in the direction of traitors trap    chapter thirteen  hunky ben is sorely perplexed  it was one of hunky bens few weaknesses to take pride in being well mounted  when he left the tavern he bestrode one of his best steedsa black charger of unusual size which he had purchased while on a trading trip in texasand many a time had he ridden it while guiding the united states troops in their frequent expeditions against illdisposed indians  taken both together it would have been hard to equal and impossible to match hunky ben and his coalblack mare  from the way that ben rode on quitting the tavern it might have been supposed that legions of wild indians were at his heels  but after going about a few miles at racing speed he reined in and finally pulled up at a spot where a very slight pathway diverged  here he sat quite still for a few minutes in meditation  then he muttered softly to himselffor ben was often and for long periods alone in the woods and on the plains and found it somewhat sociablelike to mutter his thoughts audibly  youve not cotched him up after all ben he said  black polly amost equals a streak o lightnin but the britisher got too long a start o ye an hes clearly in a hurry  now if i follow on hell hear your footfalls polly an praps be scared into goin faster to his doom  whereas if i go off the track here an drive ahead so as to git to the blue fork before him ill be able to stop the bucks little game an save the poor fellows life  buck is sure to stop him at the blue fork for its a handy spot for a roadagent a highwayman and theres no other near  hunky ben was preeminently a man of action  as he uttered or thought the last word he gave a little chirp which sent black polly along the diverging track at a speed which almost justified the comparison of her to lightning  the blue fork was a narrow pass or gorge in the hills the footpath through which was rendered rugged and dangerous for cattle because of the rocks that had fallen during the course of ages from the cliffs on either side  seen from a short distance off on the main track the mountains beyond had a brilliantly blue appearance and a few hundred yards on the other side of the pass the track forkedhence the name one fork led up to traitors trap the other to the fort of quester creek an outpost of united states troops for which hunky ben was bound with the warning that the redskins were contemplating mischief  as ben had conjectured this was the spot selected by buck tom as the most suitable place for waylaying his intended victim  doubtless he supposed that no englishman would travel in such a country without a good deal of money about him and he resolved to relieve him of it  it was through a thick belt of wood that the scout had to gallop at first and he soon outstripped the traveller who kept to the main and at that part more circuitous road and who was besides obliged to advance cautiously in several places  on nearing his destination however ben pulled up dismounted fastened his mare to a tree and proceeded the rest of the way on foot at a run carrying his repeating rifle with him  he had not gone far when he came upon a horse  it was fastened like his own to a tree in a hollow  ho ho thought ben you prefer to do yer dirty work on foot mr buck  well youre not far wrong in such a place  advancing now with great caution the scout left the track and moved through the woods more like a visible ghost than a man for he was well versed in all the arts and wiles of the indian and his moccasined feet made no sound whatever  climbing up the pass at some height above the level of the road so that he might be able to see all that took place below he at last lay down at full length and drew himself in snake fashion to the edge of the thicket that concealed him  pushing aside the bushes gently he looked down and there to his satisfaction beheld the man he was in search of not thirty yards off  buck tom was crouching behind a large mass of rock close to the track and so lost in the dark shadow of it that no ordinary man could have seen him but nothing could escape the keen and practised eye of hunky ben  he could not indeed make out the highwaymans form but he knew that he was there and that was enough  laying his rifle on a rock before him in a handy position he silently watched the watcher  during all this time the englishmanwhom the reader has doubtless recognised as charlie brookewas pushing on as fast as he could in the hope of overtaking the man who could guide him to traitors trap  at last he came to the blue forks and rode into the pass with the confidence of one who suspects no evil  he drew rein however as he advanced and picked his way carefully along the encumbered path  he had barely reached the middle of it where a clear space permitted the moonbeams to fall brightly on the ground when a stern voice suddenly broke the stillness of the night with the words  hands up  charlie brooke seemed either to be ignorant of the ways of the country and of the fact that disobedience to the command involved sudden death or he had grown unaccountably reckless for instead of raising his arms and submitting to be searched by the robber who covered him with a revolver he merely reined up and took off his hat allowing the moon to shine full on his countenance  the effect on buck tom was singular  standing with his back to the moon his expression could not be seen but his arm dropped to his side as if it had been paralysed and the revolver fell to the ground  never had buck tom been nearer to his end than at that moment for hunky ben seeing clearly what would be the consequence of the englishmans noncompliance with the command was already pressing the trigger that would have sent a bullet into buck toms brain but the englishmans strange conduct induced him to pause and the effect on the robber caused him to raise his head and open wide his eyesalso his ears  ah  ralph ritson has it come to this said charlie in a voice that told only of pity and surprise  for some moments ralph did not speak  he was evidently stunned presently he recovered and passing his hand over his brow but never taking his eyes off the handsome face of his former friend he said in a low tone  iidont feel very sure whether youre flesh and blood brooke or a spiritbutbut  im real enough to be able to shake hands ritson returned our hero dismounting and going up to his former friend who suffered him to grasp the hand that had been on the point of taking his life  but can it be true that i really find you a  it is true charlie brooke quite truebut while you see the result you do not see and cannot easily understand the hard grinding injustice that has brought me to this  the last and worst blow i received this very night  i have urgent need of moneynot for myself believe meand i came down to davids store at some personal risk i may add to receive payment of a sum due me for acting as a cowboy for many months  the company instead of paying me  yes i know i heard it all said charlie  you were only shamming sleep then  yes i knew you at once  well then continued buck tom as we shall still continue to style him the disappointment made me so desperate that i determined to rob youlittle thinking who you werein order to help poor shank leather  does shank stand in urgent need of help asked charlie interrupting  he does indeed  he has been very ill  we have run out of funds and he needs food and physic of a kind that the mountains dont furnish  does he belong to your band ritson  wellnearly not quite  that is a strange answer  how far is it to where he lies just now  six miles about  come then i will go to him if you will show me the way returned charlie preparing to remount  i have plenty of that which poor shank stands so much in need of  in fact i have come here for the express purpose of hunting him and you up  would it not be well by the way to ride back to the store for some supplies  no need answered buck tom stooping to pick up his revolver theres another store not far from this to which we can send tomorrow  we can get what we want there  but what have you done with your horse asked charlie i heard you start on one  it is not far off  ill go fetch it  so saying the robber entered the bushes and disappeared  a few minutes later the clattering of hoofs was heard and in another moment he rode up to the spot where our hero awaited him  follow me he said the road becomes better half a mile further on  during all this time hunky ben had stood with his rifle ready listening with the feelings of a man in a dream  he watched the robber and his victim ride quietly away until they were out of sight  then he stood up tilted his cap on one side and scratched his head in great perplexity  well now he said at length this is about the queerest affair ive comed across since i was raised  its a marcy i was born with a quiet spirit for another chip off the small end of a moment an buck tom would have bin with his fathers in their happy or otherwise huntin grounds  its quite clear that them two have bin friends mayhap pards in the old country  an buck tom thats ritson i think he called him has bin driven to it by injustice has he  ah  buck if all the world that suffers injustice was to take to robbery its not many respectable folk would be left to rob  well well my comin off in such a splittin hurry to take care o this britisher is a wildgoose chase arter all  its not the first one youve bin led into anyhow an its time you was lookin arter yer own business hunky ben  while giving vent to these remarks in low muttering tones the scout was quickly retracing his steps to the place where he had tied up black polly  mounting her he returned to the main track proceeded along it until he reached the place beyond the pass where the roads forked then selecting that which diverged to the left he set off at a hard gallop in the direction of quester creek    chapter fourteen  the haunt of the outlaws  after riding through the blue fork charlie and buck tom came to a stretch of open ground of considerable extent where they could ride abreast and here the latter gave the former some account of the condition of shank leather  tell me ritson said charlie what you mean by shank nearly and not quite belonging to your band  the outlaw was silent for some time  then he seemed to make up his mind to speak out  brooke he said it did till this night seem to me that all the better feelings of my naturewhatever they werehad been blotted out of existence for since i came to this part of the world the cruelty and injustice that i have witnessed and suffered have driven me to desperation and i candidly confess to you that i have come to hate pretty nigh the whole human race  the grip of your hand and tone of your voice however have told me that i have not yet sunk to the lowest possible depths  but that is not what i mean to enlarge on  what i wish you to understand is that after shank and i had gone to the dogs and were reduced to beggary i made up my mind to join a band of men who lived chiefly by their wits and sometimes by their personal courage of course i wont say who they are because we still hang together and there is no need to say what we are  the profession is variously named and not highly respected  shank refused to join me so we parted  he remained for some time in new york doing odd jobs for a living  then he joined a small party of emigrants and journeyed west  strange to say although the country is wide he and i again met accidentally  my fellows wanted to overhaul the goods of the emigrants with whom he travelled  they objected  a fight followed in which there was no bloodshed for the emigrants fled at the first warwhoop  a shot from one of them however wounded one of our men and one of theirs was so drunk at the time of the flight that he fell off his horse and was captured  that man was shank  i recognised him when i rode up to see what some of my boys were quarrelling over and found that it was the wounded man wanting to shove his knife into shank  the moment i saw his face i claimed him as an old chum and had him carried up to our headquarters in traitors trap  there he has remained ever since in a very shaky condition for the fall seems to have injured him internally besides almost breaking his neck  indeed i think his spine is damagedhe recovers so slowly  we have tried to persuade him to say that he will become one of us when he gets well but up to this time he has steadily refused  i am not sorry for to say truth i dont want to force any one into such a line of lifeand he does not look as if hed be fit for it or anything else for many a day to come  but how does it happen that you are in such straits just now asked charlie seeing that buck paused and seemed unwilling to make further explanations  well the fact is we have not been successful of late no chances have come in our way and two of our best men have taken their departureone to golddigging in california the other to the happy hunting grounds of the redskin or elsewhere  luck in short seems to have forsaken us pious folk he added with something of a sneer would say no doubt that god had forsaken us  i think pious people would not say so and they would be wrong if they did returned charlie  in my opinion god never forsakes any one but when his creatures forsake him he thwarts them  it cannot be otherwise if his laws are to be vindicated  it may be so  but what have i done said buck tom fiercely to merit the bad treatment and insufferable injustice which i have received since i came to this accursed land  i cannot stand injustice  it makes my blood boil and so since it is rampant here and everybody has been unjust to me i have made up my mind to pay them back in their own coin there seems to me even a spice of justice in that  i wonder that you cannot see the fallacy of your reasoning ritson replied charlie  you ask what have i done  the more appropriate question would be what have i not done  have you not according to your own confession rebelled against your maker and cast him off yet you expect him to continue his supplies of food to you to keep up your physical strength and powers of enjoying life and under the name of luck to furnish you with the opportunity of breaking his own commands by throwing people in your way to be robbed  besides which have you not yourself been guilty of gross injustice in leading poor weak shank leather into vicious coursesto his great if not irreparable damage i dont profess to teach theology ralph ritson my old friend but i do think that even an average cowboy could understand that a rebel has no claim to forgivenessmuch less to favouruntil he lays down his arms and gives in  had any other man but you charlie brooke said half as much as you have just said to me i would have blown his brains out returned the outlaw sternly  im very glad no other man did say it then returned charlie for your hands must be sufficiently stained already  but dont let anger blind you to the fact ralph that you and i were once old friends that i am your friend still and that what is of far greater importance the almighty is still your friend and is proving his friendship by thwarting you  you preach a strange doctrine said buck tom laughing softly but you must end your sermon here in the meantime for we have reached the entrance to traitors trap and have not room to ride further abreast i will lead and do you follow with care for the path is none o the safest  my asking you to follow me is a stronger proof than you may think that i believe in your friendship  most strangers whom i escort up this gorge are usually requested to lead the way and i keep my revolver handy lest they should stray from the track  the defile or gorge which they had reached was not inappropriately named for although the origin of the name was unknown the appearance of the place was eminently suggestive of blackness and treachery  two spurs of the mountain range formed a precipitous and rugged valley which even in daylight wore a forbidding aspect and at night seemed the very portal to erebus  keep close to my horses tail said buck tom as they commenced the ascent  if you stray here ever so little your horse will break his neck or legs  thus admonished our hero kept a firm hand on the bridle and closed up as much as possible on his guide  the moon was by this time clouded over so that with the precipitous cliffs on either side and the great mass of the mountains further up there was only that faint sombre appearance of things which is sometimes described as darkness visible the travellers proceeded slowly for besides the danger of straying off the path the steepness of the ascent rendered rapid motion impossible after riding for about three miles thus in absolute silence they came to a spot where the track became somewhat serpentine and charlie could perceive dimly that they were winding amongst great fragments of rock which were here and there overcanopied by foliage but whether of trees or bushes he could not distinguish  at last they came to a halt in front of what appeared to be a cliff  dismount here said buck in a low voice setting the example  is this the end of our ride  it is  give me the bridle  i will put up your horse  stand where you are till i return  the outlaw led the horses away leaving his former friend and schoolfellow in a curious position and a not very comfortable frame of mind  when a man is engaged in actionespecially if it be exciting and slightly dangeroushe has not time to think much about his surroundings at least about their details but now while standing there in the intense darkness in the very heartas he had reason to believeof a robbers stronghold young brooke could not help questioning his wisdom in having thus thrown himself into the power of one who had obviously deteriorated and fallen very low since the time when in england they had studied and romped together  it was too late however to question the wisdom of his conduct  there he was and so he must make the best of it  he did not indeed fear treachery in his former friend but he could not help reflecting that the reckless and perhaps desperate men with whom that friend was now associated might not be easy to restrain especially if they should become acquainted with the fact that he carried a considerable sum of money about him  he was yet pondering his position when buck tom returned  ralph ritson he said laying his hand on the arm of the outlaw youll forgive my speaking plainly to you i know  with regard to yourself i have not a shadow of doubt that you will act the part of an honourable host though you follow a dishonourable calling  but i have no guarantee that those who associate with you will respect my property now i have a considerable sum of money about me in gold and silver which i brought here expressly for the benefit of our poor friend shank leather  what would you advise me to do in regard to it  intrust it to my care said buck promptly  charlie could not see the outlaws face very clearly but he could easily detect the halfamused halfmocking tone in which the suggestion was made  my good fellow said charlie in a hearty voice you evidently think i am afraid to trust you  that is a mistake  i do not indeed trust to any remnant of good that is in your poor human nature but i have confidence in the good feeling which god is arousing in you just now  i will freely hand over the money if you can assure me that you can guard it from your comrades  this will make it secure from them returned buck with a short defiant laugh  humph exclaimed charlie with a shrug  ive not much confidence in that safeguard  no doubt in certain circumstances and on certain occasions the revolver is a most important and useful instrument but taking it all round i would not put much store by it  when you met me at the blue fork tonight for instance of what use was my revolver to me  and for the matter of that after you had dropped it on the road of what use was yours to you  it only wants one of your fellows to have more pluck and a quicker eye and hand than yourself to dethrone you at once  well none of my fellows returned buck tom goodhumouredly happen to have the advantage of me at present so you may trust me and count this as one o the certain occasions on which a revolver is a most important instrument  i dare say you are right responded charlie smiling as he drew from the breast of his coat a small bag and handed it to his companion  you know exactly of course how much is here asked buck tom  yes exactly  thats all right continued buck thrusting the bag into the bosom of his hunting coat now ill see if any o the boys are at home doubtless they are outelse theyd have heard us by this time  just wait a minute  he seemed to melt into the darkness as he spoke  another minute and he reappeared  here give me your hand he said the passage is darkish at first  charlie brooke felt rather than saw that they had passed under a portal of some sort and were advancing along a narrow passage  soon they turned to the left and a faint red lightas of firebecame visible in the distance  buck tom stopped  theres no one in the cave but him and hes asleep  follow me  the passage in which they stood led to a third and shorter one where the light at its extremity was intense lighting up the whole of the place so as to reveal its character  it was a corridor about seven feet high and four feet wide cut out of the solid earth arched in the roof and supported here and there by rough posts to make it still more secure  charlie at once concluded that it led to one of those concealed caverns of which he had heard more than once while crossing the country the entrances of which are made in zigzag form in order to prevent the possibility of a ray of light issuing from the outside opening  on reaching the end of the third passage he found that his conjecture was right for the doorway or opening on his left hand conducted into a spacious cave also hollowed out of the earth but apparently against a perpendicular cliff for the inner end of it was of unhewn rock  the roof of the cave was supported by pillars which were merely sections of pinetrees with the bark left on  these pillars and the earthen walls were adorned with antlers skulls and horns of the rocky mountain sheep necklaces of grizzlybears claws indian bows and arrows rifles short swords and various other weapons and trophies of the chase besides sundry articles of clothing  at the inner end of the cave a large fireplace and chimney had been rudely built and in this was roaring the pinewood fire which had lighted them in and which caused the whole interior to glow with a vivid glare that seemed to surpass that of noonday  a number of couches of pinebrush were spread round the walls and on one of these lay a sleeping figure  the face was turned towards the visitor who saw at a glance that it was that of his former friend and playmatebut it was terribly changed  hard toil suffering sickness dissipation had set indelible marks on it and there was a slight curve about the eyebrows which gave the idea of habitual pain  yet strange to say worn and lined though it was the face seemed far more attractive and refined than it had ever been in the days of robust health  buck tom went to the fire and began to stir the contents of a big pot that hung over it while charlie advanced and stood for some minutes gazing at the countenance of his friend unwilling to disturb his slumbers yet longing to cheer him with the glad news that he had come to succour him  he chanced however to touch a twig of the pine branches on which the sleeper lay and shank awoke instantly raised himself on one elbow and returned his friends gaze earnestly but without the slightest symptom of surprise  o charlie he said at last in a quiet voice i wish you hadnt come to me tonight  he stopped and charlie felt quite unable to speak owing to intense pity mingled with astonishment at such a reception  its too bad of you shank went on worrying me so in my dreams  im weary of it and if you only knew what a terrible disappointment it is to me when i awake and dont find you there you wouldnt tantalise me so  you always look so terribly real too  man i could almost pledge my life that you are no deception this time butbut im so used to it now that  shank my dear boy said charlie finding words at last it is no deception  he stopped abruptly for the intense look of eager anxiety doubt and hope in the thin expressive face alarmed him  charlie gasped rather than said the invalid youyou never spoke to me before in my dreams andyou never touchedthe grip of your strong ho god can it be true  at this point buck tom suddenly left off his occupation at the fire and went out of the cave    chapter fifteen  lost and found  try to be calm shank said charlie in a soothing tone as he kneeled beside the shadow that had once been his sturdy chum and put an arm on his shoulder  it is indeed myself this time  i have come all the way from england to seek you for we heard through ritson that you were ill and lost in these wilds and now through gods mercy i have found you  while charlie brooke was speaking the poor invalid was breathing hard and gazing at him as if to make quite sure it was all true  yes he said at last unable to raise his voice above a hoarse whisper lostandandfound  charlie my friendmy chummy  he could say no more but laying his head like a little child on the broad bosom of his rescuer he burst into a passionate flood of tears  albeit strong of will and not by any means given to the melting mood our hero was unable for a minute or two to make free use of his voice  come now shank old man you mustnt give way like that  you wouldnt you know if you had not been terribly reduced by illness  yes i would yes i would interrupted the sick man almost passionately id howl id roar id blubber like a very idiot id do any mortal thing if the doing of it would only make you understand how i appreciate your great kindness in coming out here to save me  oh no you wouldnt said charlie affecting an easy offhand tone which he was far from feeling you wouldnt do anything to please me  what dye mean asked shank with a look of surprise  well i mean returned the other gently that you wont even do such a trifle as to lie down and keep quiet to please me  a smile lighted up the emaciated features of the sick man as he promptly lay back at full length and shut his eyes  there charlie he said ill behave and let you do all the talking but dont let go my hand old man  keep a tight grip of it  im terrified lest you drift off again andand melt away  no fear shank  ill not let go my hold of you please god till i carry you back to old england  ah old england  ill never see it again  i feel that  but tell mehe started up again with a return of the excited lookis father any better  nno not exactlybut he is no worse  ill tell you all about everything if you will only lie down again and keep silent  the invalid once more lay back closed his eyes and listened while his friend related to him all that he knew about his family affairs and the kindness of old jacob crossley who had not only befriended them when in great distress but had furnished the money to enable him charlie to visit these outlandish regions for the express purpose of rescuing shank from all his troubles and dangers  at this point the invalid interrupted him with an anxious look  have you the money with you  yes  all of it  yes  why do you ask  because returned shank with something of a groan you are in a den of thieves  i know it my boy returned charlie with a smile and so for better security i have given it in charge to our old chum ralph ritson  what exclaimed shank starting up again with wide open eyes you have met ralph then  i have  he conducted me here  and you have intrusted your money to him  yesall of it every cent  are you aware continued shank in a solemn tone that ralph ritson is buck tomthe noted chief of the outlaws  i know it  and you trust him  i do  i have perfect confidence that he is quite incapable of betraying an old friend  for some time shank looked at his companion in surprise then an absent look came into his eyes and a variety of expressions passed over his wan visage  at last he spoke  i dont know how it is charlie but somehow i think you are right its an old complaint of mine you know to come round to your way of thinking whether i admit it or not  in days of old i usually refused to admit it but believed in you all the same  if any man had told me this morningay even half an hour sincethat he had placed money in the hands of buck tom for safe keeping knowing who and what he is i would have counted him an incurable fool but now somehow i do believe that you were quite right to do it and that your money is as safe as if it were in the bank of england  but i did not intrust it to buck tom knowing who and what he is returned charlie with a significant smile i put it into the hands of ralph ritson knowing who and what he was  youre a good fellow charlie said shank squeezing the hand that held his and i believe it is that very trustfulness of yours which gives you so great power and influence with people  i know it has influenced me for good many a time in the past and would continue to do so still if i were not past redemption  no man is past redemption said the other quietly but im glad you agree with me about ralph for  he stopped abruptly and both men turned their eyes towards the entrance to the cave  did you hear anything asked shank in a low voice  i thought sobut it must have been the shifting of a log on the fire said the other in a similarly low tone  come now charlie said shank in his ordinary tones let me hear something about yourself  you have not said a word yet about what you have been doing these three years past  as he spoke a slight noise was again heard in the passage and next moment buck tom reentered carrying a lump of meat  whether he had been listening or not they had no means of knowing for his countenance was quite grave and natural in appearance  i suppose you have had long enough you two to renew your old acquaintance he said  it behoves me now to get ready some supper for the boys against their return for they would be illpleased to come home to an empty kettle and their appetites are surprisingly strong but you neednt interrupt your conversation  i can do my work without disturbing you  we have no secrets to communicate buck returned shank and i have no doubt that the account of himself which our old chum was just going to give will be as interesting to you as to me  quite as interesting rejoined buck so pray go on brooke  i can listen while i look after the cookery  thus urged our hero proceeded to relate his own adventures at seathe wreck of the walrus the rescue by the whaler and his various experiences both afloat and ashore  the man dick darvall whom i have mentioned several times said charlie in conclusion i met with again in new york when i was about to start to come here and as i wanted a companion and he was a most suitable man besides being willing to come i engaged him  he is a rough and ready but a handy and faithful man who had some experience in woodcraft before he went to sea but i have been forced to leave him behind me at a ranch a good many miles to the south of davids store owing to the foolish fellow having tried to jump a creek in the dark and broken his horses leg  we could not get another horse at the time and as i was very anxious to push onbeing so near my journeys endand the ranch was a comfortable enough berth i left him behind as i have said with directions to stay till i should return or to push on if he could find a safe guide  while charlie brooke was relating the last part of his experience it might have been observed that the countenance of buck tom underwent a variety of curious changes like the sky of an april day  a somewhat stern frown settled on it at last but neither of his companions observed the fact being too much interested in each other  what was the name o the ranch where your mate was left asked buck tom when his guest ceased speaking  the ranch of roaring bull answered charlie  i should not wonder he added if its name were derived from its owners voice for it sounded like the blast of a trombone when he shouted to his people  not only his ranch but himself is named after his voice returned buck  his real name is jackson but it is seldom used now  every one knows him as roaring bull  hes not a bad fellow at bottom but something overbearing and has made a good many enemies since he came to this part of the country six years ago  that may be so remarked brooke but he was very kind to us the day we put up at his place and dick darvall at all events is not one of his enemies  indeed he and roaring bull took quite a fancy to each other  it seemed like love at first sight  whether jacksons pretty daughter had anything to do with the fancy on dicks part of course i cant say  now i think of it his readiness to remain behind inclines me to believe it had  well come outside with me and have a chat about old times  it is too hot for comfort here  i dare say our friend shank will spare you for quarter of an hour and the pot can look after itself  by the way it would be as well to call me buck tomor buck  my fellows would not understand ralph ritson  they never heard it before  have a cigar  no thank you i have ceased to see the advantage of poisoning onesself merely because it is the fashion to do so  the poison is wonderfully slow said buck  but not less wonderfully sure returned charlie with a smile  as you will rejoined buck rising and going outside with his visitor  the night was very still and beautiful and the clouds having cleared away the moonbeams struggled through the foliage and revealed the extreme wildness and seclusion of the spot which had been chosen by the outlaws as their fortress  charlie now saw that the approach to the entrance of the cave was a narrow neck of rock resembling a natural bridge with a deep gully on either side and that the cliff which formed the inner end of the cavern overhung its base so that if an enemy were to attempt to hurl rocks down from above these would drop beyond the cave altogether  this much he saw at a glance  the minute details and intricacies of the place of course could not be properly seen or understood in the flickering and uncertain light which penetrated the leafy canopy and as it were played with the shadows of the fallen rocks that strewed the ground everywhere and hung in apparently perilous positions on the mountain slopes  the manner of the outlaw changed to that of intense earnestness the moment he got out to the open air  charlie brooke he said with more of the tone and air of old familiar friendship than he had yet allowed himself to assume its of no use exciting poor shank unnecessarily so i brought you out here to tell you that your man dick darvall is in deadly peril and nothing but immediate action on my part can save him i must ride without delay to his rescue you cannot help me in this  i know what you are going to propose but you must trust and obey me if you would save your friends life  to accompany me would only delay and finally mar my plans  now will you  a peculiar whistle far down the gorge caused the outlaw to cease abruptly and listen  the whistle was repeated and buck answered it at once with a look of great surprise  these are my fellows back already he said  you seem surprised  did you then not expect them so soon  i certainly did not something must have gone wrong replied buck with a perplexed look  then as if some new idea had flashed upon him now look here brooke i must ask you to trust me implicitly and to act a part  your life may depend on your doing this  the first i can do with ease but as to the latter my agreeing to do so depends on whether the action you require of me is honourable  you must forgive me rits  hush  dont forget that there is no such man as ralph ritson in these mountains  my life may depend on your remembering that  of course i dont expect you to act a dishonourable partall i want you to do just now is to lie down and pretend to go to sleep  truly if that is all i am ready said charlie at all events i will shut my eyes and hold my tongue  a useful virtue at times and somewhat rare said buck leading his guest back into the cavern  now then brooke lie down there pointing to a couch of pinebrush in a corner and try to sleep if you can  our hero at once complied stretched himself at full length with his face to the light and apparently went to sleep but with his left arm thrown over his forehead as if to protect his eyes from the glare of the fire  thus he was in a position to see as well as hear all that went on  buck tom went to the sick man and whispered something to him then returning to the fire he continued to stir the big pot and sniff its savoury contents with much interest    chapter sixteen  friends and foesplots and counterplotsthe ranch in danger  in a few minutes the sound of heavy feet and gruff voices was heard in the outside passage and next moment ten men filed into the room and saluted their chief heartily  charlie felt an almost irresistible tendency to open his eyes but knew that the risk was too great and contented himself with his ears  these told him pretty eloquently what was going on for suddenly the noise of voices and clattering of footsteps ceased a dead silence ensued and charlie knew that the whole band were gazing at him with wide open eyes and probably open mouths  their attention had been directed to the stranger by the chief  the silence was only momentary however  now dont begin to whisper pards said buck tom in a slightly sarcastic tone  when will ye learn that there is nothing so likely to waken a sleeper as whisperin  be naturalbe natural and tell me as softly as ye can in your natural tones what has brought you back so soon  come jake you have got the quietest voice  the poor man is pretty well knocked up and needs rest  i brought him here  has he got much the sentence was completed by jake significantly slapping his pocket  a goodish lot  but come sit down and out wi the news  something must be wrong  wall i guess that somethin is wrong  everythings wrong as far as i can see  the redskins are up an the troops are out an so it seemed o no use our goin to bust up the ranch of roarin bull seein that the red devils are likely to be there before us  so we came back here an im glad youve got suthin in the pot for were about as empty as kettledrums  humph ejaculated buck didnt i tell you not to trouble roarin bullthat he and his boys could lick you if you had been twenty instead of ten  but how came ye to hear o this cockandbull story about the redskins  we got it from hunky ben an hes not the boy to go spreadin false reports  charlie brooke ventured at this point to open his eyelids the smallest possible bit so that any one looking at him would have failed to observe any motion in them  the little slit however admitted the whole scene to the retina and he perceived that ten of the most cutthroatlooking men conceivable were seated in a semicircle in the act of receiving portions from the big pot into tin plates  most of them were clothed in hunters leathern costume wore long boots with spurs and were more or less bronzed and bearded  buck tom alias ralph ritson although as tall and strong as any of them seemed a being of quite angelic gentleness beside them  yet buck was their acknowledged chief  no doubt it was due to the superiority of mind over matter for those outlaws were grossly material and matteroffact  there must be some truth in the report if hunky ben carried it said buck looking up quickly but i left ben sitting quietly in davids store not many hours ago  no doubt thats true captain said jake as he ladled the soup into his capacious mouth nevertheless we met hunky ben on the pineriver prairie scourin over the turf like all possessed on black polly  we stopped him of course an asked the news  news cried he why the redskins have dug up the hatchet an riz like one man  theyve clard out yellow bluff an are pourin like niagara down upon raspers creek  its said that theyll visit roarin bulls ranch tomorrow  no time for more talk boys  oratin aint in my line  im off to quester creek to rouse up the troops  wi that hunky wheeled round an went off like a runaway streak o lightnin  i sent a couple o shots after him for id took a fancy to black polly but them bullets didnt seem to hit somehow  boys cried buck tom jumping up when he heard this if hunky ben said all that you may depend ont its true an we wont have to waste time this night if were to save the ranch of roarin bull  but we dont want to save the ranch of roarin bull as far as im consarned said jake rather sulkily  buck wheeled round on the man with a fierce glare but as if suddenly changing his mind he said in a tone of wellfeigned surprise  what you jake of all mensuch a noted ladykillerindifferent about the fate of the ranch of roaring bull and pretty miss mary jackson in it at the mercy of the redskins  well if it comes to that captain ill ride as far and as fast as any man to rescue a girl pretty or plain from the redskins said jake recovering his goodhumour  well then cram as much grub as you can into you in five minutes for we must be off by that time  rise sir said buck shaking charlie with some violence  we ride on a matter of life an deathto save women  will you join us  of course i will cried charlie starting up with a degree of alacrity and vigour that favourably impressed the outlaws and shaking off his simulated sleep with wonderful facility  follow me then cried buck hastening out of the cave  but what of shank asked charlie in some anxiety when they got outside  he cannot accompany us may we safely leave him behind  quite safely  this place is not known to the savages who are on the warpath and there is nothing to tempt them this way even if it were besides shank is well enough to get up and gather firewood kindle his fire and boil the kettle for himself  he is used to being left alone see here is our stable under the cliff and yonder stands your horse saddle him  the boys will be at our heels in a moment  some of them are only too glad to have a brush wi the redskins for they killed two of our band lately  this last remark raised an uncomfortable feeling in the mind of charlie for was he not virtually allying himself with a band of outlaws with intent to attack a band of indians of whom he knew little or nothing and with whom he had no quarrel  there was no time however to weigh the case critically  the fact that savages were about to attack the ranch in which his comrade dick darvall was staying and that there were females in the place was enough to settle the question  in a minute or two he had saddled his horse which he led out and fastened to a tree and while the outlaws were busy making preparations for a start he ran back to the cave  shank said he sitting down beside his friend and taking his hand you have heard the news  my comrade darvall is in great danger  i must away to his rescue  but be sure old fellow that i will return to you soon  yes yesi know returned shank with a look of great anxiety but charlie you dont know half the danger you run  dont fight with buck tomdo you hear  of course i wont said charlie in some surprise  no no thats not what i mean said shank with increasing anxiety dont fight in company with him  at that moment the voice of the outlaw was heard at the entrance shouting come along brooke were all ready  dont be anxious about me shank ill take good care said charlie as he hastily pressed the hand of the invalid and hurried away  the ten men with buck at their head were already mounted when he ran out  pardon me he said vaulting into the saddle i was having a word with the sick man  keep next to me and close up said buck as he wheeled to the right and trotted away  down the traitors trap they went at what was to charlie a breakneck but satisfactory pace for now that he was fairly on the road a desperate anxiety lest they should be too late took possession of him across an open space they went at the bottom of which ran a brawling rivulet  there was no bridge but over or through it went the whole band without the slightest check and onward at full gallop for the country became more level and open just beyond  the moon was still shining although sinking towards the horizon and now for the first time charlie began to note with what a stern and reckless band of men he was riding and a feeling of something like exultation arose within him as he thought on the one hand of the irresistible sweep of an onslaught from such men and on the other of the cruelties that savages were known to practise  in short rushing to the rescue was naturally congenial to our hero  about the same time that the outlaws were thus hastening for once on an honourable missionthough some of them went from anything but honourable motivestwo other bands of men were converging to the same point as fast as they could go  these were a company of united states troops guided by hunky ben and a large band of indians under their warlike chief bigfoot  jackson alias roaring bull had once inadvertently given offence to bigfoot and as that chief was both by nature and profession an unforgiving man he had vowed to have his revenge  jackson treated the threat lightly but his pretty daughter mary was not quite as indifferent about it as her father  the stories of indian raids and frontier wars and barbarous cruelties had made a deep impression on her sensitive mind and when her mother died leaving her the only woman at her fathers ranchwith the exception of one or two halfbreed women who could not be much to her as companionsher life had been very lonely and her spirit had been subjected to frequent though hitherto groundless alarms  but pretty moll as she was generally called was well protected for her father besides having been a noted pugilist in his youth was a big powerful man and an expert with rifle and revolver  moreover there was not a cowboy within a hundred miles of her who would not at least thought he would not have attacked singlehanded the whole race of redskins if moll had ordered him to do so as a proof of affection  now when strapping goodlooking dick darvall came to the ranch in the course of his travels and beheld mary jackson and received the first broadside from her bright blue eyes he hauled down his colours and surrendered with a celerity which would have mightily amused the many comrades to whom he had said in days of yore that his heart was as hard as rock and he had never yet seen the woman as could soften it  but dick more than most of his calling was a modest almost a bashful man  he behaved to mary with the politeness that was natural to him and with which he would have approached any woman  he did not make the slightest attempt to show his admiration of her though it is quite within the bounds of possibility that his speaking brown eyes may have said something without his permission  mary jackson being also modest in a degree of course did not reveal the state of her feelings and made no visible attempt to ascertain his but her bluff sagacious old father was not obtuseneither was he reticent  he was a man of the worldat least of the backwoods worldand his knowledge of life as there exhibited was founded on somewhat acute experience  he knew that his daughter was young and remarkably pretty  he saw that dick darvall was also younga dashing and unusually handsome sailorsomething like what tom bowling may have been  putting these things together he came to the very natural conclusion that a wedding would be desirable believing as he did that human nature in the rockies is very much the same as to its foundation elements as it is elsewhere  moreover roaring bull was very much in want of a stout soninlaw at that time so he fanned the flame which he fondly hoped was beginning to arise this he did in a somewhat blundering and obvious manner but dick was too much engrossed with mary to notice it and mary was too ignorant of the civilised worlds ways to care much for the proprieties of life  of course this state of things created an awful commotion in the breasts of the cowboys who were in the employment of marys father and herded his cattle  their mutual jealousies were sunk in the supreme danger that threatened them all and they were only restrained from picking a quarrel with dick and shooting him by the calmly resolute look in his brown eyes coupled with his great physical power and his irresistible goodnature  urbanity seemed to have been the mould in which the spirit of this manofthesea had been cast and gentleness was one of his chief characteristics  moreover he could tell a good story and sing a good song in a fine bass voice  still further although these gallant cowboys felt intensely jealous of this newcomer they could not but admit that they had nothing tangible to go upon for the sailor did not apparently pay any pointed attention to mary and she certainly gave no special encouragement to him  there was one cowboy however of irish descent who could not or would not make up his mind to take things quietly but resolved as far as he was concerned to bring matters to a head  his name was pat reilly  he entered the kitchen on the day after dicks arrival and found mary alone and busily engaged with the dinner  miss jackson said pat theres a question ive bin wantin to ax ye for a long time past an with your lave ill putt it now  what is it mr reilly asked the girl somewhat stiffly for she had a suspicion of what was coming  a little negro girl in the back kitchen named buttercup also had a suspicion of what was coming and stationed herself with intense delight behind the door through a crack in which she could both hear and see  mary my dear said pat insinuatingly how would you like to jump into double harness with me an jog along the path o life together  poor mary being agitated by the proposal and much amused by the manner of it bent over a pot of something and tried to hide her blushes and amusement in the steam  buttercup glared grinned hugged herself and waited for more  pat erroneously supposing that silence meant consent slipped an arm round marys waist  no man had ever yet dared to do such a thing to her  the indignant girl suddenly wheeled round and brought her pretty little palm down on the cowboys cheek with all her mightand that was considerable  whos afirin off pistles in de kitchen demanded buttercup in a serious tone as she popped her woolly head through the doorway  nobody me black darlin said pat its only miss mary expressin her failins in a cheeky manner  thats all  so saying the rejected cowboy left the scene of his discomfiture mounted his mustang took his departure from the ranch of roarin bull without saying farewell and when next heard of had crossed the lonely guadaloupe mountains into lincoln county new mexico  but to return  while the troops and the outlaws were hastening thus to the rescue of the dwellers in bulls ranch and the bloodthirsty redskins were making for the same point bent on the destruction of all its inhabitants roaring bull himself his pretty daughter and dick darvall were seated in the ranch enjoying their supper all ignorant alike of the movements of friend and foe with buttercup waiting on them  one messenger however was speeding on his way to warn them of danger this was the cowboy crux who had been despatched on bluefire by hunky ben just before that sturdy scout had started to call out the cavalry at quester creek    chapter seventeen  the alarm and preparations for defence  from what you say i should think that my friend brooke wont have much trouble in findin traitors trap remarked dick darvall pausing in the disposal of a venison steak which had been cooked by the fair bands of mary jackson herself but im sorely afraid o the reception hell meet with when he gets there if the men are such awful blackguards as you describe  theyre the biggest hounds unhung growled roaring bull bringing one hand down on the board by way of emphasis while with the other he held out his plate for another steak  youre too hard on some of them father said mary in a voice the softness of which seemed appropriate to the beauty of her face  always the way wi you wenches observed the father  some o the villains are goodlookin others are ugly so the first are not so bad as the secondeh lass  mary laughed  she was accustomed to her fathers somewhat rough but not illnatured rebuffs  perhaps i may be prejudiced father she returned but apart from that surely you would never compare buck tom with jake the flint though they do belong to the same band  you are right my lass rejoined her father  they do say that buck tom is a gentleman and often keeps back his boys from devilrythough he cant always manage that an no wonder for jake the flint is the cruellest monster tween this an texas if all thats said of him be true  i wish my comrade was well out o their clutches said dick with a look of anxiety an it makes me feel very small to be sittin here enjoyin myself when i might be ridin on to help him if he should need help  dont worry yourself on that score said the host  you couldnt find your way without a guide though i was to give ye the best horse in my stablewhich id do slick off if it was of any use  theres not one o my boys on the ranch just now but therell be four or five of em in tomorrow by daylight an i promise you the first that comes in  they all know the country for three hundred miles aroundevery inchan you may ride my best horse till you drop him if ye can  there now wash down your victuals an give us a yarn or a song  im quite sure added mary by way of encouragement that with one of the outlaws for an old friend mr brooke will be quite safe among them  but hes not an outlaw miss mary broke in darvall  leastwise we have the best reason for believin that hes detained among them against his will  howsever its of no use cryin over spilt milk  im bound to lay at anchor in this port till mornin so as i cant get up steam for a song in the circumstances here goes for a yarn  the yarn to which our handsome seaman treated his audience was nothing more than an account of one of his numerous experiences on the ocean but he had such a pleasant earnest truthlike and confidential way of relating it and withal interlarded his speech with so many little touches of humour that the audience became fascinated and sat in openeyed forgetfulness of all else  buttercup in particular became so engrossed as to forget herself as well as her duties and stood behind her master in an expectant attitude glaring at the storyteller with bated breath profound sympathy and extreme readiness to appreciate every joke whether good or bad  in the midst of one of the most telling of his anecdotes the speaker was suddenly arrested by the quick tramp of a galloping horse the rider of which judging from the sound seemed to be in hot haste  all eyes were turned inquiringly on the master of the ranch  that cool individual rising with quiet yet rapid action reached down a magazine repeating rifle that hung ready loaded above the door of the room  observing this dick darvall drew a revolver from his coatpocket and followed his host to the outer door of the house  mary accompanied them and buttercup retired to the back kitchen as being her appropriate stronghold  they had hardly reached and flung open the door when bluefire came foaming and smoking into the yard with crux the cowboy on his back  wall roaring bull cried crux leaping off his horse and coming forward as quietly as if there were nothing the matter  im glad to see you ok for the cheyenne reds are on the warpath an makin tracks for your ranch  but as theyve not got here yet they wont likely attack till the moon goes down  is there any chuck goin  im half starved  ay crux lots o chuck here  come in an lets hear all about it where got ye the news  hunky ben sent me  he wasnt thinkin o you at first but when a boy came in wi the news that a crowd o the reds had gone round by pine hollowjust as he was fixin to pull out for quester creek to rouse up the cavalryhe asked me to come on here an warn you  while he was speaking the cowboy sat down to supper with the air of a man who meant business while the host and his sailor guest went to look after the defences of the place  im glad you are here dick darvall said the former for its a bad job to be obliged to fight without help agin a crowd o yellin reds my boys wont be back till sunup an by that time the game may be played out  dee think the redskins ll attack us tonight then asked the sailor as he assisted to close the gates of the yard  ay that they will lad  they know the value o time better than most men and when they see their chance are not slow to take advantage of it  as crux said they wont attack while the moon shines so we have plenty of time to git ready for them  i wish i hadnt sent off my boys but as bad luck would have it a bunch o my steers have drifted down south an i cant afford to lose themso you see theres not a man left in the place but you an me an crux to defend poor mary  for the first time in his life dick darvall felt a distinct tendency to rejoice over the fact that he was a young and powerful man  to live and if need be die for mary was worth living for  are you well supplied with arms an ammunition he asked  that am i and well need it all answered the host as he led dick round to the back of the yard where another gate required fastening  i dont see that it matters much said dick in a questioning tone whether you shut the gates or not  with so few to defend the place the house will be our only chance  when youve fought as much wi reds as i have dick youll larn that delay even for five minutes counts for a good deal  well theres somethin in that  it minds me o what one o my shipmates who had bin in the london fire brigade once said  dick said he never putt off what youve got to do  sometimes ive bin at a fire where the loss of only two minutes caused the destruction of a store worth ten thousand pound more or less  we all but saved it as it wasso near were we that if we had bin one minute sooner i do believe wed have saved it  but when we was makin for that fire full sail a deaf old applewoman came athwart our bows an got such a fright that she went flop down right in front of us  to steer clear of her wed got to sheer off so that we all but ran into a big van and what wi our lights an the yellin the horses o the van took fright and backed into us as we flew past so that we amost went down by the starn  one way or another we lost two minutes as ive said an the owners o that store lost about ten thousand poundsmore or less  that was a big pile dick observed the ranchman as they turned from the gate towards the house not easy to replace  truemy shipmate never seemed to be quite sure whether it was more or less that was lost but he thought the insurance offices must have found it out by that time  its a pity theres only three of us for that will leave one side o the house undefended  all right dick you dont trouble your head about that for buttercup fights like a black tiger  shes amost as good as a manonly she cant manage to aim so its no use givin her a rifle  shes game enough to fire it but the more she tries to hit the more shes sure to miss  however shes got a way of her own that sarves well enough to defend her side o the house  she always takes charge o the front  my mary cant fight but shes a heroine at loadinan thats somethin when youre hard pressed  come now ill show ye the shootin irons an our plan of campaign  roaring bull led the way back to the room or central hall where they had supped and here they found that the debris of their feast had already been cleared away and that arms of various kinds with ammunition covered the board  hospitable alike to friend and foe said jackson gaily  here you see mary has spread supper for the reds  darvall made no response to this pleasantry for he observed that poor marys pretty face was very pale and that it wore an expression of mingled sadness and anxiety  you wont be exposed to danger i hope said dick in a low earnest tone while jackson was loudly discussing with crux the merits of one of the repeating riflesof which there were halfadozen on the table  oh no  it is not that returned the girl sadly  i am troubled to think that however the fight goes some souls perhaps many will be sent to their account unprepared  for myself i shall be safe enough as long as we are able to hold the house and it may be that god will send us help before long  you may be quite sure returned dick with suppressed emotion that no redskin shall cross this threshold as long as we three men have a spark o life left  a sweet though pitiful smile lighted up marys pale face for a moment as she replied that she was quite sure of that in a tone which caused darvalls heart to expand so that his ribs seemed unable to contain it while he experienced a sensation of being stronger than samson and bigger than goliath  and i suppose continued dick that the troops wont be long of coming  is the manwhats his name humpy bentrustworthy  trustworthy exclaimed the maiden with a flush of enthusiasm there is not a more trustworthy man on this side of the rocky mountains or the other side either i am quite sure  poor darvalls heart seemed suddenly to find plenty of room within the ribs at that moment and his truthful visage must have become something of an index to his state of mind for to his surprise mary laughed  it seems to me so funny she continued to hear any one ask if hunkynot humpyben is to be trusted  is he then such a splendid young fellow asked the seaman with just the slightest touch of bitterness in his tone for he felt as if a rock something like gibraltar had been laid on his heart  well hes not exactly young answered mary with a peculiar expression that made her questioner feel still more uncomfortable yet he is scarcely middleaged but he certainly is the most splendid fellow on the frontier and he saved my life once  indeed how was that  well it was this way  i had been paying a short visit to his wife who lives on the other side of the  come along darvall cried roaring bull at that moment  the moons about down an well have to take our stations  we shall defend the outworks first to check them a bit and put off some time then scurry into the house and be ready for them when they try to clear the fence follow me  out wi the lights girls and away to your posts  ill hear the end of your story another time miss mary said dick looking over his shoulder and following his host and crux to the outer door  the seaman was conscious of a faint suspicion that mary was wrestling with another laugh as he went off to defend the outworks but he also happily felt that the rock of gibraltar had been removed from his heart    chapter eighteen  defence of the ranch of roaring bull  every light and every spark of fire had been extinguished in the ranch of roaring bull when its defenders issued from its doorway  they were armed to the teeth and glided across the yard to the fence or stockade that enclosed the buildings leaving the door slightly open so as to be ready for speedy retreat  it had been arranged that as there was a large open field without bush or tree in the rear of the ranch they should leave that side undefended at first  theyll never come into the open as long as they can crawl up through the bush jackson had said while making his final dispositions theyre amost sure to come up in front thinkin were all abed  now minddont stand still boys but walk along as ye fire to give em the notion theres more of us  an dont fire at nothin  theyd think we was in a funk  an when you hear me whistle get into the house as quick as a cottontail rabbit an as sly as a snake  after the moon went down everything in and around the ranch was as silent as the grave save now and then the stamp of a hoof on the floor of a shed where a number of horses stood saddled and bridled ready to mount at a moments notice for jackson had made up his mind if it came to the worst to mount and make a bold dash with all his household through the midst of his foes trusting to taking them by surprise and to his knowledge of the country for success  for a long time probably two hours the three men stood at their posts motionless and silent still there was no sign either by sight or sound of an enemy  the outline of the dark woods was barely visible against the black sky in front of each solitary watcher and no moving thing could be distinguished in the open field behind either by crux or darvall to each of whom the field was visible  jackson guarded the front  to dick unaccustomed as he was to such warfare the situation was very trying and might have told on his nerves severely if he had not been a man of iron mould as it was he had no nerves to speak of  but he was a man of lively imagination  more than fifty times within those two hours did he see a black form moving in the darkness that lay between him and the wood and more than fifty times was his winchester rifle raised to his shoulder but as often did the caution dont fire at nothin rise to his memory  the stockade was of peculiar construction because its owner and maker was eccentric and a mechanical genius  not only were the pickets of which it was composed very strong and planted with just space between to permit of firing but there was a planking of strong boards waist high all round the bottom inside which afforded some protection to defenders by concealing them when they stooped and changed position  while matters were in this state outside mary jackson and buttercup were standing at an upper window just opposite the front gate the latter with a huge bellmouthed blunderbuss of the last century loaded with buckshot in her hands  mary stood beside her sable domestic ready to direct her not as to how but where and when to use the ancient weapon  you must be very careful buttercup said mary in a low voice not to fire till i tell you and to point only where i tell you else youll shoot father  and do keep your finger off the trigger by the way have you cocked it  o missy i forgit dat answered the damsel with a selfcondemned look as she corrected the error  but don you fear missy mary  is use to dis yar blunnerbus  last time i fire im was at a raven  down hoed de raven blowd to atims an down hoed me toocause de drefful ting kicks like a texas mule  but bress you i don mind dat  is used to it  buttercup gave a little sniff of grave scorn with her flat nose as though to intimate that the ordinary ills of life were beneath her notice  we have said that all fires had been extinguished but this is not strictly correct for in the room where the two maidens watched there was an iron stove so enclosed that the fire inside did not show and as it was fed with charcoal there were neither flames nor sparks to betray its presence  on this there stood a large castiron pot full of water the bubbling of which was the only sound that broke the profound stillness of the night while the watchers scarcely breathed so intently did they listen  at last the patient and selfrestraining dick saw a dark object moving towards his side of the stockade which he felt was much too real to be classed with the creatures of his imagination which had previously given him so much trouble  without a moments hesitation the rifle flew to his shoulder and the prolonged silence was broken by the sharp report while an involuntary halfsuppressed cry proved that he had not missed his mark  the dark object hastily retreated  a neighbouring cliff echoed the sounds and two shots from his comrades told the sailor that they also were on the alert  instantly the night was rendered hideous by a series of wild yells and whoops while for a moment the darkness gave place to a glare of light as a hundred rifles vomited their deadly contents and the sound of many rushing feet was heard upon the open sward in front of the ranch  the three male defenders had ducked their heads below the protecting breastwork when the volley was fired and then discarding all idea of further care they skipped along their respective lines yelling and firing the repeaters so rapidly that to any one ignorant of the true state of things it must have seemed as if the place were defended by a legion of demons  to add to the hullabaloo buttercups blunderbuss poured forth its contents upon a group of red warriors who were rushing towards the front gate with such a cannonlike sound and such wonderful effect that the rush was turned into a sudden and limping retreat  the effect indeed was more severe even than buttercup had intended for a stray buckshot had actually taken a direction which had been feared and grazed her masters left arm  happily the wound was very slight and to do the poor damsel justice she could not see that her master was jumping from one place to another like a caged lion  like the same animal however he gave her to understand what she had done by shouting in a thunderous bass roar that fully justified his sobriquet  mind your eye buttercup  not so low next time  the immediate result of this vigorous defence was to make the indians draw off and retire to the woodspresumably for consultation  by previous arrangement the negro girl issued from the house with three fresh repeaters in her arms ran round to the combatants with them and returned with their almost empty rifles  these she and mary proceeded to reload in the hall and then returned to their post at the upper front window  the morning was by this time pretty well advanced and jackson felt a little uncertain as to what he should now do  it was still rather dark but in a very short time he knew dawn would spread over the east when it would of course be quite impossible to defend the walls of the little fort without revealing the small number of its defenders  on the other hand if they should retire at once the enemy might find a lodgement within among the outbuildings before there was light enough to prevent them by picking off the leaders in which case the assailants would be able to apply fire to the wooden wails of the house without much risk  if they manage to pile up enough o brush to clap a light to he grumbled to himself in an undertone its all up wi us  the thought had barely passed through his brain when a leaden messenger intended to pass through it carried his cap off his head and the fire that had discharged it almost blinded him  bigfoot the chief of the savages had wriggled himself snakefashion up to the stockade unseen and while roaring bull was meditating what was best to be done he had nearly succeeded in rendering him unable to do anything at all  the shot was the signal for another onslaught  once more the woods rang with fiendish yells and rattling volleys  bigfoot with the agility and strength of a gorilla leaped up and over the stockade and sprung down into jacksons arms while darvall and crux resumed their almost ubiquitous process of defence and buttercups weapon again thundered forth its defiance  this time the fight was more protracted  bigfoots career was indeed stopped for the time being for jackson not only crushed the life almost out of him by an unloving embrace but dealt him a prizefighters blow which effectually stretched him on the ground  not a moment too soon however for the white man had barely got rid of the red one when another savage managed to scale the wall  a blow from the butt of jacksons rifle dropped him and then the victor fired so rapidly and with such effect that a second time the reds were repulsed  jackson did not again indulge in meditation but blew a shrill blast on a dogwhistlea preconcerted signalon hearing which his two comrades made for the house door at full speed  only one other of the indians besides the two already mentioned had succeeded in getting over the stockade  this man was creeping up to the open door of the house and tomahawk in hand had almost reached it when dick darvall came tearing round the corner  hallo  crux cried dick that you  the fact that he received no reply was sufficient for dick who was too close to do more than drive the point of his rifle against the chest of the indian who went down as if he had been shot while dick sprang in and held open the door  a word from jackson and crux as they ran forward sufficed  they passed in and the massive door was shut and barred while an instant later at least halfadozen savages ran up against it and began to thunder on it with their riflebutts and tomahawks  to your windows shouted jackson as he sprang up the wooden staircase three steps at a time  fresh rifles here mary  yes father came in a silvery and most unwarlike voice from the hall below  another moment and three shots rang from the three sides of the house and of the three indians who were at the moment in the act of clambering over the stockade one fell inside and two out  happily daylight soon began to make objects distinctly visible and the indians were well aware that it would now be almost certain death to any one who should attempt to climb over  it is well known that as a rule savages do not throw away their lives recklessly  the moment it became evident that darkness would no longer serve them those who were in the open retired to the woods and potted at the windows of the ranch but as the openings from which the besieged fired were mere loopholes made for the purpose of defence they had little hope of hitting them at long range except by chance those of the besiegers who happened to be near the stockade took shelter behind the breastwork and awaited further orders from their chief ignorant of the fact that he had already fallen  from the loopholes of the room which jackson had selected to defend the shed with the saddled horses was visible so that no one could reach it without coming under the fire of his deadly weapon  there was also a window in this room opening upon the back of the house and commanding the field which we have before mentioned as being undefended while the battle was waged outside  by casting a glance now and then through this window he could see any foe who might show himself in that direction the only part of the fort that seemed exposed to great danger now was the front door where the halfdozen savages with a few others who had joined them were still battering away at the impregnable door  dick who held the garret above could not see the door of course nor could he by any manoeuvre manage to bring his rifle to bear on it from his loophole and he dared not leave his post lest more indians should manage to scale the front stockade  buttercup in the room below had indeed a better chance at her window but she was too inexpert in warfare to point the blunderbuss straight down and fire with effect especially knowing as she did that the sight of her arm in the act would be the signal for a prompt fusillade but the girl was not apparently much concerned about that or anything else  the truth is that she possessed in an eminent and enviable degree the spirit of entire trust in a leader  she was under orders and awaited the word of command with perfect equanimity  she even smiled slightlyif such a mouth could be said to do anything slightlywhen mary left her to take fresh rifles to the defenders overhead  at last the command came from the upper regions in tones that caused the very savages to pause a moment and look at each other in surprise they did not pause long however  now buttercup thundered roaring bull give it emhot  at the word the girl calmly laid aside her weapon lifted the big iron pot with familiar and businesslike facility and emptied it over the window  the result is more easily imagined than described  a yell that must have been heard miles off was the prelude to a stampede of the most lively nature  it was intensified if possible by the further action of the negress who seizing the blunderbuss pointed it at the flying crowd and shutting both eyes fired  not a buckshot took effect on the savages for buttercup if we may say so aimed too low but the effect was more stupendous than if the aim had been good for the heavy charge drove up an indescribable amount of peppery dust and small stones into the rear of the flying foe causing another yell which was not an echo but a magnified reverberation of the first  thus buttercup had the satisfaction of utterly routing her foes without killing a single man  daylight had fairly set in by that time and the few savages who had not succeeded in vaulting the stockade had concealed themselves behind the various outhouses  the proprietor of the ranch began now to have some hope of keeping the indians at bay until the troops should succour him  he even left his post and called his friends to a council of war when a wild cheer was heard in the woods  it was followed by the sound of firing  no sooner was this heard than the savages concealed outside of the breastwork rose as one man and ran for the woods  its the troops exclaimed dick hopefully  troopers never cheer like that returned jackson with an anxious look its more like my poor cowboys and if so they will have no chance wi such a crowd o reds  we must ride to help them an youll have to ride with us mary  we darent leave you behind lass wi them varmints skulkin around  im ready father said mary with a decided look though it was evident from the pallor of her cheek that she was ill at ease  now look here dick said jackson quickly you will go down and open the front gate  ill go with ee wi my repeater to keep an eye on the hidden reptiles so that if one of them shows so much as the tip of his ugly nose hell have cause to remember it  you will go to my loophole crux an keep your eyes open all roundspecially on the horses  when the gate is open ill shout and youll run down to the shed wi the womenyou understand  crux nodded  acting on this plan dick ran to the gate jackson followed rifle in hand and having reached the middle of the fort he faced round only just in time to see a gun barrel raised from behind a shed  before he could raise his own weapon a shot was heard and the gunbarrel disappeared while the indian who raised it fell wounded on the ground  well done crux he exclaimed at the same moment firing his own rifle at a head which was peeping round a corner  the head vanished instantly and darvall rejoined him having thrown the gate wide open  come round wi me an drive the reptiles out cried jackson  at the same time he uttered a roar that a bull might have envied and they both rushed round to the back of the outhouses where three indians were found skulking  at the sudden and unexpected onslaught they fired an ineffectual volley and fled wildly through the now open gate followed by several shots from both pursuers whose aim however was no better than their own had been  meanwhile crux and the girls having reached the shed according to orders mounted their respective steeds and awaited their comrades they had not long to wait  jackson and dick came round the corner of the shed at full speed and without a word leaped simultaneously into their saddles  keep close to me girlsclose up was all that jackson said as he dashed spurs into his horse and sweeping across the yard and through the gate made straight for that part of the woods where yells shouts and firing told that a battle was raging furiously    chapter nineteen  the rescue and its consequences  the ground in the neighbourhood of the ranch favoured the operations of an attacking party for it was so irregular and so cumbered with knolls and clumps of trees that the defenders of the post scarce dared to make a sally lest their retreat should be cut off by a detached party of assailants  hence jackson would never have dreamed of quitting his house or ceasing to act on the defensive had he not been under the natural impression that it was his own returning cowboys who had been attacked and outnumbered by the indians  great therefore was his surprise when on rounding a bluff and coming into view of the battlefield the party engaged with the indians though evidently white men were neither his own men nor those of the us troops  he had just made the discovery when a band of about fifty warriors burst from the woods and rushed upon him  back to back boys girls keep close shouted jackson as he fired two shots and dropped two indians  he pulled at a third but there was no answering report for the magazine of his repeater was empty  crux and darvall turned their backs towards him and thus formed a sort of triangle in the midst of which were the two girls  but this arrangement which might have enabled them to hold out for some time was rendered almost abortive by the ammunition having been exhausted  so much for bein in too great a hurry growled jackson between his clenched teeth as he clubbed his rifle and made a savage blow at the indian who first came close to him  it was evident that the indians were afraid to fire lest they should wound or kill the women or perhaps understanding how matters stood they wished to capture the white men alive for instead of firing at them they circled swiftly round endeavouring to distract their attention so as to rash in on them  bigfoot who had recovered from his blow and escaped from the ranch made a sudden dash at dick when he thought him off his guard but dick was not easily caught off his guard in a fight  while in the act of making a furious demonstration at an indian in front which kept that savage off he gave bigfoot a backhanded wipe as he called it which tumbled the chief completely off his horse  just then a turn of affairs in favour of the whites was taking place on the battlefield beyond  the party there had attacked the savages with such fury as to scatter them right and left and they were now riding down at racing speed on the combatants whose fortunes we have followed thus far  two men rode well in advance of the party with a revolver in each hand  why its charlie brooke  hurrah yelled darvall with delight  an buck tom roared jackson in amazement  so sudden was the onset that the indians were for a moment paralysed and the two horsemen firing right and left as they rode up dashed straight into the very midst of the savages  in a moment they were alongside of their friends while the rest of the outlaw band were already engaged on the outskirts of the crowd  the very danger of the white men constituted to some extent their safety for they were so outnumbered and surrounded that the indians seemed afraid to fire lest they should shoot each other  to add to the confusion another party of whites suddenly appeared on the scene and attacked the reds with a wild cheer  this was jacksons little band of cowboys  they numbered only eight but the suddenness of their appearance tended further to distract the savages  while the noise was at its height a sound or rather sensation of many feet beating the earth was felt  next moment a compact line was seen to wheel round the bluff where the fight was going on and a stentorian charge was uttered as the united states cavalry preceded by hunky ben bore down with irresistible impetuosity on the foe  but the indians did not await this onset  they turned and fled scattering as they went and the fight was quickly turned into a total rout and hot pursuit in which troopers outlaws travellers ranchmen scouts and cowboys joined  the cavalry however had ridden far and fast so that the wiry little mustangs of the plains soon left them behind and the bugle ere long recalled them all  it was found on the assembling of the forces that not one of the outlaws had returned  whether they were bent on wreaking their vengeance still more fully on their foes or had good reason for wishing to avoid a meeting with troops was uncertain but it was shrewdly suspected that the latter was the true reason  but you led the charge with buck tom sir said jackson to charlie in considerable surprise though how you came to be in his company is more than i can understand  heres somebody that can explain maybe said one of the cowboys leading forward a wounded man whose face was covered with blood while he limped as if hurt in the legs  i found him tryin to crawl into the brush  dye know him boys  why its jake the flint exclaimed several voices simultaneously while more than one hand was laid on a revolver as if to inflict summary punishment  i claim this man as my prisoner said the commander of the troops with a stern look that prevented any attempt at violence  ay youve got me at last said the outlaw with a look of scorn youve bin a precious long time about it too  secure him said the officer deigning no reply to these remarks  two troopers dismounted and with a piece of rope began to tie the outlaws hands behind him  i arrest you also said the commander to charlie who suddenly found a trooper on each side of him  these took him lightly by each arm while a third seized his bridle  sir exclaimed our hero while the blood rushed to his forehead i am not an outlaw  excuse me returned the officer politely but my duty is plain there are a good many gentlemanly outlaws about at present  you are found joining in fight with a notorious band  until you can clear yourself you must consider yourself my prisonerdisarm and bind him  for one moment charlie felt an almost irresistible impulse to fell the men who held him but fortunately the absurdity of his position forced itself on him and he submitted well knowing that his innocence would be established immediately  is not this man one of your band jake asked the officer quietly  yes he is replied the man with a malevolent grin  hes not long joined  this is his first scrimmage with us  charlie was so thunderstruck at this speech that he was led back to the ranch in a sort of dazed condition  as for dick darvall he was rendered speechless and felt disposed to regard the whole thing as a sort of dream for his attempted explanations were totally disregarded  arrived at the house charlie and jake were locked up in separate rooms and sentries placed beneath their windowsthis in addition to the security of handcuffs and roped arms  then breakfast was prepared for the entire company and those who had been wounded in the fight were attended to by hunky bena selftaught surgeonwith mary and buttercup to act as dressers  i say jackson observed darvall when the worthy ranchman found leisure to attend to him of course you know that this is all nonsensean abominable lie about my friend brooke being an outlaw  of course i do dick said jackson in a tone of sympathy an you may be cocksure ill do what i can to help im  but hell have to prove himself a true man an there are some mysteries about him that it puzzles me to think how hell clear em up  mysteries echoed dick  ay mysteries  ive had some talk wi hunky ben an hes as much puzzled as myself if not more  well then im puzzled more than either of ye returned dick for my friend and mate is as true a manall straight an aboveboardas ever i met with on sea or land  that may be boy but theres some mystery about him somehow  can ye explain what the mystery is jackson  well this is what hunky ben says  he saw your friend go off the other night alone to traitors trap following in the footsteps o that notorious outlaw buck tom  feelin sure that buck meant to waylay your friend hunky followed him up and overshot him to a place where he thought it likely the outlaw would lay in wait  sure enough when he got there he found buck squattin behind a big rock  so he waited to see what would turn up and be ready to rescue your friend  an what dye think did turn up  don know said dick with a look of solemn wonder  why when buck stepped out an bid him throw up his hands your friend merely looked at buck and said somethin that hunky couldnt hear an then buck dropped his pistol and your friend got off his horse and they shook hands and went off as thick as thieves together  an now as youve seen an heard your friend turns up headin a charge of the outlawsan a most notable charge it wasalongside o buck tom  jake the flint too claims him for a comrade  pretty mysterious all that aint it  may i ask said dick with some scorn in his tone who is this hunky ben that his word should be considered as good as a banknote  hes the greatest scout an the best an truest man on the frontier replied jackson  hm so miss mary seems to think too  an mary thinks right  an who may this jake the flint be asked the sailor  the greatest scoundrel cattle and horse stealer and cutthroat on the frontier  so then rejoined dick with some bitterness it would seem that my friend and mate is taken up for an outlaw on the word o the two greatest men on the frontier  it looks like it dick coupled of course wi your friends own actions  but never you fear man  there must be a mistake o some sort somewhere an its sure to come out for id as soon believe my mary to be an outlaw as your friendthough i never set eyes on him before the other day  the fact is dick that ive learned physiognomy since  fizziwhatumy interrupted dick  physiognomythe study o facessince i came to live on the frontier an im pretty sure to know an honest man from a rogue as soon as i see him an hear him speakthough i cant always prove myself right  dick and his host were thus conversing and the soldiers were regaling themselves in the hall the commander of the troops and hunky ben were engaged in earnest conversation with charlie brooke who gave an account of himself that quite cleared up the mystery of his meeting and afterwards being found associated with the outlaws  its a queer story said hunky ben who besides being what his friends called a philosopher was prone at times to moralise  its a queer story an shows that a man shouldnt bounce at a conclusion till hes larned all the ins an outs of a matter  of course mr brooke said the officer when dick had finished his narration your companion knows all this and can corroborate what you have said  not all replied charlie  he is an old shipmate whom i picked up on arriving at new york and only knows that i am in search of an old schoolfellow who has given way to dissipation and got into trouble here  of my private and family affairs he knows nothing  well you have cleared yourself mr brooke continued the captain whose name was wilmot but im sorry to have to add that you have not cleared the character of your friend leather whose name has for a considerable time been associated with the notorious band led by your old schoolfellow ritson who is known in this part of the country as buck tom  one of the worst of this gang of highwaymen jake the flint has as you know fallen into my hands and will soon receive his deserts as a blackhearted murderer  i have recently obtained trustworthy information as to the whereabouts of the gang and i am sorry to say that i shall have to ask you to guide me to their den in traitors trap  is it my duty to do this asked charlie with a troubled look at the officer  it is the duty of every honest man to facilitate the bringing of criminals to justice  but i have strong reason for believing that my friend leather although reckless and dissipated joined these men unwillinglywas forced to do it in factand has been suffering from the result of a severe injury ever since joining so that he has not assisted them at all in their nefarious work  then as to ritson i am convinced that he repents of his course of conduct  indeed i know that his men have been rebellious of late and this very jake has been aspiring to the leadership of the gang  your feelings regarding these men may be natural returned the captain but my duty is to use you in this matter  believing what you say of yourself i will treat you as a gentleman but if you decline to guide me to the nest of this gang i must treat you still as a prisoner  may i have a little time to think over the matter before answering  so that you may have a chance of escaping me replied the captain  nothing was further from my thoughts said charlie with a flush of indignation  i believe you mr brooke rejoined the captain with gravity  let me know any time before twelve today what course you deem it right to take  by noon i shall sound boot and saddle when you will be ready to start  your nautical friend here may join us if he chooses  now while this investigation into the affairs of one prisoner was going on the other prisoner jake was busily employed investigating his own affairs with a view to escape  how he fared in this investigation we reserve for another chapter    chapter twenty  jake the flint in difficulties  the man who at the time we write of was known by the name of jake the flint had acquired the character of the most daring and cruel scoundrel in a region where villains were by no means rare  his exploits indicated a spirit that was utterly reckless of life whether his own or that of his fellowmen and many were the trappers hunters and redskins who would have given a good deal and gone far to have the chance of putting a bullet in his carcass  but as is not unfrequently the case with such men jake seemed to bear a charmed life and when knife bullet and rope cut short the career of many less guilty men jake had hitherto managed to elude his captorsat one time by strategy at another by a bold dash for life and sometimes by luck  no one had a kind word for jake no one loved though many feared admired and hated him  this may seem strange for it is usually found that even in the case of the most noted outlaws there is a woman or a man or bothwho cling to them with affection  perhaps the fact that jake was exceptionally harsh and cruel at all times may account for this as it accounted for his sobriquet of flint he was called by some of those who knew him a godforsaken man  we merely state the fact but are very far from adopting the expression for it ill becomes any man of mortal mould to pronounce his fellowman godforsaken  in the meantime we feel it to be no breach of charity to say that jake had forsaken god for his foul language and bloody deeds proved the fact beyond all question  he was deceitful as well as cruel and those who knew him best felt sure that his acting under buck tom was a mere ruse there is little doubt that he had done so for the purpose of obtaining an influence over a gang of desperadoes ready to hand as it were and that the moment he saw his opportunity he would kill buck tom and take command  the only thing that had kept him from doing so sooner it was thought was the fact that buck had the power to gain the affection of his men as well as to cause them to fear him so that jake had not yet found the time ripe for action  after the outlaw had been put into the room by himself as already stated the door locked and a sentry posted below the window he immediately turned with all his energy to examine into his circumstances and prospects  first of all his wrists were manacled  that however gave him little concern for his hands were unusually small and delicate and he knew from experience that he could slip them out of any handcuffs that would close easily on his wristsa fact that he had carefully concealed and of which men were not yet aware as he had not yet been under the necessity of availing himself of the circumstance  the rope with which he had been bound on the way to the ranch had been removed the handcuffs being deemed sufficient  as the window of his prison was over thirty feet from the ground and a sentinel with a carbine and revolver stood below it was thought that the bird who had so frequently escaped his cage before was safe at last and fairly on his way to the gallows  not so thought jake the flint  despair did not seem to be a possibility to him  accordingly he examined his prison carefully and with a hopeful smile  the examination was soon completed for the room presented no facilities whatever for escape  there was no bed from which to take the sheets and blankets to extemporise a rope  no mattress to throw over the window so as to break a heavy mans fall  no chimney by which to ascend to the roof no furniture indeed of any kind beyond a deal chair and table  the door was of solid oak and bolted outside  obviously the window was his only chance  he went to it and looked out the depth was too much he knew for even his strong bones to stand the shock and the sentinel paced to and fro underneath with loaded carbine  if any one would only lay a featherbed down there thought jake id jump an take my chance  while he was gazing meditatively on the fair prospect of land and water that lay before him one of the bolts of the door was withdrawn then another and the door slowly opened  for an instant the outlaw gathered himself up for a rush with a view to sell his life dearly and he had even begun to draw one of his hands out of the manacles when the folly and hopelessness of the attempt struck him  he quickly checked himself and met his jailor one of the troopers with a smiling countenance as he entered and laid a loaf and a jug of water on the table  the rattle of a musket outside told jake that his jailor had not come alone  without a word the man turned and was leaving the room when jake in a voice of great humility asked him to stop  you couldnt remove these things could you he said holding out his fettered hands  no answered the trooper sharply  ah sighed jake i feared it was agin the rules  you couldnt let me have the use of a file could you for a few minutes  what agin rules too  its a pity for im used to brush my teeth with a file of a mornin an i like to do it before breakfast  jake interlarded his speech with a variety of oaths with which we will not defile the paper but he could extract no further reply from the trooper than a glance of scorn  left to himself jake again went to the window which was a small cottage one opening inwards like a door  he opened it and looked out the sentinel instantly raised his carbine and ordered him to shut it  hullo  silas is that you cried jake in surprise but paying no attention to the threat i thought you had quit for heaven durin the last skrimidge wi the reds down in kansas  glad to see you lookin so well  hows your wife an the childn silas  come now jake said the trooper sternly you know its all up with you so you neednt go talkin bosh like thatmore need to say your prayers  stand back and shut the window i say else ill put a bullet through your gizzard  well now silas said jake remonstratively and opening the breast of his red shirt as he spoke i didnt expect that of an old friend like youindeed i didnt  but see here if you raaly are goin to fire take good aim an keep clear o the heart and liver  the gizzard lies hereabout pointing to his breast and easy to hit if youve a steady hand  i know the exact spot for ive had the cuttin up of a good bunch o men in my day an i cant bear to see a thing muddled  but hold on silas i wont put ye to the pain o shootin me  ill shut the window if youll make me a promise  whats that demanded the trooper still covering the outlaw however with his carbine  you know im goin to my doomthats what poetical folk call it silasan i want you to help me wind up my affairs as the lawyers say well this here holding up a coin is my last dollar the remains o my fortin silas an this here bit o paper that im rappin round it is my last will an testimonial  youll not refuse to give it to my only friend on arth hunky ben for ive no wife or chick to weep oer my grave even though they knew where it was  youll do this for me silas wont you  all rightpitch it down  jake threw the coin which fell on the ground a few feet in front of the trooper who stooped to pick it up  with one agile bound the outlaw leaped from the window and descended on the troopers back which was broken by the crashing blow and jake rolled over him with considerable violence but the poor mans body had proved a sufficient buffer and jake rose unhurt  deliberately taking the carbine from the dead mans hand and plucking the revolver from his belt he sauntered off in the direction of the stables  these being too small to contain all the troophorses some of the animals were picketed in an open shed and several troopers were rubbing them down  the men took jake for one of the cowboys of the ranch for he passed them whistling  entering the stable he glanced quickly round selected the finest horse and loosing its halter from the stall turned the animals head to the door  what are ye doin wi the captains horse demanded a trooper who chanced to be in the neighbouring stall  the captain wants it  hold his head till i get on him  hes frisky said jake in a voice of authority  the man was taken aback and obeyed but as jake mounted he turned suddenly pale  the outlaw observing the change drew the revolver and pointing it at the troopers head said in a low savage voice a word a sound and your brains are on the floor  the man stood openmouthed as if petrified  jake shook the reins of the fiery horse and bounded through the doorway stooping to the saddlebow as he went  he could see even at that moment that the trooper recovering himself was on the point of uttering a shout wheeling round in the saddle he fired and the man fell with a bullet in his brain  the shot of course aroused the whole ranch  men rushed into the yard with and without arms in wild confusion but only in time to see a flying horseman cross the square and make for the gate  a rattling irregular volley was sent after him but the only effect it had was to cause the outlaw to turn round in the saddle and wave his hat while he gave vent to a yell of triumph  another moment and he was beyond the bluff and had disappeared  boot and saddle instantly rang out at the ranch and every preparation was made for pursuit though mounted as jake was on the best horse of the troop they could not hope to overtake him  hunky ben at his own particular request was permitted to go on in advance  you see sir he said to the captain my black polly ant quite as good as your charger but shes more used to this sort o country an i can take the short cuts where your horse could hardly follow  go ben and good luck go with you  besides we can do without you now that we have mr brooke to guide us  come wi me sir said hunky ben as he passed charlie on his way to the stables  dont you hesitate mr brooke to guide the captain to the cave of buck tom  im goin on before you to hunt up the reptiles to try an catch jake the flint  the scout chuckled inwardly as he said this  but why go in advance  you can never overtake the scoundrel with such a start and on such a horse  never you mind what i can or cant do said ben entering the stable where the dead trooper still lay and unfastening black polly  ive no time to explain  all i know is that your friend leather is sure to be hanged if hes cotched an im sure hes an innocent mantherefore im goin to save him  its best for you to know nothin more than that for i see youre not used to tellin lies  can you trust me  certainly i can  the look of your face ben even more than the character you bear would induce me to trust you  well then mr brooke the first sign o trust is to obey orders without askin questions  true when the orders are given by one who has a right to command returned charlie  just so an my right to command lies in the fact that the life o your friend leather depends on your obedience  im your humble servant then  but what am i to do  do whatever captain wilmot orders without objectin an speak nothing but the truth  you dont need to speak the whole truth howsever added the scout thoughtfully as he led out his coalblack steed  your friend leather has got a christian name of course  dont mention it  i dont want to hear it  say nothin about it to anybody  the time may come when it may be useful to drop the name of leather and call your friend mister whatever the tother name may be  now mind what ive said to ye  as he spoke the last words the scout touched the neck of his beautiful mare and in another minute was seen racing at full speed over the rolling plain    chapter twenty one  tells of a cruel deed and shows how mysteriously hunky ben behaved  when jake escaped from the ranch of roaring bull he tried the mettle of captain wilmots charger to the uttermost for well he knew that the pursuit would be instant and vigorous that his late comrade charlie brooke could guide the troops to the cavern in traitors trap and that if his companions who would doubtless ride straight back were to escape they must be warned in time  he also knew that the captains charger was a splendid one  in order to accomplish his purpose therefore he would ride it to death  the distance between the ranch and the outlaws cave was not so great but that any mustang in the plains could have traversed it in a day but the cruel man had made up his mind that the captains charger should do it in a few hours  it is not so much distance as pace that kills  had any consideration whatever been extended to the noble creature by the ignoble brute who rode it the good horse would have galloped to the head of the trap almost without turning a hair  at first he strode out over the rolling prairie with the untiring vigour of a wellmade frame and a splendid constitution leaping the little cracks and inequalities of the ground in the exuberance of his strength though there was no need to bound and coursing over the knolls as easily as he cantered down the hollows while his flashing eye betokened at once a courageous and a gentle spirit  but when the lower slopes of the hills were reached and steepish gradients were met with here and there the horse began to put back first one ear and then the other and sometimes both as if in expectation of the familiar well done or pat on the neck or check of the rein with which the captain had been wont to sanction a slackening of the pace but no such grace was allowed him  on the contrary when the first symptom appeared of a desire to reduce speed jake drove his cruel spurs into the chargers glossy side  with a wild snort and bound the horse stretched out again and spurned the ground as if in indignant surprise  then the breath began to labour slightly the sweat to darken his rich brown coat and the white foam to fleck his broad chest  still jake pressed him on with relentless fury  it could not be expected that a man who cared not for his fellows would have much consideration for his beast  murder of a deeper dye than that of a horse was seething in the outlaws brain  this to him useless expedition which had so nearly cost him his life would be the last that buck tom should command after blowing out his brains he would warn the others of the impending danger and lead them away to other and more favourable fields of enterprise  at this point the good horse stumbled and almost threw his rider who with horrible curses plied the spurs and tugged at the bit until blood was mingled with the flying foam  never save oncewhen captain wilmot was caught alone in the plains by cheyenne indians and had to fly for his lifehad the good charger been urged to anything like such an effort as he was now called on to make and then there was no cruelty mingled with the urging  the very tone of his masters voice as he patted the neck and shook the rein and gently touched him with the spur must have convinced the intelligent creature that it was a matter of life or deaththat there was a stern needbe for such haste  turning at last into the gorge of the trap the charger gasped and sobbed with distress as he faced the steep ascent and tried with the unabated courage of a willing heart to pull himself together while the unmerciful monster still drove in the spurs and galled his tender mouth but the brave effort was unavailing  stumbling over a root that crossed the path the horse plunged forward and fell with a crash sending his rider over his head  jake alighting on his face and right shoulder lay stunned for a few seconds  then he jumped up displaying torn garments and a face covered with blood  running to the horses head he seized the rein and shook it savagely kicking the animals face with his heavy boots in his anxiety to make it rise but the poor charger was beyond his cruelty by that time for its neck had been broken by the fall  oh it was one of those sights which are fitted to make even thoughtless men recognise the need of a saviour for the human race and to reject with something like scorn the doctrinefounded on wholly insufficient evidencethat there is no future of compensation for the lower animals  the outlaw did not waste time in vain regrets  bestowing a meaningless curse on the dead charger he turned and went up the narrow glen at a smart pace but did not overstrain himself for he knew well that none of the troophorses could have kept up with him  he counted on having plenty of time to warn his comrades and get away without hurry  but he reckoned without his hostbeing quite ignorant of the powers of black polly and but slightly acquainted with those of her master hunky ben  indeed so agile were the movements of polly and so thoroughly was the scout acquainted with the bypaths and short cuts of that region that he actually passed the fugitive and reached the head of traitors trap before him  this he managed by forsaking the roads keeping a straighter line for the outlaws cave and passing on foot over the shoulder of a hill where a horseman could not go  thus he came down on the cavern about halfanhour before jakes arrival  clambering to the crevice in the cliff against which the cave abutted and sliding down into a hollow on its earthen roof he cautiously removed a small stone from its position and disclosed a hole through which he could both hear and see most of what took place inside  lest any one should wonder at the facility with which the ground lent itself to this manoeuvre we may as well explain that the bold scout possessed one of those farreaching minds which are not satisfied without looking into everythingseeing to the bottom of and peering round to the rear of all things as far as possible  he always acted on the principle of making himself acquainted with every road and track and bypath every stream pond river and spring in the land  hence he was well aware of this haunt of outlaws and happening to be near it one day when its owners were absent he had turned aside to make the little arrangement of a peephole in the belief that it might possibly turn out to be of advantage in course of time  the clump of shrubs and grass on the rugged bank which formed the top of the cave effectually concealed the natural hollow which he had deepened and the overhanging mass of the rugged cliff protected it from rain and dew  what hunky ben saw on looking through his peephole filled him with surprise and pity and compelled him to modify his plans  almost below him on a brush couch lay the tall form of buck tom with the unmistakable hue of approaching death upon his countenance  beside him holding his head kneeled the muchwasted figure of leatherthe reputed outlaw  seated or standing around in solemn silence were six of the outlaws most of whom bore tokens of the recent fight in the form of bandage on head or limb  i brought you to this leather god forgive me said the dying man faintly  no you didnt ralph replied the other calling him by his old familiar name i brought myself to it  dont blame yourself ralph you werent half so bad as me  youd never have been here but for me come ralph try to cheer up a bit youre not dying  its only faint you are from loss of blood and the long gallop  when youve had a sleep and some food youll feel stronger  well fetch a doctor soon an hell get hold o the bullet  dear ralph dont shake your head like that an look so solemn  cheer up old boy  leather spoke with a sort of desperate fervour but ralph could not cheer up  no he said sadly there is no cheer for me  ive thrown my life away  theres no hopeno mercy for me  ive been trying to recall the past an what mother used to teach me but it wont come  theres only one text in all the bible that comes to me now  its thisbe sure your sin will find you out  thats true boys he said turning a look on his comrades  whatever else may be false thats true for i know it  thats so dear ralph said leather earnestly but its no less true that  just then a noise was heard in the outer passage then hurrying footsteps  instinctively every man drew his revolver and faced the door  next moment jake entered  here one of you a drinkim fit toha  his eyes fell on the figure of buck and he shrank back for a moment in silent surprise  yes jake said the dying man with a glance of pity not unmingled with scorn it has come sooner than you or i expected and it will save you some troublemaybe some regret  ive seen through your little game jake and am glad ive been spared the necessity of thwarting you  he stopped owing to weakness and jake recovering himself hastily explained the reason of his sudden appearance  fetch me a rag an some water boys he continued  it looks worse than it isonly skin deep  and weve not a moment to lose  those who have a mind may follow me  them that wants to swing may stop  but how about buck tom asked one who was not quite so depraved as the others  whats the use o askin said jake  its all up with him dont you see  besides hes safe enough  theyd never have the heart to hang a dying man  an leather cried another  we mustnt quit leather  hes game for many a fight yet  come leather well help you along for theyre sure to string you up on the nearest tree  dont trouble yourself about me said leather looking round for he still kneeled beside his old friend i dont intend to escape  look to yourselves boys an leave us alone  unless youre all tired o life youll quit here an skip for the woods said jake as turning round he hurriedly left the place  the others did not hesitate but followed him at once leaving buck tom and his friend to shift for themselves  during all this scene hunky ben had been intently gazing and listening chiefly the latter  when the outlaws filed past him he found it extremely difficult to avoid putting a bullet into the flint but he restrained himself because of what yet remained to be done  as soon as the outlaws were well out of sight ben arose and prepared for action  first of all he tightened his belt  then he pulled the hood of his coat well over his head so that it effectually concealed his face and still further to accomplish the end in view he fastened the hood in front with a wooden pin  proceeding to the stable he found as he had hoped and expected that the outlaws had left one or two horsecloths behind in their flight  in one of these he enveloped his person in such a way as to render it unrecognisable  then he walked straight into the cave and without a word of warning threw his strong arms a round shank leather and lifted him off the ground  of course leather shouted and struggled at first but as well might a kitten have struggled in the grip of a grizzly bear  in his worn condition he felt himself to be utterly powerless  buck tom made a feeble effort to rise and help him but the mere effort caused him to fall back with a groan of helpless despair  swiftly his captor bore leather up the side of the hill till he got behind a clump of trees into the heart of which he plunged and then set his burden down on his feet  at the same time throwing back his hood and flinging away the horsecloth he stood up and smiled  hunky ben or his ghost exclaimed shank forgetting his indignation in his amazement  youre right young man though youve only seed me once that i know of  but most men that see me once are apt to remember me  well hunky said leather while the indignation began to return you may think this very amusing but its mean of a big strong man like you to take advantage of a fellow thats as weak as a child from wounds an fever  lend me one o your sixshooters now so as we may stand on somewhat more equal terms andbut a truce to boasting  im sure that you wouldnt keep smiling at me like a cheshire cat if there wasnt something behind this  youre right mr leather said ben becoming at once grave and earnest  there is somethin behind itay an somethin before it too  so much that i have barely time to tell ee  so listen wi both ears  theres a bunch o men an troops close to the trap even now on their way to visit your cave  if they find youyou know what that means  death said leather quietly  ay death though ye dont desarve it said ben  but i do deserve it returned shank in the same quiet voice  well mayhap you do rejoined the scout coolly but not so far as i know in connection wi your present company  now theres buck tom  ay what of him asked shank anxiously  well in the natral course o timings death is comin to him too an thatll save him from bein strung upfor theyre apt to do that sort o thing hereaway in a loose freeaneasy style thats awkward sometime i was within an inch of it myself once all through a mistakeill tell ee about that when ive got more time maybe  well now im keen to save you an buck tom if i can and what i want you to understand is that if you expect me to help you at a time when you stand considerable in need o help youll have to do what i tell ee  and what would you have me do asked shank with a troubled look  remain here till i come for ee and when you meet me in company say nothin about havin met me before  can i trust you hunky ben said shank looking at him earnestly  if you cant trust me what dye propose to do asked the scout with a grin  youre right ben  i must trust you and to say truth from the little i know of you i believe ive nothing to fear  but my anxiety is for ralphbuck tom i mean  youre sure i suppose that mr brooke will do his best to shield him  ay sartin sure an by the way dont mention your christian name just nowwhatever it isnor for some time yet  goodday an keep quiet till i come  weve wasted overmuch time aready  so saying the scout left the coppice and flinging open his coat reentered the cave a very differentlooking man from what he was when he left it  hunky ben exclaimed buck who had recovered by that time  i wish you had turned up halfanhour since boy  you might have saved my poor friend leather from a monster who came here and carried him away bodily  ay  thats strange now  howsever worse luck might have befel him for the troops are at my heels an ye know what would be in store for him if he was here  yes indeed i know it ben and what is in store for me too but death will have his laugh at them if they dont look sharp  no surely said the scout in a tone of real commiseration youre not so bad as that are you  truly am i answered buck with a pitiful look shot in the chest but i saw you in the fight ben did you guide them here  thats what i didat least i told em which way to go an came on in advance to warn you in time sos you might escape  to tell you the plain truth ralph ritson ive bin told all about you by your old friend mr brooke an about leather too who you say has bin carried off by a monster  yesat least by a monstrous big man  youre quite sure o that  quite sure  an you would know the monster if you saw him again  i think i would know his figure but not his face for i did not see it  strange remarked the scout with a simple look an youre sartin sure you dont know where leather is now  not got the most distant idea  thats well now stick to that an theres no fear o leather  as to yourselftheyll never think o hangin you till ye can walk to the gallowsso cheer up buck tom  it may be that ye desarve hangin for all i know but not just at present  im a bit of a surgeon toobein a sort o jackofalltrades and know how to extract bullets  what between mr brooke an me an time wonders may be worked if youre wise enough to keep a tight rein on your tongue  while the scout was speaking the tramp of cavalry was heard outside and a few minutes later captain wilmot entered the cave closely followed by charlie brooke    chapter twenty two  the cave of the outlaws invaded by ghosts and us troops  we need scarcely say that buck tom was wise enough to put a bridle on his tongue after the warning hint he had received from the scout  he found this all the easier that he had nothing to conceal save the christian name of his friend leather and as it turned out this was never asked for by the commander of the troops  all that the dying outlaw could reveal was that jake the flint had suddenly made his appearance in the cave only a short time previously had warned his comrades and knowing that he buck was mortally wounded and that leather was helplessly weak from a wound which had nearly killed him had left them both to their fate  that just after they had gone an unusually broad powerful man with his face concealed had suddenly entered the cave and carried leather off in spite of his struggles and that about halfanhour later hunky ben had arrived to find the cave deserted by all but himself  where the other outlaws had gone to he could not tellof course they would not reveal that to a comrade who was sure to fall into the hands of their enemies  and you have no idea continued the captain who the man is that carried your friend leather so hurriedly away  not the slightest returned buck  had my revolver been handy and an ounce of strength left in me you wouldnt have had to ask the question  passing strange murmured captain wilmot glancing at the scout who was at the moment seated on a keg before the fire lighting his pipe and with a look of simple benignant stolidity on his grave countenance have you no idea ben where these outlaws have taken themselves off to  no moren a lopeared rabbit captain wilmot answered the scout you see theres a good many paths by which men who knows the place could git out o the trap an once out o it theres the whole o the rockie range where to pick an choose  but how comes it ben that you missed jake  surely the road is not so broad that you could pass him unseen  yet you arrived here before him  thats true sir but sly coons like the flint can retire into the brush when they dont want to be overhauled  that wasnt the way of it however  with such a splendid animal as your poor horse captain an ridden to death as it wasan as i spected it would bei knowed i had no chance o comin up wi the flint so i took advantage o my knowledge o the lay o the land an pushed ahead by a straighter linefinishin the last bit on futt over the ridge of a hill  that sent me well ahead o the flint an so i got here before him  havin ways of eavesdroppin that other people dont know on i peeped into the cave here and saw and heard how matters stood  then i thought o harkin back on my tracks an stoppin the flint wi a bullet but i reflected what goodll that do  the shot would wake up the outlaws an putt them on the scent all the same  then i tried to listen what their talk was about so as i might be up to their dodges but i hadnt bin listenin long when in tramps the flint an sounds the alarm  of course i might have sent him an praps one o the others to their long home from where i stood but ive always had an objection to shoot a man behind his back  it has such a sneakin sort o feel about it  an then the othersi couldnt see how many there waswould have swarmed out on me an id have had to make tracks for the scrub an larn nothin more  so i fixed to keep quiet an hear and see all that i couldpraps find out where they fixed to pull out to  but i heard nothin more worth tellin  they only made some hurried an by no means kindly observations about poor buck an leather an went off over the hills  i went into the woods a bit myself after that just to be well out o the way so to speak an when i got back here leather was gone  and you didnt see the man that carried him off  no i didnt see him  youd have shot him of course if you had seen him  no indeed captain i wouldnt  no why not asked the captain with a peculiar smile  well because answered the scout with a look of great solemnity i wouldnt shoot such a man on any accountno matter what he was doin  indeed returned the other with a broadening smile  i had no idea you were superstitious ben  i thought you feared neither man nor devil  what i fear an what i dont fear returned the scout with quiet dignity is a matter which has never given me much consarn  well dont be hurt hunky ben i dont for one moment question your courage only i fancied that if you saw any one rescuing an outlaw you would have tried to put a bullet into him whether he happened to be a man or a ghost  but i have told you broke in buck tom with something of his old fire that leather is not an outlaw  i have only your word for that and you know what that is worth returned the captain  i dont want to be hard on one apparently so near his end and to say truth im inclined to believe you but we know that this man leather has been for a long time in your companywhether a member of your band or not must be settled before another tribunal if caught he stands a good chance of being hanged  and now added the captain turning to a sergeant who had entered the cave with him tell the men to put up their horses as best they may  we camp here for the night  we can do nothing while it is dark but with the first gleam of day we will make a thorough search of the neighbourhood  while the troopers and their commander were busy making themselves as comfortable as possible in and around the cave the scout went quietly up to the clump of wood where leather was in hiding and related to that unfortunate all that had taken place since he left him  it is very good of you hunky to take so much interest in me and incur so much risk and trouble but do you know said leather with a look of surprise not unmingled with amusement you are a puzzle to me for i cant understand how you could tell captain wilmot such a heap o liesyou that has got the name of bein the truesthearted scout on the frontier  you puzzle me more than i puzzle you leather returned the scout with a simple look  what lies have i told  why all you said about what you saw and heard when you said you were eavesdroppin must have been nonsense you know for how could you hear and see what took place in the cave through tons of rock and earth  how i saw and heard my son leather is a private affair of my own but it was no lie  leather looked incredulous  then you said he continued that you didnt see the man that carried me away  no more i did boy  i never saw him  what not even in a lookingglass  not even in a lookinglass returned hunky  ive seed his reflection there many a timean a pretty goodlookin reflection it wasbut ive never seed himselfthat i knows on  no leather if captain wilmot had axed me if i saw you carried off i might ha been putt in a fix but he didnt ax me that  he axed if id seen the man that carried you off an i told the truth when i said i had not moreover i wasnt bound to show him that he wasnt fit to be a lawyer specially when he was arter an innocent man an might praps hang him without a trial  it was my duty to guide the captain in pursuit of outlaws an it is my duty to shield an innocent man  between the two perplexin duties i tried to steer as straight a course as i could but i confess i had to steer pretty close to the wind  well hunky it is my duty to thank you instead of criticising you as i have done but how do you come to be so sure that im innocent  praps because ye putt such an innocent question replied ben with a little smile  dye raily think leather that an old scout like me is goin to let you see through all the outs and ins by which i comes at my larnin  its enough for you to know boy that i know a good deal more about you than ye thinkmore praps than ye know about yerself  i dont go for to say that youre a born angel wantin nothin but a pair o wings to carry ye off to the better landby no means but i do know that as regards jinin buck toms boys or takin a willin part in their devilish work ye are innocent an thats enough for me  im glad you know it and believe it ben said leather earnestly for it is true  i followed buck because hes an old old chum and i did it at the risk of my life an then as perhaps you are aware we were chased and i got injured  so far i am innocent of acting with these men but o ben i dont admit my innocence in anything else  my whole lifewell wellits of no use talkin  tell me dye think theres any chance o buck getting over this  he may  nobody can tell  ill do my best for him  i never lose hope of a man after what ive seed in my experience till the breath is fairly out of him  thank god for these words ben  yes continued the scout and your friend brooke is at this moment sunk in the blue dumps because you have been carried off by a great mysterious monster  then he doesnt know it was you exclaimed leather  in course not  an he doesnt know you are within five hundred yards of him  an whats more you mustnt let him know it was me for that must be kept a dead secret else itll ruin my character on the frontiers  we must surround it wi mystery my boy till all is safe but i didnt come up here to enjoy an evenins conversation  youre not safe where you are leather  theyll be scourin all round for you long before sunup so i must putt you where youll be able to look on an grin at them  where will that be asked leather with some curiosity  you know the cliff about five hundred feet high that rises just over on the other side o the valleywhere the watershoot comes down  ay its likely i do for ive seen it every mornin for months past  an you remember the hole near the top o the cliff  yesthat looks about the size of a crow  whatever it looks like its three times the size of a man an its the mouth of a cave returned the scout  now ill lead you to the track thatll let you up to that cave  its a splendid place full of all sorts o holes an places where a man couldnt find you even if he knowd you was there  once up you may sit down smoke your pipe in the mouth o the cave an enjoy yourself lookin on at the hunt arter yourself  heres a bit o chuck ive brought to keep you from wearyin for they may keep it up all day  when all danger is past ill come up for ye  you neednt show more o yourself however than the top o your head  a man can never be overcautious when hes bein hunted down  an mind dont leave the place till i come for you  handing a cold roast fowl and a loaf to his companion the scout got up and led him away to the spot which he had just described  it was by that time quite dark but as hunky ben knew every inch of the ground he glided along almost as quickly as if it had been broad day followed with some difficulty by poor leather who was still in a state of great prostration partly because of his injury and partly in consequence of his previous dissipation  as the place however was not much more than halfamile distant his powers of endurance were not much tried  the scout led him across the narrow valley just above the outlaws cave and then entering a steep rocky defile he began to ascend a place that was more suitable for goats than men  after halfanhour of upward toil they reached a plateau where the trackif it may be so styledseemed to run in a zigzag manner until it reached a small hole in the solid rock  through this they entered and found themselves within a cavern and in total darkness  we may rest a bit now said the scout  theres a ledge hereabouts there you are  sit down  ill have to take your hand here lest you fall off the bridge into the holes on each side o the track  are the holes dangerous asked leather  theyre dangerous enough to be worth takin care of anyhow for if ye was to tumble into one youd never come out again  there now lets go on for if i dont git back soon theyll be wonderin if the monster hasnt run away wi me too as well as you  after advancing a short distance in total darknessben feeling his way carefully step by stepthey came suddenly to the hole in the front of the cave to which reference has been already made  the place had evidently been used before as a place of refuge and temporary abode for near this frontmouth of the cave was found a litter of pine branches which had plainly been used as a bed  sit ye down there leather said the scout see or rather hear for the eyes arent of much use just nowive set down the grub an a flask o water beside ye  dont strike a light unless you want to have your neck stretched  daylight wont be long o lettin ye see whats goin on  you wont weary for itll be as good as a play yourself bein chief actor an audience all at the same time  saying this the scout melted as it were into the darkness of the cavern and with noiseless moccasined feet retraced his steps to the rear entrance  left to himself the poor wanderer found both time and food for reflection for he did not dare in the darkness to move from the spot where he had seated himself  at first an eerie feeling of indefinable fear oppressed him but this passed away as the busy thoughts went rambling back to home and the days of comparative innocence gone by forgetting the dark surroundings and the threatening dangers he was playing again on the river banks drinking liquoricewater swimming and rescuing kittens with charlie brooke  anon he was wandering on the seabeach with his sister browneyed mary or watching the manly form of his old friend and chum buffeting the waves towards the wreck on the sealford rocks  memory may not be always faithful but she is often surprisingly prompt  in the twinkling of an eye shank leather had crossed the atlantic again and was once more in the drinking and gambling saloonsthe hells of new yorkwith his profoundly admired friend and tempter ralph ritson  it was a wild whirl and plunge from bad to worse through which memory led him nowscenes at which he shuddered and on which he would fain have closed his eyes if possible but memory knows not the meaning of mercy  she tore open his eyes and becoming unusually strict at this point bade him look particularly at all the minute details of his reckless lifeespecially at the wrecks of other lives that had been caused by the wreck of his own  then the deepest deep of all seemed to be reached when he roseor rather fell from the condition of tempted to that of tempter and somehow managed for a time to lead even the far strongerminded ralph ritson on the road to ruin  but he did not lead him long  the stronger nature soon reasserted itself seized the reins led the yielding leather to the cities of the far west from gambling took to robbing till at last the gay and handsome ritson became transformed into the notorious buck tom and left his weaker chum to care for himself  it was at this pointso memory recalled to himthat he leather was stopped in mid and mad career by a man of god with the love of jesus in his heart and on his lips  and at this point memory seemed to change her action and proved herself although unmerciful preeminently faithful  she reminded him of the deep contrition that god wrought in his heart of the horror that overwhelmed him when he thought of what he was and what he had done of the sudden resolve he had formed to follow ritson and try to stop him in the fearful career on which he had entered  then came the memory of failure of desperate anxieties of futile entreaties of unaccountably resolute perseverance of joining the outlaw band to be near his friend of being laughed to scorn by them all of being chased by us troops at the very commencement of his enterprise of being severely wounded rescued and carried off during the flight by buck tom and thena long blank mingled with awful dreams and scenes and ribald songs and cursessome of all which was real and some the working of a fevered brain  so terribly vivid were these pictures of memory that one of the shouts of dreamland absolutely awoke him to the fact that he had extended his wearied limbs on his couch of pine brush and fallen asleep  he also awake to the perception that it was broad daylight and that a real shout had mingled with that of dreamland for after he had sat up and listened intently for a few moments the shout was repeated as if at no great distance    chapter twenty three  the troops outwitted by the scout and his friends  creeping quickly to the mouth of the cave leather peeped cautiously out and the scene that met his startled gaze was not calculated to restore that equanimity which his recent dreams had disturbed  the narrow and rugged valley which lay spread out below him was alive with horsemen trotting hither and thither as if searching for some one and several parties on foot were scaling gorges and slopes up which a horseman could not scramble  the shout which had awakened the fugitive was uttered by a dismounted trooper who had climbed higher on the face of the cliff than his fellows and wished to attract the attention of those below  hi hallo he cried send hunky ben up here  ive found a track that seems to lead to somewhere but itll need the scouts nose to ferret it out  leathers heart beat wildly for from the position of the man he could not doubt that he had discovered the track leading up to the cave before he could think how he should act a response came to the call from hunky ben  ay ay he shouted in a voice so bold and resonant that leather felt it was meant to warn him of his danger ay ay  hold on  dont be in a hurry  the tracks branch out further on an some o them are dangerous  wait till i come up  theres a cave up there ill lead ye to it  this was more than enough for leather  he turned hastily to survey his place of refuge  it was a huge dismal cavern with branching tunnels around that disappeared in thick obscurity and heights above that lost themselves in gloom holes in the sides and floor that were of invisible depth and curious irregular ledges that formed a sort of arabesque fringe to the general confusion  one of these ornamental ledges stretching along the roof with many others lost itself in the gloom and seemed to be a hopeful livingplaceall the more hopeful that it was in the full blaze of light that gushed in through the front opening of the cave  this opening it will be remembered was on the face of the cliff and inaccessible  but leather found that he could not reach the ledge hastening to the dark side of the cave however he saw that by means of some projections and crevices in the rocky wall he could reach the end of the ledge  creeping along it he soon found himself close to the opening surrounded by strong light but effectually concealed from view by the ledge  it was as if he were on a natural rafter peeping down on the floor below  as there was a multitude of such ledges around which it would take several men many hours to examine he began to breathe more freely for would the searchers not naturally think that a fugitive would fly to the darkest recesses of his place of refuge rather than to the brightest and most accessible spot  he gave vent to a sigh of relief and was congratulating himself upon his wisdom when his eyes chanced to fall on the flask of water and cold roast fowl and loaf lying conspicuous in the full glare of light that flooded the front part of the cave  if the fowl had been thrust whole into his throat it could scarcely have added to the gush of alarm that choked him  he slipped incontinently from his arabesque ledge and dropped upon the floor  securing the telltale viands with eager haste he dashed back into the obscurity and clambered with them back to his perch  and not much too soon for he had barely settled down when the voice of the scout was heard talking pretty loudly  come along captain wilmot he said give me your hand sir  its not safe to walk alone here even wi a light  here where are you  oh  all right  havent you got a match asked the captain  nothin that would burn moren a few seconds  were better without a light for a gust o wind might blow it out an leave us worse than we was  mind this step  there  well im glad i didnt bring any of my men in here said the captain as he kicked one of his heavy boots violently against a projection of rock  aytis as well you didnt returned the scout in a tone suggestive of the idea that he was smiling  for theres holes on both sides an if one o your men went down ye might read the funeral sarvice over him at once an be done with it  theres a glimmer o daylight at last well soon be at the other end now  a horrible place truly said the captain and one that it would be hard to find a fellow in even if we knew he was here  didnt i say so captain but ye wouldnt be convinced said hunky ben leading his companion into the full light of the opening and coming to a halt close to the ledge above which the fugitive lay  besides leather could never have found his way here alone  you forget returned wilmot with a peculiar smile the monster might have shown him the way or even have carried him hither  ah true answered the scout with solemn gravity  theres somethin in that  wilmot laughed  what a splendid view he said going forward to the openingand see here is a bed of pine brush  no doubt the cave must have been used as a place of refuge by the redskins in days gone by  ay an by the palefaces too said the scout  why ive had occasion to use it myself more than once  and as you truly obsarve sir theres small chance of findin a man once hes in here  as well run after a rabbit in his hole  or search for a needle in a haystack observed the captain as he gazed with curious interest around and above him  well ben i give in  you were right when you said there was no probability of my finding any of the outlaws here  im ginerally right when i speak about what i understand returned the scout calmly  so now captain if youre satisfied we may as well go an have a look at the other places i spoke of  assenting to this the two men left the place but leather continued to lie perfectly still for a considerable time after their footsteps had died away  then gliding from his perch he dropped on the floor and ran to the opening where he saw the troopers still riding about but gradually going farther and farther away from him  the scene was not perhaps as the scout had prophesied quite as good as a play but it certainly did become more and more entertaining as the searchers receded and distance lent enchantment to the view  when at last the troops had disappeared shank bethought him of the food which hunky ben had so thoughtfully provided and sitting down on the brush couch devoted himself to breakfast with a hearty appetite and a thankful spirit  meanwhile captain wilmot having satisfied himself that the outlaws had fairly escaped him and that buck tom was too ill to be moved retired to a cool glade in the forest and held a council of war with the scout and charlie brooke  now ben he said dismounting and seating himself on a mossy bank while a trooper took charge of the horses and retired with them to a neighbouring knoll it is quite certain that in the present unsettled state of the district i must not remain here idle  it is equally certain that it would be sudden death to buck tom to move him in his present condition therefore some men must be left behind to take care of him  now though i can ill afford to spare any of mine i feel that out of mere humanity some sacrifice must be made for we cannot leave the poor fellow to starve  i can relieve you on that point said the scout for if you choose i am quite ready to remain  and of course interposed charlie i feel it my duty to remain with my old friend to the end  well i expected you to say something of this sort  now said the captain how many men will you require  none at all captain answered ben decisively  but what if these scoundrels should return to their old haunt said wilmot  let them come returned the scout  wi mr brooke an dick darvall an three winchesters an halfadozen sixshooters id engage to hold the cave against a score o such varmin  if mr brooke an dick are willin to  i am quite willing ben and i can answer for my friend dick so dont let that trouble you  well then that is settled  ill go off at once said the captain rising and signing to the trooper to bring up the horses  but bear in remembrance hunky ben that i hold you responsible for buck tom  if he recovers you must produce him  the scout accepted the responsibility the arrangements were soon made boots and saddles was sounded and the troopers rode away leaving charlie brooke dick darvall buck tom and the scout in possession of the outlaws cave    chapter twenty four  the meeting of old friends in curious circumstances  when the soldiers were safely away hunky ben returned to the cave and brought leather down  charlie brookes love for his old schoolfellow and playmate seemed to become a new passion now that the wreck of life and limb presented by shank had awakened within him the sensation of profound pity  and shanks admiration for and devotion to charlie increased tenfold now that the terrible barrier of self had been so greatly eliminated from his own nature and a new spirit put within him  by slow degrees and bit by bit each came to know and understand the other under the influence of new lights and feelings  but their thoughts about themselves and their joy at meeting in such peculiar circumstances had to be repressed to some extent in the presence of their common friend ralph ritsonalias buck tomfor charlie knew him only as an old schoolfellow though to leather he had been a friend and chum ever since they had landed in the new world  the scout during the first interval of leisure on the previous day had extracted the ball without much difficulty from bucks chest through which it had passed and was found lying close under the skin at his back  the relief thus afforded and rest obtained under the influence of some medicine administered by captain wilmot had brightened the poor fellow up to some extent and leather seeing him look so much better on his return began to entertain some hopes of his recovery  buck himself had no such hope but being a man of strong will he refused to let it be seen in his demeanour that he thought his case to be hopeless  yet he did not act from bravado or the slightest tincture of that spirit which resolves to die game  the approach of death had indeed torn away the veil and permitted him to see himself in his true colours but he did not at that time see jesus to be the saviour of even the chief of sinners  therefore his hopelessness took the form of silent submission to the inevitable  of course charlie brooke spoke to him more than once of the love of god in christ and of the dying thief who had looked to jesus on the cross and was saved but buck only shook his head  one afternoon in particular charlie tried hard to remove the poor mans perplexities  its all very well brooke said buck tom and very kind of you to interest yourself in me but the love of god and the salvation of christ are not for me  you dont know what a sinner i have been a rebel all my lifeall my life mark you  i would count it mean to come whining for pardon now that the game is up  i deserve hellor whatever sort o punishment is duean im willing to take it  ralph ritson said brooke impressively you are a far greater sinner than you think or admit  perhaps i am returned the outlaw sadly and with a slight expression of surprise  perhaps i am he repeated  indeed i admit that you are right butbut your saying so is a somewhat strange way to comfort a dying man  is it not  i am not trying to comfort you  i am trying by gods grace to convince you  you tell me that you have been a rebel all your days  yes i admit it  there are still it may be a few days yet to run and you are determined it seems to spend these in rebellion tooup to the very end  nay i do not say that  have i not said that i submit to whatever punishment is due  surely that is not rebellion  i can do nothing now to make up for a misspent life so i am willing to accept the consequences  is not that submission to godat least as far as lies in my power  no it is not submission  bear with me when i say it is rebellion still deeper rebellion than ever  god says to you you have destroyed yourself but in me is your help  he says though your sins be as scarlet they shall be white as snow  he says believe on the lord jesus christ and you shall be saved and assures you that whoever will may come to him and that no one who comes shall be cast outyet in the face of all that you tell me that the love of god and the salvation of christ are not for you  ralph my friend you think that if you had a chance of living your life over again you would do better and so deserve salvation  that is exactly what god tells us we cannot do and then he tells us that he himself in jesus christ has provided salvation from sin for us offers it as a free unmerited gift and immediately we dive to the deepest depth of sin by deliberately refusing this deliverance from sin unless we can somehow manage to deserve it  i cannot see it said the wounded man thoughtfully  only god himself by his holy spirit can enable you to see it said his companion and then in a low earnest voice with eyes closed and his hand on his friends arm he prayed that the outlaw might be born again  charlie brooke was not one of those who make long prayers either for a pretence or otherwise  buck tom smiled slightly when his friend stopped at the end of this one sentence  your prayer is not longwinded anyhow he said  true ralph but it is comprehensive  it requires a good deal of expounding and explaining to make man understand what we say or think the almighty needs none of that  indeed he does not need even the asking but he bids us ask and that is enough for me  i have seen enough of life to understand the value of unquestioning obedience whether one comprehends the reason of an order or not  ay returned buck quickly when he who gives the order has a right to command  that is so much a matter of course rejoined charlie that i would not think of referring to it while conversing with an intelligent man by the waywhich name would you like to be called by ralph or buck  it matters little to me returned the outlaw languidly and it wont matter to anybody long  i should prefer ralph for it is not associated with so much evil as the other but you know our circumstances are peculiar just now so all things considered i had better remain buck tom to the end of the chapter  ill answer to whichever name comes first when the roll is called in the next world  the conversation was interrupted at this point by the entrance of hunky ben bearing a deer on his lusty shoulders  he was followed by dick darvall  there said the former throwing the carcass on the floor i told ye i wouldnt be long o bringin in somethin for the pot  ay an the way he shot it too said the seaman laying aside his rifle would have made even a monkey stare with astonishment  has leather come back by the way  i seed him goin full sail through the woods when i went out this mornin  he has not yet returned said charlie  when i relieved him and sat down to watch by our friend here he said he felt so much better and stronger that he would take his gun and see if he couldnt find something for the pot  i advised him not to trust his feelings too much and not to go far butah here he comes to answer for himself  as he spoke a step was heard outside and next moment shank entered carrying a brace of rabbits which he flung down and then threw himself on a couch in a state of considerable exhaustion  there said he wiping the perspiration from his forehead  theyve cost me more trouble than theyre worth for im quite done up  i had no idea i had become so weak in the legs  ralph my dear fellow he added forgetting himself for the moment as he rose and went to his friends side i have more sympathy with you now that i have found out the extent of my own weakness  do you feel better  yes old boymuchmuch better  thats all right  im convinced thathallo why who shot the deer  hunky ben has beat you said charlie  beat leather exclaimed darvall why he beats all creation  i never seed anything like it since i went to sea  since you came ashore you should say  but come dick said charlie lets hear about this wonderful shooting  im sure it will amuse buckunless hes too wearied to listen  let him talk said the invalid  i like to hear him  thus exhorted and encouraged the seaman recounted his days experience  well you must know messmates said he that i set sail alone this mornin havin in my pocket the small compass i always carry about me also my bearins before startin so as i shouldnt go lost in the woodsthough that wouldnt be likely in such an narrow inlet as this traitors trap to say nothin o the landmarks alow and aloft of all sorts  i carried a winchester with me because not bein what you may call a crack shot i thought it would give me a better chance to have a lot o resarve shots in the locker dye see  i carried also a sixshooter as it might come handy you know if i fell in wi a redskin or a bear an got to close quarters  also my cutlass for ive bin used to that aboard ship when i was in the navy  well away i wentmakin sail down the valley to begin with an then a long tack into the mountains right in the winds eye that bein the way to get on the blind side o game  i hadnt gone far when up starts a bird o some sort  what like was it asked the scout  no more notion than the man in the moon returned the sailor  what wi the flutter an scurry an leaves branches an feathersan the starti seed nothin clear an i was so anxious to git somethin for the pot that six shots went arter it out o the winchester before i was quite sure id begun to firefor you must know ive larned to fire uncommon fast since i come to these parts  howsever i hit nothin  not quite so bad as that dick interrupted the scout gravely  well thats true but you better tell that part of it yourself hunky as you know more about it than me  it wasnt of much consequence said the scout betraying the slightest possible twinkle in his grey eyes but dick has a knack o lettin drive without much regard to whats in front of him  i happened to be more in front of him than that bird when he began to fire an the first shot hit my right leggin but by good luck only grazed the bark  of course i dropped behind a rock when the storm began and lay quiet there and when a lull came i hallood  yes he did halloo said dick resuming the narrative an that halloo was more like the yell of a bull of bashan than the cry of a mortal man  it made my heart jump into my throat an stick there for i thought i must have killed a whole redskin tribe at one shot  six shots dick  tell the exact truth an dont contradic yourself said hunky  no it wasnt retorted the seaman stoutly  it was arter the first shot that you gave the yell  howsever i allow that the echoes kep it goin till the six shots was offan i can tell you messmates that the hallooin an flutterin an scurryin an echoin an thought of redskins in my brain all mixed up wi the blatterin shots caused such a rumpus that i experienced considerable relief when the smoke cleared away an i seed hunky ben in front o me laughin fit to bust his sides  well to make a long yarn short i joined hunky and allowed him to lead seein that he understands the navigation hereaway better than me  come along says he an ill let you have a chance at a deer  all right says i an away we went up one hill an down anotherfor all the world as if we was walkin over a heavy atlantic swelltill we come to a sort o pass among the rocks  im goin to leave you here to watch says he an ill go round by the futt o the gully an drive the deer up  theyll pass quite close so youve only to  hunky stopped short as he was speakin and flopped down as if hed bin shothaulin me along wi him  keep quiet says he in a low voice  were in luck an dont need to drive  theres a deer comin up at this very minutea young one youll take it  i wont fire unless you miss  you may be sure i kep quiet messmates arter that  i took just one peep an there sure enough i saw a brown beast comin up the pass so we kep close as mice  there was a lot o small bushes not ten yards in front of us which ended in a cuta sort o crackin the hillside a hundred yards or more from the place where we was crouchin  now whispers hunky to  i never whisper remarked the scout  well well he said in a low vice to me says he dye see that openin in the bushes  i do says i  well then says he its about ten yards off be ready to commence firin when it comes to that openin  i will says i  an sure enough when the brown critter came forid at a walk an stopped sudden wi a look o surprise as if it hadnt expected to see me bang went my winchester four times like winkin an up went the deer four times in the air but niver a bit the worse was he  snap i went a fifth time but there was no shot an i gave a yell for i knew the cartridges was done  by that time the critter had reached the crack in the hill i told ye of an up in the air he went to clear it like an indyrubber ball  i felt amost like to fling my rifle at it in my rage when bang went a shot at my ear that all but deafned me an i wish i may niver fire another shot or furl another tgallantsl if that deer didnt crumple up in the air an drop down stone deadas dead as it now lays there on the floor  by the time dick darvall had ended his narrativewhich was much more extensive than our report of itsteaks of the deer were sputtering in a fryingpan and other preparations were being made for a hearty meal to which all the healthy men did ample justice  shank leather did what he could and even buck tom made a feeble attempt to join  that night a strict watch was kept outside the caveeach taking it by turns for it was just possible though not probable that the outlaws might return to their old haunt  no one appeared however and for the succeeding eight weeks the party remained there undisturbed shank leather slowly but surely regaining strength his friend buck tom as slowly and surely losing it while charlie dick and hunky ben ranged the neighbouring forest in order to procure food  leather usually remained in the cave to cook for and nurse his friend  it was pleasant work to shank for love and pity were at the foundation of the service buck tom perceived this and fully appreciated it  perchance he obtained some valuable light on spiritual subjects from shanks changed tone and manner which the logic of his friend brooke had failed to convey  who can tell    chapter twenty five  shows how the seaman was sent on a delicate mission and how he fared  shank said charlie one day as they were sitting in the sunshine near the outlaws cave waiting for dick and the scout to return to their midday meal it seems to me that we may be detained a good while here for we cannot leave ralph and it is evident that the poor fellow wont be able to travel for many a day  if ever interposed shank sorrowfully  well then i think we must send down to bulls ranch to see if there are any letters for us  i feel sure that there must be some and the question ariseswho are we to send  you must not go charlie whoever goes  you are the only link in this mighty wilderness that connects ralph and me with homeand hope weak and helpless as we are we cannot afford to let you out of our sight  well but if i dont go i cant see my way to asking the scout to go for he alone thoroughly understands the ways of the country and of the indiansif any should chance to come this way  besides considering the pledge he is under to be accountable for buck tom i doubt if he would consent to go  the question is answered then said shank for the only other man is dick darvall  true and it strikes me that dick will be very glad to go returned charlie with a smile of peculiar meaning  dye think hes getting tired of us charlie  by no means  but you know he has a roving disposition and i think he has a sort of fondness for jacksonthe boss of the ranch  it was found when the question was put to him that dick was quite ready to set out on the mission required of him  he also admitted his fondness for roaring bull  but what if you should lose your way asked the scout  find it again was dicks prompt reply  and what if you should be attacked by indians  fight em of course  but if they should be too many to fight  why clap on all sail an give em a starn chase which is always a long one  for this purpose however i would have to command a good craft so id expect you to lend me yours hunky ben  what my polly  even so  black polly  the scout received this proposal gravely and shook his head at first for he was naturally fond of his beautiful mare and besides doubted the sailors horsemanship though he had perfect faith in his courage and discretion  finally however he gave in and accordingly one fine morning at daybreak dick darvall mounted on black polly and armed with his favourite winchester revolvers and cutlass set sail down traitors trap to visit his ladylove  of course he knew that his business was to obtain letters and gather news  but honest dick darvall could not conceal from himself that his main object wasmary jackson  somehow it has come to be supposed or assumed that a jacktar cannot ride  possibly this may be true of the class as a whole to which jack belongs but it is not necessarily true of all and it certainly is not true of some  dick darvall was an expert horsemanthough a sailor  he had learned to ride when a boy before going to sea and his afterhabit of riding the white horses of the norseman did not cause him to forget the art of managing the buckers of the american plains  to use his own words he felt as much at home on the hurricane deck of a spanish pony as on the focsl of a manofwar so that the scouts doubt of his capacity as a rider was not well founded  tremendous was the bound of exultation which our seaman felt then when he found himself on the magnificent black mare with the fresh morning air fanning his temples and the bright morning sun glinting through a cut in the eastern range  soon he reached the lower end of the valley which being steep he had descended with tightened rein  on reaching the open prairie he gave the mare her head and went off with a wild whoop like an arrow from a bow  black polly required neither spur nor whip  she possessed that charmingly sensitive spirit which seems to receive an electric shock from its riders lightest chirp  she was what you may call an anxiously willing steed yet possessed such a tender mouth that she could be pulled up as easily as she could be made to go  a mere child could have ridden her and dick found in a few minutes that a slight check was necessary to prevent her scouring over the plains at racing speed  he restrained her therefore to a grand canter with many a stride and bound interspersed when such a thing as a rut or a little bush came in her way  with arched neck glistening eyes voluminous mane and flowing tail she flew onward hour after hour with many a playful shake of the head and an occasional snort as though to say this is mere childs play do let me put on a spurt  it may not be fair to credit such a noble creature with talking or even thinking slang but dick darvall clearly understood her to say something of the sort for after a while he reduced speed to a kind of indiarubber walk and patted her neck saying  no no lass you mustnt use up your strength at the beginning  weve got a longish trip before us polly an it wont do to clap on all sail at the beginnin of the voyage  at davids store dick stopped for a short time to obtain a little refreshment for himself and polly  there he found a group of cowboys discussing the affairs of their neighbours and enlarging noisily on things in general under the brainclearing and reasoninspiring influence of strong drink  to these he recounted briefly the incidents of the recent raid of the troops into traitors trap and learned that jake the flint had drifted south into mexico where he was plying the trade of cattle and horse stealer with the usual accompaniments of that professionfighting murdering drinking etcetera  some of the deeds of this notorious outlaw as narrated by the cowboy crux who happened to be there made the blood of dick run coldand dicks blood was not easily made to run otherwise than naturally by any oneexcept of course by mary jackson who could at all events make it run hot also fast or slow very much according to her own sweet will  but the seaman had no time to lose  he had still a long way to go and the day was advancing  remounting black polly he was soon out again on the prairie sweeping over the grassy waves and down into the hollows with a feeling of hilarious jollity that was born of high health goodnature pleasant circumstances and a freeandeasy mind  nothing worthy of particular notice occurred after this to mar the pleasure of our sailors voyage over the prairie until he reached a belt of woodland through which for half a mile he had to travel  here he drew rein and began to traverse the bit of forest at a quiet amble partly to rest polly and partly that he might more thoroughly enjoy the woodland scenery through the umbrageous canopy of which the sun was sending his slanting rays and covering the sward with a confused chequerwork of green and gold  and here dick darvall became communicative entered into conversation so to speak with himself  after a few minutes however this did not prove a sufficient outlet to his exuberant spirits  come dick he exclaimed give us a song  your voice aint perhaps much to speak of as to quality but theres no end of quantity  strike up now what shall it be  without replying to the question he struck up rule britannia in tones that did not justify his disparaging remark as to quality  he reached the other end of the wood and the end of the song at the same time britons shouted he with unalterable determinationnever never neever shall beredskins  this unnatural termination was not an intentional variation  it was the result of a scene that suddenly burst upon his view  far away on the prairie two riders were seen racing at what he would have styled a slant away from him  they were going at a pace that suggested fleeing for life  redskinsarter somethin murmured dick pulling up and shading his eyes from the sun with his right hand as he gazed earnestly at the two riders  nonno  theyre whites he continued one o them a man tother a woman  i can make that out anyhow  as he spoke the racing riders topped a faroff knoll halted and turned round as if to gaze back towards the norththe direction from which they had come  then wheeling round as if in greater haste than ever they continued their headlong gallop and disappeared on the other side of the knoll  dick naturally turned towards the north to see if possible what the two riders were flying from  he was not kept long in doubt for just then a band of horsemen was seen topping the farthest ridge in that direction and bearing down on the belt of woodland along the edge of which they galloped towards him  there was no mistaking who they were  the warwhoop sounding faint and shrill in the distance and the wild gesticulations of the riders told the story at once to our seamantwo palefaces pursued by a band of bloodthirsty savages  unskilled though he was in backwoods warfare dick was not unfamiliar with wars alarms nor was he wanting in common sense  to side with the weaker party was a natural tendency in our seaman  that the pursuers were red and the pursued white strengthened the tendency and the fact that one of the latter was a woman settled the question  instantly dick shook the reins drove his unarmed heels against the sides of polly and away they went after the fugitives like a black thunderbolt if there be such artillery in nature  a wild yell told him that he was seen  howl away ye land lubbers growled dick  youll have to fill your sails wi a stiffer breeze than howlin before ye overhaul this here craft  just then he reached the crest of a prairie billow whence he could see the fugitives still far ahead of him  suddenly a suspicion entered the seamans mind which made his heart almost choke him  what if this should be mary jackson and her father  their relative size countenanced the idea for the woman seemed small and the man unusually large  in desperate haste dick now urged on his gallant steed to her best pace and well did she justify the praises that had been often bestowed on her by hunky ben  in a very brief space of time she was close behind the fugitives and dick was now convinced that his suspicions as to who they were was right  he rode after them with divided feelingstremblingly anxious lest mary should fall into the hands of their ruthless foes exultantly glad that he had come there in time to fight or die if need be in her defence  suddenly the male fugitive who had only glanced over his shoulder from time to time pulled up wheeled round and quickly raised his rifle  hallo get on man dont stop  dick yelled in a voice worthy of bull himself  taking off his hat he waved it violently above his head as he spoke he saw the womans arm flash upwards a puff of smoke followed and a bullet whistled close over his head  next moment the fugitives had turned and resumed their headlong flight a few more minutes sufficed to bring dick and the black mare alongside for the latter was still vigorous in wind and limb while the poor jaded animals which mary and her father rode were almost worn out by a prolonged flight  dick darvall exclaimed jackson as the former rode up i never was gladder to see any man than i am to see you this hour though but for my mary id surely have sent you to kingdom come  her ears are better than mine you see  she recognised the voice an knocked up my rifle just as i pulled the trigger  but im afeared its too late lad  the way in which the man said this and the look of his pale haggard face sent a thrill to the heart of dick  what dye mean he said looking anxiously at mary who with a set rigid expression on her pale face was looking straight before her and urging her tired pony with switch and rein  i mean lad that weve but a poor chance to reach the ranch wi such knockedup brutes as these  of course we can turn at bay an kill as many o the reddevils as possible before its all over wi us but what good would that do to mary  if we could only check the varmins there might be some hope but  jackson exclaimed the seaman in a firm tone ill do my best to check them  god bless you marygoodbye  heave ahead now full swing  as he spoke dick pulled up while the others continued their headlong flight straight for the ranch which was by the only a few miles distant  wheeling round dick cantered back to the knoll over which they had just passed and halted on the top of it  from this position he could see the band of about fifty indians careering towards him and yelling with satisfaction for they could also see hima solitary horsemanclear cut against the bright sky  dick got ready his repeating rifle  we have already mentioned the fact that he had learned to load and fire this formidable weapon with great rapidity though he had signally failed in his attempts to aim with it being well aware of his weakness he made up his mind in his present desperate extremity not to aim at all  he had always felt that the difficulty of getting the back and front sights of the rifle to correspond with the object aimed at was a slow and in his case an impossible process  he therefore resolved to simply point his weapon and fire  surely he muttered to himself even in that trying moment surely i cant altogether miss a whole bunch o fifty men an horses  he waited until he thought the savages were within long range and then elevating his piece a little fired  the result justified his hopes  a horse fell dead upon the plain and its owner although evidently unwounded was for the time hors de combat  true to his plan dick kept up such a quick continuous fire and made so much noise and smoke that it seemed as if a whole company of riflemen were at work instead of one man and several horses on the plain testified to the success of the pointing as compared with the aiming principle  of course the fire was partly returned and for a time the stout seaman was under a pretty heavy rain of bullets but as the savages fired while galloping their aim was necessarily bad  this fusillade had naturally the effect of checking the advance of the indiansespecially when they drew near to the reckless man who when the snap of his rifle told that his last cartridge was off wheeled about and fled as fast as black polly could lay hoofs to the plain  and now he found the value of the trustworthy qualities of his steed for instead of guiding her out of the way of obstacles he gave her her head held tight with his legs and merely kept an eye on the ground in front to be ready for any swerve bound or leap that might be impending  thus his hands were set free to recharge the magazine of his rifle which he did with deliberate rapidity  the truth is that recklessness has a distinct tendency to produce coolness  and there is no one who can afford to be so deliberate and of whom other men are so much afraid as the man who has obviously made up his mind to die fighting  while dick was loadingup black polly was encouraged by voice and heel to do her best and her best was something to see and remember  when the charging was finished dick drew rein and trotted to the next knoll he encountered from which point he observed with some satisfaction that the fugitives were still pressing on and that the distance between them and their foe had slightly increased  but the seaman had not much time to look or think for the band of redskins was drawing near  when they came within range he again opened fire  but this time the savages divided evidently with the intention of getting on both sides of him and so distracting his attention  he perceived their object at once and reserved his fire until they turned and with frantic yells made a simultaneous dash on him right and left again he waited till his enemies were close enough and then opened fire right and left alternately while the indians found that they had outwitted themselves and scarcely dared to fire lest the opposite bands should hit each other  having expended the second supply of ammunition dick wheeled round and took to flight as before  of course the mare soon carried him out of range and again he had the satisfaction of observing that the fugitives had increased their distance from the foe  one more check o this kind thought dick and theyll be safei think  while thus thinking he was diligently recharging and soon cantered to the top of a third knoll where he resolved to make his final stand the ranch was by that time dimly visible on the horizon and the weary fugitives were seen struggling towards it  but dick found on halting and looking back that the indians had changed their tactics  instead of directing their attention to himself as on the previous occasions they had spread out to the right and left and had scattered besides keeping well out of range  what are the sinners up to now muttered the seaman in some perplexity  he soon perceived that they meant to go past him altogether if possible and head towards the fugitives in separate groups  ay but its not possible exclaimed dick answering his own thoughts as he turned swiftly and stretched out after his friends seeing this the savages tried to close in on him from both sides but their already winded ponies had no chance against the grand mexican mare which having been considerately handled during the days journey was comparatively fresh and in full vigour  shooting ahead he now resolved to join his friends and a feeling of triumph began to rise within his breast as he saw them pushing steadily onward  the ranch however was still at a considerable distance while the indians were rapidly gaining ground  at that moment to dicks horror the pony which mary jackson rode stumbled and fell sending its rider over its head  but the fair mary besides being a splendid horsewoman was singularly agile and quick in perception  for some time she had anticipated the catastrophe and at the first indication of a stumble leaped from the saddle and actually alighted on her feet some yards ahead  of course she fell with some violence but the leap broke her fall and probably saved her neck  she sprang up instantly and grasping the reins tried to raise her pony it was too late  the faithful creature was dead  jackson pulling up wheeled round and was back at her side instantly almost at the same moment dick darvall came up threw the mare almost on her haunches leaped from the saddle and ran to mary  as he did so the crash of a pistol shot at his ear almost deafened him and a glance showed him that jackson had shot his horse which fell dead close to his daughters pony  kill your horse dick he growled sharply as he exerted his great strength to the utmost and dragged the haunches of his own steed close to the head of the other  its our only chance  dick drew his revolver and aimed at the heart of black polly but for the soul of him he could not pull the trigger  noi wont he cried grasping the lasso which always hung at the saddlebow  hobble the forelegs  there was such determination in the sailors command that jackson felt bound to obey  at the same moment dick bound the horses hindlegs  he fully understood what jackson intended and the latter was as quick to perceive the seamans drift  seizing the reins while his friend caught hold of the lasso dick cried out o the way mary and with a mighty effort the two men threw the mare on her side  firstrate cried jackson while his companion held down the animals head  it couldnt have dropped better  jump inside mary an lie down flat behind your pony  let mary have the reins dick  she knows how to hold its head down without showin herself  even while he was speaking jackson and dick leaped into the triangle of horses thus formed and crouching low disappeared from the sight of the savages who now came on yelling with triumph for they evidently thought themselves sure of their victims by that time  are ye a good shot dick asked jackson as he gazed sternly at the approaching foe  noabominably bad  fire low then  you may catch the horses if ye miss the redskins anyhow youll hit the ground if you aim low an its wonderful what execution a bullet may do arter hittin mother earth  i never aim replied the sailor  only a waste o time  i just point straight an fire away  do it then growled roaring bull with something that sounded like a short laugh  at the same moment he himself took quick aim at the foe and fired the leading horse and man immediately rolled upon the plain  as both men were armed with repeating rifles the fusillade was rapid and most of the savages who seldom fight well in the open were repulsed  but several of them headed apparently by their chief rode on fearlessly until within pistolshot  then the two defenders of this peculiar fortress sprang up with revolvers in each hand  lie close mary cried jackson as he fired and the chiefs horse rolled over almost reaching their position with the impetus of the charge  the chief himself lay beside his horse for another shot had ended his career  as two other horses had fallen the rest of the band wheeled aside and galloped away followed by a brisk fire from the white men who had again crouched behind their breastwork and resumed their rifles  bullets were by that time flying over them in considerable numbers for those indians who had not charged with their chief had after retiring to a safe distance taken to firing at long range  at this work dicks rifle and straight pointing were of little use so he reserved his fire for close quarters while jackson who was almost a certain shot at average ranges kept the savages from drawing nearer  lie closer to the pony miss mary said dick as a shot passed close over the girl and whistled between him and his comrade  were you hurt in the fall  no not in the least  dont you think theyll hear the firing at the ranch father  ay lass if theres anybody to hear it but i sent the boys out this mornin to hunt up a bunch o steers that have drifted south among wilsons cattle an i fear theyve not come back yet  see the reptiles are goin to try it again  as he spoke the remnant of the redskins who pressed home the first charge having held a palaver induced the whole band to make another attempt but they were met with the same vigour as beforea continuous volley at long range which emptied several saddles and then when the plucky men of the tribe charged close the white men stood up as before and plied them with revolvers so rapidly that they were fain to wheel aside and retire  ammunitions gettin low said dick in an anxious tone  then ill waste no more growled jackson but only fire when im safe to hit  as he spoke a distant cheer was heard and looking back they saw with a rebound of hope that a band of five or six cowboys were coming from the ranch and galloping full swing to the rescue  behind them a few seconds later appeared a line of men who came on at a swinging trot  troopers i do believe exclaimed jackson  thank god said mary with a deep sigh of relief as she sat up to look at them  the troopers gave a cheer of encouragement as they thundered past to the attack but the indians did not await the onset  at the first sight of the troops they fled and in a few minutes pursued and pursuers alike were out of sighthidden behind the prairie waves  i cant tell you how thankful i am that i didnt shoot the mare said dick as they unfastened the feet of black polly and let her rise  id never have been able to look hunky ben in the face again arter it  well im not sorry you spared her said jackson as for the two that are dead theyre no great lossyet ive a kind o regret too for the poor things served us well  faithfullyeven to death added mary in a sorrowful tone as she stooped to pat the neck of her dead pony  will you mount miss mary and ride home asked the sailor  thank youno id rather walk with father  we have not far to go now  then well all walk together said jackson  dick threw black pollys bridle over his arm and they all set off at a smart walk for the ranch of roaring bull while the troops and cowboys chased the redskins back into the mountains whence they had come    chapter twenty six  treats of various interesting matters and tells of news from home  dick darvall now learned that owing to the disturbed state of the country captain wilmot had left a small body of men to occupy bulls ranch for a time hence their presence at the critical moment when jackson and his daughter stood so much in need of their assistance  he also found that there were two letters awaiting the party at traitors trapone for charles brooke esquire and one for mr s leather  they bore the postmarks of the old country  youd better not start back wi them for three or four days dick said jackson when they were seated that evening in the hall of the ranch enjoying a cup of coffee made by the fair hands of mary  dick shook his head  im acting postboy just now said he an it would ill become me to hang off an on here waitin for a fair wind when i can beat into port with a foul one  but if the redskins is up all round as some o the boys have reported its not merely a foul wind but a regular gale thats blowin an it would puzzle you to beat into port in the teeth o that  i think remarked mary with an arch smile that mr darvall had better lay to until the troops return tonight and report on the state of the weather  to this the gallant seaman declared that he would be only too happy to cast anchor altogether where he was for the rest of his life but that duty was duty and that blow high or blow low fair weather or foul duty had to be attended to  thats true o highprincipled seaman returned jackson and what dye consider your duty at the present time  to deliver my letters o roarin bull replied dick  just so but if you go slick off when redskins are rampagin around youll be sure to get nabbed an roasted alive an so youll never deliver your letters  its my duty to try said dick  howsever he added turning to mary with a benignant smile ill take your advice miss mary an wait for the report o the soldiers  when the troopers returned their report was that the redskins after being pretty severely handled had managed to reach the woods where it would have been useless to follow them so close upon night but it was their opinion that the band which had so nearly captured the boss of the ranch and his daughter was merely a marauding band from the south of the same indians who had previously attacked the ranch and that as for the indians of the district they believed them to be quite peaceably disposed  which says a good deal for them remarked the officer in command of the troops when we consider the provocation they receive from buck tom jake the flint and suchlike ruffians  the moon rises at ten tonight dick said jackson as they went together to the stables to see that the horses were all right  thats so said the sailor who noticed something peculiar in the mans tone what may be the reason o your reference to that bit of astronomy  why you see returned the other postboys in these diggins are used to travellin night an day  an the troopers report o the weather might be worse  you was sayin somethin about duty wasnt you  right jackson returned dick but black polly is not used to travellin night an day  if she was id take her back tonight for moonlight is good enough for a man that has twice taken soundins along the road an whos well up in all the buoys beacons an landmarks but it would be cruelty to the good mare  duty first dick the mare second  you dont need to trouble about her  ill lend ye one o my best horses an take good care o black polly till hunky ben claims her  thank ee jackson but ill not part wi black polly till ive delivered her to her owner  i wont accept your invite to stop here three or four days but neither will i start off tonight  ive too much regard for the good mare to do that  ho ho thought his host with an inward chuckle its not so much the mare as mary that youve a regard for my young sailor  but in spite of his name the man was much too polite to express this opinion aloud  he merely said well dick you know that youre welcome to squat here as long or as short a time as you like an use the best o my horses if so disposed or do the postboy business on black polly  do as ye like wi me an mine boy for its only fair to say that but for your help this day my mary an me would have bin done for  they reached the stable as he was speaking and jackson at once turned the conversation on the horses thus preventing a reply from dickin regard to which the latter was not sorry  in the stall the form of black polly looked grander than ever for her head nearly touched the roof as she raised it and turned a gleaming eye on the visitors at the same time uttering a slight whinny of expectation  why i do believe she has transferred her affections to you dick said jackson  i never heard her do that before except to hunky ben and shes bin many a time in that stall  more likely that she expected ben had come to bid her goodnight returned the sailor  but the way in which the beautiful creature received dicks caresses induced jackson to hold to his opinion  it is more probable however that some similarity of disposition between dick darvall and hunky ben had commended itself to the mare which was as much as many a human being of an amiable loving disposition  she thoroughly appreciated the tenderness and forbearance of her master and more recently of dick  no doubt the somewhat rough way in which she had been thrown to the ground that day may have astonished her but it evidently had not soured her temper  that night dick did not see much of mary  she was far too busy attending to and providing for the numerous guests at the ranch to be able to give individual attention to any one in particulareven had she been so disposed  buttercup of course lent able assistance to her mistress in these domestic duties and despite her own juvenilitywe might perhaps say in consequence of itgave mary much valuable advice  dat mans in a bad way said she as with her huge lips pouting earnestly she examined the contents of a big pot on the fire  the black maidens lips were so pronounced and expressive that they might almost be said to constitute her face  what man asked mary who with her sleeves tucked up to the elbows was manipulating certain proportions of flour water and butter  why dick oh course  hes de only man wuth speakin about  mary blushed a little in spite of herself and laughed hilariously as she replied  dear me butter i didnt think he had made such a deep impression on you  s not ony on me hes made a mpressn returned the maid carelessly  he makes de same mpressn on eberybody  how dyou know asked mary  cause i see answered the maid  she turned her eyes on her mistress as she spoke and immediately a transformation scene was presented  the eyes dwindled into slits as the cheeks rose and the serious pout became a smile so magnificent that ivory teeth and scarlet gums set in ebony alone met the gaze of the beholder  buttercup exclaimed mary stamping her little foot firmly its boiling over  she was right  teeth and gums vanished  the eyes returned so did the pout and the pot was whipped off the fire in a twinkling but not before a mighty hiss was heard and the head of the black maiden was involved in a cloud of steam and ashes  i told you so cried mary quoting from an ancient manuscript  no you dint retorted her servitor speaking from the depths of her own consciousness  we refrain from following the conversation beyond this point as it became culinary and flat  next day dick darvall refreshedand owing to some quite inexplicable influences enlivenedmounted black polly and started off alone for traitors trap leaving his heart and a reputation for cool pluck behind him  of course he was particularly watchful and circumspect on the way up but saw nothing to call for a further display of either pluck or coolness  on arriving at the cave he found his friends there much as he had left them  buck tom owing to the skilled attentions which he had received from that amateur surgeon hunky ben and a long refreshing sleepthe result of partial relief from painwas a good deal better and poor leather cheered by the hope thus raised of his friends recovery was himself considerably improved in health and spirits  fortunately for his own peace of mind it never seemed to occur to shank that a return to health meant for buck tom death on the gallows perhaps his own illness had weakened shanks powers of thought  it may be his naturally thoughtless disposition helped to render him oblivious of the solemn fact and no one was cruel enough to remind him of it but buck himself never forgot it yet he betrayed no symptom of despondency neither did he indicate any degree of hope  he was a man of resolute purpose and had the power of subduingat least of absolutely concealinghis feelings  to those who nursed him he seemed to be in a state of gentle colourless resignation  charlie brooke and hunky ben having been out together had returned well laden with game and leather was busy at the fire preparing a savoury mess of the same for his sick friend when dick arrived  news from the old country he exclaimed holding up the letters on entering the cave  two for charles brooke esquire and one for mister leather  they might have been more polite to me  hand it here said the latter endeavouring to conceal under a jest his excitement at the sight of a letter from home for his wild life had cut him off from communication for a very long time  one of mine is from old jacob crossley said charlie tearing the letter open with eager interest  an mine is from sister may exclaimed shank  if any one had observed buck tom at that moment he would have seen that the outlaw started and rose almost up on one elbow while a deep flush suffused his bronzed countenance  the action and the flush were only momentary however he sank down again and turned his face to the wall  charlie also started and looked at shank when the name of may was mentioned and the eye of hunky ben was on him at the moment  but hunky of course could not interpret the start  he knew little of our heros past historynothing whatever about may  being a western scout no line of his mahoganylooking face indicated that the start aroused a thought of any kind  while the recipients of the letters were busily perusing their missives dick darvall gave the scout a brief outline of his expedition to the ranch reserving the graphic narration of incidents to a more fitting occasion when all the party could listen  dick youre a trump said the scout  im a lucky fellow anyhow returned dick  in very truth ye are lad to escape from such a big bunch o redskins without a scratch why  pooh interrupted the sailor thats not the luck im thinkin of havin overhauled roarin bull an his little girl in time to help rescue them thats what i call luckdee see  yes i see was hunky bens laconic reply  perhaps the scout saw more than was intended for he probably observed the glad enthusiasm with which the bold seaman mentioned roaring bulls little girl  we cannot tell  his wooden countenance betrayed no sign and he may have seen nothing but he was a western scout and accustomed to take particular note of the smallest signs of the wilderness  capitalfirstrate exclaimed charlie looking up from his letter when he had finished it  just what i was going to say or something of the same sort said leather as he folded his epistle  then theres nothing but good news said charlie  nothing  i suppose its the same with you to judge from your looks returned shank  exactly  perhaps said charlie it may interest you all to hear my letter  there are no secrets in it and the gentleman who writes it is a jolly old fellow jacob crossley by name  you know him dick as the owner of the walrus though youve never seen him  all right  i remember fire away said dick  it is dated from his office in london continued our hero and runs thus    my dear brookewe were all very glad to hear of your safe arrival   in new york and hope that long before this reaches your hand you will   have found poor leather and got him to some place of comfort where he   may recover the health that we have been given to understand he has   lost    i chanced to be down at sealford visiting your mother when your   letter arrived hence my knowledge of its contents  mrs leather and   her daughter may were then as usual  by the way what a pretty girl   may has become  i remember her such a rumpled up dressanyhow   harumscarum sort of a girl that i find it hard to believe the tall   graceful modest creature i meet with now is the same person  captain   stride says she is the finest craft he ever saw except that wonderful   maggie about whose opinions and sayings he tells us so much    but this is a double digression  to return your letter of course   gave us all great pleasure  it also gave your mother and may some   anxiety where it tells of the necessity of your going up to that   wildwest place traitors trap where poor leather is laid up  take   care of yourself my dear boy for im told that the red savages are   still given to those roasting scalping and other torturing that one   has read of in the pages of fenimore cooper    by the way before i forget it let me say in reference to the   enclosed bill it is a loan which i have obtained for leather at very   moderate interest and when more is required more can be obtained on   the same terms  let him understand this for i dont wish that he   should think on the one hand that he is drawing on his mothers   slender resources or on the other hand that he is under obligation   to any one  i send the bill because i feel quite sure that you   started on this expedition with too little  it is drawn in your name   and i think you will be able to cash it at any civilised towneven in   the far west    talking of captain stridewas i talking of him  well no matter   as he is past work now but thinks himself very far indeed from that   condition i have prevailed on him to accept a new and peculiar post   arising out of the curious evolutions of the firm of withers and   company which satisfies the firm completely and suits the captain to a   t  as the work can be done anywhere a residence has been taken for   him in sealford midway between that of your mother and mrs leather   so that he and his wife and little girl can run into either port when   so disposed  as mrs l however to use his own phraseology is   almost always to be found at anchor in the brooke harbour he usually   kills both with the same visit  i have not been to see him yet in the   new abode and do not know what the celebrated maggie thinks of it    when you find leather poor fellow tell him that his mother and   sister are very well  the former is indefatigable in knitting those   hundreds of socks and stockings for poor people about which there has   been and still is and i think ever will be so much mystery  the   person who buys them from her must be very deep as well as honest for   no inquiries ever throw any fresh light on the subject and heor   she whichever it ispays regularly as the worsted work is   deliveredso im told  it is a little old lady who paysbut ive   reason to believe that shes only a gobetweensome agent of a   society for providing cheap clothing for the poor i fancy which the   poor stand very much in need of poor things  your good mother helps   in this workat least so i am told but im not much up in in the   details of it yet  i mean to run down to see them in a few days and   hear all about it    stride i forgot to say is allowed to smoke a pipe in your mothers   parlour when he pays her a visit  this is so like her amiability for   she hates tobacco as much as i do  i ventured on a similarly amiable   experiment one day when the worthy captain dined with me but the   result was so serious that i have not ventured to repeat it  you   remember my worthy housekeeper mrs bland  well she kicked over the   traces and became quite unmanageable  i had given stride leave to   smoke after dessert because i had a sort of idea that he could nor   digest his food without a pipe  you know my feelings with regard to   young fellows who try to emulate chimneys so you can understand   that my allowing the captain to indulge was no relaxation of my   principles but was the result of a strong objection i had to spoil   the dinner of a man who was somewhat older than myself by cramming my   principles down his throat    but the moment that mrs bland entered i knew by the glance of her   eye as well as by the sniff of her nose that a storm was brewing   upas stride puts itand i was not wrong  the storm burst upon me   that evening  its impossible and might be tedious to give you all   the conversation that we had after stride had gone but the upshot was   that she gave me warning    but my good woman i began    its of no use goodwomaning me mr crossley said she i   couldnt exist in a ouse were smokin is allowed  my dear father   died of smokinat least if he didnt smokin must ave ad   somethink to do with it for after the dear man was gone a pipe an a   plug of the nasty stuff was found under is piller so i cant stand   it an whats more mr crossley i wont stand it  just think   sir ow silly it is to put a bit of clay in your mouth an draw smoke   through it an then to spit it out again as if you didnt like it as   no more no one does on beginnin it for boys only smoke to look   like men an men only smoke because theyve got up the abit an   cant elp it  wy sir you may git up any abit  you may git the   abit of walkin on your ands an shakin your legs in the hair if   you was to persevere long enough but that would only prove you a fool   fit for a circus or a lunatic asylum  you never see the hanimals   smokin  they knows better  just fancy what would you think if you   saw the cab osses all asettin on their tails in the rank smokin   pipes an cigars  what would you think of a oss wen is cabby   cried geeup theres a fare a owlin for us an that oss would   say hall right cabby just old on hold man till i finish my   pipe  no mr crossley no i    but my good soul  i burst in here do listen    no use goodsoulin me mr crossley  i tell you i wont stand it   my dear father died of it an i cant stand it    i hate it mrs bland myself    i shouted this interruption in such a loud fierce tone that the good   woman stopped and looked at me in surprise    yes mrs bland i continued in the same tone i detest smoking   you know i always did but now more than ever for your reasoning has   convinced me that there are some evil consequences of smoking which   are almost worse than smoking itself  rest assured that never again   shall the smell of the noxious weed defile the walls of this house    lauk sir said mrs bland    i had subdued her charlie by giving in with dignity  i shall try   the same role next breeze that threatens    i almost feel that i owe you an apology for the length of this   epistle  let me conclude by urging you to bring poor leather home   strong and well  tell him from me that there is a vacant situation in   the firm of withers and company which will just suit him  he shall   have it when he returnsif god spares me to see him again  but im   getting old charlie and we know not what a day may bring forth  a kinda very kind letter said leather earnestly when his friend had finished reading  why he writes as if he were your own father brooke remarked buck tom who had been listening intently  have you known him long  not long  only since the time that he gave me the appointment of supercargo to the walrus but the little i have seen of him has aroused in me a feeling of strong regard  my sister may refers to him here said leather with a peculiar smile as he reopened his letter  the greater part of this tells chiefly of private affairs which would not interest any of you but here is a passage which forms a sort of commentary on what you have just heard    you will be amused to hear she writes that good captain stride   has come to live in sealford  kind old mr crossley has given him   some sort of work connected with withers and companys house which i   can neither understand nor describe  indeed i am convinced it is   merely work got up on purpose by mr crossley as an excuse for giving   his old friend a salary for he knows that captain stride would be   terribly cast down if offered a pension as that would be equivalent   to pronouncing him unfit for further duty and the captain will never   admit himself to be in that condition till he is dying  old jacob   crossleyas you used to call himthinks himself a very sagacious and   deep man but in truth there never was a simpler or more transparent   one  he thinks that we know nothing about who it is that sends the   old lady to buy up all the worstedwork that mother makes but we know   perfectly well that it is himself and dear mother could never have   gone on working with satisfaction and receiving the money for it all   if we had not found out that he buys it for our fishermen who are   said really to be very much in need of the things she makes    the dear old man is always doing something kind and considerate in a   sly way under the impression that nobody notices  he little knows   the power of womans observation  by the way that reminds me that he   is not ignorant of womans powers in other ways  we heard yesterday   that his old and faithfulthough rather tryinghousekeeper had   quarrelled with him about smoking  we were greatly surprised for we   knew that the old gentleman is not and never was a smoker  she   threatened to leave but we have since heard i am glad to say that   they have made it up  hm theres food for meditation in all that said dick darvall as he knocked the ashes out of his pipe and put it in his vest pocket    chapter twenty seven  hunky ben and charlie get beyond their depth and buck tom gets beyond recall  while hunting together in the woods near traitors trap one day charlie brooke and hunky ben came to a halt on the summit of an eminence that commanded a wide view over the surrounding country  tis a glorious place ben said brooke leaning his rifle against a tree and mounting on a piece of rock the better to take in the beautiful prospect of woodland river and lake  when i think of the swarms of poor folk in the old country who dont own a foot of land have little to eat and only rags to cover them i long to bring them out here and plant them down where god has spread his blessings so bountifully where there is never lack of work and where nature pays high wages to those who obey her laws  no doubt theres room enough here returned the scout sitting down and laying his rifle across his knees  ive often thowt on them subjects but my thowts only lead to puzzlement for out here in the wilderness a man cant git all the information needful to larn him about things in the old world  dear dear it do seem strange to me that any man should choose to starve in the cities when theres the free wilderness to roam about in  i mind havin a palaver once wi a stoveup man when i was ranchin down in kansas on the indian territory line  screw was his name an a real kindhearted fellow he was tooonly he couldnt keep his hand off that curse o mankind the bottle  i mentioned to him my puzzlements about this matter an he up fist an come down on the table wi a crack that made the glasses bounce as if theyd all come alive an caused a plate o mush in front of him to spread itself all over the placebut he cared nothin for that he was so riled up by the thowts my obsarvation had shook up  hunky ben says he glowerin at me like a bull wi the measles the reason we stay there an dont come out here or go to the other parts o gods green arth is cause we cant help ourselves an dont know how or whatdont know nothin in fact  thats a bustedup state o ignorance no doubt said i in a soothin sort o way for i seed the man was riled pretty bad by ancient memories an looked gittin waxier  he wore a black eye too caught in a free fight the night before which didnt improve his looks  you said we just now says i  was you one o them  of course i was says he tamin down a little an id bin one o them yetif not food for worms by this timeif it hadnt bin for a dook as took pity on me  whats a dook says i  a dook says he  why hes a dook you know a sort o markis somewheres between a lord an a king  i dont know zackly where an hang me if i care but theyre a bad lot are some o them dooksrich as pharaoh king o jruslem an hard as nailsthough im bound for to say they aint all alike  some on ems no better nor costermongers others are men men what keeps in mind that the same god made us all an will call us all to the same account an that the same kind o worms ll finish us all off at last  but this dook as took pity on me was a true blue  he wasnt one o the hard sort as didnt care a rush for us so long as his own stummick was full  neether was he one o the buttermouths as dursent say boo to a goose  he spoke out to me like a man an he knew well enough that id bin born in the london slums an that my daddy had bin born there before me an that my mother had caught her death o cold through havin to pawn her only pair o boots to pay my school fees an then walk barefutt to the court in a winter day to answer for not sendin her boy to the board schoolher send me to schoolshe might as well have tried to send daddy himself an him out o work too an all on us starvin  my dook when he hear about it amost bust wi passion  i hear im arterwards talkin to a overseer or somebody confound it says heno not quite that for my dook he never swore only he said somethin pretty stiffthese people are starvin says he an pawnin their things for food to keep em alive an they cant git work nohow says he an yet you worry them out o body an soul for school fees  i didnt hear no more for the overseer smoothed im down somehows  but that dookthat good man hunky ben paid my passage to ameriky an sent me off wi his blessin an a bible  unfortnitly i took a bottle wi me an when i got to the other side i got hold of another bottle an anotheran there stands the last of em  an wi that mr brooke he fetched the bottle in front of him such a crack wi his fist as sent it all to smash against the opposite wall  well done screw cried the boy at the bar laughin have another bottle  poor screw smiled in a sheepish way for the rile was out of him by that time an says he well i dont mind if i do  a shot like that deserves another  ah me continued the scout it do take the manhood out of a fellow that drink  even when his indignations roused and he tries to shake it off he cant do it  well do i know that ben  it is only god who can help a man in such a case  the scout gravely shook his head  seems to me mr brooke that theres a screw loose some wheres in our theology for ive heard parsons as well as you say thatas if the almighty condescended to help us only when were in bad straits  now though im but a scout and pretend to no book larnin it comes in strong upon me that if god made us an measures our movements an gives us every beat o the pulse an counts the very hairs of our heads we stand in need of his help in every case and at all times that we cant save ourselves from mischief under any circumstances great or small without him  i have thought of that too sometimes said charlie sitting down on the rock beside his companion and looking at him in some perplexity but does not the view you take savour somewhat of fatalism and seek to free us from responsibility in regard to what we do  it dont seem so to me replied the scout im not speakin you see so much of doin as of escapin  no doubt we are perfectly free to will but it dont follow that we are free to act  im quite free to will to cut my leg off or to let it stay on an if i carry out my will an do it why im quite free there tooan also responsible but i aint free to sew it on again however much i may will to do so leastwise if i do it wont stick  the consekinces o my deed i must bear but who will deny that the almighty could grow on another leg if he chose  why some creeters he does allow to get rid of a limb or two an grow new ones  so you see im responsible for my deeds but at the same time i must look to god for escape from the consekinces if he sees fit to let me escape  a man bein free may drink himself into a drunkard but hes not free to cure himself  he cant do it  the demon crave has got him by the throat forces him to open his mouth and pours the fiery poison down  the thing that he is free to do is to will  he may if he chooses call upon god the saviour to help him an my own belief is that no man ever made such a call in vain  how if that be so are we to account for the failure of those who try honestly strive struggle and agonise yet obviously fail  its not for the like o me mr brooke to expound the outs an ins o all mysteries  yet i will pint out that you what they call beg the question when you say that such people honestly strive  if a man tries to unlock a door with all his might and main heart and soul honestly tries by turnin the key the wrong way hell strive till doomsday without openin the door  its my opinion that a man may get into difficulties of his own freewill  he can get out of them only by applyin to his maker  during the latter part of this conversation the hunters had risen and were making their way through the trackless woods when the scout stopped suddenly and gazed for a few seconds intently at the ground then he kneeled and began to examine the spot with great care  a footprint here he said that tells of recent visitors  friends ben or foes asked our hero also going on his knees to examine the marks  well now i see only a pressed blade or two of grass but nothing the least like a footprint  it puzzles me more than i can tell how you scouts seem so sure about invisible marks  truly if they was invisible you would have reason for surprise but my wonder is that you dont see them  any child in woodcraft might read them  see here is the edge o the right futt making a faint impression where the ground is softan the heel surely ye see the heel  a small hollow i do see but as to its being a heelprint i could not pronounce on that  has it been made lately think you  ay last night or this morning at latest and it was made by the futt of jake the flint  i know it well for ive had to track him more than once an would spot it among a thousand  if jake is in the neighbourhood wouldnt it be well to return to the cave  he and some of his gang might attack it in our absence  no fear o that replied the scout rising from his inspection the futt pints away from the cave  i should say that the flint has bin there durin the night an found that we kep too sharp a lookout to be caught sleepin  where he went to arter that no one can tell but we can hoof it an see  like enough he went to spy us out alone an then returned to his comrades  so saying the scout hoofed it through the woods at a pace that tested charlie brookes powers of endurance exceptionally good though they were  after a march of about four miles in comparative silence they were conducted by the footprints to an open space in the midst of dense thicket where the fresh ashes of a camp fire indicated that a party had spent some time  just so  they came to see what was up and what could be done found that nothin partiklar was up an nothin at all could be done so off they go mounted to fish in other waters  just as well for us  but not so well for the fish in the other waters remarked charlie  true but we cant help that  come we may as well return now  while charlie and the scout were thus following the trail buck tom lying in the cave became suddenly much worse  it seemed as if some string in his system had suddenly snapped and let the poor human wreck run down  come here leather he gasped faintly  poor shank who never left him and who was preparing food for him at the time was at his side in a moment and bent anxiously over him  dyou want anything he asked  nothing shank  wheres dick  outside cutting some firewood  dont call him  im glad we are alone said the outlaw seizing his friends hand with a feeble tremulous grasp  im dying shank dear boy  you forgive me  forgive you ralph  aylong long ago i he could not finish the sentence  i know you did shank returned the dying man with a faint smile how it will fare with me hereafter i know not  ive but one word to say when i get there and that isguilty  ii loved your sister shank  ayyou never guessed it  i only tell you now that i may send her a message  tell her that the words she once said to me about a saviour have never left me  they are like a light in the darkness now god bless youshankandmay  with a throbbing heart and listening ear shank waited for more but no more came  the hand he still held was lifeless and the spirit of the outlaw had entered within the veil of that mysterious hereafter    chapter twenty eight  chase capture and end of jake the flint  it was growing dark when brooke and the scout reached the cave that evening and found that buck tom was dead but they had barely time to realise the fact when their attention was diverted by the sudden arrival of a large band of horsemencowboys and othersthe leader of whom seemed to be the cowboy crux  hunky ben and his friends had of course made rapid preparations to receive them as foes if need were but on recognising who composed the cavalcade they went out to meet them  hallo  hunky shouted crux as he rode up and leaped off his steed have they been here  who dye mean demanded the scout  why jake the flint to be sure an his murderin gang  havent ye heard the news  not i  who dye think would take the trouble to come up here with noos  theyve got clear off boys said crux in a voice of great disappointment  so we must off saddle an camp where we are for the night  while the rest of the party dismounted and dispersed to look for a suitable campingground crux explained the reason of their unexpected appearance  after the flint and his companions had left their mountain fastness as before described they had appeared in different parts of the country and committed various depredations some of their robberies having been accompanied with bloodshed and violence of a nature which so exasperated the people that an organised band had at length been gathered to go in pursuit of the daring outlaw  but jake was somewhat napoleonic in his character swift in his movements and sudden in his attacks so that while his exasperated foes were searching for him in one direction news would be brought of his having committed some daring and bloody deed far off in some other quarter  his latest acts had been to kill and rob a postrunner who happened to be a great favourite in his locality and to attack and murder in mere wanton cruelty a family of friendly indians belonging to a tribe which had never given the whites any trouble  the fury of the people therefore was somewhat commensurate with the wickedness of the man  they resolved to capture him and as there was a number of resolute cowboys on the frontier to whom life seemed to be a bauble to be played with kept or cast lightly away according to circumstances it seemed as if the effort made at this time would be successful  the latest reports that seemed reliable were to the effect that after slaying the indians jake and his men had made off in the direction of his old stronghold at the head of traitors trap  hence the invasion by crux and his band  youll be glad to hearor sorry im not sure which said the scout that buck tom has paid his last debt  what defunct exclaimed crux  ay  whatever may have bin his true character an deeds hes gone to his account at last  are ye sure hunky  if ye dont believe me go in there an youll see whats left of him the corp aint cold yet  the rugged cowboy entered at once to convince himself by ocular demonstration  well said he on coming out of the cave i wish it had been the flint instead  hell give us some trouble you bet afore we bring him to lie as flat as buck tom  poor buck  they say he wasnt a bad chap in his way an i never heard of his bein cruel like his comrades his main fault was castin in his lot wi the flint  they say that jake has bin carousin around throwin the townfolk everywhere into fits  that night the avengers in search of jake the flint slept in and around the outlaws cave while the chief of the outlaws lay in the sleep of death in a shed outside  during the night the scout went out to see that the body was undisturbed and was startled to observe a creature of some sort moving near it  ben was troubled by no superstitious fears so he approached with the stealthy catlike tread which he had learned to perfection in his frontier life  soon he was near enough to perceive through the bushes that the form was that of shank leather silent and motionless seated by the side of buck tom with his face buried in his hands upon his knees  a deep sob broke from him as he sat and again he was silent and motionless  the scout withdrew as silently as he had approached leaving the poor youth to watch and mourn over the friend who had shared his hopes and fears sins and sorrows so longlong at least in experience if not in numbered years  next morning at daybreak they laid the outlaw in his last restingplace and then the avengers prepared to set off in pursuit of his comrades  youll join us i fancy said crux to charlie brooke  no i remain with my sick friend leather  but perhaps some of my comrades may wish to go with you  it was soon arranged that hunky ben and dick darvall should join the party  we wont be long o catchin him up said crux for the flint has become desperate of late an were pretty sure of a man when he gets into that fix  the desperado to whom crux referred was one of those terrible human monsters who may be termed a growth of american frontier life men who having apparently lost all fear of god or man or death carry their lives about with hilarious indifference ready to risk them at a moments notice on the slightest provocation and to take the lives of others without a shadow of compunction  as a natural consequence such maniacs for they are little else are feared by all and even brave men feel the necessity of being unusually careful while in their company  among the various wild deeds committed by jake and his men was one which led them into serious trouble and proved fatal to their chief  coming to a village or small town one night they resolved to have a regular spree and for this purpose encamped a short way outside the town till it should be quite dark  about midnight the outlaws to the number of eight entered the town each armed with a winchester and a brace of revolvers  scattering themselves they began a tremendous fusillade as fast as they could fire so that nearly the whole population supposing the place was attacked by indians turned out and fled to the mountains behind the town  the flint and his men made straight for the chief billiard room which they found deserted and there after helping themselves to all the loose cash available they began to drink  of course they soon became wild under the influence of the liquor but retained sense enough to mount their horses and gallop away before the people of the place mustered courage to return and attack the foe  it was while galloping madly away after this raid that the murderous event took place which ended in the dispersal of the gang  daylight was creeping over the land when the outlaws left the town jake was wild with excitement at what had occurred as well as with drink and began to boast and swear in a horrible manner  when they had ridden a good many miles one of the party said he saw some redskins in a clump of wood they were approaching  did ye cried jake flourishing his rifle over his head and uttering a terrible oath then ill shoot the first redskin i come across  better not jake said one of his men  theyre all friendly injins about here  whats the odds to me yelled the drunken wretch  ill shoot the first i see as i would a rabbit  at that moment they were passing a bluff covered with timber and unfortunately a poor old indian woman came out of the wood to look at the horsemen as they flew past  without an instants hesitation jake swerved aside rode straight up to the old creature and blew out her brains  accustomed as they were to deeds of violence and bloodshed his comrades were overwhelmed with horror at this and fearing the consequences of the dastardly murder rode for life away over the plains  but the deed had been witnessed by the relatives of the poor woman without sound or cry fifty red men leaped on their horses and swept with the speed of light along the other side of the bluff which concealed them from the white mens sight  thus they managed to head them and when jake and his gang came to the end of the strip of wood the red men armed with rifle and revolver were in front of them  there was something deadly and unusual in the silence of the indians on this occasion  concentrated rage seemed to have stopped their power to yell  swift as eagles they swooped down and surrounded the little band of white men who seeing that opposition would be useless and perhaps cowed by the sight of such a coldblooded act offered no resistance at all while their arms were taken from them  with lips white from passion the indian chief in command demanded who did the deed  the outlaws pointed to jake who sat on his horse with glaring eyes and halfopen mouth like one stupefied  at a word from the chief he was seized dragged off his horse and held fast by two powerful men while a third bound his arms  a spear was driven deep into the ground to serve as a stake and to this jake was tied  he made no resistance  he seemed to have been paralysed and remained quite passive while they stripped him naked to the waist  his comrades still seated on their horses seemed incapable of action  they had no doubt a presentiment of what was coming  the chief then drew his scalping knife and passed it swiftly round the neck of the doomed man so as to make a slight incision  grasping the flap raised at the back of the neck he tore a broad band of skin from jakes body right down his back to his waist  a fearful yell burst from the lips of the wretched man but no touch of pity moved the hearts of the red men whose chief prepared to tear off another strip of skin from the quivering flesh  at the same moment the companions of the flint wheeled their horses round and filled with horror fled at full speed from the scene  the red men did not attempt to hinder them  there was no feud at that time between the white men and that particular tribe  it was only the murderer of their old kinswoman on whom they were bent on wreaking their vengeance and with terrible cruelty was their diabolical deed accomplished  the comrades of the murderer left free to do as they pleased scattered as they fled as if each man were unable to endure the sight of the other and they never again drew together  on the very next day crux and his band of avengers were galloping over the same region making straight for the town which the outlaws had thrown into such consternation and where crux had been given to understand that trustworthy news of the flints movements would probably be obtained  the sun was setting and a flood of golden light was streaming over the plains when one of the band suggested that it would be better to encamp where they were than to proceed any further that night  so we will boy said crux looking about for a suitable spot until his eye fell on a distant object that riveted his attention  a strangelooking thing that remarked the scout who had observed the object at the same moment  somethin like a man but standin crookedlike in a fashion i never saw a man stand before though ive seen many a queer sight in my day  well soon clear up the mystery said crux putting spurs to his horse and riding straight for the object in question followed by the whole cavalcade  ay ay bloody work bin goin on here i see muttered the scout as they drew near  the accursed redskins growled crux  we need scarcely say that it was the dead body of jake they had thus discovered tied to the spear which was nearly broken by the weight of the mutilated carcass  besides tearing most of the skin off the wretched mans body the savages had scalped jake but a deep wound over the region of the heart showed that they had at all events ended his sufferings before they left him  while the avengerswhose vengeance was thus forestalledwere busy scraping a shallow grave for the remains of the outlaw a shout was raised by several of the party who dashed after something into a neighbouring copse  an indian had been discovered there and the cruelties which had been practised on the white man had to a great extent transferred their wrath from the outlaw to his murderers  but they found that the rush was needless for the indian who had been observed was seated on the ground beside what appeared to be a newly formed grave and he made no attempt to escape  he was a very old and feeble man yet something of the fire of the warrior gleamed from his sunken eyes as he stood up and tried to raise his bent form into an attitude of proud defiance  do you belong to the tribe that killed this white man said hunky ben whose knowledge of most of the indian dialects rendered him the fitting spokesman of the party  i do answered the indian in a stern yet quavering voice that seemed very pitiful for it was evident that the old man thought his last hour had come and that he had made up his mind to die as became a dauntless indian brave  at that moment a little indian girl who had hitherto lain quite concealed in the tangled grass started up like a rabbit from its lair and dashed into the thicket  swiftly though the child ran however one of the young men of the party was swifter  he sprang off in pursuit and in a few moments brought her back  your tribe is not at war with the palefaces continued the scout taking no notice of this episode  they have been needlessly cruel  for some moments the old man gazed sternly at his questioner as if he heard him not  then the frown darkened and pointing to the grave at his feet he said  the white man was more cruel  what had he done asked the scout  but the old man would not reply  there came over his withered features that stony stare of resolute contempt which he evidently intended to maintain to the last in spite of torture and death  better question the child suggested dick darvall who up to that moment had been too much horrified by what he had witnessed to be able to speak  the scout looked at the child  she stood trembling beside her captor with evidences of intense terror on her dusky countenance for she was only too well accustomed to the cruelties practised by white men and red on each other to have any hope either for the old man or herself  poor thing said hunky ben laying his strong hand tenderly on the girls head  then taking her hand he led her gently aside and spoke to her in her own tongue  there was something so unexpectedly soft in the scouts voice and so tender in his touch that the little brown maid was irresistibly comforted  when one falls into the grasp of goodness and strength relief of mind more or less is an inevitable result  david thought so when he said let me fall now into the hand of the lord  the indian child evidently thought so when she felt that hunky ben was strong and perceived that he was good  we will not hurt you my little one said the scout when he had reached a retired part of the copse and sitting down placed the child on his knee  the white man who was killed by your people was a very bad man  we were looking for him to kill him  was it the old man that killed him  no replied the child it was the chief  why was he so cruel in his killing asked the scout  because the white man was a coward  he feared to face our warriors but he shot an old woman answered the little maid and then inspired with confidence by the scouts kind and pitiful expression she related the whole story of the savage and wanton murder perpetrated by the flint the subsequent vengeance of her people and the unchecked flight and dispersion of jakes comrades  the old woman who had been slain she said was her grandmother and the old man who had been captured was her grandfather  friends our business has been done for us said the scout on rejoining his comrades so weve nothing to do but return home  he then told them in detail what the indian girl had related  of course he added weve no right to find fault wi the redskins for punishin the murderer arter their own fashion though we might wish they had bin somewhat more merciful  no we mightnt interrupted crux stoutly  the flint got off easy in my opinion  if i had had the doin ot id have roasted him alive  no you wouldnt crux returned ben with a benignant smile  young chaps like you are always accordin to your own showin worse than the devil himself when your bloods roused by indignation at cruelty or injustice but you sing a good deal softer when you come to the scratch with your enemy in your power  youre wrong hunky ben retorted crux firmly  any man as would blow the brains out of a poor old woman in cold blood as the flint did desarves the worst that can be done to him  i didnt say nowt about what he desarves returned the scout i was speakin about what you would do if youd got the killin of him  well well mates said dick darvall a little impatiently seems to me that were wastin our wind for the miserable wretch bein defunct is beyond the malice o red man or white  i therefore vote that we stop palaverin bout ship clap on all sail an lay our course for home  this suggestion met with general approval and the curious mixture of men and races which had thus for a brief period been banded together under the influence of a united purpose prepared to break up  i suppose you an darvall will make tracks for traitors trap said crux to hunky ben  thats my trail to be answered the scout  what say you black polly  are ye game for such a spin tonight  the mare arched her glossy neck put back both ears and gave other indications that she would have fully appreciated the remarks of her master if she had only understood them  ah  bluefire and i dont talk in that style said crux with a laugh i give him his orders an he knows that hes got to obey  he and i will make a beeline for davids store an have a drink  wholl keep me company  several of the more reckless among the men intimated their willingness to join the toper  the rest said they had other business on hand than to go carousin around  why crux said one who had been a very lively member of the party during the ride out dye know boy that its writ in the book o fate that you an i an all of us have just got so many beats o the pulse allowed usno more an no lessan were free to run the beats out fast or slow just as we like  theres nothin like drink for makin em go fast  i dont believe that robin stout returned crux an even if i did believe it id go on just the same for i prefer a short life and a merry one to a long life an a wishywashy miserable one  hear hear exclaimed several of the topers  dont ye think crux interposed darvall that a long life an a happy one might be better than either  hear hear remarked hunky ben with a quiet laugh  well boys said one fine brightlooking young fellow patting the neck of his pony whether my life is to be long or short merry wishywashy or happy i shall be off cowpunching for the next six months or so somewhere about the african bend on the colorado river in south texas an i mean to try an keep my pulse agoin without drink  ive seen more than enough o the curse that comes to us all on account of it and i wont be caught in that trap again  then youve bin caught in it once already jo pinto said a comrade  ay i just have but you bet its the last time  i dont see the fun of makin my veins a channel for firewater and then finishin off with dt if bullet or knife should leave me to go that length  i suppose pinto said crux with a smile of contempt that youve bin to hear that mad fellow gough whos bin howlin around in these parts of late  thats so retorted pinto flushing with sudden anger  ive been to hear jb gough an whats more i mean to take his advice in spite of all the flapjack soakers tween the atlantic and the rockies  hes a true man is gough every inch of him and men and women thats bin used chiefly to cursin in time past have heaped more blessins on that mans head than would sink you cruxif put by mistake on your headright through the lowest end o the bottomless pit  pretty deep that anyhow exclaimed crux with a careless laugh for he had no mind to quarrel with the stout young cowboy whose black eyes he had made to flash so keenly  it seems to me said another of the band as he hung the coils of his lasso round the horn of his mexican saddle that we must quit talkin unless we make up our minds to stop here till sunup  whos goin north  my old boss is financially busted so ive hired to pt granger who has started a new ranch at the head o pugits creek  he wants one or two good hands i know an ive reason to believe hes an honest man  i go up trail at thirty dollars per month  the outfits to consist of thirty hundred head of texas steers a chuck wagon and cook with thirty riders includin the boss himself an six horses to the man  a couple of stoutlooking cowboys offered to join the last speaker on the strength of his representations and then as the night bid fair to be bright and calm the whole band scattered and galloped away in separate groups over the moonlit plains    chapter twenty nine  they return to the ranch of roaring bull where something serious happens to dick darvall  when dick darvall and hunky ben returned from the expedition which we have just described they found all right at the cave except that a letter to leather had been sent up from bulls ranch which had caused him much grief and anxiety  i have been eagerly awaiting your return ben said charlie brooke when he and the scout went outside the cave to talk the matter over for the news in this letter has thrown poor leather back considerably and as he will continue to fret about it and get worse something must be done  he paused for a few moments and the scout gravely waited for him to resume  the fact is continued charlie that poor leathers father has been given far too much to the bottle during a great part of his life and the letter just received tells us that he has suddenly left home and gone no one knows where  now my friend leather and his father were always very fond of each other and the son cannot forgive himself for having at various times rather encouraged his father in drinking so that his conscience is reproaching him terribly as you may well believe and he insists on it that he is now quite able to undertake the voyage home  you and i know ben that in his present state it would be madness for him to attempt it yet to lie and fret here would be almost as bad  now what is your advice  for some moments the scout stood silent with his eyes on the ground and his right hand grasping his chinhis usual attitude when engaged in meditation  is there enough o dollars he asked to let you do as ye like  no lack of dollars i dare say when needed replied charlie  then my advice returned the scout promptly is to take leather straight off tomorrow mornin to bulls ranch make him comfortable there call him mister shankso as nobodyll think hes been the man called leather whos bin so long ill along wi poor buck toms gang and then you go off to old england to follow his fathers trail till you find him  leather has great belief in you sir and the feelin that you are away doin your best for him will do more to relieve his mind and strengthen his body than tons o doctors stuff  dick darvall could remain to take care of him if he has no objection  i rather think he would be well pleased to do so replied charlie with a laugh of significance which the scout quietly subjected to analysis in what he styled his brainpan and made a note of the result in his mental memorandum book  but i doubt if leather  shank interrupted the scout  call him shank from now sos we may all git used to it tho praps it aint o much importance for most o the men that saw him here saw him in uncommon bad condition an would hardly know him again besides they wont likely be at bulls ranch an the captain an troops that were here have been ordered down south still one can never be too careful when life and death may be i the balance  your friend niver was one o the outlaws but it mightnt be easy to prove that  well then resumed our hero i was going to say that i fear shank wont be able to stand the journey even to the ranch  no fear of that sir  well carry him down to the foot o the trap an when we git out on the plain mount him on one o the horses left by poor buckthe one that goes along so quiet that theyve given it the name o the wheelbarrow  should i speak to him tonight about our plan ben  no  if i was you id only say were goin to take him down to bulls ranch i the mornin  thatll take his mind a bit off the letter an then itll give him an extra lift when you tell him the rest o the plan  in accordance with this arrangement on the following morning a litter was made with two stout poles and a blanket between  on this the invalid was laid after an early breakfast another blanket was spread over him and the scout and dick taking it up between them carried him out of traitors trap while charlie brooke riding jacksons horse led the wheelbarrow by the bridle  as for black polly she was left to follow at her own convenience a whistle from hunky ben being at any moment sufficient to bring her promptly to her masters side  on reaching the plain the litter was laid aside the blankets were fastened to the horses and shank prepared as dick said to board wheelbarrow  now then shank said the seaman while helping his friend dont be in a hurry  nothin was ever done well in a hurry either afloat or ashore  git your futt well into the stirrup an dont take too much of a spring else youll be apt to go right over on the starboard side hup you go  the worthy sailor lent such willing aid that there is little doubt he would have precipitated the catastrophe against which he warned had not hunky ben placed himself on the starboard side of the steed and counteracted the heave  after that all went well the amble of the wheelbarrow fully justified the title and in due course the party arrived at the ranch of roaring bull where the poor invalid was confined to his room for a considerable time thereafter and became known at the ranch as mr shank  one evening charlie brooke entered the kitchen of the ranch in search of his friend dick darvall who had a strange fondness for buttercup and frequently held converse with her in the regions of the backkitchen  i dun know whar he is massa book answered the sable beauty when appealed to hes mostly somewhar around when hes not nowhar else  i shouldnt wonder if he was returned charlie with a hopeful smile i suppose miss marys not around anywhere is she  i shouldnt wonder if she wasnt but she aint here massa said the black maid earnestly  you are a truthful girl butterstick to that and youll get on in life  with this piece of advice charlie left the kitchen abruptly and thereby missed the eruption of teeth and gums that immediately followed his remark  making his way to the chamber of his sick friend charlie sat down at the open window beside him  how dyou feel this evening my boy he asked  a little better butoh dear mei begin to despair of getting well enough to go home and its impossible to avoid being worried for unless father is sought for and found soon he will probably sink altogether  you have no idea charlie what a fearful temptation drink becomes to those who have once given way to it and passed a certain point  i dont know it personallythough i take no credit for thatbut i have some idea of it i think from what i have seen and heard  but i came to relieve your mind on the subject shank  i wanted to speak with dick darvall first to see if he would fall in with my plan but as i cant find him just now i thought it best to come straight to you about it  hallo  there is dick  where said shank bending forward so as to see the place on which his friends eyes were fixed  there dont you see  look across that bit of green sward about fifty yards into the bush close to that lopped pine where a thick shrub overhangs a fallen tree  i seei see exclaimed shank a gleeful expression banishing for a time the look of suffering and anxiety that had become habitual to him why the fellow is seated beside mary jackson  ay and holding a very earnest conversation with her to judge from his attitude said charlie  probably inquiring into the marketprice of steersor some absorbing topic of that sort  hes grasping her hand now exclaimed shank with an expanding mouth  and she lets him hold it  really this becomes interesting observed charlie with gravity  but my friend is not this a species of eavesdropping  are we not taking mean advantage of a pair who fondly think themselves alone  come shank let us turn our backs on the view and try to fix our minds on matters of personal interest  but the young men had not to subject themselves to such a delicate test of friendship for before they could make any attempt to carry out the suggestion dick and mary were seen to rise abruptly and hasten from the spot in different directions  a few minutes later buttercup was observed to glide upon the scene and sit down upon the selfsame fallen tree  the distance from the bedroom window was too great to permit of sounds reaching the observers ears or of facial contortions meeting their eyes very distinctly but there could be no doubt as to the feelings of the damsel or the meaning of those swayings to and fro of her body the throwing back of her head and the pressing of her hands on her sides  suddenly she held out a black hand as if inviting some one in the bush to draw near  the invitation was promptly accepted by a large brown doga wellknown favourite in the ranch household  roverfor such was his nameleaped on the fallen tree and sat down on the spot which had previously been occupied by the fair mary  the position was evidently suggestive for buttercup immediately began to gesticulate and clasp her hands as if talking very earnestly to the dog  i verily believe said shank that the blackingball is reenacting the scene with rover  see she grasps his paw and  my friend said charlie we are taking mean advantage again  and behold like the other pair they are flitting from the scene though not quite in the same fashion  this was true for buttercup reflecting probably that she might be missed in the kitchen had suddenly tumbled rover off the tree and darted swiftly from the spot  come now shank said charlie resuming the thread of discourse which had been interrupted it is quite plain to dick and to myself that you are unfit to travel home in your present state of health so i have made up my mind to leave you here in the care of honest jackson and darvall and to go home myself to make inquiries and search for your father will this make your mind easy  for that is essential to your recovery at the present time  you were always kind and selfsacrificing charlie  assuredly your going will take an enormous weight off my mind for you are much better fitted by nature for such a search than i amto say nothing of health thank you my dear old boy a thousand times  as for dick darvall added shank with a laugh before this evening i would have doubted whether he would be willing to remain with me after your departure but i have no doubt nowconsidering what we have just witnessed  yes he has found metal more attractive said charlie rising  i will now go and consult with him after which i will depart without delay  youve been having a gallop to judge from your heightened colour and flashing eyes said charlie to dick when they met in the yard halfanhour later  nnonot exactly returned the seaman with a slightly embarrassed air  the fact is ive bin cruisin about in the bush  what lookin for redskins  nno not exactly but  oh  i see  out huntin i suppose  after deereh  well now that was a pretty fair guess charlie said dick laughing to tell ye the plain truth i have been out arter a dearfull sail an  and you bagged it of course  fairly run it down i suppose said his friend again interrupting  well there aint no of course about it but as it happened i did manage to overhaul her and coming to close quarters i  yes yes i know interrupted charlie a third time with provoking coolness  you ran her on to the rocks dickwhich was unseamanlike in the extremeat least you ran the dear aground on a fallen tree and sitting down beside it asked it to become mrs darvall and the amiable creature agreed eh  why how on earth did ee come for to know that asked dick in blazing astonishment  well you know theres no great mystery about it  if a bold sailor will go huntin close to the house and run down his game right in front of mr shanks windows he must expect to have witnesses however give me your flipper messmate and let me congratulate you for in my opinion theres not such another dear on all the slopes of the rocky mountains  but now that ive found you i want to lay some of my future plans before you  they had not been discussing these plans many minutes when mary was seen crossing the yard in company with hunky ben  if hunky would only stop wed keep quite jolly till you return observed dick in an undertone as the two approached  we were just talking of you ben observed charlie as they came up  are you goin for a cruise miss mary asked the seaman in a manner that drew the scouts attention  no replied mary with a little laugh and anything but a little blush that intensified the attention of the scout  he gave one of his quiet but quick glances at dick and chuckled softly  so soon he murmured to himself sartinly your seadog is pretty slick at such matters  dick thought he heard the chuckle and turned a lightning glance on the scout but that sturdy son of the forest had his leathern countenance turned towards the sky with profoundest gravity  it was characteristic of him you see to note the signs of the weather  mr brooke he said with the slow deliberate air of the man who forms his opinions on solid grounds theres goin to be a bust up o the elements afore long as sure as my names hunky  thats the very thing i want to talk about with you ben for i meditate a long journey immediately  come walk with me  taking the scouts arm he paced with him slowly up and down the yard while dick and mary went off on a cruise elsewhere    chapter thirty  changes the scene somewhat violently and shows our hero in a new light  the result of our heros consultation with the scout was not quite as satisfactory as it might have been  charlie had hoped that hunky ben would have been able to stay with shank till he should return from the old country but found to his regret that that worthy was engaged to conduct still further into the great western wilderness a party of emigrants who wished to escape the evils of civilisation and to set up a community of their own which should be founded on righteousness justice and temperance  you see sir said the scout ive gin them my promise to guide them whenever theyre ready to start so as they may git ready and call for my services at any moment i must hold myself free o other engagements to say truth even if they hadnt my promise id keep myself free to help em for ive a likin for the good manhalf doctor half parson as well as jackofalltradesas has set the thing agoinmoreover ive a strong belief that all this fightin an scalpin an flayin alive an roastin an revenge aint the way to bring about good ends either among red men or white  i agree with you heartily ben though i dont very well see how we are to alter it  however we must leave the discussion of that difficulty to another time  the question at present is what hope is there of your staying here even for a short time after i leave for in dick darvalls present condition of mind he is not much to be depended on and jackson is too busy  you see i want shank to go out on horseback as much as possible but in this unsettled region and time he would not be safe except in the care of some one who knew the country and its habits and who had some sort of sympathy with a brokendown man  all i can say mr brooke is that ill stay wi your friend as long as i can returned the scout an when im obleeged to make tracks for the west ill try to git another man to take my place  anyhow i think that mr reevesthats the name o the good man as wants me an is boss o the emigrantswont be able to git them all ready to start for some weeks yet  charlie was obliged to content himself with this arrangement  next day he was galloping eastwardconvoyed part of the way by the scout on black polly and dick darvall on wheelbarrow  soon he got into the region of railways and steamboats and in a few weeks more was once again in old england  a postcard announced his arrival for charlie had learned wisdom from experience and feared to take any one by surpriseespecially his mother  we need not describe this second meeting of our hero with his kindred and friends  in many respects it resembled the former when the bad news about shank came and there was the same conclave in mrs leathers parlour for old jacob crossley happened to be spending a holiday in sealford at the time  indeed he had latterly taken to spending much of his leisure time at that celebrated wateringplace owing it was supposed to the beneficial effect which the seaair had on his rheumatism  but may leather knew better  with that discriminating penetration which would seem to be the natural accompaniment of youth and beauty she discerned that the old gentlemans motive for going so frequently to sealford was a compound motive  first mr crossley was getting tired of old bachelorhood and had at last begun to enjoy ladies society especially that of such ladies as mrs leather and mrs brooke to say nothing of may herself and miss molloythe worsted reservoirwho had come to reside permanently in the town and who had got the blackguard boy into blue tights and buttons to the amazement and confusion of the little dog scraggy whose mind was weakened in consequenceso they said  second mr crossley was remarkably fond of captain stride whom he abused like a pickpocket and stuck to like a brother besides playing backgammon with him nightly to the great satisfaction of the captains missus and their little mag third mr crossley had no occasion to attend to business because business somehow attended to itself and poured its profits perennially into the old gentlemans pocketa pocket which was never full because it had a charitable hole in it somewhere which let the cash run out as fast as it ran in  fourth and last but not least mr crossley found considerable relief in getting away occasionally from his worthy housekeeper mrs bland  this relief which he styled letting off the steam at one time brushing away the cobwebs at another was invariably followed by a fit of amiability which resulted in a penitent spirit and ultimately took him back to town where he remained till mrs bland had again piled enough of eccentricity on the safety valve to render another letting off of steam on the seashore imperative  what charlie learned at the meeting held in reference to the disappearance of old mr isaac leather was not satisfactory  the wretched man had so muddled his brain by constant tippling that it had become a question at last whether he was quite responsible for his actions  in a fit of remorse after an attack of delirium tremens he had suddenly condemned himself as being a mean contemptible burden on his poor wife and daughter  of course both wife and daughter asserted that his mere maintenance was no burden on them at allas in truth it was not when compared with the intolerable weight of his intemperance and they did their best to soothe him  but the idea seemed to have taken firm hold of him and preyed upon his mind until at last he left home one morning in a fit of despair and had not since been heard of  have you no idea then where he has gone asked charlie  no none said mrs leather with a tear trembling in her eye  we know mother said may that he has gone to london  the booking clerk at the station you know told us that  did the clerk say to what part of london he booked  no he could not remember  besides if he had remembered that would be but a slight clue said mr crossley  as well look for a needle in a bundle of hay as for a man in london  as well go to sea without rudder or compass observed captain stride  nevertheless said charlie rising i will make the attempt  hopeless said crossley  sheer madness added stride  mrs leather shook her head and wept gently  mrs brooke sighed and cast down her eyes  miss molloywho was of the council being by that time cognisant of all the family secretsclasped her hands and looked miserable  of all that conclave the only one who did not throw cold water on our hero was pretty little browneyed may  she cast on him a look of trusting gratitude which blew a long smouldering spark into such a flame that the waters of niagara in winter would have failed to quench it  i cant tell you yet friends what i intend to do said charlie all i can say is that im off to london  i shall probably be away some time but will write to mother occasionally  so goodbye  he said a good deal more of course but that was the gist of it  may accompanied him to the door  oh thank youthank you she said with trembling lip and tearful eyes as she held out her hand i feel sure that you will find father  i think i shall may  indeed i also feel sure that i shallgod helping me  at the ticket office he found that the clerk remembered very little  he knew the old gentleman well by sight indeed but was in the habit of selling tickets to so many people that it was impossible for him to remember where they booked to  in fact the only thing that had fixed mr leather at all in his memory was the fact that the old man had dropped his ticket had no money to take another and had pleaded earnestly to let him have one on trust a request with which he dared not complybut fortunately a porter found and restored the ticket  is the porter you refer to still here asked charlie  yes he was there and charlie soon found him  the porter recollected the incident perfectly for the old gentleman he said had made a considerable fuss about the lost ticket  and you cant remember the station he went to  no sir but i do remember something about his saying he wanted to go to whitechapeli think it wasor whitehall i forget which but im sure it was white something  with this very slender clue charlie brooke presented himself in due time at scotland yard at which fountainhead of london policedom he gave a graphic account of the missing man and the circumstances attending his disappearance  thence he went to the headquarters of the london city mission introduced himself to a sympathetic secretary there and was soon put in communication with one of the most intelligent of those valuable selfsacrificing and devoted men who may be styled the salt of the london slums  this good mans district embraced part of whitechapel  i will help you to the extent of my power mr brooke he said but your quest will be a difficult one perhaps dangerous  how do you propose to go about it  by visiting all the low lodginghouses in whitechapel first said charlie  that will take a long time said the city missionary smiling  low lodginghouses are somewhat numerous in these parts  i am aware of that mr stansfield and mean to take time returned our hero promptly  and what i want of you is to take me into one or two of them so that i may see something of them while under your guidance  after that i will get their streets and numbers from you or through you and will then visit them by myself  but excuse me my friend returned the missionary your appearance in such places will attract more attention than you might wish and would interfere with your investigations besides exposing you to danger for the very worst characters in london are sometimes to be found in such places  only men of the police force and we city missionaries can go among them with impunity  i have counted the cost mr stansfield and intend to run the risk but thank you all the same for your wellmeant warning  can you go round one or two this afternoon  i can with pleasure and will provide you with as many lodginghouse addresses as i can procure  do you live far from this  no quite close  a gentleman who was in your secretarys office when i called recommended a small lodginghouse kept by a mrs butt in the neighbourhood of flower and dean street  you know that region well i suppose  ayintimately and i know mrs butt tooa very respectable woman come then let us start on our mission  accordingly mr stansfield introduced his inexperienced friend into two of the principal lodginghouses in that neighbourhood  they merely passed through them and the missionary besides commenting on all that they saw told his new friend where and what to pay for a nights lodging  he also explained the few rules that were connected with those sinks into which the dregs of the metropolitan human family ultimately settle  then he accompanied charlie to the door of his new lodging and bade him goodnight  it was a dingy little room in which our hero found himself having an empty and rusty firegrate on one side and a window on the other from which there was visible a landscape of paved court  the foreground of the landscape was a pump the middle distance a washtub and the background a brick wall about ten feet distant and fifteen feet high there was no sky to the landscape by reason of the next house  the furniture was in keeping with the view  observing a small sofa of the last century on its last legs in a corner charlie sat down on it and rose again instantly owing apparently to rheumatic complaints from its legs  la sir said the landlady who had followed him into the room you dont need to fear anythink  that sofar sir as bin in my family for three generations  the frame was renood before i was born an the legs i ad taken off an noo ones putt on about fifteen year ago last easter as ever was  my last lodger ee went through the bottom of it wich obliged me to ave that renood so its stronger than ever it were  if you only keep it well shoved up agin the wall sir itll stand amost any weightonly it wont stand jumpin on  you mustnt jump on it sir with your feet  charlie promised solemnly that he would not jump on it either with his feet or head and then asked if he could have tea and a fire  on being informed that he could have both he drew out his purse and said  now mrs butt i expect to stay here for two or three weeksperhaps longer  my name is brooke  i was advised to come here by a gentleman in the offices of the city mission  i shall have no visitorsbeing utterly unknown in this neighbourhoodexcept perhaps the missionary who parted from me at the door  mr stansfield sir said the landlady  yes  you know him  ive knowed im for years sir  i shall only be too pleased to ave any friend of is in my ouse i assure you  thats well  now mrs butt my motive in coming here is to discover a runaway relation  la sira little boy  no mrs butt a  surely not a little gurl sir said the landlady with a sympathetic expression  it is of no consequence what or who the runaway relation is mrs butt i merely mention the fact in order that you may understand the reason of any little eccentricity you may notice in my conduct and not perplex your mind about it  for instance i shall have no regular hoursmay be out late or earlyit may be even all night  you will give me a passkey and i will let myself in  the only thing i will probably ask for will be a cup of tea or coffee  pray let me have one about an hour hence  im going out at present  here is a weeks rent in advance  shall i put on a fire sir asked mrs butt  well yesyou may  toast sir  yes yes said charlie opening the outer door  ot or cold sir  ot and buttered cried charlie with a laugh as he shut the door after him and rendered further communication impossible  wending his way through the poor streets in the midst of which his lodging was situated our hero at last found an oldclothes store which he entered  i want a suit of old clothes he said to the owner a jew who came forward  the jew smiled spread out his hands after the manner of a frenchman and said my shop sir is at your disposal  after careful inspection charlie selected a fustian coat of extremely ragged appearance with trousers to match also a sealskin vest of a mangy complexion likewise a soiled and battered billycock hat so shockingly bad that it was difficult to imagine it to have ever had better days at all  are they clean he asked  bin baked and fumigated sir answered the jew solemnly  as the look and smell of the garments gave some countenance to the truth of this statement charlie paid the price demanded had them wrapped up in a green cotton handkerchief and carried them off  arrived at his lodging he let himself in entered his room and threw the bundle in a corner  then he rang for tea  it was growing dark by that time but a yellowcotton blind shut out the prospect and a cheery fire in the grate lighted up the little room brightly casting a rich glow on the yellowwhite tablecloth which had been already spread and creating a feeling of coziness in powerful contrast to the sensation of dreariness which had assailed him on his first entrance  when mrs butt had placed a paraffin lamp on the table with a darkbrown teapot a thick glass sugarbowl a creamjug to match and a plate of thickbuttered toast that scented the atmosphere deliciously our hero thoughtnot for the first time in his lifethat wealth was a delusion besides being a snare  one wants but little here below he mused as he glanced round the apartment but he wants it longer than that thought he as his eyes wandered to the ancient sofa which was obviously eighteen inches too short for him  i ope youve found im sir said mrs butt anxiously as she was about to retire  found who  your relation sir the little boyi mean gurl  no i have found neither the boy nor the girl returned the lodger sharply  havent even begun to look for them yet  oh beg parding sir i didnt know there was two of em  neither are there  theres only one  fetch me some hot water mrs butt your tea is too good  i never take it strong  the landlady retired and on returning with the water found her lodger so deep in a newspaper that she did not venture to interrupt him  tea over charlie locked his door and clothed himself in his late purchase which fitted him fairly well considering that he had measured it only by eye  putting on the billycock and tying the green cotton kerchief loosely round his neck to hide his shirt he stepped in front of the lookingglass above the mantelpiece  at sight of himself he was prepared to be amused but he had not expected to be shocked  yet shocked he certainly was for the transformation was so complete that it suddenly revealed to him something of the depth of degradation to which he might fallto which many a man as good as himself if not better had fallen  then amusement rose within him for he was the very beauideal of a typical burglar or a prizefighter big squareshouldered deepchested largechinned  the only parts that did not quite correspond to the type were his straight wellformed nose and his clear blue eyes but these defects were put right by slightly drooping his eyelids pushing his billycock a little back on his head and drawing a lock of hair in a drunken fashion over his forehead  suddenly an idea occurred to him  slipping his latchkey into his pocket he went out of the house and closed the door softly  then he rang the bell  is the genleman at ome he asked of mrs butt in a gruff hoarse voice as if still engaged in a struggle with a bad cold  what gentleman asked mrs butt eyeing him suspiciously  wy the genleman as sent for me to give im boxin lessonsbuck or book or some sitch name  brooke you mean said mrs butt still suspicious and interposing her solid person in the doorway  ay thats the covethe genleman i mean came here this arternoon to lodge wi a missis butt or brute or suthin o that sortair you mrs brute  certainly not answered the landlady with indignation but im mrs butt  well its all the same  i ax yer parding for the mistake but theres sitch a mixin up o brutes an brookes an butts an bucks that it comes hard o a man o no edication to speak of to take it all in  this genleman mr brute e said if e was hout wen i called i was to wait an say you was to make tea for two an ave it laid in the bedroom as ed require the parlour for the mill  the mans evident knowledge of her lodgers affairs and his gross stupidity disarmed mrs butt  she would have laughed at his last speech if it had not been for the astounding conclusion  tea in the bedroom and a mill in the parlour the first night was a degree of eccentricity she had not even conceived of  come in then young man she said making way  youll find mr brooke in the parlour at his tea  the prizefighter stepped quickly along the dark passage into the parlour and while the somewhat sluggish mrs butt was closing the door she overheard her lodger exclaim  ha  jem mace this is good of youvery good of youto come so promptly  mrs butt shouting at the parlour door another cup and plate for mr mace andand bring the ham  the am repeated mrs butt softly to herself as she gazed in perplexity round her little kitchen did e order a am  unable to solve the riddle she gave it up and carried in the cup and saucer and plate  i beg your parding sir you mentioned a am she began but stopped abruptly on seeing no one there but the prizefighter standing before the fire in a freeandeasy manner with his hands in his breeches pockets  the light of the streetlamps had very imperfectly revealed the person of jem mace  now that mrs butt saw him slouching in all his native hideousness against her mantelpiece in the full blaze of a paraffin lamp she inwardly congratulated herself that mr brooke was such a big strong manalmost a match she thought for mace  i thought you said the genleman was in the parlour mrs brute said mace inquiringly  so ewas answered the perplexed lady looking round the room didnt i ear im ashakin ands wi you an ashoutin for am  well mrs brute i dun know what you eard all i know is that ive not seed im yet  e must be in the bedroom said mrs butt with a dazed look  no e aint there returned the prizefighter ive bin all over it looked under the bed into the cupboard through the keyolepraps he added turning quickly e may be up the chimbly  the expression on poor mrs butts face now alarmed charlie who instantly doffed his billycock and resumed his natural voice and manner  forgive me mrs butt if i have been somewhat reckless he said in testing my disguise on you  i really had no intention till a few minutes ago of playing such a practical  well well mr brooke broke in the amazed yet amiable creature at this point i do assure you as id never ave knowd you from the worst character in witechapel  i wouldnt have trusted younot with a sixpence  you was born to be a playactor sir  i declare that jem mace have given me a turn thatbut why disguise yourself in this way mr brooke  because i am going to haunt the low lodginghouses mrs butt and i could not well do that you know in the character of a gentleman and as you have taken it so amiably im glad i tried my hand here first for it will make me feel much more at ease  and well it may sir  i only ope it wont get you into trouble for if the pleece go lookin for a burglar or murderer or desprit ruffian where you appen to be theyre sure to run you in  the only think i would point out sir if i may be so free is that your ands an face is too clean  that is easily remedied said charlie with a laugh as he stooped and rubbed his hands among the ashes then taking a piece of cinder he made sundry marks on his countenance therewith which when judiciously touched in with a little water and some ashes converted our hero into as thorough a scoundrel as ever walked the streets of london at unseasonable hours of night    chapter thirty one  failure and a new scent  although our heros plan of search may seem to some rather quixotic there was nothing further from his thoughts than merely playing at the game of amateur detective  being enthusiastic and sanguine besides being spurred on by an intense desire to rescue the father of may leather charlie brooke was thoroughly in earnest in his plan  he knew that it would be useless to attempt such a search and rescue in any other capacity than that of a genuine pauper at least in appearance and action  he therefore resolved to conduct the search in character and to plunge at once into the deepest pools of the slums  it is not our intention to carry the reader through the arabiannightlike adventures which he experienced in his quest suffice it to say that he did not find the lost man in the pools in which he fished for him but he ultimately after many weeks found one who led him to the goal he aimed at  meanwhile there were revealed to him numerous phases of lifeor rather of living deathin the slums of the great city which caused him many a heartache at the time and led him ever afterwards to consider with anxious pity the condition of the poor the socalled lost and lapsed the depraved degraded and unfortunate  of course he foundas so many had found before himthat the demon drink was at the bottom of most of the misery he witnessed but he also learned that whereas many weak and vicious natures dated the commencement of their final descent and fall from the time when they began to drink many of the strong and ferocious spirits had begun a life of wickedness in early youth and only added drink in after years as a little additional fuel to the already roaring flame of sin  it is well known that men of all stamps and creeds and classes are to be found in the low lodginghouses of all great cities  at first charlie did not take note of this being too earnestly engaged in the search for his friend and anxious to avoid drawing attention on himself but as he grew familiar with these scenes of misery and destitution he gradually began to be interested in the affairs of other people and as he was eminently sympathetic he became the confidant of several paupers young and old  a few tried to draw him out but he quietly checked their curiosity without giving offence  it may be remarked here that he at once dropped the style of talk which he had adopted when representing jem mace because he found so many in the lodginghouses who had fallen from a good position in society that grammatical language was by no means singular  his size and strength also saved him from much annoyance for the roughs who might otherwise have bullied him felt that it would be wise to leave him alone  on one occasion however his pacific principles were severely tested as well as his manhood and as this led to important results we must recount the incident  there was a little lame elderly man who was a habitual visitor at one of the houses which our hero frequented  he was a humorous character who made light of his troubles and was a general favourite  charlie had felt interested in the man and in ordinary circumstances would have inquired into his history but as we have said he laid some restraint on his natural tendency to inquire and sympathise  as it was however he showed his goodwill by many little acts of kindnesssuch as making way for zookso he was calledwhen he wanted to get to the general fire to boil his tea or coffee giving him a portion of his own food on the half pretence that he had eaten as much as he wanted etcetera  there was another habitue of the same lodging named stoker whose temperament was the very opposite to that of little zook  he was a huge burly dock labourer an exprizefighter and a disturber of the peace wherever he went  between stoker and zook there was nothing in common save their poverty and the former had taken a strong dislike to the latter presumably on the ground of zooks superiority in everything except bulk of frame  charlie had come into slight collision with stoker on zooks account more than once and had tried to make peace between them but stoker was essentially a bully he would listen to no advice and had more than once told the wouldbe peacemaker to mind his own business  one evening towards the close of our heros search among the lodginghouses little zook entered the kitchen of the establishment teapot and penny loaf in hand  he hastened towards the roaring fire that might have roasted a whole sheep and which served to warm the entire basement storey or kitchen of the tenement  here zook said charlie as the former passed the table at which he was seated taking his supper ive bought more than i can eat as usual  ive got two redherrings and can eat only one  will you help me  its all fish that comes to my net charlie said the little man skipping towards his friend and accepting the herring with a grateful but exaggerated bow  we omitted to say that our hero passed among the paupers by his christian name which he had given as being from its very universality the best possible alias  a few minutes later stoker entered and went to the fire where loud angry voices soon told that the bully was at his old game of peacedisturber  presently a cry of shame was heard and poor zook was seen lying on the floor with his nose bleeding  who cried shame demanded the bully looking fiercely round  i did not said charlie brooke striding towards him for i did not know it was you who knocked him down but i do cry shame on you now for striking a man so much smaller than yourself and without provocation i warrant  an pray who are you returned stoker in a tone that was meant to be witheringly sarcastic  i am one who likes fair play said charlie restraining his anger for he was still anxious to throw oil on the troubled waters and if you call it fair play for a heavyweight like you to attack such a lightweight as zook you must have forgotten somehow that you are an englishman  come now stoker say to zook you are sorry and wont worry him any more and im sure hell forgive you  hear hear cried several of the onlookers  perhaps i may forgive im said zook with a humorous leer as he wiped his bleeding noseid do amost anything to please charlie  this was received with a general laugh but stoker did not laugh he turned on our hero with a look of mingled pity and contempt  no mister charlie he said i wont say im sorry because id tell a big lie if i did and ill worry him just as much as i please  but ill tell e what ill do  if you show yourself as ready wi your bunches o fives as you are wi yer tongue and agree to fight me ill say to zook that im sorry and wont worry im any more  there was dead silence for a minute after the delivery of this challenge and much curiosity was exhibited as to how it would be taken charlie cast down his eyes in perplexity  like many big and strong men he was averse to use his superior physical powers in fighting  besides this he had been trained by his mother to regard it as more noble to suffer than to avenge insults and there is no doubt that if the bullys insult had affected only himself he would have avoided him if possible rather than come into conflict  having been trained also to let scripture furnish him with rules for action his mind irresistibly recalled the turning of the other cheek to the smiter but the fact that he was at that moment acting in defence of another not of himself prevented that from relieving him  suddenlylike the lightning flash there arose to him the words smite a scorner and the simple will beware  indeed all that we have mentioned and much more passed through his troubled brain with the speed of light  lifting his eyes calmly to the face of his opponent he saidi accept your challenge  no no charlie cried the alarmed zook in a remonstrative tone youll do nothing of the sort  the mans a old prizefighter  you havent a chance  why ill fight him myself rather than let you do it  and with that the little man began to square up and twirl his fists and skip about in front of the bully in spite of his lamenessbut took good care to keep well out of his reach  its a bargain then said charlie holding out his hand  done answered the bully grasping it  well then the sooner we settle this business the better continued charlie  where shall it come off  prizefightins agin the law suggested an old pauper who seemed to fear they were about to set to in the kitchen  so it is old man said charlie and i would be the last to engage in such a thing but this is not a prizefight for theres no prize  its simply a fight in defence of weakness against brute strength and tyranny  there were only a few of the usual inhabitants of the kitchen present at the time for it was yet early in the evening  this was lucky as it permitted of the fight being gone about quietly  in the upper part of the building there was an empty room of considerable size which had been used as a furniture store and happened at that time to have been cleared out with the view of adding it to the lodging  there it was arranged the event should come off and to this apartment proceeded all the inhabitants of the kitchen who were interested in the matter  a good many however remained behindsome because they did not like fights some because they did not believe that the parties were in earnest others because they were too much taken up with and oppressed by their own sorrows and a few because being what is called fuddled they did not understand or care anything about the matter at all  thus it came to pass that all the proceedings were quiet and orderly and there was no fear of interruption by the police  arrived at the scene of action a ring was formed by the spectators standing round the walls which they did in a single row for there was plenty of room  then stoker strode into the middle of the room pulled off his coat vest and shirt which he flung into a corner and stood up stripped to the waist like a genuine performer in the ring charlie also threw off coat and vest but retained his shirtan old striped cotton one in harmony with his other garments  im not a professional he said as he stepped forward youve no objection i suppose to my keeping on my shirt  none whatever replied stoker with a patronising air praps it may be as well for fear you should kitch cold  charlie smiled and held out his handyou see he said that at least i understand the civilities of the ring  there was an approving laugh at this as the champions shook hands and stood on guard  i am quite willing even yet said charlie while in this attitude to settle this matter without fighting if youll only agree to leave zook alone in future  this was a clear showing of the white feather in the opinion of stoker who replied with a thundering no and at the same moment made a savage blow at charlies face  our hero was prepared for it  he put his head quickly to one side let the blow pass and with his left hand lightly tapped the bridge of his opponents nose  hah a hammytoor exclaimed the expugilist in some surprise  charlie said nothing but replied with the grim smile with which in schooldays he had been wont to indicate that he meant mischief  the smile passed quickly however for even at that moment he would gladly have hailed a truce so deeply did he feel what he conceived to be the degradation of his positiona feeling which neither his disreputable appearance nor his miserable associates had yet been able to produce  but nothing was further from the intention of stoker than a truce savages usually attribute forbearance to cowardice  war to the knife was in his heart and he rushed at charlie with a shower of slogging blows which were meant to end the fight at once  but they failed to do so  our hero nimbly evaded the blows acting entirely on the defensive and when stoker at length paused panting the hammytoor was standing before him quite cool and with the grim look intensified  if you will have ittake it he exclaimed and shot forth a blow which one of the juvenile bystanders described as a stinger on the beak  the owner of the beak felt it so keenly that he lost temper and made another savage assault which was met in much the same way with this difference that his opponent delivered several more stingers on the unfortunate beak which after that would have been more correctly described as a bulb  again the expugilist paused for breath and again the hammytoor stood up before him smiling more grimly than everpanting a little it is true but quite unscathed about the face for he had guarded it with great care although he had received some rather severe body blows  seeing this stoker descended to mean practices and in his next assault attempted and with partial success to hit below the belt  this roused a spirit of indignation in charlie which gave strength to his arm and vigour to his action  the next time stoker paused for breath charlie as the juvenile bystander remarkedwent for him planted a blow under each eye a third on his forehead and a fourth on his chest with such astounding rapidity and force that the man was driven up against the wall with a crash that shook the whole edifice  stoker dropped and remained still  there were no seconds no sponges or calling of time at that encounter  it was altogether an informal episode and when charlie saw his antagonist drop he kneeled down beside him with a feeling of anxiety lest he had killed him  my poor man he said are you much hurt  oh youve no need to fear for me said stoker recovering himself a little and sitting upbut i throw up the sponge  stokers day is over wen es knocked out o time by a hammytoor and zook is free to bile is pot unmorlested in futur  come it was worth a fight to bring you to that state of mind my man said charlie laughing  here two of you help to take him down and wash the blood off him and i say youngster he added pulling out his purse and handing a sovereign to the juvenile bystander already mentioned go out and buy sausages for the whole company  the boy stared at the coin in his hand in mute surprise while the rest of the ring looked at each other with various expressions for charlie in the rebound of feeling caused by his opponents sudden recovery and submission had totally forgotten his role and was ordering the people about like one accustomed to command  as part of the orders were of such a satisfactory nature the people did not object and to the everlasting honour of the juvenile bystander who resisted the temptation to bolt with the gold a splendid supper of pork sausages was smoking on the various tables of the kitchen of that establishment in less than an hour thereafter  when the late hours of night had arrived and most of the paupers were asleep in their poor beds dreaming perchance of better days when porksausages were not so tremendous a treat little zook went to the table at which charlie sat  he was staring at a newspaper but in reality was thinking about his vain search and beginning if truth must be told to feel discouraged  charlie said zook sitting down beside his champion or praps i should say mister charlie the games up wi you whatever it was  what dyou mean zook  well i just mean that its o no manner o use your tryin to sail any longer under false colours in this here establishment  i must still ask you to explain yourself said charlie with a puzzled look  well you know continued the little man with a deprecatory glance wen a man in ragged close orders people here about as if e was the commanderinchief o the british army an flings yellow boys about as if e was chancellor o the checkers an orders sassengers offhand for all ands e may be a gentlemanwery likely e isbut e aint a redooced one such as slopes into lodginouse kitchens  watever little game may ave brought you ere sir it aint povertyan nobody will be fool enough in this ouse to believe it is  you are right zook  im sorry i forgot myself returned charlie with a sigh  after all it does not matter much for i fear my little gameas you call itwas nearly played out and it does not seem as if i were going to win  charlie clasped his hands on the table before him and looked at the newspaper somewhat disconsolately  its bin all along o takin up my cause said the little man with something like a whimper in his voice  youve bin wery kind to me sir an id give a lot if i ad it an would go a long way if i wasnt lame to elp you  charlie looked steadily in the honest pale careworn face of his companion for a few seconds without speaking  poverty it is said brings together strange bedfellows  not less perhaps does it lead to unlikely confidants  under a sudden impulse our hero revealed to poor zook the cause of his being thereconcealing nothing except names  youll scuse me sir said the little man after the narrative was finished but i think youve gone on summat of a wildgoose chase for your man may never have come so low as to seek shelter in sitch places  possibly zook but he was penniless and this or the workhouse seemed to me the natural place to look for him in  ave you bin to the workouses sir  yesat least to all in this neighbourhood  what in that toggery asked the little man with a grin  not exactly zook i can change my shell like the hermit crabs  well sir its my opinion that you may go on till doomsday on this scent an find nuthin but theres a old ooman as i knows on that might be able to elp you  mind i dont say she could but she might moreover if she can she will  how asked charlie somewhat amused by the earnestness of his little friend  why this way  shes a good old soul who lost er usband an er sonif i aint mistakenthrough drink an ever since she as devoted erself body an soul to save men an women from drink  she attends temperance meetins an takes people thereamost drags em in by the scruff o the neck  she keeps er eyes open like a weasel an wenever she sees a chance o what she calls pluckin a brand out o the fire she plucks it without much regard to burnin er fingers sometimes she gits one an another to submit to her treatment an then she locks em up in er ousethough it aint a big unan treats em as she calls it  shes got one there now its my belief though wether its a he or a she i cant tell  now she may ave seen your friend goin aboutif e stayed long in whitechapel  it may be so returned our hero wearily for he was beginning to lose heart and the prospect opened up to him by zook did not on the first blush of it seem very brilliant  when could i see this old woman  first thing tomorror arter breakfast sir  very well then youll come and breakfast with me at eight  i will sir with all the pleasure in life  in this ere ouse sir or in a resterang  neither  in my lodgings zook  having given his address to the little man charlie bade him goodnight and retired to his pauperbed for the last time    chapter thirty two  success and future plans  punctual to the minute zook presented himself to mrs butt next morning and demanded audience  mrs butt had been forewarned of the impending visit and although she confessed to some uncomfortable feelings in respect of infection and dirt received him with a gracious air  youve come to breakfast i understand  well i believe i ave answered the little man with an involuntary glance at his dilapidated clothes avin been inwitedunless he added somewhat doubtfully the inwite came in a dream  you may go in and clear up that point for yourself said the landlady as she ushered the poor man into the parlour where he was almost startled to find an amiable gentleman waiting to receive him  come along zook i like punctuality  are you hungry  ungry as a awk sir replied zook glancing at the table and rubbing his hands for there entered his nostrils delicious odours the causes of which very seldom entered his throat  wy sir i knowd you was a gent from the wery first  i have at least entered my native shell said charlie with a laugh sit down  weve no time to waste  now whatll you have  coffee tea porksausage ham and egg buttered toast hot rolls  just help yourself and fancy youre in the lodginghouse at your own table  well sir that would be a stretch o fancy that would strain me amost to the bustin pint  coffee if you please  oh yes sugar an milk in course  i never let slip a chance as i knows on  wich bread well ot rolls is temptin but i allers ad a weakness for sappy things so ot buttered toastif you can spare it  spare it my good man said charlie laughing  theres a whole loaf in the kitchen and pounds of butter when youve finished this not to mention the shops round the corner  it was a more gratifying treat to charlie than he had expected to see this poor man eat to his hearts content of viands which he so thoroughly appreciated and so rarely enjoyed  what zook himself felt it is impossible for welltodo folk to conceive or an ordinary pen to describe but as he sat there opposite to his big friend and champion stowing away the good things with zest and devotion of purpose it was easy to believe that his watery eyes were charged with the tears of gratitude as well as with those of a chronic cold to which he was subject  breakfast over they started off in quest of the old woman with teetotal proclivities  how did you come to know her asked charlie as they went along  through a ouse in the city as i was connected with afore i got run over an lamed  they used to send me with parcels to this old ooman in course i didnt know for sartin wat was in the parcels but avin a nose you see an bein able to smell i guessed that it was a compound o wittles an wursted work  a strange compound zook  well they wasnt zactly compoundedthey was sometimes the one an sometimes the other never mixed to my knowledge  what house was it that sent you  withers and company  indeed exclaimed charlie in surprise  i know the house well  the head of it is a wellknown philanthropist  how came you to leave them they never would have allowed an old servant to come to your pass unless indeed he was  a fool sir or wuss interrupted zook an thats just what i was i runned away from em sir an ive been ashamed to go back since but thats ow i come to know old missis mag an its down ere she lives  they turned into a narrow passage which led to a small court at the back of a mass of miserable buildings and here they found the residence of the old woman  by the way zook whats her name asked charlie  mrs mag samson  somehow the name sounds familiar to me said charlie as he knocked at the door  a very small girl opened it and admitted that her missis was at ome whereupon our hero turned to his companion  ill manage her best without company zook he said so you be off and see that you come to my lodging tonight at six to hear the result of my interview and have tea  i will sir  and here zook put that in your pocket and take a good dinner  i will sir  andhallo  zook come here  not a word about all this in the lodginghousestay now i think of it dont go to the lodginghouse at all  go to a casual ward where theyll make you take a good bath be sure you give yourself a good scrub  dye hear  yes sir  he walked away murmuring more am and hegg an buttered toast tonight  zook youre in luck todayin clover my boy in clover  meanwhile charlie brooke found himself in the presence of a brighteyed little old woman who bade him welcome with the native grace of one who is a born though not a social lady and beautified by christianity her visitor went at once straight to the point  forgive my intrusion mrs samson he said taking the chair to which the old woman pointed but indeed i feel assured that you will when i state that the object of my visit is to ask you to aid in the rescue of a friend from drink  no man intrudes on me who comes on such an errand but how does it happen sir that you think i am able to aid you  to this charlie replied by giving her an account of his meeting and conversation with zook and followed that up with a full explanation of his recent efforts and a graphic description of isaac leather  the old woman listened attentively and as her visitor proceeded with increasing interest not unmingled with surprise and amusement  when he had concluded mrs samson rose and opening a door leading to another room held up her finger to impose silence and softly bade him look in  he did so  the room was a very small one scantily furnished with a low trucklebed in one corner and there on the bed lay the object of his questisaac leather  charlie had just time to see that the thin pale face was not that of a dead but of a sleeping man when the old woman gently pulled him back and reclosed the door  thats your man i think  yes thats the mani thank god for this most astonishing and unlookedfor success  ah sir returned the woman sitting down again most of our successes are unlooked for and when they do come we are not too ready to recognise the hand of the giver  nevertheless you must admit that some incidents do seem almost miraculous said charlie  to have found you out in this great city the very person who had mr leather in her keeping does seem unaccountable does it not  not so unaccountable as it seems to you replied the old woman and certainly not so much of a miracle as it would have been if you had found him by searching the lodginghouses  here is the way that god seems to have brought it about  i have for many years been a pensioner of the house of withers and company by whom i was employed until the senior partner made me a sort of female citymissionary amongst the poor  i devoted myself particularly to the reclaiming of drunkards having special sympathy with them  a friend of mine miss molloy also employed by the senior partner in works of charity happened to be acquainted with mr leather and his family  she knew of his failing and she found outfor she has a strange power that i never could understand of inducing people to make a confidant of hershe found out what no one else knew it seems that poor mr leather wished to put himself under some sort of restraint for he could not resist temptation when it came in his way  knowing about me she naturally advised him to put himself in my hands  he objected at first but agreed at last on condition that none of his people should be told anything about it  i did not like to receive him on such conditions but gave in because he would come on no other  well sir you came down here because you had information which led you to think mr leather had come to this part of the city  you met with a runaway servant of withers and companynot very wonderful that  he naturally knows about me and fetches you here  dont you see  yes i see replied charlie with an amused expression still i cannot help looking on the whole affair as very wonderful and i hope that that does not disqualify me from recognising gods leading in the matter  nay young sir returned the old woman that ought rather to qualify you for such recognition for are not his ways said to be wonderfulay sometimes past finding out  but what we know not now we shall know hereafter  i thought that when my poor boy went to sea  mrs samson exclaimed charlie with a sudden start i see it now was your boys name fred  it was  and he went to sea in the walrus that was wrecked in the southern ocean  yes exclaimed the old woman eagerly  then said charlie drawing a packet from the breastpocket of his coat fred gave me this for you  i have carried it about me ever since in the hope that i might find you  i came to london but found you had left the address written on the packet and it never occurred to me that the owners of the walrus would know anything about the mother of one of the men who sailed in her  i have a message also from your son  the message was delivered and charlie was still commenting on it when the door of the inner room opened and isaac leather stood before them  charlie brooke he exclaimed in openeyed amazement not unmingled with confusion  ay and a most unexpected meeting on both sides said charlie advancing and holding out his hand  i bring you good news mr leather of your son shank  do you indeed said the brokendown man eagerly grasping his young friends hand  what have you to tell me  oh charlie you have no idea what terrible thoughts ive had about that dear boy since he went off to america  my sin has found me out charlie  ive often heard that said before but have never tally believed it till now  god sends you a message of mercy then said our hero who thereupon began to relieve the poor mans mind by telling him of his sons welfare and reformation  but we need not linger over this part of the story for the reader can easily guess a good deal of what was said to leather while old mrs samson was perusing the letter of her dead son and tears of mingled sorrow and joy coursed down her withered cheeks  that night however charlie brooke conceived a vast idea and partially revealed it at the teatable to zookwhose real name by the way was jim smith  ave you found er sir said mrs butt putting the invariable and by that time annoying question as charlie entered his lodging  no mrs butt i havent found er and i dont expect to find er at all  lawk sir im so sorry  has mr zook come  yes sir es inside and looks impatient  the smell o the toast seems amost too strong a temptation for im im glad youve come  look here zook said charlie entering his parlour go into that bedroom  youll find a bundle of new clothes there  put them on  wrap your old clothes in a handkerchief and bring them to me  tea will be ready when you are  the surprised pauper did as he was bid without remark and reentered the parlour a new man  my own mother if i ad one wouldnt know me sir he said glancing admiringly at his vest  jim smith esquire returned charlie laughing  i really dont think she would  zook sir said the little man with a grave shake of the head couldnt think of changin my name at my time of life let it be zook if you please sir though in course ive no objection to esquire wen i ave the means to maintain my rank  well zook you have at all events the means to make a good supper so sit down and go to work and ill talk to you while you eatbut stay hand me the bundle of old clothes  charlie opened the window as he spoke took hold of the bundle and discharged it into the back yard  there he said sitting down at the table that will prove an object of interest to the cats all night and a subject of surprise to good mrs butt in the morning  now zook he added when his guest was fairly at work taking in cargo i want to ask youhave you any objection to emigrate to america  not the smallest he said as well as was possible through a full mouth  bein a orphling so to speak owin to my never avin ad a father or motheras i knows ontheres nothin that chains me to old england cept poverty  could you do without drink  scasely sir seein the doctors say that man is about three partsor four is itmade up o water i would be apt to grow mummified without drink wouldnt i sir  come zookyou know that i mean strong drinkalcohol in all its forms  oh i see  well sir as to that ive bin in the abit of doin without it so much of late from needcessity that i dont think id find much difficulty in knocking it off altogether if i was to bring principle to bear  well then continued charlie have some more ham  i have just conceived a plan  i have a friend in america who is a reformed drunkard  his father in this country is also i hope a reformed drunkard  there is a good man out there i understand who has had a great deal to do with reformed drunkards and he has got up a large body of friends and sympathisers who have determined to go away into the far west and there organise a total abstinence community and found a village or town where nothing in the shape of alcohol shall be admitted except as physic  now i have a lot of friends in england who i think would go in for such an expedition if  are they all reformed drunkards sir asked zook in surprise arresting a mass of sausage in its course as he asked the question  by no means returned charlie with a laugh but they are earnest souls and im sure will go if i try to persuade them  youre sure to succeed sir said zook if your persuasions is accompanied wi sassengers am an buttered toast remarked the little man softly as he came to a pause for a few seconds  ill bring to bear on them all the arguments that are available you may be sure  meanwhile i shall count you my first recruit  number 1 it is sir wich is more than i can say of this here slice said zook helping himself to more toast  while the poor but happy man was thus pleasantly engaged his entertainer opened his writing portfolio and began to scribble off note after note with such rapidity that the amazed pauper at his elbow fairly lost his appetite and after a vain attempt to recover it suggested that it might be as well for him to retire to one of the palatial fourpenceanight residences in dean and flower street  not tonight  youve done me a good turn that i shall never forget said charlie rising and ringing the bell with needless vigour  be kind enough mrs butt to show mr zook to his bedroom  my heye murmured the pauper marching off with two full inches added to his stature  not in there i suppose missis he said facetiously as he passed the coalhole  oh lawks nothis way replied the good woman who was becoming almost imbecile under the eccentricities of her lodger  this is your bedroom and i only ope it wont turn into a bandbox before morning for of all the transformations an pantimimes as as took place in this ouse since mr brooke entered it i  she hesitated and not seeing her way quite clearly to the fitting end of the sentence asked if mr zook would ave ot water in the morning  no thank you missis replied the little man with dignity while he felt the stubble on his chin avin left my razors at ome i prefers the water cold  leaving zook to his meditations mrs butt retired to bed remarking as she extinguished the candle that mr brooke was still awritin like a ouse a fire    chapter thirty three  sweetwater bluff  we must now leap over a considerable space not only of distance but of time in order to appreciate fully the result of charlie brookes furious letterwriting and amazing powers of persuasion  let the reader try to imagine a wide plateau dotted with trees and bushes on one of the eastern slopes of the rocky mountains where that mighty range begins to slide into union with the great prairies  it commands a view of mingled woodland and rolling plain diversified by river and lake extending to a horizon so faint and far away as to suggest the idea of illimitable space  early one morning in spring five horsemen emerging from a belt of woodland galloped to the slope that led to the summit of this plateau drawing rein they began slowly to ascend  two of the cavaliers were young tall and strongtwo were portly and old though still hearty and vigorous one who led them on a coalblack steed was a magnificent specimen of the backwoodsman and one who brought up the rear was a thin little man who made up for what he wanted in size by the energy and vigour of his action as with hand and heel he urged an unwilling horse to keep up with the rest of the party  arrived at the summit of the plateau the leading horseman trotted to its eastern edge and halted as if for the purpose of surveying the position  here we are at last he said to the tallest of his comrades sweetwater bluffand the end of our journey  and a most noble end it is exclaimed the tall comrade  why hunky ben it far surpasses my expectations and all you have said about it  most o the people ive had to guide over this trail have said pretty much the same thing in different words mr brooke returned the scout dismounting  your wife will find plenty o subjects here for the paintin shes so fond of  ay may will find work here to keep her brushes busy for many a day to come replied charlie though i suspect that other matters will claim most of her time at first for there is nothing but a wilderness here yet  youve yet to larn sir that we dont take as long to fix up a town hereaway as you do in the old country remarked hunky ben as old jacob crossley ambled up on the staid creature which we have already introduced as wheelbarrow  waving his hand with enthusiasm the old gentleman exclaimed glorious indeed for a few minutes he sat with glistening eyes and heaving chest quite unable to give vent to any other sentiment than glorious this he did at intervals  his interest in the scene however was distracted by the sudden advent of captain stride whose horsea longlegged roanhad an awkward tendency among other eccentricities to advance sideways with a waltzing gait that greatly disconcerted the mariner  woa you brute  back your topsls wont you  i never did see sitch a craft for heavin about like a dutch lugger in a cross sea  she sails side on no matter where shes bound for  forges ahead amost entirely by means of leeway so to speak  hallo woa  ketch a grip o the painter dick an hold on till i git off the hurricane deck o this walruselse ill be overboard in a  there the captain came to the ground suddenly as he spoke without the use of stirrup and luckily without injury  not hurt i hope asked dick darvall assisting his brothersalt to rise  not a bit of it dick  you see im amost as active as yourself though double your age if not more  i say charlie this is a pretty lookout  dont ee think so mr crossley  i was sure that hunky ben would find us a pleasant anchorage and safe holdingground at last though it did seem as if we was pretty long o comin to it  just as we was leavin the waggins to ride on in advance i said to my missussays imaggie you may depend  hallo  zook cried charlie as the little man of the slums came limping up what have you done with your horse  cast im loose sir an gin im leave of absence as long as e pleases  its my opinion that some the osses o the western prairies aint quite eekal to some o the osses ive bin used to in rotten row is this the place hunky  well now continued the little man with flashing eyes as he looked round on the magnificent scene itll do beats witechapel an the parks any ow  an theres lots o poultry about too he added as a flock of wild ducks went by on whistling wings  i say hunky ben wats yon brown things over there by the shores o the lake  buffalo answered the scout  what wild uns  theres no tame ones in them diggins as i knows on  if there was theyd soon become wild you bet  an wats yon monster crawlin over the farthest plain like the great seaserpent  why man returned the scout thems the waggins  come now lets to work an git the fire lit  the cart wi the chuck an tentsll be here in a few minutes an the waggins wont be long arter em  ay wi the women an kids shoutin for grub added zook as he limped after the scout while the rest of the little band dispersedsome to cut firewood others to select the best positions for the tents  the waggons with a supply of food arrived soon after under the care of roaring bull himself with two of his cowboys  they were followed by buttercup who bestrode manfashion a mustang nearly as black as herself and even more frisky  in a wonderfully short time a number of white tents arose on the plateau and several fires blazed and at all the fires buttercup laboured with superhuman effect assisted by the cowboys to the unbounded admiration of zook who willingly superintended everything but did little or nothing  a flat rock on the highest point was chosen for the site of a future blockhouse or citadel and upon this was ere long spread a breakfast on a magnificent scale  it was barely ready when the first waggons arrived and commenced to lumber up the ascent preceded by two girls on horseback who waved their hands and gave vent to vigorous little feminine cheers as they cantered up the slope  these two were our old friends whom we knew as may leather and mary jackson but who must now be reintroduced to the reader as mrs charlie brooke and mrs dick darvall  on the same day they had changed their names at the ranch of roaring bull and had come to essay wedded life in the far west  we need hardly say that this was the great experimental emigrant party led by the reverend william reeves who had resolved to found a colony on total abstinence principles and with as many as possible of the sins of civilisation left behind  they found alas that sin is not so easily got rid of nevertheless the effort was not altogether fruitless and mr reeves carried with him a sovereign antidote for sin in the shape of a godly spirit  the party was a large one for there were many men and women of the frontier whose experiences had taught them that life was happier and better in every way without the prevalent vices of gambling and drinking  of course the emigrants formed rather a motley band  among them besides those of our friends already mentioned there were our heros mother and all the leather family  captain strides daughter as well as his missus and mr crossleys housekeeper mrs bland  that good woman however had been much subdued and rendered harmless by the terrors of the wilderness to which she had been recently exposed  miss molloy was also there with an enormous supply of knitting needles and several bales of worsted  poor shank leather was still so much of an invalid as to be obliged to travel in a spring cart with his father but both men were rapidly regaining physical strength under the influence of temperance and spiritual strength under a higher power  soon the hammer axe and saw began to resound in that lovely western wilderness the net to sweep its lakes the hook to invade its rivers the rifle to crack in the forests and the plough to open up its virgin soil  in less time almost than a european would take to wink the town of sweetwater bluff sprang into being stores and workshops a school and a church grew up like mushrooms seed was sown and everything in short was done that is characteristic of the advent of a thriving community  but not a gambling or drinking saloon or a drop of firewater was to be found in all the town  in spite of this indians brought their furs to it trappers came to it for supplies emigrants turned aside to see and rest in it and the place soon became noted as a flourishing and preeminently peaceful spot    chapter thirty four  the last  but a little cloud arose ere long on the horizon of sweetwater bluff insignificant at first it suddenly spread over the sky and burst in a wild storm  the first intimation of its approach came from charlie brooke one quiet autumn evening in that brief but delightful season known as the indian summer  charlie entered his garden that evening with a fowlingpiece on his shoulder and two brace of prairie hens at his girdle  may was seated at her cottage door basking in sunshine chatting with her motherwho was knitting of courseand shank was conversing with hunky ben who rested after a day of labour  there may is tomorrows dinner said charlie throwing the birds at his wifes feet and sitting down beside her  who dyou think i passed when i was out on the plains today hunky  your old friend crux the cowboy  hes no friend o mine said the scout while something like a frown flitted across his usually placid brow  im not overpleased to hear that hes comin for its said that some old uncle or aunt o hisi forget whichhas left him a lot o dollars  i hope he aint comin to spend em here for hed never git along without gamblin an drinkin  then i can tell you that he is just coming to stay here returned charlie for he has several waggons with him and a dozen men  i asked him where he was going to and he said to locate himself as a storekeeper at sweetwater bluff but he did not seem inclined to be communicative so i left him and galloped on to report the news  what dyou think about it  i think itll be a bad day for sweetwater bluff when crux comes to settle in it  howsoever this is a free country an weve no right to interfere with him so long as he dont break the laws  but i doubt him im afeard hell try to sell drink an theres some o our people who are longin to git back to that  the other members of the party and indeed those heads of the town generally who knew crux were of much the same opinion but some of them thought that being in a free country no one had a right to interfere the consequence was that crux and his men were permitted to go to work they hired a shed in which to stow their goods while they were engaged in building a store and in course of time this was finished but there was a degree of mystery about the excowboys proceedings which baffled investigation and people did not like to press inquiry too far for it was observed that all the men who had accompanied crux were young and powerful fellows well armed with rifle and revolver  at last however the work was finished and the mystery was cleared up for one fine morning the new store was opened as a drinking and gambling saloon and that same evening the place was in full swing sending forth the shouts songs cursing and demoniac laughter for which such places are celebrated  consternation filled the hearts of the community for it was not only the men brought there by crux who kept up their revels in the new saloon but a sprinkling of the spirited young fellows of the town also who had never been very enthusiastic in the temperance cause and were therefore prepared to fall before the first temptation  at a conference of the chief men of the town it was resolved to try to induce crux to quit quietly and for this end to offer to buy up his stockintrade  hunky ben being an old acquaintance was requested to go to the store as a deputation  but the excowboy was inexorable  neither the offer of money nor argument had any effect on him  well crux said the scout at the conclusion of his visit you know your own affairs best but rememberin as i do what you used to be i thought there was more of fairplay about you  fairplay  what dye mean  i mean that when folk let you alone you used to be willin to let them alone  here has a crowd o people come back all this way into the rockies to escape from the curse o strong drink and gamblin an here has cruxa lover o fairplaycome all this way to shove that curse right under their noses  id thowt better of ye crux lad  it dont matter much what you thowt o me old man returned the cowboy somewhat sharply an as to fairplay theres a lot of men here who dont agree wi your humbuggin notions about temperance an teetotalismmore of em maybe than you think  these want to have the drink an ive come to give it em  i see nothin unfair in that  hunky ben carried his report back to the council which for some time discussed the situation  as in the case of most councils there was some difference of opinion a few of the members being inclined to carry things with a high handbeing urged thereto by captain stridewhile others influenced chiefly by mr reeves were anxious to try peaceable means  at last a subcommittee was appointed at hunky bens suggestion to consider the whole matter and take what steps seemed advisable  hunky was an adroit and modest manhe could not have been a firstrate scout otherwise  he managed not only to become convener of the committee but succeeded in getting men chiefly of his own opinion placed on it  at supper that night in charlies cottage while enjoying mays cookery and presence and waited on by the amused and interested buttercup the subcommittee discussed and settled the plan of operations  its all nonsense said hunky ben to talk of tryin to persuade crux  hes as obstinate as a texas mule wi the toothache  rubbish exclaimed captain stride smiting the table with his fist we mustnt parley with him but heave him overboard at once  i said so to my missus this very day  maggie says i  and what do you think charlie asked mr crossley  i think with hunky ben of course  he knows crux and what is best to be done in the circumstances  the only thing that perplexes me is what shall we do with the liquor when weve paid for it  a lot of it is good wine and champagne and although useless as a beverage it is useful as a medicine and might be given to hospitals  pour it out exclaimed shank almost fiercely  ay the hospitals can look out for themselves added shanks father warmly  some hospitals ive bin told git on well enough without it altogether said dick darvall  however its a subject that desarves considerationhallo  buttercup what is it that tickles your fancy an makes your mouth stretch out like that  buttercup became preternaturally grave on the instant but declined to tell what it was that tickled her fancy  shortly after the party rose and left the house hunky ben remarking with a quiet laugh that deeds of darkness were best hatched at night  what the conspirators hatched became pretty evident next day for during the breakfast hour a band of forty horsemen rode slowly down the sloping road which led to the plains and on the side of which crux had built his saloon  crux and his men turned out in some surprise to watch the cavalcade as it passed  the band was led by charlie brooke and the scout rode in advance on black polly as guide  is it the reds or the buffalo youre after today hunky with such a big crowd asked crux  halt cried charlie at that moment  the forty men obeyed and turning suddenly to the left faced the saloon  hands up said charlie whose men at the same moment pointed their rifles at crux and his men  these were all too familiar with the order to dare to disobey it  our hero then ordered a small detachment of his men to enter the saloon and fetch out all rifles and pistols and those of cruxs people who chanced to have their weapons about them were disarmed  another detachment went off to the stables behind the saloon  while they were thus engaged charlie addressed crux  we have decided to expel you crux from this town he said as he drew an envelope from his pocket  we have tried to convince you that as the majority of the people here dont want you it is your duty to go  as you dont seem to see this we now take the law into our own hands  we love fairplay however so you will find in this envelope a cheque which we have reason to believe is fully equal to the value of your saloon and all its contents  your lost time and trouble is your own affair  as you came without invitation you must go without compensation  here are your rifles and revolvers emptied of cartridges and there are your horses saddled  as he spoke one detachment of his men handed rifles and revolvers to the party who were stricken dumb with amazement  at the same time their horses saddled and bridled were led to the front and delivered to them  we have no provisions said crux at last recovering the use of his tongue and without ammunition we cannot procure any  that has been provided for said our hero turning to hunky ben  ay crux said the scout we dont want to starve you though the arth wouldnt lose much if we did  at the other end o the lake about five mile from here youll find a red rag flyin at the branch of a tree  in the hole of a rock close beside it youll find three days provisions for you and your men an a lot of ammunition  now mount and go said charlie and if you ever show face here again except as friends your blood be on your own heads  crux did not hesitate  he and his men saw that the game was up without another word they mounted their horses and galloped away  while this scene was being enacted a dark creature with darker designs entered the drinking saloon and descended to the cellar  finding a spiritcask with a tap in it buttercup turned it on then pulling a matchbox out of her pocket she muttered i tink de hospitals wont git much ob it and applied a light  the effect was more powerful than she had expected  the spirit blazed up with sudden fury singeing off the girls eyebrows and lashes and almost blinding her  in her alarm buttercup dashed up to the saloon missed her way and found herself on the stair leading to the upper floor  a cloud of smoke and fire forced her to rush up  she went to the window and yelled on observing that it was far too high to leap  she rushed to another window and howled in horror for escape was apparently impossible  charlie heard the howl  he and his men had retired to a safe distance when the fire was first observedthinking the place emptybut the howl touched a chord in our heros sympathetic breast which was ever ready to vibrate  from whom the howl proceeded mattered little or nothing to charlie brooke  sufficient that it was the cry of a living being in distress  he sprang at once through the open doorway of the saloon through which was issuing a volume of thick smoke mingled with flame  god help him the placell blow up in a few minutes cried hunky ben losing for once his imperturbable coolness and rushing wildly after his friend  but at that moment the thick smoke burst into fierce flame and drove him back  charlie sprang up the staircase three steps at a time holding his breath to avoid suffocation  he reached the landing where buttercup ran or rather fell almost fainting into his arms  at the moment an explosion in the cellar shook the building to its foundation and shattering one of the windows caused a draught of air to drive aside the smoke  charlie gasped a mouthful of air and looked round  flames were by that time roaring up the only staircase  a glance from the nearest window showed that a leap thence meant broken limbs if not death to both  a ladder up to a trapdoor suggested an exit by the roof  it might only lead to a more terrible leap but meanwhile it offered relief from imminent suffocation  charlie bore the halfdead girl to the top rung and found the trapdoor padlocked but a thrust from his powerful shoulder wrenched hasp and padlock from their hold and next moment a wild cheer greeted him as he stood on a corner of the gable  but a depth of forty or fifty feet was below him with nothing to break his fall to the hard earth  jump yelled one of the onlookers  no dont cried another youll be killed  hold your noise roared hunky ben and lend a hand heresharpthe housell blow up in a minute  he ran as he spoke towards a cart which was partly filled with hay seizing the trams he raised them  willing hands helped and the cart was run violently up against the gablehunky shouting to some of the men to fetch more hay  but there was no time for that  another explosion took place inside the building which charlie knew must have driven in the sides of more casks and let loose fresh fuel  a terrible roar followed by ominous cracking of the roof warned him that there was no time to lose  he looked steadily at the cart for a moment and leaped  his friends held their breath as the pair descended  the hay would not have sufficed to break the fall sufficiently but happily the cart was an old one  when they came down on it like a thunderbolt the bottom gave way  crashing through it the pair came to the ground heavily indeed but uninjured  the fall which almost stunned our hero had the curious effect of reviving buttercup for she muttered something to the effect that dat was a mos drefful smash as they conveyed her and her rescuer from the vicinity of danger  this had scarcely been done when the house blew upits walls were driven outwards its roof was blown off its bottles were shattered all its baleful contents were scattered around and amid an appropriate hurricane of blue fire that drinking and gambling saloon was blown to atoms  would that a like fate might overtake every similar establishment in the world  this was the first and last attempt to disturb the peace of sweetwater bluff  it is said indeed that crux and some of his men did long afterwards make their appearance in that happy and flourishing town but they came as reformed men not as foesmen who had found out that in very truth sobriety tends to felicity that honesty is the best policy and that the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom  the end
