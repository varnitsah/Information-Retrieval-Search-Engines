the black dwarf        note  footnotes in the printed book have been inserted in the      etext in square brackets  close to the place where      they were referenced by a suffix in the original text      text in italics has been written in capital letters     i tales of my landlord  collected and reported by jedediah cleishbotham schoolmaster and parishclerk of gandercleugh     introduction  as i may without vanity presume that the name and official description prefixed to this proem will secure it from the sedate and reflecting part of mankind to whom only i would be understood to address myself such attention as is due to the sedulous instructor of youth and the careful performer of my sabbath duties i will forbear to hold up a candle to the daylight or to point out to the judicious those recommendations of my labours which they must necessarily anticipate from the perusal of the titlepage nevertheless i am not unaware that as envy always dogs merit at the heels there may be those who will whisper that albeit my learning and good principles cannot lauded be the heavens be denied by any one yet that my situation at gandercleugh hath been more favourable to my acquisitions in learning than to the enlargement of my views of the ways and works of the present generation to the which objection if peradventure any such shall be started my answer shall be threefold  first gandercleugh is as it were the central partthe navel si fas sit dicere of this our native realm of scotland so that men from every corner thereof when travelling on their concernments of business either towards our metropolis of law by which i mean edinburgh or towards our metropolis and mart of gain whereby i insinuate glasgow are frequently led to make gandercleugh their abiding stage and place of rest for the night and it must be acknowledged by the most sceptical that i who have sat in the leathern armchair on the lefthand side of the fire in the common room of the wallace inn winter and summer for every evening in my life during forty years bypast the christian sabbaths only excepted must have seen more of the manners and customs of various tribes and people than if i had sought them out by my own painful travel and bodily labour even so doth the tollman at the wellfrequented turnpike on the wellbraehead sitting at his ease in his own dwelling gather more receipt of custom than if moving forth upon the road he were to require a contribution from each person whom he chanced to meet in his journey when according to the vulgar adage he might possibly be greeted with more kicks than halfpence  but secondly supposing it again urged that ithacus the most wise of the greeks acquired his renown as the roman poet hath assured us by visiting states and men i reply to the zoilus who shall adhere to this objection that de facto i have seen states and men also for i have visited the famous cities of edinburgh and glasgow the former twice and the latter three times in the course of my earthly pilgrimage and moreover i had the honour to sit in the general assembly meaning as an auditor in the galleries thereof and have heard as much goodly speaking on the law of patronage as with the fructification thereof in mine own understanding hath made me be considered as an oracle upon that doctrine ever since my safe and happy return to gandercleugh  againand thirdly if it be nevertheless pretended that my information and knowledge of mankind however extensive and however painfully acquired by constant domestic enquiry and by foreign travel is natheless incompetent to the task of recording the pleasant narratives of my landlord i will let these critics know to their own eternal shame and confusion as well as to the abashment and discomfiture of all who shall rashly take up a song against me that i am not the writer redacter or compiler of the tales of my landlord nor am i in one single iota answerable for their contents more or less and now ye generation of critics who raise yourselves up as if it were brazen serpents to hiss with your tongues and to smite with your stings bow yourselves down to your native dust and acknowledge that yours have been the thoughts of ignorance and the words of vain foolishness lo ye are caught in your own snare and your own pit hath yawned for you turn then aside from the task that is too heavy for you destroy not your teeth by gnawing a file waste not your strength by spurning against a castle wall nor spend your breath in contending in swiftness with a fleet steed and let those weigh the tales of my landlord who shall bring with them the scales of candour cleansed from the rust of prejudice by the hands of intelligent modesty for these alone they were compiled as will appear from a brief narrative which my zeal for truth compelled me to make supplementary to the present proem  it is well known that my landlord was a pleasing and a facetious man acceptable unto all the parish of gandercleugh excepting only the laird the exciseman and those for whom he refused to draw liquor upon trust their causes of dislike i will touch separately adding my own refutation thereof  his honour the laird accused our landlord deceased of having encouraged in various times and places the destruction of hares rabbits fowls black and grey partridges moorpouts roedeer and other birds and quadrupeds at unlawful seasons and contrary to the laws of this realm which have secured in their wisdom the slaughter of such animals for the great of the earth whom i have remarked to take an uncommon though to me an unintelligible pleasure therein now in humble deference to his honour and in justifiable defence of my friend deceased i reply to this charge that howsoever the form of such animals might appear to be similar to those so protected by the law yet it was a mere deceptio visus for what resembled hares were in fact hillkids and those partaking of the appearance of moorfowl were truly wood pigeons and consumed and eaten eo nomine and not otherwise  again the exciseman pretended that my deceased landlord did encourage that species of manufacture called distillation without having an especial permission from the great technically called a license for doing so now i stand up to confront this falsehood and in defiance of him his gaugingstick and pen and inkhorn i tell him that i never saw or tasted a glass of unlawful aqua vitae in the house of my landlord nay that on the contrary we needed not such devices in respect of a pleasing and somewhat seductive liquor which was vended and consumed at the wallace inn under the name of mountain dew if there is a penalty against manufacturing such a liquor let him show me the statute and when he does ill tell him if i will obey it or no  concerning those who came to my landlord for liquor and went thirsty away for lack of present coin or future credit i cannot but say it has grieved my bowels as if the case had been mine own nevertheless my landlord considered the necessities of a thirsty soul and would permit them in extreme need and when their soul was impoverished for lack of moisture to drink to the full value of their watches and wearing apparel exclusively of their inferior habiliments which he was uniformly inexorable in obliging them to retain for the credit of the house as to mine own part i may well say that he never refused me that modicum of refreshment with which i am wont to recruit nature after the fatigues of my school it is true i taught his five sons english and latin writing bookkeeping with a tincture of mathematics and that i instructed his daughter in psalmody nor do i remember me of any fee or honorarium received from him on account of these my labours except the compotations aforesaid nevertheless this compensation suited my humour well since it is a hard sentence to bid a dry throat wait till quarterday  but truly were i to speak my simple conceit and belief i think my landlord was chiefly moved to waive in my behalf the usual requisition of a symbol or reckoning from the pleasure he was wont to take in my conversation which though solid and edifying in the main was like a wellbuilt palace decorated with facetious narratives and devices tending much to the enhancement and ornament thereof and so pleased was my landlord of the wallace in his replies during such colloquies that there was no district in scotland yea and no peculiar and as it were distinctive custom therein practised but was discussed betwixt us insomuch that those who stood by were wont to say it was worth a bottle of ale to hear us communicate with each other and not a few travellers from distant parts as well as from the remote districts of our kingdom were wont to mingle in the conversation and to tell news that had been gathered in foreign lands or preserved from oblivion in this our own  now i chanced to have contracted for teaching the lower classes with a young person called peter or patrick pattieson who had been educated for our holy kirk yea had by the license of presbytery his voice opened therein as a preacher who delighted in the collection of olden tales and legends and in garnishing them with the flowers of poesy whereof he was a vain and frivolous professor for he followed not the example of those strong poets whom i proposed to him as a pattern but formed versification of a flimsy and modern texture to the compounding whereof was necessary small pains and less thought and hence i have chid him as being one of those who bring forward the fatal revolution prophesied by mr robert carey in his vaticination on the death of the celebrated dr john donne       now thou art gone and thy strict laws will be      too hard for libertines in poetry      till verse by thee refined in this last age      turn ballad rhyme  i had also disputations with him touching his indulging rather a flowing and redundant than a concise and stately diction in his prose exercitations but notwithstanding these symptoms of inferior taste and a humour of contradicting his betters upon passages of dubious construction in latin authors i did grievously lament when peter pattieson was removed from me by death even as if he had been the offspring of my own loins and in respect his papers had been left in my care to answer funeral and deathbed expenses i conceived myself entitled to dispose of one parcel thereof entitled tales of my landlord to one cunning in the trade as it is called of bookselling he was a mirthful man of small stature cunning in counterfeiting of voices and in making facetious tales and responses and whom i have to laud for the truth of his dealings towards me  now therefore the world may see the injustice that charges me with incapacity to write these narratives seeing that though i have proved that i could have written them if i would yet not having done so the censure will deservedly fall if at all due upon the memory of mr peter pattieson whereas i must be justly entitled to the praise when any is due seeing that as the dean of st patricks wittily and logically expresseth it       that without which a thing is not      is causa sine qua non  the work therefore is unto me as a child is to a parent in the which child if it proveth worthy the parent hath honour and praise but if otherwise the disgrace will deservedly attach to itself alone  i have only further to intimate that mr peter pattieson in arranging these tales for the press hath more consulted his own fancy than the accuracy of the narrative nay that he hath sometimes blended two or three stories together for the mere grace of his plots of which infidelity although i disapprove and enter my testimony against it yet i have not taken upon me to correct the same in respect it was the will of the deceased that his manuscript should be submitted to the press without diminution or alteration a fanciful nicety it was on the part of my deceased friend who if thinking wisely ought rather to have conjured me by all the tender ties of our friendship and common pursuits to have carefully revised altered and augmented at my judgment and discretion but the will of the dead must be scrupulously obeyed even when we weep over their pertinacity and selfdelusion so gentle reader i bid you farewell recommending you to such fare as the mountains of your own country produce and i will only farther premise that each tale is preceded by a short introduction mentioning the persons by whom and the circumstances under which the materials thereof were collected  jedediah cleishbotham     ii introduction to the black dwarf  the ideal being who is here presented as residing in solitude and haunted by a consciousness of his own deformity and a suspicion of his being generally subjected to the scorn of his fellowmen is not altogether imaginary an individual existed many years since under the authors observation which suggested such a character this poor unfortunate mans name was david ritchie a native of tweeddale he was the son of a labourer in the slatequarries of stobo and must have been born in the misshapen form which he exhibited though he sometimes imputed it to illusage when in infancy he was bred a brushmaker at edinburgh and had wandered to several places working at his trade from all which he was chased by the disagreeable attention which his hideous singularity of form and face attracted wherever he came the author understood him to say he had even been in dublin  tired at length of being the object of shouts laughter and derision david ritchie resolved like a deer hunted from the herd to retreat to some wilderness where he might have the least possible communication with the world which scoffed at him he settled himself with this view upon a patch of wild moorland at the bottom of a bank on the farm of woodhouse in the sequestered vale of the small river manor in peeblesshire the few people who had occasion to pass that way were much surprised and some superstitious persons a little alarmed to see so strange a figure as bowd davie ie crooked david employed in a task for which he seemed so totally unfit as that of erecting a house the cottage which he built was extremely small but the walls as well as those of a little garden that surrounded it were constructed with an ambitious degree of solidity being composed of layers of large stones and turf and some of the corner stones were so weighty as to puzzle the spectators how such a person as the architect could possibly have raised them in fact david received from passengers or those who came attracted by curiosity a good deal of assistance and as no one knew how much aid had been given by others the wonder of each individual remained undiminished  the proprietor of the ground the late sir james naesmith baronet chanced to pass this singular dwelling which having been placed there without right or leave asked or given formed an exact parallel with falstaffs simile of a fair house built on anothers ground so that poor david might have lost his edifice by mistaking the property where he had erected it of course the proprietor entertained no idea of exacting such a forfeiture but readily sanctioned the harmless encroachment  the personal description of elshender of mucklestanemoor has been generally allowed to be a tolerably exact and unexaggerated portrait of david of manor water he was not quite three feet and a half high since he could stand upright in the door of his mansion which was just that height the following particulars concerning his figure and temper occur in the scots magazine for 1817 and are now understood to have been communicated by the ingenious mr robert chambers of edinburgh who has recorded with much spirit the traditions of the good town and in other publications largely and agreeably added to the stock of our popular antiquities he is the countryman of david ritchie and had the best access to collect anecdotes of him  his skull says this authority which was of an oblong and rather unusual shape was said to be of such strength that he could strike it with ease through the panel of a door or the end of a barrel his laugh is said to have been quite horrible and his screechowl voice shrill uncouth and dissonant corresponded well with his other peculiarities  there was nothing very uncommon about his dress he usually wore an old slouched hat when he went abroad and when at home a sort of cowl or nightcap he never wore shoes being unable to adapt them to his misshapen finlike feet but always had both feet and legs quite concealed and wrapt up with pieces of cloth he always walked with a sort of pole or pikestaff considerably taller than himself his habits were in many respects singular and indicated a mind congenial to its uncouth tabernacle a jealous misanthropical and irritable temper was his prominent characteristic the sense of his deformity haunted him like a phantom and the insults and scorn to which this exposed him had poisoned his heart with fierce and bitter feelings which from other points in his character do not appear to have been more largely infused into his original temperament than that of his fellowmen  he detested children on account of their propensity to insult and persecute him to strangers he was generally reserved crabbed and surly and though he by no means refused assistance or charity he seldom either expressed or exhibited much gratitude even towards persons who had been his greatest benefactors and who possessed the greatest share of his goodwill he frequently displayed much caprice and jealousy a lady who had known him from his infancy and who has furnished us in the most obliging manner with some particulars respecting him says that although davie showed as much respect and attachment to her fathers family as it was in his nature to show to any yet they were always obliged to be very cautious in their deportment towards him one day having gone to visit him with another lady he took them through his garden and was showing them with much pride and goodhumour all his rich and tastefully assorted borders when they happened to stop near a plot of cabbages which had been somewhat injured by the caterpillars davie observing one of the ladies smile instantly assumed his savage scowling aspect rushed among the cabbages and dashed them to pieces with his kent exclaiming i hate the worms for they mock me  another lady likewise a friend and old acquaintance of his very unintentionally gave david mortal offence on a similar occasion throwing back his jealous glance as he was ushering her into his garden he fancied he observed her spit and exclaimed with great ferocity am i a toad woman that ye spit at methat ye spit at me and without listening to any answer or excuse drove her out of his garden with imprecations and insult when irritated by persons for whom he entertained little respect his misanthropy displayed itself in words and sometimes in actions of still greater rudeness and he used on such occasions the most unusual and singularly savage imprecations and threats scots magazine vol lxxx p207  nature maintains a certain balance of good and evil in all her works and there is no state perhaps so utterly desolate which does not possess some source of gratification peculiar to itself this poor man whose misanthropy was founded in a sense on his own preternatural deformity had yet his own particular enjoyments driven into solitude he became an admirer of the beauties of nature his garden which he sedulously cultivated and from a piece of wild moorland made a very productive spot was his pride and his delight but he was also an admirer of more natural beauty the soft sweep of the green hill the bubbling of a clear fountain or the complexities of a wild thicket were scenes on which he often gazed for hours and as he said with inexpressible delight it was perhaps for this reason that he was fond of shenstones pastorals and some parts of paradise lost the author has heard his most unmusical voice repeat the celebrated description of paradise which he seemed fully to appreciate his other studies were of a different cast chiefly polemical he never went to the parish church and was therefore suspected of entertaining heterodox opinions though his objection was probably to the concourse of spectators to whom he must have exposed his unseemly deformity he spoke of a future state with intense feeling and even with tears he expressed disgust at the idea of his remains being mixed with the common rubbish as he called it of the churchyard and selected with his usual taste a beautiful and wild spot in the glen where he had his hermitage in which to take his last repose he changed his mind however and was finally interred in the common burialground of manor parish  the author has invested wise elshie with some qualities which made him appear in the eyes of the vulgar a man possessed of supernatural power common fame paid david ritchie a similar compliment for some of the poor and ignorant as well as all the children in the neighbourhood held him to be what is called uncanny he himself did not altogether discourage the idea it enlarged his very limited circle of power and in so far gratified his conceit and it soothed his misanthropy by increasing his means of giving terror or pain but even in a rude scottish glen thirty years back the fear of sorcery was very much out of date  david ritchie affected to frequent solitary scenes especially such as were supposed to be haunted and valued himself upon his courage in doing so to be sure he had little chance of meeting anything more ugly than himself at heart he was superstitious and planted many rowans mountain ashes around his hut as a certain defence against necromancy for the same reason doubtless he desired to have rowantrees set above his grave  we have stated that david ritchie loved objects of natural beauty his only living favourites were a dog and a cat to which he was particularly attached and his bees which he treated with great care he took a sister latterly to live in a hut adjacent to his own but he did not permit her to enter it she was weak in intellect but not deformed in person simple or rather silly but not like her brother sullen or bizarre david was never affectionate to her it was not in his nature but he endured her he maintained himself and her by the sale of the product of their garden and beehives and latterly they had a small allowance from the parish indeed in the simple and patriarchal state in which the country then was persons in the situation of david and his sister were sure to be supported they had only to apply to the next gentleman or respectable farmer and were sure to find them equally ready and willing to supply their very moderate wants david often received gratuities from strangers which he never asked never refused and never seemed to consider as an obligation he had a right indeed to regard himself as one of natures paupers to whom she gave a title to be maintained by his kind even by that deformity which closed against him all ordinary ways of supporting himself by his own labour besides a bag was suspended in the mill for david ritchies benefit and those who were carrying home a melder of meal seldom failed to add a gowpen handful to the almsbag of the deformed cripple in short david had no occasion for money save to purchase snuff his only luxury in which he indulged himself liberally when he died in the beginning of the present century he was found to have hoarded about twenty pounds a habit very consistent with his disposition for wealth is power and power was what david ritchie desired to possess as a compensation for his exclusion from human society  his sister survived till the publication of the tale to which this brief notice forms the introduction and the author is sorry to learn that a sort of local sympathy and the curiosity then expressed concerning the author of waverley and the subjects of his novels exposed the poor woman to enquiries which gave her pain when pressed about her brothers peculiarities she asked in her turn why they would not permit the dead to rest to others who pressed for some account of her parents she answered in the same tone of feeling  the author saw this poor and it may be said unhappy man in autumn 1797 being then as he has the happiness still to remain connected by ties of intimate friendship with the family of the venerable dr adam fergusson the philosopher and historian who then resided at the mansionhouse of halyards in the vale of manor about a mile from ritchies hermitage the author was upon a visit at halyards which lasted for several days and was made acquainted with this singular anchorite whom dr fergusson considered as an extraordinary character and whom he assisted in various ways particularly by the occasional loan of books though the taste of the philosopher and the poor peasant did not it may be supposed always correspond i remember david was particularly anxious to see a book which he called i think letters to elect ladies and which he said was the best composition he had ever read but dr fergussons library did not supply the volume dr fergusson considered him as a man of a powerful capacity and original ideas but whose mind was thrown off its just bias by a predominant degree of selflove and selfopinion galled by the sense of ridicule and contempt and avenging itself upon society in idea at least by a gloomy misanthropy  david ritchie besides the utter obscurity of his life while in existence had been dead for many years when it occurred to the author that such a character might be made a powerful agent in fictitious narrative he accordingly sketched that of elshie of the mucklestanemoor the story was intended to be longer and the catastrophe more artificially brought out but a friendly critic to whose opinion i subjected the work in its progress was of opinion that the idea of the solitary was of a kind too revolting and more likely to disgust than to interest the reader as i had good right to consider my adviser as an excellent judge of public opinion i got off my subject by hastening the story to an end as fast as it was possible and by huddling into one volume a tale which was designed to occupy two have perhaps produced a narrative as much disproportioned and distorted as the black dwarf who is its subject     iii the black dwarf    chapter i  preliminary       hast any philosophy in thee shepherdas you like it  it was a fine april morning excepting that it had snowed hard the night before and the ground remained covered with a dazzling mantle of six inches in depth when two horsemen rode up to the wallace inn the first was a strong tall powerful man in a grey ridingcoat having a hat covered with waxcloth a huge silvermounted horsewhip boots and dreadnought overalls he was mounted on a large strong brown mare rough in coat but well in condition with a saddle of the yeomanry cut and a doublebitted military bridle the man who accompanied him was apparently his servant he rode a shaggy little grey pony had a blue bonnet on his head and a large check napkin folded about his neck wore a pair of long blue worsted hose instead of boots had his gloveless hands much stained with tar and observed an air of deference and respect towards his companion but without any of those indications of precedence and punctilio which are preserved between the gentry and their domestics on the contrary the two travellers entered the courtyard abreast and the concluding sentence of the conversation which had been carrying on betwixt them was a joint ejaculation lord guide us an this weather last what will come o the lambs the hint was sufficient for my landlord who advancing to take the horse of the principal person and holding him by the reins as he dismounted while his ostler rendered the same service to the attendant welcomed the stranger to gandercleugh and in the same breath enquired what news from the south hielands  news said the farmer bad eneugh news i thinkan we can carry through the yowes it will be a we can do we maun een leave the lambs to the black dwarfs care  ay ay subjoined the old shepherd for such he was shaking his head hell be unco busy amang the morts this season  the black dwarf said my learned friend and patron mr jedediah cleishbotham and what sort of a personage may he be  we have in this and other instances printed in italics capitals in this etext some few words which the worthy editor mr jedediah cleishbotham seems to have interpolated upon the text of his deceased friend mr pattieson we must observe once for all that such liberties seem only to have been taken by the learned gentleman where his own character and conduct are concerned and surely he must be the best judge of the style in which his own character and conduct should be treated of  hout awa man answered the farmer yell hae heard o canny elshie the black dwarf or i am muckle mistaena the warld tells tales about him but its but daft nonsense after ai dinna believe a word ot frae beginning to end  your father believed it unco stievely though said the old man

o us to be judging to be sure but it was a bonny knowe that broomy knowe and an unco braw shelter for the lambs in a severe morning like this  ay said his patron but ye ken we maun hae turnips for the

gate lang syne when the short sheep were in the fashion  aweel aweel maister said the attendant short sheep had short rents im thinking  here my worthy and learned patron again interposed and observed that he could never perceive any material difference in point of longitude between one sheep and another  this occasioned a loud hoarse laugh on the part of the farmer and an astonished stare on the part of the shepherd  its the woo manits the woo and no the beasts themsells that makes them be cad lang or short i believe if ye were to measure their backs the short sheep wad be rather the langerbodied o the twa but its the woo that pays the rent in thae days and it had muckle need  odd bauldie says very trueshort sheep did make short rentsmy father paid for our steading just threescore

fortunately settled without an appeal to the gentlemen of the long robe my learned and worthy patron failed not to attend both on account of the refreshment promised to the mind and to the body although he is known to partake of the latter in a very moderate degree and the party with which my landlord was associated continued to sit late in the evening seasoning their liquor with many choice tales and songs the last incident which i recollect was my learned and worthy patron falling from his chair just as he concluded a long lecture upon temperance by reciting from the gentle shepherd a couplet which he right happily transferred from the vice of avarice to that of ebriety       he that has just eneugh may soundly sleep      the owercome only fashes folk to keep  in the course of the evening the black dwarf had not been forgotten and the old shepherd bauldie told so many stories of him that they excited a good deal of interest it also appeared though not till the third punchbowl was emptied that much of the farmers scepticism on the subject was affected as evincing a liberality of thinking and a freedom from ancient prejudices becoming a man who paid three hundred pounds ayear of rent while in fact he had a lurking belief in the traditions of his forefathers after my usual manner i made farther enquiries of other persons connected with the wild and pastoral district in which the scene of the following narrative is placed and i was fortunate enough to recover many links of the story not generally known and which account at least in some degree for the circumstances of exaggerated marvel with which superstition has attired it in the more vulgar traditions  the black dwarf now almost forgotten was once held a formidable personage by the dalesmen of the border where he got the blame of whatever mischief befell the sheep or cattle he was says dr leyden who makes considerable use of him in the ballad called the cowt of keeldar a fairy of the most malignant orderthe genuine northern duergar the best and most authentic account of this dangerous and mysterious being occurs in a tale communicated to the author by that eminent antiquary richard surtees esq of mainsforth author of the history of the bishopric of durham  according to this wellattested legend two young northumbrians were out on a shooting party and had plunged deep among the mountainous moorlands which border on cumberland they stopped for refreshment in a little secluded dell by the side of a rivulet there after they had partaken of such food as they brought with them one of the party fell asleep the other unwilling to disturb his friends repose stole silently out of the dell with the purpose of looking around him when he was astonished to find himself close to a being who seemed not to belong to this world as he was the most hideous dwarf that the sun had ever shone on his head was of full human size forming a frightful contrast with his height which was considerably under four feet it was thatched with no other covering than long matted red hair like that of the felt of a badger in consistence and in colour a reddish brown like the hue of the heatherblossom his limbs seemed of great strength nor was he otherwise deformed than from their undue proportion in thickness to his diminutive height the terrified sportsman stood gazing on this horrible apparition until with an angry countenance the being demanded by what right he intruded himself on those hills and destroyed their harmless inhabitants the perplexed stranger endeavoured to propitiate the incensed dwarf by offering to surrender his game as he would to an earthly lord of the manor the proposal only redoubled the offence already taken by the dwarf who alleged that he was the lord of those mountains and the protector of the wild creatures who found a retreat in their solitary recesses and that all spoils derived from their death or misery were abhorrent to him the hunter humbled himself before the angry goblin and by protestations of his ignorance and of his resolution to abstain from such intrusion in future at last succeeded in pacifying him the gnome now became more communicative and spoke of himself as belonging to a species of beings something between the angelic race and humanity he added moreover which could hardly have been anticipated that he had hopes of sharing in the redemption of the race of adam he pressed the sportsman to visit his dwelling which he said was hard by and plighted his faith for his safe return but at this moment the shout of the sportsmans companion was heard calling for his friend and the dwarf as if unwilling that more than one person should be cognisant of his presence disappeared as the young man emerged from the dell to join his comrade  it was the universal opinion of those most experienced in such matters that if the shooter had accompanied the spirit he would notwithstanding the dwarfs fair pretences have been either torn to pieces or immured for years in the recesses of some fairy hill  such is the last and most authentic account of the apparition of the black dwarf    chapter ii       will none but hearne the hunter serve your turn      merry wives of windsor  in one of the most remote districts of the south of scotland where an ideal line drawn along the tops of lofty and bleak mountains separates that land from her sister kingdom a young man called halbert or hobbie elliot a substantial farmer who boasted his descent from old martin elliot of the preakintower noted in border story and song was on his return from deerstalking the deer once so numerous among these solitary wastes were now reduced to a very few herds which sheltering themselves in the most remote and inaccessible recesses rendered the task of pursuing them equally toilsome and precarious there were however found many youth of the country ardently attached to this sport with all its dangers and fatigues the sword had been sheathed upon the borders for more than a hundred years by the peaceful union of the crowns in the reign of james the first of great britain still the country retained traces of what it had been in former days the inhabitants their more peaceful avocations having been repeatedly interrupted by the civil wars of the preceding century were scarce yet broken in to the habits of regular industry sheepfarming had not been introduced upon any considerable scale and the feeding of black cattle was the chief purpose to which the hills and valleys were applied near to the farmers house the tenant usually contrived to raise such a crop of oats or barley as afforded meal for his family and the whole of this slovenly and imperfect mode of cultivation left much time upon his own hands and those of his domestics this was usually employed by the young men in hunting and fishing and the spirit of adventure which formerly led to raids and forays in the same districts was still to be discovered in the eagerness with which they pursued those rural sports  the more highspirited among the youth were about the time that our narrative begins expecting rather with hope than apprehension an opportunity of emulating their fathers in their military achievements the recital of which formed the chief part of their amusement within doors the passing of the scottish act of security had given the alarm of england as it seemed to point at a separation of the two british kingdoms after the decease of queen anne the reigning sovereign godolphin then at the head of the english administration foresaw that there was no other mode of avoiding the probable extremity of a civil war but by carrying through an incorporating union how that treaty was managed and how little it seemed for some time to promise the beneficial results which have since taken place to such extent may be learned from the history of the period it is enough for our purpose to say that all scotland was indignant at the terms on which their legislature had surrendered their national independence the general resentment led to the strangest leagues and to the wildest plans the cameronians were about to take arms for the restoration of the house of stewart whom they regarded with justice as their oppressors and the intrigues of the period presented the strange picture of papists prelatists and presbyterians caballing among themselves against the english government out of a common feeling that their country had been treated with injustice the fermentation was universal and as the population of scotland had been generally trained to arms under the act of security they were not indifferently prepared for war and waited but the declaration of some of the nobility to break out into open hostility it was at this period of public confusion that our story opens  the cleugh or wild ravine into which hobbie elliot had followed the game was already far behind him and he was considerably advanced on his return homeward when the night began to close upon him this would have been a circumstance of great indifference to the experienced sportsman who could have walked blindfold over every inch of his native heaths had it not happened near a spot which according to the traditions of the country was in extremely bad fame as haunted by supernatural appearances to tales of this kind hobbie had from his childhood lent an attentive ear and as no part of the country afforded such a variety of legends so no man was more deeply read in their fearful lore than hobbie of the heughfoot for so our gallant was called to distinguish him from a round dozen of elliots who bore the same christian name it cost him no efforts therefore to call to memory the terrific incidents connected with the extensive waste upon which he was now entering in fact they presented themselves with a readiness which he felt to be somewhat dismaying  this dreary common was called mucklestanemoor from a huge column of unhewn granite which raised its massy head on a knell near the centre of the heath perhaps to tell of the mighty dead who slept beneath or to preserve the memory of some bloody skirmish the real cause of its existence had however passed away and tradition which is as frequently an inventor of fiction as a preserver of truth had supplied its place with a supplementary legend of her own which now came full upon hobbies memory the ground about the pillar was strewed or rather encumbered with many large fragments of stone of the same consistence with the column which from their appearance as they lay scattered on the waste were popularly called the grey geese of mucklestanemoor the legend accounted for this name and appearance by the catastrophe of a noted and most formidable witch who frequented these hills in former days causing the ewes to keb and the kine to cast their calves and performing all the feats of mischief ascribed to these evil beings on this moor she used to hold her revels with her sister hags and rings were still pointed out on which no grass nor heath ever grew the turf being as it were calcined by the scorching hoofs of their diabolical partners  once upon a time this old hag is said to have crossed the moor driving before her a flock of geese which she proposed to sell to advantage at a neighbouring fairfor it is well known that the fiend however liberal in imparting his powers of doing mischief ungenerously leaves his allies under the necessity of performing the meanest rustic labours for subsistence the day was far advanced and her chance of obtaining a good price depended on her being first at the market but the geese which had hitherto preceded her in a pretty orderly manner when they came to this wide common interspersed with marshes and pools of water scattered in every direction to plunge into the element in which they delighted incensed at the obstinacy with which they defied all her efforts to collect them and not remembering the precise terms of the contract by which the fiend was bound to obey her commands for a certain space the sorceress exclaimed deevil that neither i nor they ever stir from this spot more the words were hardly uttered when by a metamorphosis as sudden as any in ovid the hag and her refractory flock were converted into stone the angel whom she served being a strict formalist grasping eagerly at an opportunity of completing the ruin of her body and soul by a literal obedience to her orders it is said that when she perceived and felt the transformation which was about to take place she exclaimed to the treacherous fiend ah thou false thief lang hast thou promised me a grey gown and now i am getting ane that will last for ever the dimensions of the pillar and of the stones were often appealed to as a proof of the superior stature and size of old women and geese in the days of other years by those praisers of the past who held the comfortable opinion of the gradual degeneracy of mankind  all particulars of this legend hobbie called to mind as he passed along the moor he also remembered that since the catastrophe had taken place the scene of it had been avoided at least after nightfall by all human beings as being the ordinary resort of kelpies spunkies and other demons once the companions of the witchs diabolical revels and now continuing to rendezvous upon the same spot as if still in attendance on their transformed mistress hobbies natural hardihood however manfully combated with these intrusive sensations of awe he summoned to his side the brace of large greyhounds who were the companions of his sports and who were wont in his own phrase to fear neither dog nor devil he looked at the priming of his piece and like the clown in halloween whistled up the warlike ditty of jock of the side as a general causes his drums be beat to inspirit the doubtful courage of his soldiers  in this state of mind he was very glad to hear a friendly voice shout in his rear and propose to him a partner on the road he slackened his pace and was quickly joined by a youth well known to him a gentleman of some fortune in that remote country and who had been abroad on the same errand with himself young earnscliff of that ilk had lately come of age and succeeded to a moderate fortune a good deal dilapidated from the share his family had taken in the disturbances of the period they were much and generally respected in the country a reputation which this young gentleman seemed likely to sustain as he was well educated and of excellent dispositions  now earnscliff exclaimed hobbie i am glad to meet your honour ony gate and companys blithe on a bare moor like thisits an unco bogilly bitwhere hae ye been sporting  up

his nailsand besides theres naebody else left that was concerned to take amends upon and hes a prelatist and a jacobite into the bargaini can tell ye the country folk look for something atween ye  o

beings may be listening to us  hush hush said hobbie drawing nearer to his companion i was nae thinking o the like o thembut i can guess a wee bit what keeps your hand up mr patrick we a ken its no lack o courage but the twa grey een of a bonny lass miss isabel vere that keeps you sae sober  i assure you hobbie said his companion rather angrily i assure you you are mistaken and it is extremely wrong of you either to think of or to utter such an idea i have no idea of permitting freedoms to be carried so far as to connect my name with that of any young lady  why there nowthere now retorted elliot did i not say it was nae want o spunk that made ye sae mimweel weel i meant nae offence but theres just ae thing ye may notice frae a friend the auld laird of ellieslaw has the auld riding blood far hetter at his heart than ye haetroth he kens naething about thae newfangled notions o peace and quietnesshes a for the auldwarld doings o lifting and laying on and he has a wheen stout lads

little davie of the stenhouse will be wi you wi a the power we can make in the snapping of a flint  many thanks hobbie answered earnscliff but i hope we shall have no war of so unnatural and unchristian a kind in our time  hout sir hout replied elliot it wad be but a wee bit neighbour war and heaven and earth would make allowances for it in this uncultivated placeits just the nature o the folk and the landwe canna live quiet like loudon folkwe haena sae muckle to do its impossible  well hobbie said the laird for one who believes so deeply as you do in supernatural appearances i must own you take heaven in your own hand rather audaciously considering where we are walking  what needs i care for the mucklestanemoor ony mair than ye do yoursell earnscliff said hobbie something offended to be sure they do say theres a sort o worricows and langnebbit things about the land but what need i care for them i hae a good conscience and little to answer for unless it be about a rant amang the lasses or a splore at a fair and thats no muckle to speak of though i say it mysell i am as quiet a lad and as peaceable  and dick turnbulls head that you broke and willie of winton whom you shot at said his travelling companion  hout earnscliff ye keep a record of a mens misdoingsdicks heads healed again and were to fight out the quarrel at jeddart on the roodday so thats like a thing settled in a peaceable way and then i am friends wi willie again puir chieldit was but twa or three hail draps after a i wad let onybody do the like ot to me for a pint o brandy but willies lowland bred poor fallow and soon frighted for himselland for the worricows were we to meet ane on this very bit  as is not unlikely said young earnscliff for there stands your old witch hobbie  i say continued elliot as if indignant at this hinti say if the auld carline hersell was to get up out o the grund just before us here i would think nae mairbut gude preserve us earnscliff what can yon be    chapter iii       brown dwarf that oer the moorland strays      thy name to keeldar tell      the brown man of the moor that stays      beneath the heatherbelljohn leyden  the object which alarmed the young farmer in the middle of his valorous protestations startled for a moment even his less prejudiced companion the moon which had arisen during their conversation was in the phrase of that country wading or struggling with clouds and shed only a doubtful and occasional light by one of her beams which streamed upon the great granite column to which they now approached they discovered a form apparently human but of a size much less than ordinary which moved slowly among the large grey stones not like a person intending to journey onward but with the slow irregular flitting movement of a being who hovers around some spot of melancholy recollection uttering also from time to time a sort of indistinct muttering sound this so much resembled his idea of the motions of an apparition that hobbie elliot making a dead pause while his hair erected itself upon his scalp whispered to his companion its auld ailie hersell shall i gie her a shot in the name of god  for heavens sake no said his companion holding down the weapon which he was about to raise to the aimfor heavens sake no its some poor distracted creature  yere distracted yoursell for thinking of going so near to her said elliot holding his companion in his turn as he prepared to advance well aye hae time to pit ower a bit prayer an i could but mind ane afore she comes this lengthgod shes in nae hurry continued he growing bolder from his companions confidence and the little notice the apparition seemed to take of them she hirples like a hen on a het girdle i redd ye earnscliff this he added in a gentle whisper let us take a cast about as if to draw the wind on a buckthe bog is no abune kneedeep and better a saft road as bad company the scots use the epithet soft in malam partem in two cases at least a soft road is a road through quagmire and bogs and soft weather signifies that which is very rainy  earnscliff however in spite of his companions resistance and remonstrances continued to advance on the path they had originally pursued and soon confronted the object of their investigation  the height of the figure which appeared even to decrease as they approached it seemed to be under four feet and its form as far as the imperfect light afforded them the means of discerning was very nearly as broad as long or rather of a spherical shape which could only be occasioned by some strange personal deformity the young sportsman hailed this extraordinary appearance twice without receiving any answer or attending to the pinches by which his companion endeavoured to intimate that their best course was to walk on without giving farther disturbance to a being of such singular and preternatural exterior to the third repeated demand of who are you what do you here at this hour of nighta voice replied whose shrill uncouth and dissonant tones made elliot step two paces back and startled even his companion pass on your way and ask nought at them that ask nought at you  what do you do here so far from shelter are you benighted on your journey will you follow us home god forbid ejaculated hobbie elliot involuntarily and i will give you a lodging  i would sooner lodge by mysell in the deepest of the tarrasflow again whispered hobbie  pass on your way rejoined the figure the harsh tones of his voice still more exalted by passion i want not your guidancei want not your lodgingit is five years since my head was under a human roof and i trust it was for the last time  he is mad said earnscliff  he has a look of auld humphrey ettercap the tinkler that perished in this very moss about five years syne answered his superstitious companion but humphrey wasna that awfu big in the bouk  pass on your way reiterated the object of their curiosity the breath of your human bodies poisons the air around methe sound of pour human voices goes through my ears like sharp bodkins  lord safe us whispered hobbie that the dead should bear sie fearfu illwill to the livinghis saul maun be in a puir way im jealous  come my friend said earnscliff you seem to suffer under some strong affliction common humanity will not allow us to leave you here  common humanity exclaimed the being with a scornful laugh that sounded like a shriek where got ye that catchwordthat noose for woodcocksthat common disguise for mantrapsthat bait which the wretched idiot who swallows will soon find covers a hook with barbs ten times sharper than those you lay for the animals which you murder for your luxury  i tell you my friend again replied earnscliff you are incapable of judging of your own situationyou will perish in this wilderness and we must in compassion force you along with us  ill hae neither hand nor foot int said hobbie let the ghaist take his ain way for gods sake  my blood be on my own head if i perish here said the figure and observing earnscliff meditating to lay hold on him he added and your blood be upon yours if you touch but the skirt of my garments to infect me with the taint of mortality  the moon shone more brightly as he spoke thus and earnscliff observed that he held out his right hand armed with some weapon of offence which glittered in the cold ray like the blade of a long knife or the barrel of a pistol it would have been madness to persevere in his attempt upon a being thus armed and holding such desperate language especially as it was plain he would have little aid from his companion who had fairly left him to settle matters with the apparition as he could and had proceeded a few paces on his way homeward earnscliff however turned and followed hobbie after looking back towards the supposed maniac who as if raised to frenzy by the interview roamed wildly around the great stone exhausting his voice in shrieks and imprecations that thrilled wildly along the waste heath  the two sportsmen moved on some time in silence until they were out of hearing of these uncouth sounds which was not ere they had gained a considerable distance from the pillar that gave name to the moor each made his private comments on the scene they had witnessed until hobbie elliot suddenly exclaimed weel ill uphaud that yon ghaist if it be a ghaist has baith done and suffered muckle evil in the flesh that gars him rampauge in that way after he is dead and gane  it seems to me the very madness of misanthropy said earnscliff following his own current of thought  and ye didna think it was a spiritual creature then asked hobbie at his companion  who ino surely  weel i am partly of the mind mysell that it may be a live thingand yet i dinna ken i wadna wish to see ony thing look liker a bogle  at any rate said earnscliff i will ride over tomorrow and see what has become of the unhappy being  in fair daylight queried the yeoman then grace o god ise be wi ye but here we are nearer to heughfoot than to your house by twa milehadna ye better een gae hame wi me and well send the callant on the powny to tell them that you are wi us though i believe theres naebody at hame to wait for you but the servants and the cat  have with you then friend hobbie said the young hunter and as i would not willingly have either the servants be anxious or puss forfeit her supper in my absence ill be obliged to you to send the boy as you propose  aweel that is kind i must say and yell gae hame to heughfoot theyll be right blithe to see you that will they  this affair settled they walked briskly on a little farther when coming to the ridge of a pretty steep hill hobbie elliot exclaimed now earnscliff i am aye glad when i come to this very bitye see the light below thats in the ha window where grannie the gash auld carline is sitting birling at her wheeland ye see yon other light thats gaun whiddin back and forrit through amang the windows thats my cousin grace armstrongshes twice as clever about the house as my sisters and sae they say themsells for theyre goodnatured lasses as ever trode on heather but they confess themsells and sae does grannie that she has far maist action and is the best goer about the toun now that grannie is off the foot hersellmy brothers ane o thems away to wait upon the chamberlain and anes at mossphadraig thats our led farmhe can see after the stock just as weel as i can do  you are lucky my good friend in having so many valuable relations  troth am igrace make me thankful ise never deny itbut will ye tell me now earnscliff you that have been at college and the highschool of edinburgh and got a sort o lair where it was to be best gottenwill ye tell meno that its ony concern of mine in particularbut i heard the priest of st johns and our minister bargaining about it at the winter fair and troth they baith spak very weelnow the priest says its unlawful to marry anes cousin but i cannot say i thought he brought out the gospel authorities half sae weel as our ministerour minister is thought the best divine and the best preacher atween this and edinburghdinna ye think he was likely to be right  certainly marriage by all protestant christians is held to be as free as god made it by the levitical law so hobbie there can be no bar legal or religious betwixt you and miss armstrong  hout awa wi your joking earnscliff replied his companionye are angry aneugh yoursell if ane touches you a bit man on the sooth side of the jestno that i was asking the question about grace for ye maun ken shes no my cousingermain out and out but the daughter of my uncles wife by her first marriage so shes nae kith nor kin to meonly a connexion like but now were at the sheelinghillill fire off my gun to let them ken im coming thats aye my way and if i hae a deer i gie them twa shots ane for the deer and ane for mysell  he fired off his piece accordingly and the number of lights were seen to traverse the house and even to gleam before it hobbie elliot pointed out one of these to earnscliff which seemed to glide from the house towards some of the outhousesthats grace hersell said hobbie shell no meet me at the door ise warrant herbut shell be awa for a that to see if my hounds supper be ready poor beasts  love me love my dog answered earnscliff ah hobbie you are a lucky young fellow  this observation was uttered with something like a sigh which apparently did not escape the ear of his companion  hout other folk may be as lucky as i amo how i have seen miss isabel veres head turn after somebody when they passed ane another at the carlisle races wha kens but things may come round in this world  earnscliff muttered something like an answer but whether in assent of the proposition or rebuking the application of it could not easily be discovered and it seems probable that the speaker himself was willing his meaning should rest in doubt and obscurity they had now descended the broad loaning which winding round the foot of the steep bank or heugh brought them in front of the thatched but comfortable farmhouse which was the dwelling of hobbie elliot and his family  the doorway was thronged with joyful faces but the appearance of a stranger blunted many a gibe which had been prepared on hobbies lack of success in the deerstalking there was a little bustle among three handsome young women each endeavouring to devolve upon another the task of ushering the stranger into the apartment while probably all were anxious to escape for the purpose of making some little personal arrangements before presenting themselves to a young gentleman in a dishabille only intended for their brother  hobbie in the meanwhile bestowing some hearty and general abuse upon them all for grace was not of the party snatched the candle from the hand of one of the rustic coquettes as she stood playing pretty with it in her hand and ushered his guest into the family parlour or rather hall for the place having been a house of defence in former times the sitting apartment was a vaulted and paved room damp and dismal enough compared with the lodgings of the yeomanry of our days but which when well lighted up with a large sparkling fire of turf and bogwood seemed to earnscliff a most comfortable exchange for the darkness and bleak blast of the hill kindly and repeatedly was he welcomed by the venerable old dame the mistress of the family who dressed in her coif and pinners her close and decent gown of homespun wool but with a large gold necklace and earrings looked what she really was the lady as well as the farmers wife while seated in her chair of wicker by the corner of the great chimney she directed the evening occupations of the young women and of two or three stout serving wenches who sate plying their distaffs behind the backs of their young mistresses  as soon as earnscliff had been duly welcomed and hasty orders issued for some addition to the evening meal his granddame and sisters opened their battery upon hobbie elliot for his lack of success against the deer  jenny needna have kept up her kitchenfire for a that hobbie has brought hame said one sister  troth no lass said another the gathering peat if it was weel blawn wad dress a our hobbies venison the gathering peat is the piece of turf left to treasure up the secret seeds of fire without any generous consumption of fuel in a word to keep the fire alive  ay or the low of the candle if the wind wad let it hide steady said a third if i were him i would bring hame a black craw rather than come back three times without a bucks horn to blaw on  hobbie turned from the one to the other regarding them alternately with a frown on his brow the augury of which was confuted by the goodhumoured laugh on the lower part of his countenance he then strove to propitiate them by mentioning the intended present of his companion  in my young days said the old lady a man wad hae been ashamed to come back frae the hill without a buck hanging on each side o his horse like a cadger carrying calves  i wish they had left some for us then grannie retorted hobbie theyve cleared the country o them thae auld friends o yours im thinking  we see other folk can find game though you cannot hobbie said the eldest sister glancing a look at young earnscliff  weel weel woman hasna every dog his day begging earnscliffs pardon for the auld sayingmayna i hae his luck and he mine another timeits a braw thing for a man to be out a day and frightedna i winna say that neither but mistrysted wi bogles in the

exclaimed the females one and allfor great was the regard then paid and perhaps still paid in these glens to all such fantasies  i did not say frighted nowi only said misset wi the thingand there was but ae bogle neitherearnscliff ye saw it as weel as i did  and he proceeded without very much exaggeration to detail in his own way the meeting they had with the mysterious being at mucklestanemoor concluding he could not conjecture what on earth it could be unless it was either the enemy himsell or some of the auld peghts that held the country lang syne  auld peght exclaimed the granddame na nabless thee frae scathe my bairn its been nae peght thatits been the brown man of the moors o weary fa thae evil dayswhat can evil beings be coming for to distract a poor country now its peacefully settled and living in love and lawo weary on him he neer brought gude to these lands or the indwellers my father aften tauld me he was seen in the year o the bloody fight at marstonmoor and then again in montroses troubles and again before the rout o dunbar and in my ain time he was seen about the time o bothwellbrigg and they said the secondsighted laird of benarbuck had a communing wi him some time afore argyles landing but that i cannot speak to sae preceeselyit was far in the westo bairns hes never permitted but in an ill time sae mind ilka ane o ye to draw to him that can help in the day of trouble  earnscliff now interposed and expressed his firm conviction that the person they had seen was some poor maniac and had no commission from the invisible world to announce either war or evil but his opinion found a very cold audience and all joined to deprecate his purpose of returning to the spot the next day  o my bonny bairn said the old dame for in the kindness of her heart she extended her parental style to all in whom she was interestedyou should beware mair than other folktheres been a heavy breach made in your house wi your fathers bloodshed and wi lawpleas and losses sinsyneand you are the flower of the flock and the lad that will build up the auld bigging again if it be his will to be an honour to the country and a safeguard to those that dwell in ityou before others are called upon to put yoursell in no rash adventuresfor yours was aye ower venturesome a race and muckle harm they have got by it  but i am sure my good friend you would not have me be afraid of going to an open moor in broad daylight  i dinna ken said the good old dame i wad never bid son or friend o mine haud their hand back in a gude cause whether it were a friends or their ainthat should be by nae bidding of mine or of ony body thats come of a gentle kindredbut it winna gang out of a grey head like mine that to gang to seek for evil thats no fashing wi you is clean against law and scripture  earnscliff resigned an argument which he saw no prospect of maintaining with good effect and the entrance of supper broke off the conversation miss grace had by this time made her appearance and hobbie not without a conscious glance at earnscliff placed himself by her side mirth and lively conversation in which the old lady of the house took the goodhumoured share which so well becomes old age restored to the cheeks of the damsels the roses which their brothers tale of the apparition had chased away and they danced and sung for an hour after supper as if there were no such things as goblins in the world    chapter iv       i am misanthropos and hate mankind      for thy part i do wish thou wert a dog      that i might love thee somethingtimon of athens  on the following morning after breakfast earnscliff took leave of his hospitable friends promising to return in time to partake of the venison which had arrived from his house hobbie who apparently took leave of him at the door of his habitation slunk out however and joined him at the top of the hill  yell be gaun yonder mr patrick feind o me will mistryst you for a my mother says i thought it best to slip out quietly though in case she should mislippen something of what were gaun to dowe maunna vex her at nae rateit was amaist the last word my father said to me on his deathbed  by no means hobbie said earnscliff she well merits all your attention  troth for that matter she would be as sair vexed amaist for you as for me but dye really think theres nae presumption in venturing back yonderwe hae nae special commission ye ken  if i thought as you do hobbie said the young gentleman i would not perhaps enquire farther into this business but as i am of opinion that preternatural visitations are either ceased altogether or become very rare in our days i am unwilling to leave a matter uninvestigated which may concern the life of a poor distracted being  aweel aweel if ye really think that answered hobbie doubtfullyand its for certain the very fairiesi mean the very good neighbours themsells for they say folk suldna ca them fairies that used to be seen on every green knowe at een are no half sae often visible in our days i canna depone to having ever seen ane mysell but i ance heard ane whistle ahint me in the moss as like a whaup curlew as ae thing could be like anither and mony ane my father saw when he used to come hame frae the fairs at een wi a drap drink in his head honest man  earnscliff was somewhat entertained with the gradual declension of superstition from one generation to another which was inferred in this last observation and they continued to reason on such subjects until they came in sight of the upright stone which gave name to the moor  as i shall answer says hobbie yonders the creature creeping about yetbut its daylight and you have your gun and i brought out my bit whingeri think we may venture on him  by all manner of means said earnscliff but in the name of wonder what can he be doing there  biggin a drystane dyke i think wi the grey geese as they ca thae great loose stanesodd that passes a thing i eer heard tell of  as they approached nearer earnscliff could not help agreeing with his companion the figure they had seen the night before seemed slowly and toilsomely labouring to pile the large stones one upon another as if to form a small enclosure materials lay around him in great plenty but the labour of carrying on the work was immense from the size of most of the stones and it seemed astonishing that he should have succeeded in moving several which he had already arranged for the foundation of his edifice he was struggling to move a fragment of great size when the two young men came up and was so intent upon executing his purpose that he did not perceive them till they were close upon him in straining and heaving at the stone in order to place it according to his wish he displayed a degree of strength which seemed utterly inconsistent with his size and apparent deformity indeed to judge from the difficulties he had already surmounted he must have been of herculean powers for some of the stones he had succeeded in raising apparently required two mens strength to have moved them hobbies suspicions began to revive on seeing the preternatural strength he exerted  i am amaist persuaded its the ghaist of a stanemasonsee siccan bandstatnes as hes laid ian it be a man after a i wonder what he wad take by the rood to build a march dyke theres ane sair wanted between cringlehope and the shawshonest man raising his voice ye make good firm wark there  the being whom he addressed raised his eyes with a ghastly stare and getting up from his stooping posture stood before them in all his native and hideous deformity his head was of uncommon size covered with a fell of shaggy hair partly grizzled with age his eyebrows shaggy and prominent overhung a pair of small dark piercing eyes set far back in their sockets that rolled with a portentous wildness indicative of a partial insanity the rest of his features were of the coarse roughhewn stamp with which a painter would equip a giant in romance to which was added the wild irregular and peculiar expression so often seen in the countenances of those whose persons are deformed his body thick and square like that of a man of middle size was mounted upon two large feet but nature seemed to have forgotten the legs and the thighs or they were so very short as to be hidden by the dress which he wore his arms were long and brawny furnished with two muscular hands and where uncovered in the eagerness of his labour were shagged with coarse black hair it seemed as if nature had originally intended the separate parts of his body to be the members of a giant but had afterwards capriciously assigned them to the person of a dwarf so ill did the length of his arms and the iron strength of his frame correspond with the shortness of his stature his clothing was a sort of coarse brown tunic like a monks frock girt round him with a belt of sealskin on his head he had a cap made of badgers skin or some other rough fur which added considerably to the grotesque effect of his whole appearance and overshadowed features whose habitual expression seemed that of sullen malignant misanthropy  this remarkable dwarf gazed on the two youths in silence with a dogged and irritated look until earnscliff willing to soothe him into better temper observed you are hard tasked my friend allow us to assist you  elliot and he accordingly placed the stone by their joint efforts upon the rising wall the dwarf watched them with the eye of a taskmaster and testified by peevish gestures his impatience at the time which they took in adjusting the stone he pointed to anotherthey raised it alsoto a third to a fourththey continued to humour him though with some trouble for he assigned them as if intentionally the heaviest fragments which lay near  and now friend said elliot as the unreasonable dwarf indicated another stone larger than any they had moved earnscliff may do as he likes but be ye man or be ye waur deil be in my fingers if i break my back wi heaving thae stanes ony langer like a barrowman without getting sae muckle as thanks for my pains  thanks exclaimed the dwarf with a motion expressive of the utmost contempttheretake them and fatten upon them take them and may they thrive with you as they have done with meas they have done with every mortal worm that ever heard the word spoken by his fellow reptile henceeither labour or begone  this is a fine reward we have earnscliff for building a tabernacle for the devil and prejudicing our ain souls into the bargain for what we ken  our presence answered earnscliff seems only to irritate his frenzy we had better leave him and send some one to provide him with food and necessaries  they did so the servant dispatched for this purpose found the dwarf still labouring at his wall but could not extract a word from him the lad infected with the superstitions of the country did not long persist in an attempt to intrude questions or advice on so singular a figure but having placed the articles which he had brought for his use on a stone at some distance he left them at the misanthropes disposal  the dwarf proceeded in his labours day after day with an assiduity so incredible as to appear almost supernatural in one day he often seemed to have done the work of two men and his building soon assumed the appearance of the walls of a hut which though very small and constructed only of stones and turf without any mortar exhibited from the unusual size of the stones employed an appearance of solidity very uncommon for a cottage of such narrow dimensions and rude construction earnscliff attentive to his motions no sooner perceived to what they tended than he sent down a number of spars of wood suitable for forming the roof which he caused to be left in the neighbourhood of the spot resolving next day to send workmen to put them up but his purpose was anticipated for in the evening during the night and early in the morning the dwarf had laboured so hard and with such ingenuity that he had nearly completed the adjustment of the rafters his next labour was to cut rushes and thatch his dwelling a task which he performed with singular dexterity  as he seemed averse to receive any aid beyond the occasional assistance of a passenger materials suitable to his purpose and tools were supplied to him in the use of which he proved to be skilful he constructed the door and window of his cot he adjusted a rude bedstead and a few shelves and appeared to become somewhat soothed in his temper as his accommodations increased  his next task was to form a strong enclosure and to cultivate the land within it to the best of his power until by transporting mould and working up what was upon the spot he formed a patch of gardenground it must be naturally supposed that as above hinted this solitary being received assistance occasionally from such travellers as crossed the moor by chance as well as from several who went from curiosity to visit his works it was indeed impossible to see a human creature so unfitted at first sight for hard labour toiling with such unremitting assiduity without stopping a few minutes to aid him in his task and as no one of his occasional assistants was acquainted with the degree of help which the dwarf had received from others the celerity of his progress lost none of its marvels in their eyes the strong and compact appearance of the cottage formed in so very short a space and by such a being and the superior skill which he displayed in mechanics and in other arts gave suspicion to the surrounding neighbours they insisted that if he was not a phantoman opinion which was now abandoned since he plainly appeared a being of blood and bone with themselvesyet he must be in close league with the invisible world and have chosen that sequestered spot to carry on his communication with them undisturbed they insisted though in a different sense from the philosophers application of the phrase that he was never less alone than when alone and that from the heights which commanded the moor at a distance passengers often discovered a person at work along with this dweller of the desert who regularly disappeared as soon as they approached closer to the cottage such a figure was also occasionally seen sitting beside him at the door walking with him in the moor or assisting him in fetching water from his fountain earnscliff explained this phenomenon by supposing it to be the dwarfs shadow  deil a shadow has he replied hobbie elliot who was a strenuous defender of the general opinion hes ower far in wi the auld ane to have a shadow besides he argued more logically wha ever heard of a shadow that cam between a body and the sun and this thing be it what it will is thinner and taller than the body himsell and has been seen to come between him and the sun mair than anes or twice either  these suspicions which in any other part of the country might have been attended with investigations a little inconvenient to the supposed wizard were here only productive of respect and awe the recluse being seemed somewhat gratified by the marks of timid veneration with which an occasional passenger approached his dwelling the look of startled surprise with which he surveyed his person and his premises and the hurried step with which he pressed his retreat as he passed the awful spot the boldest only stopped to gratify their curiosity by a hasty glance at the walls of his cottage and garden and to apologize for it by a courteous salutation which the inmate sometimes deigned to return by a word or a nod earnscliff often passed that way and seldom without enquiring after the solitary inmate who seemed now to have arranged his establishment for life  it was impossible to engage him in any conversation on his own personal affairs nor was he communicative or accessible in talking on any other subject whatever although he seemed to have considerably relented in the extreme ferocity of his misanthropy or rather to be less frequently visited with the fits of derangement of which this was a symptom no argument could prevail upon him to accept anything beyond the simplest necessaries although much more was offered by earnscliff out of charity and by his more superstitious neighbours from other motives the benefits of these last he repaid by advice when consulted as at length he slowly was on their diseases or those of their cattle he often furnished them with medicines also and seemed possessed not only of such as were the produce of the country but of foreign drugs he gave these persons to understand that his name was elshender the recluse but his popular epithet soon came to be canny elshie or the wise wight of mucklestanemoor some extended their queries beyond their bodily complaints and requested advice upon other matters which he delivered with an oracular shrewdness that greatly confirmed the opinion of his possessing preternatural skill the querists usually left some offering upon a stone at a distance from his dwelling if it was money or any article which did not suit him to accept he either threw it away or suffered it to remain where it was without making use of it on all occasions his manners were rude and unsocial and his words in number just sufficient to express his meaning as briefly as possible and he shunned all communication that went a syllable beyond the matter in hand when winter had passed away and his garden began to afford him herbs and vegetables he confined himself almost entirely to those articles of food he accepted notwithstanding a pair of shegoats from earnscliff which fed on the moor and supplied him with milk  when earnscliff found his gift had been received he soon afterwards paid the hermit a visit the old man was seated an a broad flat stone near his garden door which was the seat of science he usually occupied when disposed to receive his patients or clients the inside of his hut and that of his garden he kept as sacred from human intrusion as the natives of otaheite do their moraiapparently he would have deemed it polluted by the step of any human being when he shut himself up in his habitation no entreaty could prevail upon him to make himself visible or to give audience to any one whomsoever  earnscliff had been fishing in a small river at some distance he had his rod in his hand and his basket filled with trout at his shoulder he sate down upon a stone nearly opposite to the dwarf who familiarized with his presence took no farther notice of him than by elevating his huge misshapen head for the purpose of staring at him and then again sinking it upon his bosom as if in profound meditation earnscliff looked around him and observed that the hermit had increased his accommodations by the construction of a shed for the reception of his goats  you labour hard elshie he said willing to lead this singular being into conversation  labour reechoed the dwarf is the mildest evil of a lot so miserable as that of mankind better to labour like me than sport like you  i cannot defend the humanity of our ordinary rural sports elshie and yet  and yet interrupted the dwarf they are better than your ordinary business better to exercise idle and wanton cruelty on mute fishes than on your fellowcreatures yet why should i say so why should not the whole human herd butt gore and gorge upon each other till all are extirpated but one huge and overfed behemoth and he when he had throttled and gnawed the bones of all his fellowshe when his prey failed him to be roaring whole days for lack of food and finally to die inch by inch of famineit were a consummation worthy of the race  your deeds are better elshie than your words answered earnscliff you labour to preserve the race whom your misanthropy slanders  i do but whyhearken you are one on whom i look with the least loathing and i care not if contrary to my wont i waste a few words in compassion to your infatuated blindness if i cannot send disease into families and murrain among the herds can i attain the same end so well as by prolonging the lives of those who can serve the purpose of destruction as effectuallyif alice of bower had died in winter would young ruthwin have been slain for her love the last springwho thought of penning their cattle beneath the tower when the red reiver of westburnflat was deemed to be on his deathbedmy draughts my skill recovered him and now who dare leave his herd upon the lea without a watch or go to bed without unchaining the sleuthhound  i own answered earnscliff you did little good to society by the last of these cures but to balance the evil there is my friend hobbie honest hobbie of the heughfoot your skill relieved him last winter in a fever that might have cost him his life  thus think the children of clay in their ignorance said the dwarf smiling maliciously and thus they speak in their folly have you marked the young cub of a wild cat that has been domesticated how sportive how playful how gentlebut trust him with your game your lambs your poultry his inbred ferocity breaks forth he gripes tears ravages and devours  such is the animals instinct answered earnscliff but what has that to do with hobbie  it is his emblemit is his picture retorted the recluse he is at present tame quiet and domesticated for lack of opportunity to exercise his inborn propensities but let the trumpet of war soundlet the young bloodhound snuff blood he will be as ferocious as the wildest of his border ancestors that ever fired a helpless peasants abode can you deny that even at present he often urges you to take bloody revenge for an injury received when you were a boyearnscliff started the recluse appeared not to observe his surprise and proceededthe trumpet will blow the young bloodhound will lap blood and i will laugh and say for this i have preserved thee he paused and continuedsuch are my curestheir object their purpose perpetuating the mass of misery and playing even in this desert my part in the general tragedy were you on your sick bed i might in compassion send you a cup of poison  i am much obliged to you elshie and certainly shall not fail to consult you with so comfortable a hope from your assistance  do not flatter yourself too far replied the hermit with the hope that i will positively yield to the frailty of pity why should i snatch a dupe so well fitted to endure the miseries of life as you are from the wretchedness which his own visions and the villainy of the world are preparing for him why should i play the compassionate indian and knocking out the brains of the captive with my tomahawk at once spoil the three days amusement of my kindred tribe at the very moment when the brands were lighted the pincers heated the cauldrons boiling the knives sharpened to tear scorch seethe and scarify the intended victim  a dreadful picture you present to me of life elshie but i am not daunted by it returned earnscliff we are sent here in one sense to bear and to suffer but in another to do and to enjoy the active day has its evening of repose even patient sufferance has its alleviations where there is a consolatory sense of duty discharged  i spurn at the slavish and bestial doctrine said the dwarf his eyes kindling with insane furyi spurn at it as worthy only of the beasts that perish but i will waste no more words with you  he rose hastily but ere he withdrew into the hut he added with great vehemence yet lest you still think my apparent benefits to mankind flow from the stupid and servile source called love of our fellowcreatures know that were there a man who had annihilated my souls dearest hopewho had torn my heart to mammocks and seared my brain till it glowed like a volcano and were that mans fortune and life in my power as completely as this frail potsherd he snatched up an earthen cup which stood beside him i would not dash him into atoms thushe flung the vessel with fury against the wallno he spoke more composedly but with the utmost bitterness i would pamper him with wealth and power to inflame his evil passions and to fulfil his evil designs he should lack no means of vice and villainy he should be the centre of a whirlpool that itself should know neither rest nor peace but boil with unceasing fury while it wrecked every goodly ship that approached its limits he should be an earthquake capable of shaking the very land in which he dwelt and rendering all its inhabitants friendless outcast and miserableas i am  the wretched being rushed into his hut as he uttered these last words shutting the door with furious violence and rapidly drawing two bolts one after another as if to exclude the intrusion of any one of that hated race who had thus lashed his soul to frenzy earnscliff left the moor with mingled sensations of pity and horror pondering what strange and melancholy cause could have reduced to so miserable a state of mind a man whose language argued him to be of rank and education much superior to the vulgar he was also surprised to see how much particular information a person who had lived in that country so short a time and in so recluse a manner had been able to collect respecting the dispositions and private affairs of the inhabitants  it is no wonder he said to himself that with such extent of information such a mode of life so uncouth a figure and sentiments so virulently misanthropic this unfortunate should be regarded by the vulgar as in league with the enemy of mankind    chapter v       the bleakest rock upon the loneliest heath      feels in its barrenness some touch of spring      and in the april dew or beam of may      its moss and lichen freshen and revive      and thus the heart most seard to human pleasure      melts at the tear joys in the smile of womanbeaumont  as the season advanced the weather became more genial and the recluse was more frequently found occupying the broad flat stone in the front of his mansion as he sate there one day about the hour of noon a party of gentlemen and ladies well mounted and numerously attended swept across the heath at some distance from his dwelling dogs hawks and ledhorses swelled the retinue and the air resounded at intervals with the cheer of the hunters and the sound of horns blown by the attendants the recluse was about to retire into his mansion at the sight of a train so joyous when three young ladies with their attendants who had made a circuit and detached themselves from their party in order to gratify their curiosity by a sight of the wise wight of mucklestanemoor came suddenly up ere he could effect his purpose the first shrieked and put her hands before her eyes at sight of an object so unusually deformed the second with a hysterical giggle which she intended should disguise her terrors asked the recluse whether he could tell their fortune the third who was best mounted best dressed and incomparably the bestlooking of the three advanced as if to cover the incivility of her companions  we have lost the right path that leads through these morasses and our party have gone forward without us said the young lady seeing you father at the door of your house we have turned this way to  hush interrupted the dwarf so young and already so artful you cameyou know you came to exult in the consciousness of your own youth wealth and beauty by contrasting them with age poverty and deformity it is a fit employment for the daughter of your father but o how unlike the child of your mother  did you then know my parents and do you know me  yes this is the first time you have crossed my waking eyes but i have seen you in my dreams  your dreams  ay isabel vere what hast thou or thine to do with my waking thoughts  your waking thoughts sir said the second of miss veres companions with a sort of mock gravity are fixed doubtless upon wisdom folly can only intrude on your sleeping moments  over thine retorted the dwarf more splenetically than became a philosopher or hermit folly exercises an unlimited empire asleep or awake  lord bless us said the lady hes a prophet sure enough  as surely continued the recluse as thou art a womana womani should have said a ladya fine lady you asked me to tell your fortuneit is a simple one an endless chase through life after follies not worth catching and when caught successively thrown awaya chase pursued from the days of tottering infancy to those of old age upon his crutches toys and merrymakings in childhoodlove and its absurdities in youthspadille and basto in age shall succeed each other as objects of pursuitflowers and butterflies in springbutterflies and thistledown in summerwithered leaves in autumn and winterall pursued all caught all flung asidestand apart your fortune is said  all caught however retorted the laughing fair one who was a cousin of miss veres thats something nancy she continued turning to the timid damsel who had first approached the dwarf will you ask your fortune  not for worlds said she drawing back i have heard enough of yours  well then said miss ilderton offering money to the dwarf ill pay for mine as if it were spoken by an oracle to a princess  truth said the soothsayer can neither be bought nor sold and he pushed back her proffered offering with morose disdain  well then said the lady ill keep my money mr elshender to assist me in the chase i am to pursue  you will need it replied the cynic without it few pursue successfully and fewer are themselves pursuedstop he said to miss vere as her companions moved off with you i have more to say you have what your companions would wish to have or be thought to havebeauty wealth station accomplishments  forgive my following my companions father i am proof both to flattery and fortunetelling  stay continued the dwarf with his hand on her horses rein i am no common soothsayer and i am no flatterer all the advantages i have detailed all and each of them have their corresponding evilsunsuccessful love crossed affections the gloom of a convent or an odious alliance i who wish ill to all mankind cannot wish more evil to you so much is your course of life crossed by it  and if it be father let me enjoy the readiest solace of adversity while prosperity is in my power you are old you are poor your habitation is far from human aid were you ill or in want your situation in many respects exposes you to the suspicions of the vulgar which are too apt to break out into actions of brutality let me think i have mended the lot of one human being accept of such assistance as i have power to offer do this for my sake if not for your own that when these evils arise which you prophesy perhaps too truly i may not have to reflect that the hours of my happier time have been passed altogether in vain  the old man answered with a broken voice and almost without addressing himself to the young lady  yes tis thus thou shouldst thinktis thus thou shouldst speak if ever human speech and thought kept touch with each other they do notthey do notalas they cannot and yetwait here an instantstir not till my return he went to his little garden and returned with a halfblown rose thou hast made me shed a tear the first which has wet my eyelids for many a year for that good deed receive this token of gratitude it is but a common rose preserve it however and do not part with it come to me in your hour of adversity show me that rose or but one leaf of it were it withered as my heart isif it should be in my fiercest and wildest movements of rage against a hateful world still it will recall gentler thoughts to my bosom and perhaps afford happier prospects to thine but no message he exclaimed rising into his usual mood of misanthropyno messageno gobetween come thyself and the heart and the doors that are shut against every other earthly being shall open to thee and to thy sorrows and now pass on  he let go the bridlerein and the young lady rode on after expressing her thanks to this singular being as well as her surprise at the extraordinary nature of his address would permit often turning back to look at the dwarf who still remained at the door of his habitation and watched her progress over the moor towards her fathers castle of ellieslaw until the brow of the hill hid the party from his sight  the ladies meantime jested with miss vere on the strange interview they had just had with the farfamed wizard of the moor isabella has all the luck at home and abroad her hawk strikes down the blackcock her eyes wound the gallant no chance for her poor companions and kinswomen even the conjuror cannot escape the force of her charms you should in compassion cease to be such an engrosser my dear isabel or at least set up shop and sell off all the goods you do not mean to keep for your own use  you shall have them all replied miss vere and the conjuror to boot at a very easy rate  no nancy shall have the conjuror said miss ilderton to supply deficiencies shes not quite a witch herself you know  lord sister answered the younger miss ilderton what could i do with so frightful a monster i kept my eyes shut after once glancing at him and i protest i thought i saw him still though i winked as close as ever i could  thats a pity said her sister ever while you live nancy choose an admirer whose faults can be hid by winking at themwell then i must take him myself i suppose and put him into mammas japan cabinet in order to show that scotland can produce a specimen of mortal clay moulded into a form ten thousand times uglier than the imaginations of canton and pekin fertile as they are in monsters have immortalized in porcelain  there is something said miss vere so melancholy in the situation of this poor man that i cannot enter into your mirth lucy so readily as usual if he has no resources how is he to exist in this waste country living as he does at such a distance from mankind and if he has the means of securing occasional assistance will not the very suspicion that he is possessed of them expose him to plunder and assassination by some of our unsettled neighbours  but you forget that they say he is a warlock said nancy ilderton  and if his magic diabolical should fail him rejoined her sister i would have him trust to his magic natural and thrust his enormous head and most preternatural visage out at his door or window full in view of the assailants the boldest robber that ever rode would hardly bide a second glance of him well i wish i had the use of that gorgon head of his for only one half hour  for what purpose lucy said miss vere  o i would frighten out of the castle that dark stiff and stately sir frederick langley that is so great a favourite with your father and so little a favourite of yours i protest i shall be obliged to the wizard as long as i live if it were only for the half hours relief from that mans company which we have gained by deviating from the party to visit elshie  what would you say then said miss vere in a low tone so as not to be heard by the younger sister who rode before them the narrow path not admitting of their moving all three abreastwhat would you say my dearest lucy if it were proposed to you to endure his company for life  say i would say no no no three times each louder than another till they should hear me at carlisle  and sir frederick would say then nineteen naysays are half a grant  that replied miss lucy depends entirely on the manner in which the naysays are said mine should have not one grain of concession in them i promise you  but if your father said miss vere were to saythus do or  i would stand to the consequences of his or were he the most cruel father that ever was recorded in romance to fill up the alternative  and what if he threatened you with a catholic aunt an abbess and a cloister  then said miss ilderton i would threaten him with a protestant soninlaw and be glad of an opportunity to disobey him for conscience sake and now that nancy is out of hearing let me really say i think you would be excusable before god and man for resisting this preposterous match by every means in your power a proud dark ambitious man a caballer against the state infamous for his avarice and severity a bad son a bad brother unkind and ungenerous to all his relativesisabel i would die rather than have him  dont let my father hear you give me such advice said miss vere or adieu my dear lucy to ellieslaw castle  and adieu to ellieslaw castle with all my heart said her friend if i once saw you fairly out of it and settled under some kinder protector than he whom nature has given you o if my poor father had been in his former health how gladly would he have received and sheltered you till this ridiculous and cruel persecution were blown over  would to god it had been so my dear lucy answered isabella but i fear that in your fathers weak state of health he would be altogether unable to protect me against the means which would be immediately used for reclaiming the poor fugitive  i fear so indeed replied miss ilderton but we will consider and devise something now that your father and his guests seem so deeply engaged in some mysterious plot to judge from the passing and returning of messages from the strange faces which appear and disappear without being announced by their names from the collecting and cleaning of arms and the anxious gloom and bustle which seem to agitate every male in the castle it may not be impossible for us always in case matters be driven to extremity to shape out some little supplemental conspiracy of our own i hope the gentlemen have not kept all the policy to themselves and there is one associate that i would gladly admit to our counsel  not nancy  o no said miss ilderton nancy though an excellent good girl and fondly attached to you would make a dull conspiratoras dull as renault and all the other subordinate plotters in venice preserved no this is a jaffier or pierre if you like the character better and yet though i know i shall please you i am afraid to mention his name to you lest i vex you at the same time can you not guess something about an eagle and a rockit does not begin with eagle in english but something very like it in scotch  you cannot mean young earnscliff lucy said miss vere blushing deeply  and whom else should i mean said lucy jaffiers and pierres are very scarce in this country i take it though one could find renaults and bedamars enow  how call you talk so wildly lucy your plays and romances have positively turned your brain you know that independent of my fathers consent without which i never will marry any one and which in the case you point at would never be granted independent too of our knowing nothing of young earnscliffs inclinations but by your own vivid conjectures and fanciesbesides all this there is the fatal brawl  when his father was killed said lucy but that was very long ago and i hope we have outlived the time of bloody feud when a quarrel was carried down between two families from father to son like a spanish game at chess and a murder or two committed in every generation just to keep the matter from going to sleep we do with our quarrels nowadays as with our clothes cut them out for ourselves and wear them out in our own day and should no more think of resenting our fathers feuds than of wearing their slashed doublets and trunkhose  you treat this far too lightly lucy answered miss vere  not a bit my dear isabella said lucy consider your father though present in the unhappy affray is never supposed to have struck the fatal blow besides in former times in case of mutual slaughter between clans subsequent alliances were so far from being excluded that the hand of a daughter or a sister was the most frequent gage of reconciliation you laugh at my skill in romance but i assure you should your history be written like that of many a less distressed and less deserving heroine the welljudging reader would set you down for the lady and the love of earnscliff from the very obstacle which you suppose so insurmountable  but these are not the days of romance but of sad reality for there stands the castle of ellieslaw  and there stands sir frederick langley at the gate waiting to assist the ladies from their palfreys i would as lief touch a toad i will disappoint him and take old horsington the groom for my master of the horse  so saying the lively young lady switched her palfrey forward and passing sir frederick with a familiar nod as he stood ready to take her horses rein she cantered on and jumped into the arms of the old groom fain would isabella have done the same had she dared but her father stood near displeasure already darkening on a countenance peculiarly qualified to express the harsher passions and she was compelled to receive the unwelcome assiduities of her detested suitor    chapter vi       let not us that are squires of the nights body be called      thieves of the days booty let us be dianas foresters      gentlemen of the shade minions of the moon      henry the fourth part i  the solitary had consumed the remainder of that day in which he had the interview with the young ladies within the precincts of his garden evening again found him seated on his favourite stone the sun setting red and among seas of rolling clouds threw a gloomy lustre over the moor and gave a deeper purple to the broad outline of heathy mountains which surrounded this desolate spot the dwarf sate watching the clouds as they lowered above each other in masses of conglomerated vapours and as a strong lurid beam of the sinking luminary darted full on his solitary and uncouth figure he might well have seemed the demon of the storm which was gathering or some gnome summoned forth from the recesses of the earth by the subterranean signals of its approach as he sate thus with his dark eye turned towards the scowling and blackening heaven a horseman rode rapidly up to him and stopping as if to let his horse breathe for an instant made a sort of obeisance to the anchoret with an air betwixt effrontery and embarrassment  the figure of the rider was thin tall and slender but remarkably athletic bony and sinewy like one who had all his life followed those violent exercises which prevent the human form from increasing in bulk while they harden and confirm by habit its muscular powers his face sharpfeatured sunburnt and freckled had a sinister expression of violence impudence and cunning each of which seemed alternately to predominate over the others sandycoloured hair and reddish eyebrows from under which looked forth his sharp grey eyes completed the inauspicious outline of the horsemans physiognomy he had pistols in his holsters and another pair peeped from his belt though he had taken some pains to conceal them by buttoning his doublet he wore a rusted steel head piece a buff jacket of rather an antique cast gloves of which that for the right hand was covered with small scales of iron like an ancient gauntlet and a long broadsword completed his equipage  so said the dwarf rapine and murder once more on horseback  on horseback said the bandit ay ay elshie your leechcraft has set me on the bonny bay again  and all those promises of amendment which you made during your illness forgotten continued elshender  all clear away with the watersaps and panada returned the unabashed convalescent ye ken elshie for they say ye are weel acquent wi the gentleman       when the devil was sick the devil a monk would be      when the devil was well the devil a monk was he  thou sayst true said the solitary as well divide a wolf from his appetite for carnage or a raven from her scent of slaughter as thee from thy accursed propensities  why what would you have me to do its born with melies in my very blude and bane why man the lads of westburnflat for ten lang descents have been reivers and lifters they have all drunk hard lived high taking deep revenge for light offence and never wanted gear for the winning  right and thou art as thoroughbred a wolf said the dwarf as ever leapt a lambfold at night on what hells errand art thou bound now  can your skill not guess  thus far i know said the dwarf that thy purpose is bad thy deed will be worse and the issue worst of all  and you like me the better for it father elshie eh said westburnflat you always said you did  i have cause to like all answered the solitary that are scourges to their fellowcreatures and thou art a bloody one  noi say not guilty to thatlever bluidy unless theres resistance and that sets a mans bristles up ye ken and this is nae great matter after a just to cut the comb of a young cock that has been crawing a little ower crousely  not young earnscliff said the solitary with some emotion  no not young earnscliffnot young earnscliff yet but his time may come if he will not take warning and get him back to the burrowtown that hes fit for and no keep skelping about here destroying the few deer that are left in the country and pretending to act as a magistrate and writing letters to the great folk at auld reekie about the disturbed state of the land let him take care o himsell  then it must be hobbie of the heughfoot said elshie what harm has the lad done you  harm nae great harm but i hear he says i staid away from the baspiel on fasterns een for fear of him and it was only for fear of the country keeper for there was a warrant against me ill stand hobbies feud and a his clans but its not so much for that as to gie him a lesson not to let his tongue gallop ower freely about his betters i trow he will hae lost the best penfeather o his wing before tomorrow morningfarewell elshie theres some canny boys waiting for me down amang the shaws owerby i will see you as i come back and bring ye a blithe tale in return for your leechcraft  ere the dwarf could collect himself to reply the reiver of westburnflat set spurs to his horse the animal starting at one of the stones which lay scattered about flew from the path the rider exercised his spurs without moderation or mercy the horse became furious reared kicked plunged and bolted like a deer with all his four feet off the ground at once it was in vain the unrelenting rider sate as if he had been a part of the horse which he bestrode and after a short but furious contest compelled the subdued animal to proceed upon the path at a rate which soon carried him out of sight of the solitary  that villain exclaimed the dwarfthat coolblooded hardened unrelenting ruffianthat wretch whose every thought is infected with crimeshas thewes and sinews limbs strength and activity enough to compel a nobler animal than himself to carry him to the place where he is to perpetrate his wickedness while i had i the weakness to wish to put his wretched victim on his guard and to save the helpless family would see my good intentions frustrated by the decrepitude which chains me to the spotwhy should i wish it were otherwise what have my screechowl voice my hideous form and my misshapen features to do with the fairer workmanship of nature do not men receive even my benefits with shrinking horror and illsuppressed disgust and why should i interest myself in a race which accounts me a prodigy and an outcast and which has treated me as such no by all the ingratitude which i have reapedby all the wrongs which i have sustainedby my imprisonment my stripes my chains i will wrestle down my feelings of rebellious humanity i will not be the fool i have been to swerve from my principles whenever there was an appeal forsooth to my feelings as if i towards whom none show sympathy ought to have sympathy with any one let destiny drive forth her scythed car through the overwhelmed and trembling mass of humanity shall i be the idiot to throw this decrepit form this misshapen lump of mortality under her wheels that the dwarf the wizard the hunchback may save from destruction some fair form or some active frame and all the world clap their hands at the exchange no neverand yet this elliotthis hobbie so young and gallant so frank soi will think of it no longer i cannot aid him if i would and i am resolvedfirmly resolved that i would not aid him if a wish were the pledge of his safety  having thus ended his soliloquy he retreated into his hut for shelter from the storm which was fast approaching and now began to burst in large and heavy drops of rain the last rays of the sun now disappeared entirely and two or three claps of distant thunder followed each other at brief intervals echoing and reechoing among the range of heathy fells like the sound of a distant engagement    chapter vii       proud bird of the mountain thy plume shall be torn                  return to thy dwelling all lonely return      for the blackness of ashes shall mark where it stood      and a wild mother scream oer her famishing broodcampbell  the night continued sullen and stormy but morning rose as if refreshed by the rains even the mucklestanemoor with its broad bleak swells of barren grounds interspersed with marshy pools of water seemed to smile under the serene influence of the sky just as goodhumour can spread a certain inexpressible charm over the plainest human countenance the heath was in its thickest and deepest bloom the bees which the solitary had added to his rural establishment were abroad and on the wing and filled the air with the murmurs of their industry as the old man crept out of his little hut his two shegoats came to meet him and licked his hands in gratitude for the vegetables with which he supplied them from his garden you at least he saidyou at least see no differences in form which can alter your feelings to a benefactorto you the finest shape that ever statuary moulded would be an object of indifference or of alarm should it present itself instead of the misshapen trunk to whose services you are accustomed while i was in the world did i ever meet with such a return of gratitude no the domestic whom i had bred from infancy made mouths at me as he stood behind my chair the friend whom i had supported with my fortune and for whose sake i had even stainedhe stopped with a strong convulsive shudder even he thought me more fit for the society of lunaticsfor their disgraceful restraintsfor their cruel privations than for communication with the rest of humanity hubert aloneand hubert too will one day abandon me all are of a piece one mass of wickedness selfishness and ingratitudewretches who sin even in their devotions and of such hardness of heart that they do not without hypocrisy even thank the deity himself for his warm sun and pure air  as he was plunged in these gloomy soliloquies he heard the tramp of a horse on the other side of his enclosure and a strong clear bass voice singing with the liveliness inspired by a light heart       canny hobbie elliot canny hobbie now      canny hobbie elliot ise gang alang wi you  at the same moment a large deer greyhound sprung over the hermits fence it is well known to the sportsmen in these wilds that the appearance and scent of the goat so much resemble those of their usual objects of chase that the bestbroke greyhounds will sometimes fly upon them the dog in question instantly pulled down and throttled one of the hermits shegoats while hobbie elliot who came up and jumped from his horse for the purpose was unable to extricate the harmless animal from the fangs of his attendant until it was expiring the dwarf eyed for a few moments the convulsive starts of his dying favourite until the poor goat stretched out her limbs with the twitches and shivering fit of the last agony he then started into an access of frenzy and unsheathing a long sharp knife or dagger which he wore under his coat he was about to launch it at the dog when hobbie perceiving his purpose interposed and caught hold of his hand exclaiming let a be the hound manlet a be the houndna na killbuck maunna be guided that gate neither  the dwarf turned his rage on the young farmer and by a sudden effort far more powerful than hobbie expected from such a person freed his wrist from his grasp and offered the dagger at his heart all this was done in the twinkling of an eye and the incensed recluse might have completed his vengeance by plunging the weapon in elliots bosom had he not been checked by an internal impulse which made him hurl the knife to a distance  no he exclaimed as he thus voluntarily deprived himself of the means of gratifying his rage not againnot again  hobbie retreated a step or two in great surprise discomposure and disdain at having been placed in such danger by an object apparently so contemptible  the deils in the body for strength and bitterness were the first words that escaped him which he followed up with an apology for the accident that had given rise to their disagreement i am no justifying killbuck athegither neither and i am sure it is as vexing to me as to you elshie that the mischance should hae happened but ill send you twa goats and twa fat gimmers man to make a straight again a wise man like you shouldna bear malice against a poor dumb thing ye see that a goats like firstcousin to a deer sae he acted but according to his nature

dallomlea as the sang says they couldna come the straight road for the saft grund i wad send ye a bit venison but ye wadna take it weel maybe for killbuck catched it  during this long speech in which the goodnatured borderer endeavoured to propitiate the offended dwarf by every argument he could think of he heard him with his eyes bent on the ground as if in the deepest meditation and at length broke forthnatureyes it is indeed in the usual beaten path of nature the strong gripe and throttle the weak the rich depress and despoil the needy the happy those who are idiots enough to think themselves happy insult the misery and diminish the consolation of the wretchedgo hence thou who hast contrived to give an additional pang to the most miserable of human beingsthou who hast deprived me of what i half considered as a source of comfort go hence and enjoy the happiness prepared for thee at home  never stir said hobbie if i wadna take you wi me man if ye wad but say it wad divert ye

powny  is it to me you propose once more to mix in the society of the common herd said the recluse with an air of deep disgust  commons retorted hobbie nae siccan commons neither the elliots hae been

wrath and misery have brought to thy threshold before thee  i wish ye wadna speak that gate said hobbie ye ken yoursell elshie naebody judges you to be ower canny now ill tell ye just ae word for aye

serves naething to strive wi cripplesthey are aye cankered but ill just tell ye ae thing neighbour that if things be otherwise than weel wi grace armstrong ise gie you a scouther if there be a tarbarrel in the five parishes  so saying he rode off and elshie after looking at him with a scornful and indignant laugh took spade and mattock and occupied himself in digging a grave for his deceased favourite  a low whistle and the words hisht elshie hisht disturbed him in this melancholy occupation he looked up and the red reiver of westburnflat was before him like banquos murderer there was blood on his face as well as upon the rowels of his spurs and the sides of his overridden horse  how now ruffian demanded the dwarf is thy job chared  ay ay doubt not that elshie answered the freebooter when i ride my foes may moan they have had mair light than comfort at the heughfoot this morning theres a toom byre and a wide and a wail and a cry for the bonny bride  the bride  ay

outports and something to boot for them that brings a bonny wench theyre wanted beyond seas thae female cattle and theyre no that scarce here but i think o doing better for this lassie theres a leddy that unless she be a the better bairn is to be sent to foreign parts whether she will or no now i think of sending grace to wait on hershes a bonny lassie hobbie will hae a merry morning when he comes hame and misses baith bride and gear  ay and do you not pity him said the recluse  wad he pity me were i gaeing up the castle hill at jeddart  the place of execution at that ancient burgh where many of westburnflats profession have made their final exit and yet i rue something for the bit lassie but hell get anither and little skaith duneane is as gude as anither and now you that like to hear o splores heard ye ever o a better ane than i hae had this morning  air ocean and fire said the dwarf speaking to himself the earthquake the tempest the volcano are all mild and moderate compared to the wrath of man and what is this fellow but one more skilled than others in executing the end of his existencehear me felon go again where i before sent thee  to the steward  ay and tell him elshender the recluse commands him to give thee gold but hear me let the maiden be discharged free and uninjured return her to her friends and let her swear not to discover thy villainy  swear said westburnflat but what if she break her aith women are not famous for keeping their plight a wise man like you should ken thatand uninjuredwha kens what may happen were she to be left lang at tinningbeck charlie cheatthewoodie is a rough customer but if the gold could be made up to twenty pieces i think i could ensure her being wi her friends within the twentyfour hours  the dwarf took his tablets from his pocket marked a line on them and tore out the leaf there he said giving the robber the leafbut mark me thou knowest i am not to be fooled by thy treachery if thou darest to disobey my directions thy wretched life be sure shall answer it  i know said the fellow looking down that you have power on earth however you came by it you can do what nae other man can do baith by physic and foresight and the gold is shelled down when ye command as fast as i have seen the ashkeys fall in a frosty morning in october i will not disobey you  begone then and relieve me of thy hateful presence  the robber set spurs to his horse and rode off without reply  hobbie elliot had in the meanwhile pursued his journey rapidly harassed by those oppressive and indistinct fears that all was not right which men usually term a presentiment of misfortune ere he reached the top of the bank from which he could look down on his own habitation he was met by his nurse a person then of great consequence in all families in scotland whether of the higher or middling classes the connexion between them and their fosterchildren was considered a tie far too dearly intimate to be broken and it usually happened in the course of years that the nurse became a resident in the family of her fosterson assisting in the domestic duties and receiving all marks of attention and regard from the heads of the family so soon as hobbie recognised the figure of annaple in her red cloak and black hood he could not help exclaiming to himself what ill luck can hae brought the auld nurse sae far frae hame her that never stirs a gunshot frae the doorstane for ordinarhout it will just be to get craneberries or whortleberries or some such stuff out of the moss to make the pies and tarts for the feast on mondayi cannot get the words of that cankered auld cripple deilsbuckie out o my headthe least thing makes me dread some ill newso killbuck man were there nae deer and goats in the country besides but ye behoved to gang and worry his creature by a other folks  by this time annaple with a brow like a tragic volume had hobbled towards him and caught his horse by the bridle the despair in her look was so evident as to deprive even him of the power of asking the cause o my bairn she cried gang na forwardgang na forwardits a sight to kill onybody let alane thee  in gods name whats the matter said the astonished horseman endeavouring to extricate his bridle from the grasp of the old woman for heavens sake let me go and see whats the matter  ohon that i should have lived to see the daythe steadings a in a low and the bonny stackyard lying in the red ashes and the gear a driven away but gang na forward it wad break your young heart hinny to see what my auld een hae seen this morning  and who has dared to do this let go my bridle annaplewhere is my grandmothermy sisterswhere is grace armstronggodthe words of the warlock are knelling in my ears  he sprang from his horse to rid himself of annaples interruption and ascending the hill with great speed soon came in view of the spectacle with which she had threatened him it was indeed a heartbreaking sight the habitation which he had left in its seclusion beside the mountainstream surrounded with every evidence of rustic plenty was now a wasted and blackened ruin from amongst the shattered and sable walls the smoke continued to rise the turfstack the barnyard the offices stocked with cattle all the wealth of an upland cultivator of the period of which poor elliot possessed no common share had been laid waste or carried off in a single night he stood a moment motionless and then exclaimed i am ruinedruined to the groundbut curse on the warlds gearhad it not been the week before the bridalbut i am nae babe to sit down and greet about it if i can but find grace and my grandmother and my sisters weel i can go to the wars in flanders as my gudesire did under the bellenden banner wi auld buccleuch at ony rate i will keep up a heart or they will lose theirs athegither  manfully strode hobbie down the hill resolved to suppress his own despair and administer consolation which he did not feel the neighbouring inhabitants of the dell particularly those of his own name had already assembled the younger part were in arms and clamorous for revenge although they knew not upon whom the elder were taking measures for the relief of the distressed family annaples cottage which was situated down the brook at some distance from the scene of mischief had been hastily adapted for the temporary accommodation of the old lady and her daughters with such articles as had been contributed by the neighbours for very little was saved from the wreck  are we to stand here a day sirs exclaimed one tall young man and look at the burnt was of our kinsmans house every wreath of the reek is a blast of shame upon us let us to horse and take the chasewho has the nearest bloodhound  its young earnscliff answered another and hes

i trow  i am no saying onything against revenging hobbies wrang puir chield but we maun take the law wi us in thae days simon answered the more prudent elder  and besides said another old man i dinna believe theres ane now living that kens the lawful mode of following a fray across the border tam o whittram kend a about it but he died in the hard winter  ay said a third he was at the great gathering when they chased as far as thirlwall it was the year after the fight of philiphaugh  hout exclaimed another of these discording counsellors theres nae great skill needed just put a lighted peat on the end of a spear or hayfork or siclike and blaw a horn and cry the gatheringword and then its lawful to follow gear into england and recover it by the strong hand or to take gear frae some other englishman providing ye lift nae mair thans been lifted frae you thats the auld border law made at dundrennan in the days of the black douglas deil ane need doubt it its as clear as the sun

fou again or night and if we canna big up the auld house sae soon wese lay an english ane as low as heughfoot isand thats fair play a the warld ower  this animating proposal was received with great applause by the younger part of the assemblage when a whisper ran among them theres hobbie himsell puir fallow well be guided by him  the principal sufferer having now reached the bottom of the hill pushed on through the crowd unable from the tumultuous state of his feelings to do more than receive and return the grasps of the friendly hands by which his neighbours and kinsmen mutely expressed their sympathy in his misfortune while he pressed simon of hackburns hand his anxiety at length found words thank ye simonthank ye neighboursi ken what ye wad a say but where are theywhere are he stopped as if afraid even to name the objects of his enquiry and with a similar feeling his kinsmen without reply pointed to the hut into which hobbie precipitated himself with the desperate air of one who is resolved to know the worst at once a general and powerful expression of sympathy accompanied him ah puir fallowpuir hobbie  hell learn the warst ot now  but i trust earnscliff will get some speerings o the puir lassie  such were the exclamations of the group who having no acknowledged leader to direct their motions passively awaited the return of the sufferer and determined to be guided by his directions  the meeting between hobbie and his family was in the highest degree affecting his sisters threw themselves upon him and almost stifled him with their caresses as if to prevent his looking round to distinguish the absence of one yet more beloved  god help thee my son he can help when worldly trust is a broken reedsuch was the welcome of the matron to her unfortunate grandson he looked eagerly round holding two of his sisters by the hand while the third hung about his necki see youi count youmy grandmother lilias jean and annot but where is he hesitated and then continued as if with an effort where is grace surely this is not a time to hide hersell frae metheres nae time for daffing now  o brother and our poor grace was the only answer his questions could procure till his grandmother rose up and gently disengaged him from the weeping girls led him to a seat and with the affecting serenity which sincere piety like oil sprinkled on the waves can throw over the most acute feelings she said my bairn when thy grandfather was killed in the wars and left me with six orphans around me with scarce bread to eat or a roof to cover us i had strengthnot of mine ownbut i had

after the deed god bless him hes a real earnscliff hes his fathers true sona leal friend  a true friend indeed god bless him exclaimed hobbie lets on and away and take the chase after him  o my child before you run on danger let me hear you but say his will be done  urge me not mothernot now he was rushing out when looking back he observed his grandmother make a mute attitude of affliction he

to say on your return his name be praised  farewell motherfarewell my dear sisters exclaimed elliot and rushed out of the house    chapter viii       now horse and hattock cried the laird      now horse and hattock speedilie      they that winna ride for telfers kye      let them never look in the face o meborder ballad  horse horse and spear exclaimed hobbie to his kinsmen many a ready foot was in the stirrup and while elliot hastily collected arms and accoutrements no easy matter in such a confusion the glen resounded with the approbation of his younger friends  ay ay exclaimed simon of hackburn thats the gate to take it hobbie let women sit and greet at hame men must do as they have been done by its the scripture sayst  haud your tongue sir said one of the seniors sternly dinna

elliot  ill prick them out through the blindest moor in the border an there had been a fair held there the day before said hugh the blacksmith of ringleburn for i aye shoe his horse wi my ain hand  lay on the deerhounds cried another where are they  hout man the suns been lang up and the dew is aff the grundthe scent will never lie  hobbie instantly whistled on his hounds which were roving about the ruins of their old habitation and filling the air with their doleful howls  now killbuck said hobbie try thy skill this day and then as if a light had suddenly broke on himthat illfaurd goblin spak something o this he may ken mair ot either by villains on earth or devils belowill hae it frae him if i should cut it out o his misshapen bouk wi my whinger he then hastily gave directions to his

venison to ill ride ower mucklestanemoor mysell  and if i were you said dick of the dingle i would speak to canny elshie he can tell you whatever betides in this land if hes sae minded  he shall tell

him will no bear thrawing they converse sae muckle wi thae fractious ghaists and evil spirits that it clean spoils their temper  let me alane to guide him answered hobbie theres that in my breast this day that would owermaister a the warlocks on earth and a the devils in hell  and being now fully equipped he threw himself on his horse and spurred him at a rapid pace against the steep ascent  elliot speedily surmounted the hill rode down the other side at the same rate crossed a wood and traversed a long glen ere he at length regained mucklestanemoor as he was obliged in the course of his journey to relax his speed in consideration of the labour which his horse might still have to undergo he had time to consider maturely in what manner he should address the dwarf in order to extract from him the knowledge which he supposed him to be in possession of concerning the authors of his misfortunes hobbie though blunt plain of speech and hot of disposition like most of his countrymen was by no means deficient in the shrewdness which is also their characteristic he reflected that from what he had observed on the memorable night when the dwarf was first seen and from the conduct of that mysterious being ever since he was likely to be rendered even more obstinate in his sullenness by threats and violence  ill speak him fair he said as auld dickon advised me though folk say he has a league wi satan he canna be sic an incarnate devil as no to take some pity in a case like mine and folk threep hell whiles do good charitable sort o things ill keep my heart doun as weel as i can and stroke him wi the hair and if the warst come to the warst its but wringing the head o him about at last  in this disposition of accommodation he approached the hut of the solitary  the old man was not upon his seat of audience nor could hobbie perceive him in his garden or enclosures  hes gotten into his very keep said hobbie maybe to be out o the gate but ise pu it doun about his lugs if i canna win at him otherwise  having thus communed with himself he raised his voice and invoked elshie in a tone as supplicating as his conflicting feelings would permit elshie my gude friend no reply elshie canny father elshie the dwarf remained mute sorrow be in the crooked carcass of thee said the borderer between his teeth and then again attempting a soothing tonegood father elshie a most miserable creature desires some counsel of your wisdom  the better answered the shrill and discordant voice of the dwarf through a very small window resembling an arrow slit which he had constructed near the door of his dwelling and through which he could see any one who approached it without the possibility of their looking in upon him  the better said hobbie impatiently what is the better elshie do you not hear me tell you i am the most miserable wretch living  and do you not hear me tell you it is so much the better and did i not tell you this morning when you thought yourself so happy what an evening was coming upon you  that ye did een replied hobbie and that gars me come to you for advice now they that foresaw the trouble maun ken the cure  i know no cure for earthly trouble returned the dwarf or if i did why should i help others when none hath aided me have i not lost wealth that would have bought all thy barren hills a hundred times over rank to which thine is as that of a peasant society where there was an interchange of all that was amiableof all that was intellectual have i not lost all this am i not residing here the veriest outcast on the face of nature in the most hideous and most solitary of her retreats myself more hideous than all that is around me and why should other worms complain to me when they are trodden on since i am myself lying crushed and writhing under the chariotwheel  ye may have lost all this answered hobbie in the bitterness of emotion land and friends goods and gear ye may hae lost them abut ye neer can hae sae sair a heart as mine for ye neer lost nae grace armstrong and now my last hopes are gane and i shall neer see her mair  this he said in the tone of deepest emotionand there followed a long pause for the mention of his brides name had overcome the more angry and irritable feelings of poor hobbie ere he had again addressed the solitary the bony hand and long fingers of the latter holding a large leathern bag was thrust forth at the small window and as it unclutched the burden and let it drop with a clang upon the ground his harsh voice again addressed elliot  therethere lies a salve for every human ill so at least each human wretch readily thinksbegone return twice as wealthy as thou wert before yesterday and torment me no more with questions complaints or thanks they are alike odious to me  it is a gowd by heaven said elliot having glanced at the contents and then again addressing the hermit muckle obliged for your goodwill and i wad blithely gie you a bond for some o the siller or a wadset ower the lands o wideopen but i dinna ken elshie to be free wi you i dinna like to use siller unless i kend it was decently come by and maybe it might turn into sclatestanes and cheat some poor man  ignorant idiot retorted the dwarf the trash is as genuine poison as ever was dug out of the bowels of the earth take ituse it and may it thrive with you as it hath done with me  but i tell you said elliot it wasna about the gear that i was consulting youit was a braw barnyard doubtless and thirty head of finer cattle there werena on this side of the catrail but let the gear gangif ye could but gie me speerings o puir grace i would be content to be your slave for life in onything that didna touch my salvation o elshie speak man speak  well then answered the dwarf as if worn out by his importunity since thou hast not enough of woes of thine own but must needs seek to burden thyself with those of a partner seek her whom thou hast lost in the west  in the west thats a wide word  it is the last said the dwarf which i design to utter and he drew the shutters of his window leaving hobbie to make the most of the hint he had given  the west the westthought elliot the country is pretty quiet down that way unless it were jock o the todholes and hes ower auld now for the like o thae jobswestby my life it must be westburnflat elshie just tell me one word am i right is it westburnflat if i am wrang say sae i wadna like to wyte an innocent neighbour wi violenceno answerit must be the red reiveri didna think he wad hae ventured on me neither and sae mony kin as theres o usi am thinking hell hae some better backing than his cumberland friendsfareweel to you elshie and mony thanksi downa be fashed wi the siller een now for i maun awa to meet my friends at the trystingplacesae if ye carena to open the window ye can fetch it in after im awa  still there was no reply  hes deaf or hes daft or hes baith but i hae nae time to stay to claver wi him  and off rode hobbie elliot towards the place of rendezvous which he had named to his friends  four or five riders were already gathered at the trysting pool they stood in close consultation together while their horses were permitted to graze among the poplars which overhung the broad still pool a more numerous party were seen coming from the southward it proved to be earnscliff and his party who had followed the track of the cattle as far as the english border but had halted on the information that a considerable force was drawn together under some of the jacobite gentlemen in that district and there were tidings of insurrection in different parts of scotland this took away from the act which had been perpetrated the appearance of private animosity or love of plunder and earnscliff was now disposed to regard it as a symptom of civil war the young gentleman greeted hobbie with the most sincere sympathy and informed him of the news he had received  then may i never stir frae the bit said elliot if auld ellieslaw is not at the bottom o the haill villainy ye see hes leagued wi the cumberland catholics and that agrees weel wi what elshie hinted about westburnflat for ellieslaw aye protected him and he will want to harry and disarm the country about his ain hand before he breaks out  some now remembered that the party of ruffians had been heard to say they were acting for james viii and were charged to disarm all rebels others had heard westburnflat boast in drinking parties that ellieslaw would soon be in arms for the jacobite cause and that he himself was to hold a command under him and that they would be bad neighbours for young earnscliff and all that stood out for the established government the result was a strong belief that westburnflat had headed the party under ellieslaws orders and they resolved to proceed instantly to the house of the former and if possible to secure his person they were by this time joined by so many of their dispersed friends that their number amounted to upwards of twenty horsemen well mounted and tolerably though variously armed  a brook which issued from a narrow glen among the hills entered at westburnflat upon the open marshy level which expanding about half a mile in every direction gives name to the spot in this place the character of the stream becomes changed and from being a lively briskrunning mountaintorrent it stagnates like a blue swollen snake in dull deep windings through the swampy level on the side of the stream and nearly about the centre of the plain arose the tower of westburnflat one of the few remaining strongholds formerly so numerous upon the borders the ground upon which it stood was gently elevated above the marsh for the space of about a hundred yards affording an esplanade of dry turf which extended itself in the immediate neighbourhood of the tower but beyond which the surface presented to strangers was that of an impassable and dangerous bog the owner of the tower and his inmates alone knew the winding and intricate paths which leading over ground that was comparatively sound admitted visitors to his residence but among the party which were assembled under earnscliffs directions there was more than one person qualified to act as a guide for although the owners character and habits of life were generally known yet the laxity of feeling with respect to property prevented his being looked on with the abhorrence with which he must have been regarded in a more civilized country he was considered among his more peaceable neighbours pretty much as a gambler cockfighter or horsejockey would be regarded at the present day a person of course whose habits were to be condemned and his society in general avoided yet who could not be considered as marked with the indelible infamy attached to his profession where laws have been habitually observed and their indignation was awakened against him upon this occasion not so much on account of the general nature of the transaction which was just such as was to be expected from this marauder as that the violence had been perpetrated upon a neighbour against whom he had no cause of quarrelagainst a friend of their ownabove all against one of the name of elliot to which clan most of them belonged it was not therefore wonderful that there should be several in the band pretty well acquainted with the locality of his habitation and capable of giving such directions and guidance as soon placed the whole party on the open space of firm ground in front of the tower of westburnflat    chapter ix       so spak the knicht the geaunt sed

falcon  the tower before which the party now stood was a small square building of the most gloomy aspect the walls were of great thickness and the windows or slits which served the purpose of windows seemed rather calculated to afford the defenders the means of employing missile weapons than for admitting air or light to the apartments within a small battlement projected over the walls on every side and afforded farther advantage of defence by its niched parapet within which arose a steep roof flagged with grey stones a single turret at one angle defended by a door studded with huge iron nails rose above the battlement and gave access to the roof from within by the spiral staircase which it enclosed it seemed to the party that their motions were watched by some one concealed within this turret and they were confirmed in their belief when through a narrow loophole a female hand was seen to wave a handkerchief as if by way of signal to them hobbie was almost out of his senses with joy and eagerness  it was graces hand and arm he said i can swear to it amang a thousand there is not the like of it on this side of the lowdenswell have her out lads if we should carry off the tower of westburnflat stane by stane  earnscliff though he doubted the possibility of recognising a fair maidens hand at such a distance from the eye of the lover would say nothing to damp his friends animated hopes and it was resolved to summon the garrison  the shouts of the party and the winding of one or two horns at length brought to a loophole which flanked the entrance the haggard face of an old woman  thats the reivers mother said one of the elliots shes ten times waur than himsell and is wyted for muckle of the ill he does about the country  wha are ye what dye want here were the queries of the respectable progenitor  we are seeking william graeme of westburnflat said earnscliff  hes no at hame returned the old dame  when did he leave home pursued earnscliff  i canna tell said the portress  when will he return said hobbie elliot  i dinna ken naething about it replied the inexorable guardian of the keep  is there anybody within the tower with you again demanded earnscliff  naebody but mysell and baudrons said the old woman  then open the gate and admit us said earnscliff i am a justice of peace and in search of the evidence of a felony  deil be in their fingers that draws a bolt for ye retorted the portress for mine shall never do it thinkna ye shame o yoursells to come here siccan a band o ye wi your swords and spears and steelcaps to frighten a lone widow woman  our information said earnscliff is positive we are seeking goods which have been forcibly carried off to a great amount  and a young woman thats been cruelly made prisoner thats worth mair than a the gear twice told said hobbie  and i warn you continued earnscliff that your only way to prove your sons innocence is to give us quiet admittance to search the house  and what will ye do if i carena to thraw the keys or draw the bolts or open the grate to sic a clamjamfrie said the old dame scoffingly  force our way with the kings keys and break the neck of every living soul we find in the house if ye dinna gie it ower forthwith menaced the incensed hobbie  threatened folks live lang said the hag in the same tone of irony theres the iron gratetry your skeel ont ladsit has kept out as gude men as you or now  so saying she laughed and withdrew from the aperture through which she had held the parley  the besiegers now opened a serious consultation the immense thickness of the walls and the small size of the windows might for a time have even resisted cannonshot the entrance was secured first by a strong grated door composed entirely of hammered iron of such ponderous strength as seemed calculated to resist any force that could be brought against it pinches or forehammers will never pick upont said hugh the blacksmith of ringleburn ye might as weel batter at it wi pipestaples  within the doorway and at the distance of nine feet which was the solid thickness of the wall there was a second door of oak crossed both breadth and lengthways with clenched bars of iron and studded full of broadheaded nails besides all these defences they were by no means confident in the truth of the old dames assertion that she alone composed the garrison the more knowing of the party had observed hoofmarks in the track by which they approached the tower which seemed to indicate that several persons had very lately passed in that direction  to all these difficulties was added their want of means for attacking the place there was no hope of procuring ladders long enough to reach the battlements and the windows besides being very narrow were secured with iron bars scaling was therefore out of the question mining was still more so for want of tools and gunpowder neither were the besiegers provided with food means of shelter or other conveniences which might have enabled them to convert the siege into a blockade and there would at any rate have been a risk of relief from some of the marauders comrades hobbie grinded and gnashed his teeth as walking round the fastness he could devise no means of making a forcible entry at length he suddenly exclaimed and what for no do as our fathers did lang syneput hand to the wark lads let us cut up bushes and briers pile them before the door and set fire to them and smoke that auld devils dam as if she were to be reested for bacon  all immediately closed with this proposal and some went to work with swords and knives to cut down the alder and hawthorn bushes which grew by the side of the sluggish stream many of which were sufficiently decayed and dried for their purpose while others began to collect them in a large stack properly disposed for burning as close to the irongrate as they could be piled fire was speedily obtained from one of their guns and hobbie was already advancing to the pile with a kindled brand when the surly face of the robber and the muzzle of a musquetoon were partially shown at a shothole which flanked the entrance mony thanks to ye he said scoffingly for collecting sae muckle winter eilding for us but if ye step a foot nearer it wi that lunt its be the dearest step ye ever made in your days  well sune see that said hobbie advancing fearlessly with the torch  the marauder snapped his piece at him which fortunately for our honest friend did not go off while earnscliff firing at the same moment at the narrow aperture and slight mark afforded by the robbers face grazed the side of his head with a bullet he had apparently calculated upon his post affording him more security for he no sooner felt the wound though a very slight one than he requested a parley and demanded to know what they meant by attacking in this fashion a peaceable and honest man and shedding his blood in that lawless manner  we want your prisoner said earnscliff to be delivered up to us in safety  and what concern have you with her replied the marauder  that retorted earnscliff you who are detaining her by force have no right to enquire  aweel i think i can gie a guess said the robber weel sirs i am laith to enter into deadly feud with you by spilling ony of your bluid though earnscliff hasna stopped to shed mineand he can hit a mark to a groats breadthso to prevent mair skaith i am willing to deliver up the prisoner since nae less will please you  and hobbies gear cried simon of hackburn dye think youre to be free to plunder the faulds and byres of a gentle elliot as if they were an auld wifes henscavey  as i live by bread replied willie of westburnflat as i live by bread i have not a single cloot o them theyre a ower the march lang syne theres no a horn o them about the tower but ill see what o them can be gotten back and ill take this day twa days to meet hobbie at the castleton wi twa friends on ilka side and see to make an agreement about a the wrang he can wyte me wi  ay ay said elliot that will do weel eneughand then aside to his kinsman murrain on the gear lordsake man say nought about them let us but get puir grace out o that auld hellicats clutches  will ye gie me your word earnscliff said the marauder who still lingered at the shothole your faith and troth with hand and glove that i am free to come and free to gae with five minutes to open the grate and five minutes to steek it and to draw the bolts less winna do for they want creishing sairly will ye do this  you shall have full time said earnscliff i plight my faith and troth my hand and my glove  wait there a moment then said westburnflat or hear ye i wad rather ye wad fa back a pistolshot from the door its no that i mistrust your word earnscliff but its best to be sure  o friend thought hobbie to himself as he drew back an i had you but on turnersholm there is a level meadow on the very margin of the two kingdoms called turnersholm just where the brook called crissop joins the liddel it is said to have derived its name as being a place frequently assigned for tourneys during the ancient border times and naebody by but twa honest lads to see fair play i wad make ye wish ye had broken your leg ere ye had touched beast or body that belanged to me  he has a white feather in his wing this same westburnflat after a said simon of hackburn somewhat scandalized by his ready surrenderhell neer fill his fathers boots  in the meanwhile the inner door of the tower was opened and the mother of the freebooter appeared in the space betwixt that and the outer grate willie himself was next seen leading forth a female and the old woman carefully bolting the grate behind them remained on the post as a sort of sentinel  ony ane or twa o ye come forward said the outlaw and take her frae my hand haill and sound  hobbie advanced eagerly to meet his betrothed bride earnscliff followed more slowly to guard against treachery suddenly hobbie slackened his pace in the deepest mortification while that of earnscliff was hastened by impatient surprise it was not grace armstrong but miss isabella vere whose liberation had been effected by their appearance before the tower  where is grace where is grace armstrong exclaimed hobbie in the extremity of wrath and indignation  not in my hands answered westburnflat ye may search the tower if ye misdoubt me  you false villain you shall account for her or die on the spot said elliot presenting his gun  but his companions who now came up instantly disarmed him of his weapon exclaiming all at once hand and glove faith and troth haud a care hobbie we maun keep our faith wi westburnflat were he the greatest rogue ever rode  thus protected the outlaw recovered his audacity which had been somewhat daunted by the menacing gesture of elliot  i have kept my word sirs he said and i look to have nae wrang amang ye if this is no the prisoner ye sought he said addressing earnscliff yell render her back to me again i am answerable for her to those that aught her  for gods sake mr earnscliff protect me said miss vere clinging to her deliverer do not you abandon one whom the whole world seems to have abandoned  fear nothing whispered earnscliff i will protect you with my life then turning to westburnflat villain he said how dared you to insult this lady  for that matter earnscliff answered the freebooter i can answer to them that has better right to ask me than you have but if you come with an armed force and take her awa from them that her friends lodged her wi how will you answer thatbut its your ain affairnae single man can keep a tower against twentya the men o the mearns downa do mair than they dow  he lies most falsely said isabella he carried me off by violence from my father  maybe he only wanted ye to think sae hinny replied the robber but its nae business o mine let it be as it mayso ye winna resign her back to me  back to you fellow surely no answered earnscliff i will protect miss vere and escort her safely wherever she is pleased to be conveyed  ay ay maybe you and her hae settled that already said willie of westburnflat  and grace interrupted hobbie shaking himself loose from the friends who had been preaching to him the sanctity of the safeconduct upon the faith of which the freebooter had ventured from his towerwheres grace and he rushed on the marauder sword in hand  westburnflat thus pressed after calling out godsake hobbie hear me a gliff fairly turned his back and fled his mother stood ready to open and shut the grate but hobbie struck at the freebooter as he entered with so much force that the sword made a considerable cleft in the lintel of the vaulted door which is still shown as a memorial of the superior strength of those who lived in the days of yore ere hobbie could repeat the blow the door was shut and secured and he was compelled to retreat to his companions who were now preparing to break up the siege of westburnflat they insisted upon his accompanying them in their return  ye hae broken truce already said old dick of the dingle an we takena the better care yell play mair gowks tricks and make yoursell the laughingstock of the haill country besides having your friends charged with slaughter under trust bide till the meeting at castleton as ye hae greed and if he disna make ye amends then well hae it out o his hearts blood but let us gang reasonably to wark and keep our tryst and ise warrant we get back grace and the kye an a  this coldblooded reasoning went ill down with the unfortunate lover but as he could only obtain the assistance of his neighbours and kinsmen on their own terms he was compelled to acquiesce in their notions of good faith and regular procedure  earnscliff now requested the assistance of a few of the party to convey miss vere to her fathers castle of ellieslaw to which she was peremptory in desiring to be conducted this was readily granted and five or six young men agreed to attend him as an escort hobbie was not of the number almost heartbroken by the events of the day and his final disappointment he returned moodily home to take such measures as he could for the sustenance and protection of his family and to arrange with his neighbours the farther steps which should be adopted for the recovery of grace armstrong the rest of the party dispersed in different directions as soon as they had crossed the morass the outlaw and his mother watched them from the tower until they entirely disappeared    chapter x       i left my ladyes bower last night      it was clad in wreaths of snaw      ill seek it when the sun is bright      and sweet the roses blawold ballad  incensed at what he deemed the coldness of his friends in a cause which interested him so nearly hobbie had shaken himself free of their company and was now on his solitary road homeward the fiend founder thee said he as he spurred impatiently his overfatigued and stumbling horse thou art like a the rest o them hae i not bred thee and fed thee and dressed thee wi mine ain hand and wouldst thou snapper now and break my neck at my utmost need but thourt een like the lavethe farthest off o them a is my cousin ten times removed and day or night i wad hae served them wi my best blood and now i think they show mair regard to the common thief of westburnflat than to their ain kinsman but i should see the lights now in heughfootwaes me he continued recollecting himself there will neither coal nor candlelight shine in the heughfoot ony mair an it werena for my mother and sisters and poor grace i could find in my heart to put spurs to the beast and loup ower the scaur into the water to make an end ot ain this disconsolate mood he turned his horses bridle towards the cottage in which his family had found refuge  as he approached the door he heard whispering and tittering amongst his sisters the deevils in the women said poor hobbie they would nicker and laugh and giggle if their best friend was lying a corpand yet i am glad they can keep up their hearts sae weel poor silly things but the dirdum fas on me to be sure and no on them  while he thus meditated he was engaged in fastening up his horse in a shed thou maun do without horsesheet and surcingle now lad he said addressing the animal you and me hae had a downcome alike we had better hae faen i the deepest pool o tarras  he was interrupted by the youngest of his sisters who came running out and speaking in a constrained voice as if to stifle some emotion called out to him what are ye doing there hobbie fiddling about the naig and theres ane frae cumberland been waiting here for ye this hour and mair haste ye in man ill take off the saddle  ane frae cumberland exclaimed elliot and putting the bridle of his horse into the hand of his sister he rushed into the cottage where is he where is he he exclaimed glancing eagerly around and seeing only females did he bring news of grace  he doughtna bide an instant langer said the elder sister still with a suppressed laugh  hout fie bairns said the old lady with something of a goodhumoured reproof ye shouldna vex your billy hobbie that waylook round my bairn and see if there isna ane here mair than ye left this morning  hobbie looked eagerly round theres you and the three titties  theres four of us now hobbie lad said the youngest who at this moment entered  in an instant hobbie had in his arms grace armstrong who with one of his sisters plaids around her had passed unnoticed at his first entrance how dared you do this said hobbie  it wasna my fault said grace endeavouring to cover her face with her hands to hide at once her blushes and escape the storm of hearty kisses with which her bridegroom punished her simple stratagemit wasna my fault hobbie ye should kiss jeanie and the rest o them for they hae the wyte ot  and so i will said hobbie and embraced and kissed his sisters and grandmother a hundred times while the whole party halflaughed halfcried in the extremity of their joy i am the happiest man said hobbie throwing himself down on a seat almost exhaustedi am the happiest man in the world  then o my dear bairn said the good old dame who lost no opportunity of teaching her lesson of religion at those moments when the heart was best open to receive itthen o my son give praise to him that brings smiles out o tears and joy out o grief as he brought light out o darkness and the world out o naething was it not my word that if ye could say his will be done ye might hae cause to say his name be praised  it wasit was your word grannie and i do praise him for his mercy and for leaving me a good parent when my ain were gane said honest hobbie taking her hand that puts me in mind to think of him baith in happiness and distress  there was a solemn pause of one or two minutes employed in the exercise of mental devotion which expressed in purity and sincerity the gratitude of the affectionate family to that providence who had unexpectedly restored to their embraces the friend whom they had lost  hobbies first enquiries were concerning the adventures which grace had undergone they were told at length but amounted in substance to thisthat she was awaked by the noise which the ruffians made in breaking into the house and by the resistance made by one or two of the servants which was soon overpowered that dressing herself hastily she ran downstairs and having seen in the scuffle westburnflats vizard drop off imprudently named him by his name and besought him for mercy that the ruffian instantly stopped her mouth dragged her from the house and placed her on horseback behind one of his associates  ill break the accursed neck of him said hobbie if there werena another graeme in the land but himsell  she proceeded to say that she was carried southward along with the party and the spoil which they drove before them until they had crossed the border suddenly a person known to her as a kinsman of westburnflat came riding very fast after the marauders and told their leader that his cousin had learnt from a sure hand that no luck would come of it unless the lass was restored to her friends after some discussion the chief of the party seemed to acquiesce grace was placed behind her new guardian who pursued in silence and with great speed the leastfrequented path to the heughfoot and ere evening closed set down the fatigued and terrified damsel within a quarter of a mile of the dwelling of her friends many and sincere were the congratulations which passed on all sides  as these emotions subsided less pleasing considerations began to intrude themselves  this is a miserable place for ye a said hobbie looking around him i can sleep weel eneugh mysell outby beside the naig as i hae done mony a lang night on the hills but how ye are to put yoursells up i canna see and whats waur i canna mend it and whats waur than a the morn may come and the day after that without your being a bit better off  it was a cowardly cruel thing said one of the sisters looking round to harry a puir family to the bare was this gate  and leave us neither stirk nor stot said the youngest brother who now entered nor sheep nor lamb nor aught that eats grass and corn  if they had ony quarrel wi us said harry the second brother were we na ready to have fought it out and that we should have been a frae hame tooane and a upon the hillodd an we had been at hame will graemes stamach shouldna hae wanted its morning but its biding him is it na hobbie  our neighbours hae taen a day at the castleton to gree wi him at the sight o men said hobbie mournfully they behoved to have it a their ain gate or there was nae help to be got at their hands  to gree wi him exclaimed both his brothers at once after siccan an act of stouthrife as hasna been heard o in the country since the auld riding days  very true billies and my blood was een boiling at it but the sight o grace armstrong has settled it brawly  but the stocking hobbie said john elliot were utterly ruined harry and i hae been to gather what was on the outby land and theres scarce a cloot left i kenna how were to carry onwe maun a gang to the wars i think westburnflat hasna the means een if he had the will to make up our loss theres nae mends to be got out o him but what ye take out o his banes he hasna a fourfooted creature but the vicious blood thing he rides on and thats sair trashd wi his night wark we are ruined stoop and roop  hobbie cast a mournful glance on grace armstrong who returned it with a downcast look and a gentle sigh  dinna be cast down bairns said the grandmother we hae gude friends that winna forsake us in adversity theres sir thomas kittleloof is my third cousin by the mothers side and he has come by a hantle siller and been made a knightbaronet into the bargain for being ane o the commissioners at the union  he wadna gie a bodle to save us frae famishing said hobbie and if he did the bread that i bought wit would stick in my throat when i thought it was part of the price of puir auld scotlands crown and independence  theres the laird o dunder ane o the auldest families in tiviotdale  hes in the tolbooth motherhes in the heart of midlouden for a thousand merk he borrowed from saunders wyliecoat the writer  poor man exclaimed mrs elliot can we no send him something hobbie  ye forget grannie ye forget we want help oursells said hobbie somewhat peevishly  troth did i hinny replied the goodnatured lady just at the instant its sae natural to think on anes blude relations before themsellsbut theres young earnscliff  he has ower little o his ain and siccan a name to keep up it wad be a shame said hobbie to burden him wi our distress and ill tell ye grannie its needless to sit rhyming ower the style of a your kith kin and allies as if there was a charm in their braw names to do us good the grandees hae forgotten us and those of our ain degree hae just little eneugh to gang on wi themsells neer a friend hae we that can or will help us to stock the farm again  then hobbie me maun trust in him that can raise up friends and fortune out o the bare moor as they say  hobbie sprung upon his feet ye are right grannie he exclaimed ye are right i do ken a friend on the bare moor that baith can and will help usthe turns o this day hae dung my head clean hirdiegirdie i left as muckle gowd lying on mucklestanemoor this morning as would plenish the house and stock the heughfoot twice ower and i am certain sure elshie wadna grudge us the use of it  elshie said his grandmother in astonishment what elshie do you mean  what elshie should i mean but canny elshie the wight o mucklestane replied hobbie  god forfend my bairn you should gang to fetch water out o broken cisterns or seek for relief frae them that deal wi the evil one there was never luck in their gifts nor grace in their paths and the haill country kens that body elshies an unco man o if there was the law and the douce quiet administration of justice that makes a kingdom flourish in righteousness the like o them suldna be suffered to live the wizard and the witch are the abomination and the evil thing in the land  troth mother answered hobbie ye may say what ye like but i am in the mind that witches and warlocks havena half the power they had lang syne at least sure am i that ae illdeviser like auld ellieslaw or ae illdoer like that dd villain westburnflat is a greater plague and abomination in a countryside than a haill curnie o the warst witches that ever capered on a broomstick or played cantrips on fasterns een it wad hae been lang or elshie had burnt down my house and barns and i am determined to try if he will do aught to build them up again hes weel kend a skilfu man ower a the country as far as brough under stanmore  bide a wee my bairn mind his benefits havena thriven wi abody jock howden died o the very same disorder elshie pretended to cure him of about the fa o the leaf and though he helped lambsides cow weel out o the moorill yet the loupingills been sairer amane his sheep than ony season before and then i have heard he uses sic words abusing human nature thats like a fleeing in the face of providence and ye mind ye said yoursell the first time ye ever saw him that he was mair like a bogle than a living thing  hout mother said hobbie elshies no that bad a chield hes a grewsome spectacle for a crooked disciple to be sure and a rough talker but his bark is waur than his bite sae if i had anes something to eat for i havena had a morsel ower my throat this day i wad streek mysell down for twa or three hours aside the beast and be on and awa to mucklestane wi the first skreigh o morning  and what for no the night hobbie said harry and i will ride wi ye  my naig is tired said hobbie  ye may take mine then said john  but i am a wee thing wearied mysell  you wearied said harry shame on ye i have kend ye keep the saddle fourandtwenty hours thegither and neer sic a word as weariness in your wame  the nights very dark said hobbie rising and looking through the casement of the cottage and to speak truth and shame the deil though elshies a real honest fallow yet somegate i would rather take daylight wi me when i gang to visit him  this frank avowal put a stop to further argument and hobbie having thus compromised matters between the rashness of his brothers counsel and the timid cautions which he received from his grandmother refreshed himself with such food as the cottage afforded and after a cordial salutation all round retired to the shed and stretched himself beside his trusty palfrey his brothers shared between them some trusses of clean straw disposed in the stall usually occupied by old annaples cow and the females arranged themselves for repose as well as the accommodations of the cottage would permit  with the first dawn of morning hobbie arose and having rubbed down and saddled his horse he set forth to mucklestanemoor he avoided the company of either of his brothers from an idea that the dwarf was most propitious to those who visited him alone  the creature said he to himself as he went along is no neighbourly ae body at a time is fully mair than he weel can abide i wonder if hes looked out o the crib o him to gather up the bag o siller if he hasna done that it will hae been a braw windfa for somebody and ill be finely flungcome tarras said he to his horse striking him at the same time with his spur make mair fit man we maun be first on the field if we can  he was now on the heath which began to be illuminated by the beams of the rising sun the gentle declivity which he was descending presented him a distinct though distant view of the dwarfs dwelling the door opened and hobbie witnessed with his own eyes that phenomenon which he had frequently heard mentioned two human figures if that of the dwarf could be termed such issued from the solitary abode of the recluse and stood as if in converse together in the open air the taller form then stooped as if taking something up which lay beside the door of the hut then both moved forward a little way and again halted as in deep conference all hobbies superstitious terrors revived on witnessing thisspectacle that the dwarf would open his dwelling to a mortal guest was as improbable as that any one would choose voluntarily to be his nocturnal visitor and under full conviction that he beheld a wizard holding intercourse with his familiar spirit hobbie pulled in at once his breath and his bridle resolved not to incur the indignation of either by a hasty intrusion on their conference they were probably aware of his approach for he had not halted for a moment before the dwarf returned to his cottage and the taller figure who had accompanied him glided round the enclosure of the garden and seemed to disappear from the eyes of the admiring hobbie  saw ever mortal the like o that said elliot but my case is desperate sae if he were beelzebub himsell ise venture down the brae on him  yet notwithstanding his assumed courage he slackened his pace when nearly upon the very spot where he had last seen the tall figure he discerned as if lurking among the long heather a small black roughlooking object like a terrier dog  he has nae dog that ever i heard of said hobbie but mony a deil about his handlord forgie me for saying sic a wordit keeps its grund be what it likeim judging its a badger but whae kens what shapes thae bogies will take to fright a body it will maybe start up like a lion or a crocodile when i come nearer ise een drive a stage at it for if it change its shape when im ower near tarras will never stand it and it will be ower muckle to hae him and the deil to fight wi baith at ance  he therefore cautiously threw a stone at the object which continued motionless its nae living thing after a said hobbie approaching but the very bag o siller he flung out o the window yesterday and that other queer lang creature has just brought it sae muckle farther on the way to me he then advanced and lifted the heavy fur pouch which was quite full of gold mercy on us said hobbie whose heart fluttered between glee at the revival of his hopes and prospects in life and suspicion of the purpose for which this assistance was afforded himmercy on us its an awfu thing to touch what has been sae lately in the claws of something no canny i canna shake mysell loose o the belief that there has been some jookerypaukery of satans in a this but i am determined to conduct mysell like an honest man and a good christian come ot what will  he advanced accordingly to the cottage door and having knocked repeatedly without receiving any answer he at length elevated his voice and addressed the inmate of the hut elshie father elshie i ken yere within doors and wauking for i saw ye at the doorcheek as i cam ower the bent will ye come out and speak just a gliff to ane that has mony thanks to gie yeit was a true ye telld me about westburnflat but hes

een sae  hobbie now relieved his benefactor of his presence and rode blithely home to display his treasure and consult upon the means of repairing the damage which his fortune had sustained through the aggression of the red reiver of westburnflat    chapter xi       three ruffians seized me yester morn      alas  a maiden most forlorn      they choked my cries with wicked might      and bound me on a palfrey white      as sure as heaven shall pity me      i cannot tell what men they bechristabelle  the course of our story must here revert a little to detail the circumstances which had placed miss vere in the unpleasant situation from which she was unexpectedly and indeed unintentionally liberated by the appearance of earnscliff and elliot with their friends and followers before the tower of westburnflat  on the morning preceding the night in which hobbies house was plundered and burnt miss vere was requested by her father to accompany him in a walk through a distant part of the romantic grounds which lay round his castle of ellieslaw to hear was to obey in the true style of oriental despotism but isabella trembled in silence while she followed her father through rough paths now winding by the side of the river now ascending the cliffs which serve for its banks a single servant selected perhaps for his stupidity was the only person who attended them from her fathers silence isabella little doubted that he had chosen this distant and sequestered scene to resume the argument which they had so frequently maintained upon the subject of sir fredericks addresses and that he was meditating in what manner he should most effectually impress upon her the necessity of receiving him as her suitor but her fears seemed for some time to be unfounded the only sentences which her father from time to time addressed to her respected the beauties of the romantic landscape through which they strolled and which varied its features at every step to these observations although they seemed to come from a heart occupied by more gloomy as well as more important cares isabella endeavoured to answer in a manner as free and unconstrained as it was possible for her to assume amid the involuntary apprehensions which crowded upon her imagination  sustaining with mutual difficulty a desultory conversation they at length gained the centre of a small wood composed of large oaks intermingled with birches mountainashes hazel holly and a variety of underwood the boughs of the tall trees met closely above and the underwood filled up each interval between their trunks below the spot on which they stood was rather more open still however embowered under the natural arcade of tall trees and darkened on the sides for a space around by a great and lively growth of copsewood and bushes  and here isabella said mr vere as he pursued the conversation so often resumed so often dropped here i would erect an altar to friendship  to friendship sir said miss vere and why on this gloomy and sequestered spot rather than elsewhere  o the propriety of the locale is easily vindicated replied her father with a sneer you know miss vere for you i am well aware are a learned young lady you know that the romans were not satisfied with embodying for the purpose of worship each useful quality and moral virtue to which they could give a name but they moreover worshipped the same under each variety of titles and attributes which could give a distinct shade or individual character to the virtue in question now for example the friendship to whom a temple should be here dedicated is not masculine friendship which abhors and despises duplicity art and disguise but female friendship which consists in little else than a mutual disposition on the part of the friends as they call themselves to abet each other in obscure fraud and petty intrigue  you are severe sir said miss vere  only just said her father a humble copier i am from nature with the advantage of contemplating two such excellent studies as lucy ilderton and yourself  if i have been unfortunate enough to offend sir i can conscientiously excuse miss ilderton from being either my counsellor or confidante  indeed how came you then said mr vere by the flippancy of speech and pertness of argument by which you have disgusted sir frederick and given me of late such deep offence  if my manner has been so unfortunate as to displease you sir it is impossible for me to apologize too deeply or too sincerely but i cannot confess the same contrition for having answered sir frederick flippantly when he pressed me rudely since he forgot i was a lady it was time to show him that i am at least a woman  reserve then your pertness for those who press you on the topic isabella said her father coldly for my part i am weary of the subject and will never speak upon it again  god bless you my dear father said isabella seizing his reluctant hand there is nothing you can impose on me save the task of listening to this mans persecution that i will call or think a hardship  you are very obliging miss vere when it happens to suit you to be dutiful said her unrelenting father forcing himself at the same time from the affectionate grasp of her hand but henceforward child i shall save myself the trouble of offering you unpleasant advice on any topic you must look to yourself  at this moment four ruffians rushed upon them mr vere and his servant drew their hangers which it was the fashion of the time to wear and attempted to defend themselves and protect isabella but while each of them was engaged by an antagonist she was forced into the thicket by the two remaining villains who placed her and themselves on horses which stood ready behind the copsewood they mounted at the same time and placing her between them set of at a round gallop holding the reins of her horse on each side by many an obscure and winding path over dale and down through moss and moor she was conveyed to the tower of westburnflat where she remained strictly watched but not otherwise illtreated under the guardianship of the old woman to whose son that retreat belonged no entreaties could prevail upon the hag to give miss vere any information on the object of her being carried forcibly off and confined in this secluded place the arrival of earnscliff with a strong party of horsemen before the tower alarmed the robber as he had already directed grace armstrong to be restored to her friends it did not occur to him that this unwelcome visit was on her account and seeing at the head of the party earnscliff whose attachment to miss vere was whispered in the country he doubted not that her liberation was the sole object of the attack upon his fastness the dread of personal consequences compelled him to deliver up his prisoner in the manner we have already related  at the moment the tramp of horses was heard which carried off the daughter of ellieslaw her father fell to the earth and his servant a stout young fellow who was gaining ground on the ruffian with whom he had been engaged left the combat to come to his masters assistance little doubting that he had received a mortal wound both the villains immediately desisted from farther combat and retreating into the thicket mounted their horses and went off at full speed after their companions meantime dixon had the satisfaction to find mr vere not only alive but unwounded he had overreached himself and stumbled it seemed over the root of a tree in making too eager a blow at his antagonist the despair he felt at his daughters disappearance was in dixons phrase such as would have melted the heart of a whin stane and he was so much exhausted by his feelings and the vain researches which he made to discover the track of the ravishers that a considerable time elapsed ere he reached home and communicated the alarm to his domestics  all his conduct and gestures were those of a desperate man  speak not to me sir frederick he said impatiently you are no fathershe was my child an ungrateful one i fear but still my childmy only child where is miss ilderton she must know something of this it corresponds with what i was informed of her schemes go dixon call ratcliffe here let him come without a minutes delay the person he had named at this moment entered the room  i say dixon continued mr vere in an altered tone let mr ratcliffe know i beg the favour of his company on particular businessah my dear sir he proceeded as if noticing him for the first time you are the very man whose advice can be of the utmost service to me in this cruel extremity  what has happened mr vere to discompose you said mr ratcliffe gravely and while the laird of ellieslaw details to him with the most animated gestures of grief and indignation the singular adventure of the morning we shall take the opportunity to inform our readers of the relative circumstances in which these gentlemen stood to each other  in early youth mr vere of ellieslaw had been remarkable for a career of dissipation which in advanced life he had exchanged for the no less destructive career of dark and turbulent ambition in both cases he had gratified the predominant passion without respect to the diminution of his private fortune although where such inducements were wanting he was deemed close avaricious and grasping his affairs being much embarrassed by his earlier extravagance he went to england where he was understood to have formed a very advantageous matrimonial connexion he was many years absent from his family estate suddenly and unexpectedly he returned a widower bringing with him his daughter then a girl of about ten years old from this moment his expense seemed unbounded in the eyes of the simple inhabitants of his native mountains it was supposed he must necessarily have plunged himself deeply in debt yet he continued to live in the same lavish expense until some months before the commencement of our narrative when the public opinion of his embarrassed circumstances was confirmed by the residence of mr ratcliffe at ellieslaw castle who by the tacit consent though obviously to the great displeasure of the lord of the mansion seemed from the moment of his arrival to assume and exercise a predominant and unaccountable influence in the management of his private affairs  mr ratcliffe was a grave steady reserved man in an advanced period of life to those with whom he had occasion to speak upon business he appeared uncommonly well versed in all its forms with others he held little communication but in any casual intercourse or conversation displayed the powers of an active and wellinformed mind for some time before taking up his final residence at the castle he had been an occasional visitor there and was at such times treated by mr vere contrary to his general practice towards those who were inferior to him in rank with marked attention and even deference yet his arrival always appeared to be an embarrassment to his host and his departure a relief so that when he became a constant inmate of the family it was impossible not to observe indications of the displeasure with which mr vere regarded his presence indeed their intercourse formed a singular mixture of confidence and constraint mr veres most important affairs were regulated by mr ratcliffe and although he was none of those indulgent men of fortune who too indolent to manage their own business are glad to devolve it upon another yet in many instances he was observed to give up his own judgment and submit to the contrary opinions which mr ratcliffe did not hesitate distinctly to express  nothing seemed to vex mr vere more than when strangers indicated any observation of the state of tutelage under which he appeared to labour when it was noticed by sir frederick or any of his intimates he sometimes repelled their remarks haughtily and indignantly and sometimes endeavoured to evade them by saying with a forced laugh that ratcliffe knew his own importance but that he was the most honest and skilful fellow in the world and that it would be impossible for him to manage his english affairs without his advice and assistance such was the person who entered the room at the moment mr vere was summoning him to his presence and who now heard with surprise mingled with obvious incredulity the hasty narrative of what had befallen isabella  her father concluded addressing sir frederick and the other gentlemen who stood around in astonishment and now my friends you see the most unhappy father in scotland lend me your assistance gentlemengive me your advice mr ratcliffe i am incapable of acting or thinking under the unexpected violence of such a blow  let us take our horses call our attendants and scour the country in pursuit of the villains said sir frederick  is there no one whom you can suspect said ratcliffe gravely of having some motive for this strange crime these are not the days of romance when ladies are carried off merely for their beauty  i fear said mr vere i can too well account for this strange incident read this letter which miss lucy ilderton thought fit to address from my house of ellieslaw to young mr earnscliff whom of all men i have a hereditary right to call my enemy you see she writes to him as the confidant of a passion which he has the assurance to entertain for my daughter tells him she serves his cause with her friend very ardently but that he has a friend in the garrison who serves him yet more effectually look particularly at the pencilled passages mr ratcliffe where this meddling girl recommends bold measures with an assurance that his suit would be successful anywhere beyond the bounds of the barony of ellieslaw  and you argue from this romantic letter of a very romantic young lady mr vere said ratcliffe that young earnscliff has carried off your daughter and committed a very great and criminal act of violence on no better advice and assurance than that of miss lucy ilderton  what else can i think said ellieslaw  what else can you think said sir frederick or who else could have any motive for committing such a crime  were that the best mode of fixing the guilt said mr ratcliffe calmly there might easily be pointed out persons to whom such actions are more congenial and who have also sufficient motives of instigation supposing it were judged advisable to remove miss vere to some place in which constraint might be exercised upon her inclinations to a degree which cannot at present be attempted under the roof of ellieslaw castlewhat says sir frederick langley to that supposition  i say returned sir frederick that although mr vere may choose to endure in mr ratcliffe freedoms totally inconsistent with his situation in life i will not permit such license of innuendo by word or look to be extended to me with impunity  and i say said young mareschal of mareschalwells who was also a guest at the castle that you are all stark mad to be standing wrangling here instead of going in pursuit of the ruffians  i have ordered off the domestics already in the track most likely to overtake them said mr vere if you will favour me with your company we will follow them and assist in the search  the efforts of the party were totally unsuccessful probably because ellieslaw directed the pursuit to proceed in the direction of earnscliff tower under the supposition that the owner would prove to be the author of the violence so that they followed a direction diametrically opposite to that in which the ruffians had actually proceeded in the evening they returned harassed and out of spirits but other guests had in the meanwhile arrived at the castle and after the recent loss sustained by the owner had been related wondered at and lamented the recollection of it was for the present drowned in the discussion of deep political intrigues of which the crisis and explosion were momentarily looked for  several of the gentlemen who took part in this divan were catholics and all of them stanch jacobites whose hopes were at present at the highest pitch as an invasion in favour of the pretender was daily expected from france which scotland between the defenceless state of its garrisons and fortified places and the general disaffection of the inhabitants was rather prepared to welcome than to resist ratcliffe who neither sought to assist at their consultations on this subject nor was invited to do so had in the meanwhile retired to his own apartment miss ilderton was sequestered from society in a sort of honourable confinement until said mr vere she should be safely conveyed home to her fathers house an opportunity for which occurred on the following day  the domestics could not help thinking it remarkable how soon the loss of miss vere and the strange manner in which it had happened seemed to be forgotten by the other guests at the castle they knew not that those the most interested in her fate were well acquainted with the cause of her being carried off and the place of her retreat and that the others in the anxious and doubtful moments which preceded the breaking forth of a conspiracy were little accessible to any feelings but what arose immediately out of their own machinations    chapter xii       some one way some anotherdo you know      where we may apprehend her  the researches after miss vere were for the sake of appearances perhaps resumed on the succeeding day with similar bad success and the party were returning towards ellieslaw in the evening  it is singular said mareschal to ratcliffe that four horsemen and a female prisoner should have passed through the country without leaving the slightest trace of their passage one would think they had traversed the air or sunk through the ground  men may often answered ratcliffe arrive at the knowledge of that which is from discovering that which is not we have now scoured every road path and track leading from the castle in all the various points of the compass saving only that intricate and difficult pass which leads southward down the westburn and through the morasses  and why have we not examined that said mareschal  o mr vere can best answer that question replied his companion dryly  then i will ask it instantly said mareschal and addressing mr vere i am informed sir said he there is a path we have not examined leading by westburnflat  o said sir frederick laughing we know the owner of westburnflat wella wild lad that knows little difference between his neighbours goods and his own but withal very honest to his principles he would disturb nothing belonging to ellieslaw  besides said mr vere smiling mysteriously he had other tow on his distaff last night have you not heard young elliot of the heughfoot has had his house burnt and his cattle driven away because he refused to give up his arms to some honest men that think of starting for the king  the company smiled upon each other as at hearing of an exploit which favoured their own views  yet nevertheless resumed mareschal i think we ought to ride in this direction also otherwise we shall certainly be blamed for our negligence  no reasonable objection could be offered to this proposal and the party turned their horses heads towards westburnflat  they had not proceeded very far in that direction when the trampling of horses was heard and a small body of riders were perceived advancing to meet them  there comes earnscliff said mareschal i know his bright bay with the star in his front  and there is my daughter along with him exclaimed vere furiously who shall call my suspicions false or injurious now gentlemenfriendslend me the assistance of your swords for the recovery of my child  he unsheathed his weapon and was imitated by sir frederick and several of the party who prepared to charge those that were advancing towards them but the greater part hesitated  they come to us in all peace and security said mareschalwells let us first hear what account they give us of this mysterious affair if miss vere has sustained the slightest insult or injury from earnscliff i will be first to revenge her but let us hear what they say  you do me wrong by your suspicions mareschal continued vere you are the last i would have expected to hear express them  you injure yourself ellieslaw by your violence though the cause may excuse it  he then advanced a little before the rest and called out with a loud voicestand mr earnscliff or do you and miss vere advance alone to meet us you are charged with having carried that lady off from her fathers house and we are here in arms to shed our best blood for her recovery and for bringing to justice those who have injured her  and who would do that more willingly than i mr mareschal said earnscliff haughtilythan i who had the satisfaction this morning to liberate her from the dungeon in which i found her confined and who am now escorting her back to the castle of ellieslaw  is this so miss vere said mareschal  it is answered isabella eagerlyit is so for heavens sake sheathe your swords i will swear by all that is sacred that i was carried off by ruffians whose persons and object were alike unknown to me and am now restored to freedom by means of this gentlemans gallant interference  by whom and wherefore could this have been done pursued mareschalhad you no knowledge of the place to which you were conveyedearnscliff where did you find this lady  but ere either question could be answered ellieslaw advanced and returning his sword to the scabbard cut short the conference  when i know he said exactly how much i owe to mr earnscliff he may rely on suitable acknowledgments meantime taking the bridle of miss veres horse thus far i thank him for replacing my daughter in the power of her natural guardian  a sullen bend of the head was returned by earnscliff with equal haughtiness and ellieslaw turning back with his daughter upon the road to his own house appeared engaged with her in a conference so earnest that the rest of the company judged it improper to intrude by approaching them too nearly in the meantime earnscliff as he took leave of the other gentlemen belonging to ellieslaws party said aloud although i am unconscious of any circumstance in my conduct that can authorize such a suspicion i cannot but observe that mr vere seems to believe that i have had some hand in the atrocious violence which has been offered to his daughter i request you gentlemen to take notice of my explicit denial of a charge so dishonourable and that although i can pardon the bewildering feelings of a father in such a moment yet if any other gentleman he looked hard at sir frederick langley thinks my word and that of miss vere with the evidence of my friends who accompany me too slight for my exculpation i will be happymost happyto repel the charge as becomes a man who counts his honour dearer than his life  and ill be his second said simon of hackburn and take up ony twa o ye gentle or semple laird or loon its a ane to simon  who is that roughlooking fellow said sir frederick langley and what has he to do with the quarrels of gentlemen  ise be a lad frae the hie teiot said simon and ise quarrel wi ony body i like except the king or the laird i live under  come said mareschal let us have no brawlsmr earnscliff although we do not think alike in some things i trust we may be opponents even enemies if fortune will have it so without losing our respect for birth fairplay and each other i believe you as innocent of this matter as i am myself and i will pledge myself that my cousin ellieslaw as soon as the perplexity attending these sudden events has left his judgment to its free exercise shall handsomely acknowledge the very important service you have this day rendered him  to have served your cousin is a sufficient reward in itselfgood evening gentlemen continued earnscliff i see most of your party are already on their way to ellieslaw  then saluting mareschal with courtesy and the rest of the party with indifference earnscliff turned his horse and rode towards the heughfoot to concert measures with hobbie elliot for farther researches after his bride of whose restoration to her friends he was still ignorant  there he goes said mareschal he is a fine gallant young fellow upon my soul and yet i should like well to have a thrust with him on the green turf i was reckoned at college nearly his equal with the foils and i should like to try him at sharps  in my opinion answered sir frederick langley we have done very ill in having suffered him and those men who are with him to go off without taking away their arms for the whigs are very likely to draw to a head under such a sprightly young fellow as that  for shame sir frederick exclaimed mareschal do you think that ellieslaw could in honour consent to any violence being offered to earnscliff when he entered his bounds only to bring back his daughter or if he were to be of your opinion do you think that i and the rest of these gentlemen would disgrace ourselves by assisting in such a transaction no no fair play and auld scotland for ever when the sword is drawn i will be as ready to use it as any man but while it is in the sheath let us behave like gentlemen and neighbours  soon after this colloquy they reached the castle when ellieslaw who had been arrived a few minutes before met them in the courtyard  how is miss vere and have you learned the cause of her being carried off asked mareschal hastily  she is retired to her apartment greatly fatigued and i cannot expect much light upon her adventure till her spirits are somewhat recruited replied her father she and i were not the less obliged to you mareschal and to my other friends for their kind enquiries but i must suppress the fathers feelings for a while to give myself up to those of the patriot you know this is the day fixed for our final decisiontime pressesour friends are arriving and i have opened house not only for the gentry but for the under spurleathers whom we must necessarily employ we have therefore little time to prepare to meet themlook over these lists marchie an abbreviation by which mareschalwells was known among his friends do you sir frederick read these letters from lothian and the westall is ripe for the sickle and we have but to summon out the reapers  with all my heart said mareschal the more mischief the better sport  sir frederick looked grave and disconcerted  walk aside with me my good friend said ellieslaw to the sombre baronet i have something for your private ear with which i know you will be gratified  they walked into the house leaving ratcliffe and mareschal standing together in the court  and so said ratcliffe the gentlemen of your political persuasion think the downfall of this government so certain that they disdain even to throw a decent disguise over the machinations of their party  faith mr ratcliffe answered mareschal the actions and sentiments your friends may require to be veiled but i am better pleased that ours can go barefaced  and is it possible continued ratcliffe that you who notwithstanding pour thoughtlessness and heat of temper i beg pardon mr mareschal i am a plain manthat you who notwithstanding these constitutional defects possess natural good sense and acquired information should be infatuated enough to embroil yourself in such desperate proceedings how does your head feel when you are engaged in these dangerous conferences  not quite so secure on my shoulders answered mareschal as if i were talking of hunting and hawking i am not of so indifferent a mould as my cousin ellieslaw who speaks treason as if it were a childs nursery rhymes and loses and recovers that sweet girl his daughter with a good deal less emotion on both occasions than would have affected me had i lost and recovered a greyhound puppy my temper is not quite so inflexible nor my hate against government so inveterate as to blind me to the full danger of the attempt  then why involve yourself in it said ratcliffe  why i love this poor exiled king with all my heart and my father was an old killiecrankie man and i long to see some amends on the unionist courtiers that have bought and sold old scotland whose crown has been so long independent  and for the sake of these shadows said his monitor you are going to involve your country in war and yourself in trouble  i involve nobut trouble for trouble i had rather it came tomorrow than a month hence come i know it will and as your country folks say better soon than syneit will never find me youngerand as for hanging as sir john falstaff says i can become a gallows as well as another you know the end of the old ballad       sae dauntonly sae wantonly      sae rantingly gaed he      he playd a spring and danced a round      beneath the gallows tree  mr mareschal i am sorry for you said his grave adviser  i am obliged to you mr ratcliffe but i would not have you judge of our enterprise by my way of vindicating it there are wiser heads than mine at the work  wiser heads than yours may lie as low said ratcliffe in a warning tone  perhaps so but no lighter heart shall and to prevent it being made heavier by your remonstrances i will bid you adieu mr ratcliffe till dinnertime when you shall see that my apprehensions have not spoiled my appetite    chapter xiii       to face the garment of rebellion      with some fine colour that may please the eye      of fickle changelings and poor discontents      which gape and rub the elbow at the news      of hurlyburly innovationhenry the fourth part ii  there had been great preparations made at ellieslaw castle for the entertainment on this important day when not only the gentlemen of note in the neighbourhood attached to the jacobite interest were expected to rendezvous but also many subordinate malecontents whom difficulty of circumstances love of change resentment against england or any of the numerous causes which inflamed mens passions at the time rendered apt to join in perilous enterprise the men of rank and substance were not many in number for almost all the large proprietors stood aloof and most of the smaller gentry and yeomanry were of the presbyterian persuasion and therefore however displeased with the union unwilling to engage in a jacobite conspiracy but there were some gentlemen of property who either from early principle from religious motives or sharing the ambitious views of ellieslaw had given countenance to his scheme and there were also some fiery young men like mareschal desirous of signalizing themselves by engaging in a dangerous enterprise by which they hoped to vindicate the independence of their country the other members of the party were persons of inferior rank and desperate fortunes who were now ready to rise in that part of the country as they did afterwards in the year 1715 under forster and derwentwater when a troop commanded by a border gentleman named douglas consisted almost entirely of freebooters among whom the notorious luckinabag as he was called held a distinguished command we think it necessary to mention these particulars applicable solely to the province in which our scene lies because unquestionably the jacobite party in the other parts of the kingdom consisted of much more formidable as well as much more respectable materials  one long table extended itself down the ample hall of ellieslaw castle which was still left much in the state in which it had been one hundred years before stretching that is in gloomy length along the whole side of the castle vaulted with ribbed arches of freestone the groins of which sprung from projecting figures that carved into all the wild forms which the fantastic imagination of a gothic architect could devise grinned frowned and gnashed their tusks at the assembly below long narrow windows lighted the banqueting room on both sides filled up with stained glass through which the sun emitted a dusky and discoloured light a banner which tradition averred to have been taken from the english at the battle of sark waved over the chair in which ellieslaw presided as if to inflame the courage of the guests by reminding them of ancient victories over their neighbours he himself a portly figure dressed on this occasion with uncommon care and with features which though of a stern and sinister expression might well be termed handsome looked the old feudal baron extremely well sir frederick langley was placed on his right hand and mr mareschal of mareschalwells on his left some gentlemen of consideration with their sons brothers and nephews were seated at the upper end of the table and among these mr ratcliffe had his place beneath the saltcellar a massive piece of plate which occupied the midst of the table sate the sine nomine turba men whose vanity was gratified by holding even this subordinate space at the social board while the distinction observed in ranking them was a salve to the pride of their superiors that the lower house was not very select must be admitted since willie of westburnflat was one of the party the unabashed audacity of this fellow in daring to present himself in the house of a gentleman to whom he had just offered so flagrant an insult can only be accounted for by supposing him conscious that his share in carrying off miss vere was a secret safe in her possession and that of her father  before this numerous and miscellaneous party was placed a dinner consisting not indeed of the delicacies of the season as the newspapers express it but of viands ample solid and sumptuous under which the very board groaned but the mirth was not in proportion to the good cheer the lower end of the table were for some time chilled by constraint and respect on finding themselves members of so august an assembly and those who were placed around it had those feelings of awe with which p p clerk of the parish describes himself oppressed when he first uplifted the psalm in presence of those persons of high worship the wise mr justice freeman the good lady jones and the great sir thomas truby this ceremonious frost however soon gave way before the incentives to merriment which were liberally supplied and as liberally consumed by the guests of the lower description they became talkative loud and even clamorous in their mirth  but it was not in the power of wine or brandy to elevate the spirits of those who held the higher places at the banquet they experienced the chilling revulsion of spirits which often takes place when men are called upon to take a desperate resolution after having placed themselves in circumstances where it is alike difficult to advance or to recede the precipice looked deeper and more dangerous as they approached the brink and each waited with an inward emotion of awe expecting which of his confederates would set the example by plunging himself down this inward sensation of fear and reluctance acted differently according to the various habits and characters of the company one looked grave another looked silly a third gazed with apprehension on the empty seats at the higher end of the table designed for members of the conspiracy whose prudence had prevailed over their political zeal and who had absented themselves from their consultations at this critical period and some seemed to be reckoning up in their minds the comparative rank and prospects of those who were present and absent sir frederick langley was reserved moody and discontented ellieslaw himself made such forced efforts to raise the spirits of the company as plainly marked the flagging of his own ratcliffe watched the scene with the composure of a vigilant but uninterested spectator mareschal alone true to the thoughtless vivacity of his character ate and drank laughed and jested and seemed even to find amusement in the embarrassment of the company  what has damped our noble courage this morning he exclaimed we seem to be met at a funeral where the chief mourners must not speak above their breath while the mutes and the saulies looking to the lower end of the table are carousing below ellieslaw when will you lift to lift meaning to lift the coffin is the common expression for commencing a funeral where sleeps your spirit man and what has quelled the high hope of the knight of langleydale  you speak like a madman said ellieslaw do you not see how many are absent  and what of that said mareschal did you not know before that onehalf of the world are better talkers than doers for my part i am much encouraged by seeing at least twothirds of our friends true to the rendezvous though i suspect onehalf of these came to secure the dinner in case of the worst  there is no news from the coast which can amount to certainty of the kings arrival said another of the company in that tone of subdued and tremulous whisper which implies a failure of resolution  not a line from the earl of d nor a single gentleman from the southern side of the border said a third  who is he that wishes for more men from england exclaimed mareschal in a theatrical tone of affected heroism       my cousin ellieslaw  no my fair cousin      if we are doomd to die  for gods sake said ellieslaw spare us your folly at present mareschal  well then said his kinsman ill bestow my wisdom upon you instead such as it is if we have gone forward like fools do not let us go back like cowards we have done enough to draw upon us both the suspicion and vengeance of the government do not let us give up before we have done something to deserve itwhat will no one speak then ill leap the ditch the first and starting up he filled a beerglass to the brim with claret and waving his hand commanded all to follow his example and to rise up from their seats all obeyedthe more qualified guests as if passively the others with enthusiasm then my friends i give you the pledge of the daythe independence of scotland and the health of our lawful sovereign king james the eighth now landed in lothian and as i trust and believe in full possession of his ancient capital  he quaffed off the wine and threw the glass over his head  it should never he said be profaned by a meaner toast  all followed his example and amid the crash of glasses and the shouts of the company pledged themselves to stand or fall with the principles and political interest which their toast expressed  you have leaped the ditch with a witness said ellieslaw apart to mareschal but i believe it is all for the best at all events we cannot now retreat from our undertaking one man alone looking at ratcliffe has refused the pledge but of that by and by  then rising up he addressed the company in a style of inflammatory invective against the government and its measures but especially the union a treaty by means of which he affirmed scotland had been at once cheated of her independence her commerce and her honour and laid as a fettered slave at the foot of the rival against whom through such a length of ages through so many dangers and by so much blood she had honourably defended her rights this was touching a theme which found a responsive chord in the bosom of every man present  our commerce is destroyed hollowed old john rewcastle a jedburgh smuggler from the lower end of the table  our agriculture is ruined said the laird of brokengirthflow a territory which since the days of adam had borne nothing but ling and whortleberries  our religion is cut up root and branch said the pimplenosed pastor of the episcopal meetinghouse at kirkwhistle  we shall shortly neither dare shoot a deer nor kiss a wench without a certificate from the presbytery and kirktreasurer said mareschalwells  or make a brandy jeroboam in a frosty morning without license from a commissioner of excise said the smuggler  or ride over the fell in a moonless night said westburnflat without asking leave of young earnscliff or some englified justice of the peace thae were gude days on the border when there was neither peace nor justice heard of  let us remember our wrongs at darien and glencoe continued ellieslaw and take arms for the protection of our rights our fortunes our lives and our families  think upon genuine episcopal ordination without which there can be no lawful clergy said the divine  think of the piracies committed on our eastindian trade by green and the english thieves said william willieson halfowner and sole skipper of a brig that made four voyages annually between cockpool and whitehaven  remember your liberties rejoined mareschal who seemed to take a mischievous delight in precipitating the movements of the enthusiasm which he had excited like a roguish boy who having lifted the sluice of a milldam enjoys the clatter of the wheels which he has put in motion without thinking of the mischief he may have occasioned remember your liberties he exclaimed confound cess press and presbytery and the memory of old willie that first brought them upon us  damn the gauger echoed old john rewcastle ill cleave him wi my ain hand  and confound the countrykeeper and the constable reechoed westburnflat ill weize a brace of balls through them before morning  we are agreed then said ellieslaw when the shouts had somewhat subsided to bear this state of things no longer  we are agreed to a man answered his guests  not literally so said mr ratcliffe for though i cannot hope to assuage the violent symptoms which seem so suddenly to have seized upon the company yet i beg to observe that so far as the opinion of a single member goes i do not entirely coincide in the list of grievances which has been announced and that i do utterly protest against the frantic measures which you seem disposed to adopt for removing them i can easily suppose much of what has been spoken may have arisen out of the heat of the moment or have been said perhaps in jest but there are some jests of a nature very apt to transpire and you ought to remember gentlemen that stonewalls have ears  stonewalls may have ears returned ellieslaw eyeing him with a look of triumphant malignity but domestic spies mr ratcliffe will soon find themselves without any if any such dares to continue his abode in a family where his coming was an unauthorized intrusion where his conduct has been that of a presumptuous meddler and from which his exit shall be that of a baffled knave if he does not know how to take a hint  mr vere returned ratcliffe with calm contempt i am fully aware that as soon as my presence becomes useless to you which it must through the rash step you are about to adopt it will immediately become unsafe to myself as it has always been hateful to you but i have one protection and it is a strong one for you would not willingly hear me detail before gentlemen and men of honour the singular circumstances in which our connexion took its rise as to the rest i rejoice at its conclusion and as i think that mr mareschal and some other gentlemen will guarantee the safety of my ears and of my throat for which last i have more reason to be apprehensive during the course of the night i shall not leave your castle till tomorrow morning  be it so sir replied mr vere you are entirely safe from my resentment because you are beneath it and not because i am afraid of your disclosing my family secrets although for your own sake i warn you to beware how you do so your agency and intermediation can be of little consequence to one who will win or lose all as lawful right or unjust usurpation shall succeed in the struggle that is about to ensue farewell sir  ratcliffe arose and cast upon him a look which vere seemed to sustain with difficulty and bowing to those around him left the room  this conversation made an impression on many of the company which ellieslaw hastened to dispel by entering upon the business of the day their hasty deliberations went to organize an immediate insurrection ellieslaw mareschal and sir frederick langley were chosen leaders with powers to direct their farther measures a place of rendezvous was appointed at which all agreed to meet early on the ensuing day with such followers and friends to the cause as each could collect around him several of the guests retired to make the necessary preparations and ellieslaw made a formal apology to the others who with westburnflat and the old smuggler continued to ply the bottle stanchly for leaving the head of the table as he must necessarily hold a separate and sober conference with the coadjutors whom they had associated with him in the command the apology was the more readily accepted as he prayed them at the same time to continue to amuse themselves with such refreshments as the cellars of the castle afforded shouts of applause followed their retreat and the names of vere langley and above all of mareschal were thundered forth in chorus and bathed with copious bumpers repeatedly during the remainder of the evening  when the principal conspirators had retired into a separate apartment they gazed on each other for a minute with a sort of embarrassment which in sir fredericks dark features amounted to an expression of discontented sullenness mareschal was the first to break the pause saying with a loud burst of laughter  well we are fairly embarked now gentlemenvogue la galere  we may thank you for the plunge said ellieslaw  yes but i dont know how far you will thank me answered mareschal when i show you this letter which i received just before we sat down my servant told me it was delivered by a man he had never seen before who went off at the gallop after charging him to put it into my own hand  ellieslaw impatiently opened the letter and read aloud  edinburgh  hond sir having obligations to your family which shall be nameless and learning that you are one of the company of adventurers doing business for the house of james and company late merchants in london now in dunkirk i think it right to send you this early and private information that the vessels you expected have been driven off the coast without having been able to break bulk or to land any part of their cargo and that the westcountry partners have resolved to withdraw their name from the firm as it must prove a losing concern having good hope you will avail yourself of this early information to do what is needful for your own security i rest your humble servant nihil nameless  for ralph mareschal of mareschalwells  these with care and speed  sir fredericks jaw dropped and his countenance blackened as the letter was read and ellieslaw exclaimedwhy this affects the very mainspring of our enterprise if the french fleet with the king on board has been chased off by the english as this dd scrawl seems to intimate where are we  just where we were this morning i think said mareschal still laughing  pardon me and a truce to your illtimed mirth mr mareschal this morning we were not committed publicly as we now stand committed by your own mad act when you had a letter in your pocket apprizing you that our undertaking was desperate  ay ay i expected you would say so but in the first place my friend nihil nameless and his letter may be all a flam and moreover i would have you know that i am tired of a party that does nothing but form bold resolutions overnight and sleep them away with their wine before morning the government are now unprovided of men and ammunition in a few weeks they will have enough of both the country is now in a flame against them in a few weeks betwixt the effects of selfinterest of fear and of lukewarm indifference which are already so visible this first fervour will be as cold as christmas so as i was determined to go the vole i have taken care you shall dip as deep as i it signifies nothing plunging you are fairly in the bog and must struggle through  you are mistaken with respect to one of us mr mareschal said sir frederick langley and applying himself to the bell he desired the person who entered to order his servants and horses instantly  you must not leave us sir frederick said ellieslaw if we have our musters to go over  i will go tonight mr vere said sir frederick and write you my intentions in this matter when i am at home  ay said mareschal and send them by a troop of horse from carlisle to make us prisoners look ye sir frederick i for one will neither be deserted nor betrayed and if you leave ellieslaw castle tonight it shall be by passing over my dead body  for shame mareschal said mr vere how can you so hastily misinterpret our friends intentions i am sure sir frederick can only be jesting with us for were he not too honourable to dream of deserting the cause he cannot but remember the full proofs we have of his accession to it and his eager activity in advancing it he cannot but be conscious besides that the first information will be readily received by government and that if the question be which can first lodge intelligence of the affair we can easily save a few hours on him  you should say you and not we when you talk of priorities in such a race of treachery for my part i wont enter my horse for such a plate said mareschal and added betwixit his teeth a pretty pair of fellows to trust a mans neck with  i am not to be intimidated from doing what i think proper said sir frederick langley and my first step shall be to leave ellieslaw i have no reason to keep faith with one looking at vere who has kept none with me  in what respect said ellieslaw silencing with a motion of his hand his impetuous kinsmanhow have i disappointed you sir frederick  in the nearest and most tender pointyou have trifled with me concerning our proposed alliance which you well knew was the gage of our political undertaking this carrying off and this bringing back of miss verethe cold reception i have met with from her and the excuses with which you cover it i believe to be mere evasions that you may yourself retain possession of the estates which are hers by right and make me in the meanwhile a tool in your desperate enterprise by holding out hopes and expectations which you are resolved never to realize  sir frederick i protest by all that is sacred  i will listen to no protestations i have been cheated with them too long answered sir frederick  if you leave us said ellieslaw you cannot but know both your ruin and ours is certain all depends on our adhering together  leave me to take care of myself returned the knight but were what you say true i would rather perish than be fooled any farther  can nothingno surety convince you of my sincerity said ellieslaw anxiously this morning i should have repelled your unjust suspicions as an insult but situated as we now are  you feel yourself compelled to be sincere retorted sir frederick if you would have me think so there is but one way to convince me of itlet your daughter bestow her hand on me this evening  so soonimpossible answered vere think of her late alarmof our present undertaking  i will listen to nothing but to her consent plighted at the altar you have a chapel in the castledoctor hobbler is present among the companythis proof of your good faith tonight and we are again joined in heart and hand if you refuse me when it is so much for your advantage to consent how shall i trust you tomorrow when i shall stand committed in your undertaking and unable to retract  and i am to understand that if you can be made my soninlaw tonight our friendship is renewed said ellieslaw  most infallibly and most inviolably replied sir frederick  then said vere though what you ask is premature indelicate and unjust towards my character yet sir frederick give me your handmy daughter shall be your wife  this night  this very night replied ellieslaw before the clock strikes twelve  with her own consent i trust said mareschal for i promise you both gentlemen i will not stand tamely by and see any violence put on the will of my pretty kinswoman  another pest in this hotheaded fellow muttered ellieslaw and then aloud with her own consent for what do you take me mareschal that you should suppose your interference necessary to protect my daughter against her father depend upon it she has no repugnance to sir frederick langley  or rather to be called lady langley faith like enoughthere are many women might be of her mind and i beg your pardon but these sudden demands and concessions alarmed me a little on her account  it is only the suddenness of the proposal that embarrasses me said ellieslaw but perhaps if she is found intractable sir frederick will consider  i will consider nothing mr vereyour daughters hand tonight or i depart were it at midnightthere is my ultimatum  i embrace it said ellieslaw and i will leave you to talk upon our military preparations while i go to prepare my daughter for so sudden a change of condition  so saying he left the company    chapter xiv       he brings earl osmond to receive my vows      o dreadful change  for tancred haughty osmond      tancred and sigismunda  mr vere whom long practice of dissimulation had enabled to model his very gait and footsteps to aid the purposes of deception walked along the stone passage and up the first flight of steps towards miss veres apartment with the alert firm and steady pace of one who is bound indeed upon important business but who entertains no doubt he can terminate his affairs satisfactorily but when out of hearing of the gentlemen whom he had left his step became so slow and irresolute as to correspond with his doubts and his fears at length he paused in an antechamber to collect his ideas and form his plan of argument before approaching his daughter  in what more hopeless and inextricable dilemma was ever an unfortunate man involved such was the tenor of his reflectionsif we now fall to pieces by disunion there can be little doubt that the government will take my life as the prime agitator of the insurrection or grant i could stoop to save myself by a hasty submission am i not even in that case utterly ruined i have broken irreconcilably with ratcliffe and can have nothing to expect from that quarter but insult and persecution i must wander forth an impoverished and dishonoured man without even the means of sustaining life far less wealth sufficient to counterbalance the infamy which my countrymen both those whom i desert and those whom i join will attach to the name of the political renegade it is not to be thought of and yet what choice remains between this lot and the ignominious scaffold nothing can save me but reconciliation with these men and to accomplish this i have promised to langley that isabella shall marry him ere midnight and to mareschal that she shall do so without compulsion i have but one remedy betwixt me and ruinher consent to take a suitor whom she dislikes upon such short notice as would disgust her even were he a favoured loverbut i must trust to the romantic generosity of her disposition and let me paint the necessity of her obedience ever so strongly i cannot overcharge its reality  having finished this sad chain of reflections upon his perilous condition he entered his daughters apartment with every nerve bent up to the support of the argument which he was about to sustain though a deceitful and ambitious man he was not so devoid of natural affection but that he was shocked at the part he was about to act in practising on the feelings of a dutiful and affectionate child but the recollections that if he succeeded his daughter would only be trepanned into an advantageous match and that if he failed he himself was a lost man were quite sufficient to drown all scruples  he found miss vere seated by the window of her dressingroom her head reclining on her hand and either sunk in slumber or so deeply engaged in meditation that she did not hear the noise he made at his entrance he approached with his features composed to a deep expression of sorrow and sympathy and sitting down beside her solicited her attention by quietly taking her hand a motion which he did not fail to accompany with a deep sigh  my father said isabella with a sort of start which expressed at least as much fear as joy or affection  yes isabella said vere your unhappy father who comes now as a penitent to crave forgiveness of his daughter for an injury done to her in the excess of his affection and then to take leave of her for ever  sir offence to me take leave for ever what does all this mean said miss vere  yes isabella i am serious but first let me ask you have you no suspicion that i may have been privy to the strange chance which befell you yesterday morning  you sir answered isabella stammering between a consciousness that he had guessed her thoughts justly and the shame as well as fear which forbade her to acknowledge a suspicion so degrading and so unnatural  yes he continued your hesitation confesses that you entertained such an opinion and i have now the painful task of acknowledging that your suspicions have done me no injustice but listen to my motives in an evil hour i countenanced the addresses of sir frederick langley conceiving it impossible that you could have any permanent objections to a match where the advantages were in most respects on your side in a worse i entered with him into measures calculated to restore our banished monarch and the independence of my country he has taken advantage of my unguarded confidence and now has my life at his disposal  your life sir said isabella faintly  yes isabella continued her father the life of him who gave life to you so soon as i foresaw the excesses into which his headlong passion for to do him justice i believe his unreasonable conduct arises from excess of attachment to you was likely to hurry him i endeavoured by finding a plausible pretext for your absence for some weeks to extricate myself from the dilemma in which i am placed for this purpose i wished in case your objections to the match continued insurmountable to have sent you privately for a few months to the convent of your maternal aunt at paris by a series of mistakes you have been brought from the place of secrecy and security which i had destined for your temporary abode fate has baffled my last chance of escape and i have only to give you my blessing and send you from the castle with mr ratcliffe who now leaves it my own fate will soon be decided  good heaven sir can this be possible exclaimed isabella o why was i freed from the restraint in which you placed me or why did you not impart your pleasure to me  think an instant isabella would you have had me prejudice in your opinion the friend i was most desirous of serving by communicating to you the injurious eagerness with which he pursued his object could i do so honourably having promised to assist his suitbut it is all over i and mareschal have made up our minds to die like men it only remains to send you from hence under a safe escort  great powers and is there no remedy said the terrified young woman  none my child answered vere gently unless one which you would not advise your father to adoptto be the first to betray his friends  o no no she answered abhorrently yet hastily as if to reject the temptation which the alternative presented to her but is there no other hopethrough flightthrough mediationthrough supplicationi will bend my knee to sir frederick  it would be a fruitless degradation he is determined on his course and i am equally resolved to stand the hazard of my fate on one condition only he will turn aside from his purpose and that condition my lips shall never utter to you  name it i conjure you my dear father exclaimed isabella what can he ask that we ought not to grant to prevent the hideous catastrophe with which you are threatened  that isabella said vere solemnly you shall never know until your fathers head has rolled on the bloody scaffold then indeed you will learn there was one sacrifice by which he might have been saved  and why not speak it now said isabella do you fear i would flinch from the sacrifice of fortune for your preservation or would you bequeath me the bitter legacy of lifelong remorse so oft as i shall think that you perished while there remained one mode of preventing the dreadful misfortune that overhangs you  then my child said vere since you press me to name what i would a thousand times rather leave in silence i must inform you that he will accept for ransom nothing but your hand in marriage and that conferred before midnight this very evening  this evening sir said the young lady struck with horror at the proposaland to such a mana mana monster who could wish to win the daughter by threatening the life of the fatherit is impossible  you say right my child answered her father it is indeed impossible nor have i either the right or the wish to exact such a sacrificeit is the course of nature that the old should die and be forgot and the young should live and be happy  my father die and his child can save himbut nonomy dear father pardon me it is impossible you only wish to guide me to your wishes i know your object is what you think my happiness and this dreadful tale is only told to influence my conduct and subdue my scruples  my daughter replied ellieslaw in a tone where offended authority seemed to struggle with parental affection my child suspects me of inventing a false tale to work upon her feelings even this i must bear and even from this unworthy suspicion i must descend to vindicate myself you know the stainless honour of your cousin mareschalmark what i shall write to him and judge from his answer if the danger in which we stand is not real and whether i have not used every means to avert it  he sate down wrote a few lines hastily and handed them to isabella who after repeated and painful efforts cleared her eyes and head sufficiently to discern their purport  dear cousin said the billet i find my daughter as i expected in despair at the untimely and premature urgency of sir frederick langley she cannot even comprehend the peril in which we stand or how much we are in his poweruse your influence with him for heavens sake to modify proposals to the acceptance of which i cannot and will not urge my child against all her own feelings as well as those of delicacy and propriety and oblige your loving cousinr v  in the agitation of the moment when her swimming eyes and dizzy brain could hardly comprehend the sense of what she looked upon it is not surprising that miss vere should have omitted to remark that this letter seemed to rest her scruples rather upon the form and time of the proposed union than on a rooted dislike to the suitor proposed to her mr vere rang the bell and gave the letter to a servant to be delivered to mr mareschal and rising from his chair continued to traverse the apartment in silence and in great agitation until the answer was returned he glanced it over and wrung the hand of his daughter as he gave it to her the tenor was as follows  my dear kinsman i have already urged the knight on the point you mention and i find him as fixed as cheviot i am truly sorry my fair cousin should be pressed to give up any of her maidenly rights sir frederick consents however to leave the castle with me the instant the ceremony is performed and we will raise our followers and begin the fray thus there is great hope the bridegroom may be knocked on the head before he and the bride can meet again so bell has a fair chance to be lady langley a tres bon marche for the rest i can only say that if she can make up her mind to the alliance at allit is no time for mere maiden ceremonymy pretty cousin must needs consent to marry in haste or we shall all repent at leisure or rather have very little leisure to repent which is all at present from him who rests your affectionate kinsmanr m  pstell isabella that i would rather cut the knights throat after all and end the dilemma that way than see her constrained to marry him against her will  when isabella had read this letter it dropped from her hand and she would at the same time have fallen from her chair had she not been supported by her father  my god my child will die exclaimed vere the feelings of nature overcoming even in his breast the sentiments of selfish policy look up isabellalook up my childcome what will you shall not be the sacrificei will fall myself with the consciousness i leave you happymy child may weep on my grave but she shall notnot in this instancereproach my memory he called a servantgo bid ratcliffe come hither directly  during this interval miss vere became deadly pale clenched her hands pressing the palms strongly together closed her eyes and drew her lips with strong compression as if the severe constraint which she put upon her internal feelings extended even to her muscular organization then raising her head and drawing in her breath strongly ere she spoke she said with firmnessfather i consent to the marriage  you shall notyou shall notmy childmy dear childyou shall not embrace certain misery to free me from uncertain danger  so exclaimed ellieslaw and strange and inconsistent beings that we are he expressed the real though momentary feelings of his heart  father repeated isabella i will consent to this marriage  no my child nonot now at leastwe will humble ourselves to obtain delay from him and yet isabella could you overcome a dislike which has no real foundation think in other respects what a matchwealthrankimportance  father reiterated isabella i have consented  it seemed as if she had lost the power of saying anything else or even of varying the phrase which with such effort she had compelled herself to utter  heaven bless thee my childheaven bless theeand it will bless thee with riches with pleasure with power  miss vere faintly entreated to be left by herself for the rest of the evening  but will you not receive sir frederick said her father anxiously  i will meet him she replied i will meet himwhen i must and where i must but spare me now  be it so my dearest you shall know no restraint that i can save you from do not think too hardly of sir frederick for thisit is an excess of passion  isabella waved her hand impatiently  forgive me my childi goheaven bless thee at elevenif you call me not beforeat eleven i come to seek you  when he left isabella she dropped upon her kneesheaven aid me to support the resolution i have takenheaven only cano poor earnscliff who shall comfort him and with what contempt will he pronounce her name who listened to him today and gave herself to another at night but let him despise mebetter so than that he should know the truthlet him despise me if it will but lessen his grief i should feel comfort in the loss of his esteem  she wept bitterly attempting in vain from time to time to commence the prayer for which she had sunk on her knees but unable to calm her spirits sufficiently for the exercise of devotion as she remained in this agony of mind the door of her apartment was slowly opened    chapter xv       the darksome cave they enter where they found      the woful man low sitting on the ground      musing full sadly in his sullen mindfaery queen  the intruder on miss veres sorrows was ratcliffe ellieslaw had in the agitation of his mind forgotten to countermand the order he had given to call him thither so that he opened the door with the words you sent for me mr vere then looking aroundmiss vere alone on the ground and in tears  leave meleave me mr ratcliffe said the unhappy young lady  i must not leave you said ratcliffe i have been repeatedly requesting admittance to take my leave of you and have been refused until your father himself sent for me blame me not if i am bold and intrusive i have a duty to discharge which makes me so  i cannot listen to youi cannot speak to you mr ratcliffe take my best wishes and for gods sake leave me  tell me only said ratcliffe is it true that this monstrous match is to go forward and this very night i heard the servants proclaim it as i was on the great staircasei heard the directions given to clear out the chapel  spare me mr ratcliffe replied the luckless bride and from the state in which you see me judge of the cruelty of these questions  married to sir frederick langley and this night it must not cannotshall not be  it must be mr ratcliff or my father is ruined  ah i understand answered ratcliffe and you have sacrificed yourself to save him whobut let the virtue of the child atone for the faults of the father it is no time to rake them upwhat can be done time pressesi know but one remedywith fourandtwenty hours i might find manymiss vere you must implore the protection of the only human being who has it in his power to control the course of events which threatens to hurry you before it  and what human being answered miss vere has such power  start not when i name him said ratcliffe coming near her and speaking in a low but distinct voice it is he who is called elshender the recluse of mucklestanemoor  you are mad mr ratcliffe or you mean to insult my misery by an illtimed jest  i am as much in my senses young lady answered her adviser as you are and i am no idle jester far less with misery least of all with your misery i swear to you that this being who is other far than what he seems actually possesses the means of redeeming you from this hateful union  and of insuring my fathers safety  yes even that said ratcliffe if you plead his cause with himyet how to obtain admittance to the recluse  fear not that said miss vere suddenly recollecting the incident of the rose i remember he desired me to call upon him for aid in my extremity and gave me this flower as a token ere it faded away entirely i would need he said his assistance is it possible his words can have been aught but the ravings of insanity  doubt it not fear it notbut above all said ratcliffe let us lose no timeare you at liberty and unwatched  i believe so said isabella but what would you have me to do  leave the castle instantly said ratcliffe and throw yourself at the feet of this extraordinary man who in circumstances that seem to argue the extremity of the most contemptible poverty possesses yet an almost absolute influence over your fateguests and servants are deep in their carousethe leaders sitting in conclave on their treasonable schemesmy horse stands ready in the stablei will saddle one for you and meet you at the little gardengateo let no doubt of my prudence or fidelity prevent your taking the only step in your power to escape the dreadful fate which must attend the wife of sir frederick langley  mr ratcliffe said miss vere you have always been esteemed a man of honour and probity and a drowning wretch will always catch at the feeblest twigi will trust youi will follow your advicei will meet you at the gardengate  she bolted the outerdoor of her apartment as soon as mr ratcliffe left her and descended to the garden by a separate stair of communication which opened to her dressingroom on the way she felt inclined to retract the consent she had so hastily given to a plan so hopeless and extravagant but as she passed in her descent a private door which entered into the chapel from the backstair she heard the voice of the femaleservants as they were employed in the task of cleaning it  married and to sae bad a manewhow sirs onything rather than that  they are rightthey are right said miss vere anything rather than that  she hurried to the garden mr ratcliffe was true to his appointmentthe horses stood saddled at the gardengate and in a few minutes they were advancing rapidly towards the hut of the solitary  while the ground was favourable the speed of their journey was such as to prevent much communication but when a steep ascent compelled them to slacken their pace a new cause of apprehension occurred to miss veres mind  mr ratcliffe she said pulling up her horses bridle let us prosecute no farther a journey which nothing but the extreme agitation of my mind can vindicate my having undertakeni am well aware that this man passes among the vulgar as being possessed of supernatural powers and carrying on an intercourse with beings of another world but i would have you aware i am neither to be imposed on by such follies nor were i to believe in their existence durst i with my feelings of religion apply to this being in my distress  i should have thought miss vere replied ratcliffe my character and habits of thinking were so well known to you that you might have held me exculpated from crediting in such absurdity  but in what other mode said isabella can a being so miserable himself in appearance possess the power of assisting me  miss vere said ratcliffe after a momentary pause i am bound by a solemn oath of secrecyyou must without farther explanation be satisfied with my pledged assurance that he does possess the power if you can inspire him with the will and that i doubt not you will be able to do  mr ratcliffe said miss vere you may yourself be mistaken you ask an unlimited degree of confidence from me  recollect miss vere he replied that when in your humanity you asked me to interfere with your father in favour of haswell and his ruined familywhen you requested me to prevail on him to do a thing most abhorrent to his natureto forgive an injury and remit a penaltyi stipulated that you should ask me no questions concerning the sources of my influenceyou found no reason to distrust me then do not distrust me now  but the extraordinary mode of life of this man said miss vere his seclusionhis figurethe deepness of misanthropy which he is said to express in his languagemr ratcliffe what can i think of him if he really possesses the powers you ascribe to him  this man young lady was bred a catholic a sect which affords a thousand instances of those who have retired from power and affluence to voluntary privations more strict even than his  but he avows no religious motive replied miss vere  no replied ratcliffe disgust with the world has operated his retreat from it without assuming the veil of superstition thus far i may tell youhe was born to great wealth which his parents designed should become greater by his union with a kinswoman whom for that purpose they bred up in their own house you have seen his figure judge what the young lady must have thought of the lot to which she was destinedyet habituated to his appearance she showed no reluctance and the friends ofof the person whom i speak of doubted not that the excess of his attachment the various acquisitions of his mind his many and amiable qualities had overcome the natural horror which his destined bride must have entertained at an exterior so dreadfully inauspicious  and did they judge truly said isabella  you shall hear he at least was fully aware of his own deficiency the sense of it haunted him like a phantom i am was his own expression to mei mean to a man whom he trustedi am in spite of what you would say a poor miserable outcast fitter to have been smothered in the cradle than to have been brought up to scare the world in which i crawl the person whom he addressed in vain endeavoured to impress him with the indifference to external form which is the natural result of philosophy or entreat him to recall the superiority of mental talents to the more attractive attributes that are merely personal i hear you he would reply but you speak the voice of coldblooded stoicism or at least of friendly partiality but look at every book which we have read those excepted of that abstract philosophy which feels no responsive voice in our natural feelings is not personal form such as at least can be tolerated without horror and disgust always represented as essential to our ideas of a friend far more a lover is not such a misshapen monster as i am excluded by the very fiat of nature from her fairest enjoyments what but my wealth prevents allperhaps even letitia or youfrom shunning me as something foreign to your nature and more odious by bearing that distorted resemblance to humanity which we observe in the animal tribes that are more hateful to man because they seem his caricature  you repeat the sentiments of a madman said miss vere  no replied her conductor unless a morbid and excessive sensibility on such a subject can be termed insanity yet i will not deny that this governing feeling and apprehension carried the person who entertained it to lengths which indicated a deranged imagination he appeared to think that it was necessary for him by exuberant and not always wellchosen instances of liberality and even profusion to unite himself to the human race from which he conceived himself naturally dissevered the benefits which he bestowed from a disposition naturally philanthropical in an uncommon degree were exaggerated by the influence of the goading reflection that more was necessary from him than from otherslavishing his treasures as if to bribe mankind to receive him into their class it is scarcely necessary to say that the bounty which flowed from a source so capricious was often abused and his confidence frequently betrayed these disappointments which occur to all more or less and most to such as confer benefits without just discrimination his diseased fancy set down to the hatred and contempt excited by his personal deformitybut i fatigue you miss vere  no by no means ii could not prevent my attention from wandering an instant pray proceed  he became at length continued ratcliffe the most ingenious selftormentor of whom i have ever heard the scoff of the rabble and the sneer of the yet more brutal vulgar of his own rank was to him agony and breaking on the wheel he regarded the laugh of the common people whom he passed on the street and the suppressed titter or yet more offensive terror of the young girls to whom he was introduced in company as proofs of the true sense which the world entertained of him as a prodigy unfit to be received among them on the usual terms of society and as vindicating the wisdom of his purpose in withdrawing himself from among them on the faith and sincerity of two persons alone he seemed to rely implicitlyon that of his betrothed bride and of a friend eminently gifted in personal accomplishments who seemed and indeed probably was sincerely attached to him he ought to have been so at least for he was literally loaded with benefits by him whom you are now about to see the parents of the subject of my story died within a short space of each other their death postponed the marriage for which the day had been fixed the lady did not seem greatly to mourn this delayperhaps that was not to have been expected but she intimated no change of intention when after a decent interval a second day was named for their union the friend of whom i spoke was then a constant resident at the hall in an evil hour at the earnest request and entreaty of this friend they joined a general party where men of different political opinions were mingled and where they drank deep a quarrel ensued the friend of the recluse drew his sword with others and was thrown down and disarmed by a more powerful antagonist they fell in the struggle at the feet of the recluse who maimed and truncated as his form appears possesses nevertheless great strength as well as violent passions he caught up a sword pierced the heart of his friends antagonist was tried and his life with difficulty redeemed from justice at the expense of a years close imprisonment the punishment of manslaughter the incident affected him most deeply the more that the deceased was a man of excellent character and had sustained gross insult and injury ere he drew his sword i think from that moment i observedi beg pardonthe fits of morbid sensibility which had tormented this unfortunate gentleman were rendered henceforth more acute by remorse which he of all men was least capable of having incurred or of sustaining when it became his unhappy lot his paroxysms of agony could not be concealed from the lady to whom he was betrothed and it must be confessed they were of an alarming and fearful nature he comforted himself that at the expiry of his imprisonment he could form with his wife and friend a society encircled by which he might dispense with more extensive communication with the world he was deceived before that term elapsed his friend and his betrothed bride were man and wife the effects of a shock so dreadful on an ardent temperament a disposition already soured by bitter remorse and loosened by the indulgence of a gloomy imagination from the rest of mankind i cannot describe to you it was as if the last cable at which the vessel rode had suddenly parted and left her abandoned to all the wild fury of the tempest he was placed under medical restraint as a temporary measure this might have been justifiable but his hardhearted friend who in consequence of his marriage was now his nearest ally prolonged his confinement in order to enjoy the management of his immense estates there was one who owed his all to the sufferer an humble friend but grateful and faithful by unceasing exertion and repeated invocation of justice he at length succeeded in obtaining his patrons freedom and reinstatement in the management of his own property to which was soon added that of his intended bride who having died without male issue her estates reverted to him as heir of entail but freedom and wealth were unable to restore the equipoise of his mind to the former his grief made him indifferentthe latter only served him as far as it afforded him the means of indulging his strange and wayward fancy he had renounced the catholic religion but perhaps some of its doctrines continued to influence a mind over which remorse and misanthropy now assumed in appearance an unbounded authority his life has since been that alternately of a pilgrim and a hermit suffering the most severe privations not indeed in ascetic devotion but in abhorrence of mankind yet no mans words and actions have been at such a wide difference nor has any hypocritical wretch ever been more ingenious in assigning good motives for his vile actions than this unfortunate in reconciling to his abstract principles of misanthropy a conduct which flows from his natural generosity and kindness of feeling  still mr ratcliffestill you describe the inconsistencies of a madman  by no means replied ratcliffe that the imagination of this gentleman is disordered i will not pretend to dispute i have already told you that it has sometimes broken out into paroxysms approaching to real mental alienation but it is of his common state of mind that i speak it is irregular but not deranged the shades are as gradual as those that divide the light of noonday from midnight the courtier who ruins his fortune for the attainment of a title which can do him no good or power of which he can make no suitable or creditable use the miser who hoards his useless wealth and the prodigal who squanders it are all marked with a certain shade of insanity to criminals who are guilty of enormities when the temptation to a sober mind bears no proportion to the horror of the act or the probability of detection and punishment the same observation applies and every violent passion as well as anger may be termed a short madness  this may be all good philosophy mr ratcliffe answered miss vere but excuse me it by no means emboldens me to visit at this late hour a person whose extravagance of imagination you yourself can only palliate  rather then said ratcliffe receive my solemn assurances that you do not incur the slightest danger but what i have been hitherto afraid to mention for fear of alarming you is that now when we are within sight of his retreat for i can discover it through the twilight i must go no farther with you you must proceed alone  alonei dare not  you must continued ratcliffe i will remain here and wait for you  you will not then stir from this place said miss vere yet the distance is so great you could not hear me were i to cry for assistance  fear nothing said her guide or observe at least the utmost caution in stifling every expression of timidity remember that his predominant and most harassing apprehension arises from a consciousness of the hideousness of his appearance your path lies straight beside yon halffallen willow keep the left side of it the marsh lies on the right farewell for a time remember the evil you are threatened with and let it overcome at once your fears and scruples  mr ratcliffe said isabella farewell if you have deceived one so unfortunate as myself you have for ever forfeited the fair character for probity and honour to which i have trusted  on my lifeon my soul continued ratcliffe raising his voice as the distance between them increased you are safeperfectly safe    chapter xvi       twas time and griefs      that framed him thus  time with his fairer hand      offering the fortunes of his former days      the former man may make himbring us to him      and chance it as it mayold play  the sounds of ratcliffes voice had died on isabellas ear but as she frequently looked back it was some encouragement to her to discern his form now darkening in the gloom ere however she went much farther she lost the object in the increasing shade the last glimmer of the twilight placed her before the hut of the solitary she twice extended her hand to the door and twice she withdrew it and when she did at length make the effort the knock did not equal in violence the throb of her own bosom her next effort was louder her third was reiterated for the fear of not obtaining the protection from which ratcliffe promised so much began to overpower the terrors of his presence from whom she was to request it at length as she still received no answer she repeatedly called upon the dwarf by his assumed name and requested him to answer and open to her  what miserable being is reduced said the appalling voice of the solitary to seek refuge here go hence when the heathfowl need shelter they seek it not in the nest of the nightraven  i come to you father said isabella in my hour of adversity even as you yourself commanded when you promised your heart and your door should be open to my distress but i fear  ha said the solitary then thou art isabella vere give me a token that thou art she  i have brought you back the rose which you gave me it has not had time to fade ere the hard fate you foretold has come upon me  and if thou hast thus redeemed thy pledge said the dwarf i will not forfeit mine the heart and the door that are shut against every other earthly being shall be open to thee and to thy sorrows  she heard him move in his hut and presently afterwards strike a light one by one bolt and bar were then withdrawn the heart of isabella throbbing higher as these obstacles to their meeting were successively removed the door opened and the solitary stood before her his uncouth form and features illuminated by the iron lamp which he held in his hand  enter daughter of affliction he saidenter the house of misery  she entered and observed with a precaution which increased her trepidation that the recluses first act after setting the lamp upon the table was to replace the numerous bolts which secured the door of his hut she shrunk as she heard the noise which accompanied this ominous operation yet remembered ratcliffes caution and endeavoured to suppress all appearance of apprehension the light of the lamp was weak and uncertain but the solitary without taking immediate notice of isabella otherwise than by motioning her to sit down on a small settle beside the fireplace made haste to kindle some dry furze which presently cast a blaze through the cottage wooden shelves which bore a few books some bundles of dried herbs and one or two wooden cups and platters were on one side of the fire on the other were placed some ordinary tools of fieldlabour mingled with those used by mechanics where the bed should have been there was a wooden frame strewed with withered moss and rushes the couch of the ascetic the whole space of the cottage did not exceed ten feet by six within the walls and its only furniture besides what we have mentioned was a table and two stools formed of rough deals  within these narrow precincts isabella now found herself enclosed with a being whose history had nothing to reassure her and the fearful conformation of whose hideous countenance inspired an almost superstitious terror he occupied the seat opposite to her and dropping his huge and shaggy eyebrows over his piercing black eyes gazed at her in silence as if agitated by a variety of contending feelings on the other side sate isabella pale as death her long hair uncurled by the evening damps and falling over her shoulders and breast as the wet streamers droop from the mast when the storm has passed away and left the vessel stranded on the beach the dwarf first broke the silence with the sudden abrupt and alarming questionwoman what evil fate has brought thee hither  my fathers danger and your own command she replied faintly but firmly  and you hope for aid from me  if you can bestow it she replied still in the same tone of mild submission  and how should i possess that power continued the dwarf with a bitter sneer is mine the form of a redresser of wrongs is this the castle in which one powerful enough to be sued to by a fair suppliant is likely to hold his residence i but mocked thee girl when i said i would relieve thee  then must i depart and face my fate as i best may  no said the dwarf rising and interposing between her and the door and motioning to her sternly to resume her seatno you leave me not in this way we must have farther conference why should one being desire aid of another why should not each be sufficient to itself look round youi the most despised and most decrepit on natures common have required sympathy and help from no one these stones are of my own piling these utensils i framed with my own hands and with thisand he laid his hand with a fierce smile on the long dagger which he always wore beneath his garment and unsheathed it so far that the blade glimmered clear in the firelightwith this he pursued as he thrust the weapon back into the scabbard i can if necessary defend the vital spark enclosed in this poor trunk against the fairest and strongest that shall threaten me with injury  it was with difficulty isabella refrained from screaming out aloud but she did refrain  this continued the recluse is the life of nature solitary selfsufficing and independent the wolf calls not the wolf to aid him in forming his den and the vulture invites not another to assist her in striking down her prey  and when they are unable to procure themselves support said isabella judiciously thinking that he would be most accessible to argument couched in his own metaphorical style what then is to befall them  let them starve die and be forgotten it is the common lot of humanity  it is the lot of the wild tribes of nature said isabella but chiefly of those who are destined to support themselves by rapine which brooks no partner but it is not the law of nature in general even the lower orders have confederacies for mutual defence but mankindthe race would perish did they cease to aid each otherfrom the time that the mother binds the childs head till the moment that some kind assistant wipes the deathdamp from the brow of the dying we cannot exist without mutual help all therefore that need aid have right to ask it of their fellowmortals no one who has the power of granting can refuse it without guilt  and in this simple hope poor maiden said the solitary thou hast come into the desert to seek one whose wish it were that the league thou hast spoken of were broken for ever and that in very truth the whole race should perish wert thou not frightened  misery said isabella firmly is superior to fear  hast thou not heard it said in thy mortal world that i have leagued myself with other powers deformed to the eye and malevolent to the human race as myself hast thou not heard thisand dost thou seek my cell at midnight  the being i worship supports me against such idle fears said isabella but the increasing agitation of her bosom belied the affected courage which her words expressed  ho ho said the dwarf thou vauntest thyself a philosopher yet shouldst thou not have thought of the danger of intrusting thyself young and beautiful in the power of one so spited against humanity as to place his chief pleasure in defacing destroying and degrading her fairest works  isabella much alarmed continued to answer with firmness whatever injuries you may have sustained in the world you are incapable of revenging them on one who never wronged you nor wilfully any other  ay but maiden he continued his dark eyes flashing with an expression of malignity which communicated itself to his wild and distorted features revenge is the hungry wolf which asks only to tear flesh and lap blood think you the lambs plea of innocence would be listened to by him  man said isabella rising and expressing herself with much dignity i fear not the horrible ideas with which you would impress me i cast them from me with disdain be you mortal or fiend you would not offer injury to one who sought you as a suppliant in her utmost need you would notyou durst not  thou sayst truly maiden rejoined the solitary i dare noti would not begone to thy dwelling fear nothing with which they threaten thee thou hast asked my protectionthou shalt find it effectual  but father this very night i have consented to wed the man that i abhor or i must put the seal to my fathers ruin  this nightat what hour  ere midnight  and twilight said the dwarf has already passed away but fear nothing there is ample time to protect thee  and my father continued isabella in a suppliant tone  thy father replied the dwarf has been and is my most bitter enemy but fear not thy virtue shall save him and now begone were i to keep thee longer by me i might again fall into the stupid dreams concerning human worth from which i have been so fearfully awakened but fear nothingat the very foot of the altar i will redeem thee adieu time presses and i must act  he led her to the door of the hut which he opened for her departure she remounted her horse which had been feeding in the outer enclosure and pressed him forward by the light of the moon which was now rising to the spot where she had left ratcliffe  have you succeeded was his first eager question  i have obtained promises from him to whom you sent me but how can he possibly accomplish them  thank god said ratcliffe doubt not his power to fulfil his promise  at this moment a shrill whistle was heard to resound along the heath  hark said ratcliffe he calls memiss vere return home and leave unbolted the posterndoor of the garden to that which opens on the backstairs i have a private key  a second whistle was heard yet more shrill and prolonged than the first  i come i come said ratcliffe and setting spurs to his horse rode over the heath in the direction of the recluses hut miss vere returned to the castle the mettle of the animal on which she rode and her own anxiety of mind combining to accelerate her journey  she obeyed ratcliffes directions though without well apprehending their purpose and leaving her horse at large in a paddock near the garden hurried to her own apartment which she reached without observation she now unbolted her door and rang her bell for lights her father appeared along with the servant who answered her summons  he had been twice he said listening at her door during the two hours that had elapsed since he left her and not hearing her speak had become apprehensive that she was taken ill  and now my dear father she said permit me to claim the promise you so kindly gave let the last moments of freedom which i am to enjoy be mine without interruption and protract to the last moment the respite which is allowed me  i will said her father nor shall you be again interrupted but this disordered dressthis dishevelled hairdo not let me find you thus when i call on you again the sacrifice to be beneficial must be voluntary  must it be so she replied then fear not my father the victim shall be adorned    chapter xvii       this looks not like a nuptialmuch ado about nothing  the chapel in the castle of ellieslaw destined to be the scene of this illomened union was a building of much older date than the castle itself though that claimed considerable antiquity before the wars between england and scotland had become so common and of such long duration that the buildings along both sides of the border were chiefly dedicated to warlike purposes there had been a small settlement of monks at ellieslaw a dependency it is believed by antiquaries on the rich abbey of jedburgh their possessions had long passed away under the changes introduced by war and mutual ravage a feudal castle had arisen on the ruin of their cells and their chapel was included in its precincts  the edifice in its round arches and massive pillars the simplicity of which referred their date to what has been called the saxon architecture presented at all times a dark and sombre appearance and had been frequently used as the cemetery of the family of the feudal lords as well as formerly of the monastic brethren but it looked doubly gloomy by the effect of the few and smoky torches which were used to enlighten it on the present occasion and which spreading a glare of yellow light in their immediate vicinity were surrounded beyond by a red and purple halo reflected from their own smoke and beyond that again by a zone of darkness which magnified the extent of the chapel while it rendered it impossible for the eye to ascertain its limits some injudicious ornaments adopted in haste for the occasion rather added to the dreariness of the scene old fragments of tapestry torn from the walls of other apartments had been hastily and partially disposed around those of the chapel and mingled inconsistently with scutcheons and funeral emblems of the dead which they elsewhere exhibited on each side of the stone altar was a monument the appearance of which formed an equally strange contrast on the one was the figure in stone of some grim hermit or monk who had died in the odour of sanctity he was represented as recumbent in his cowl and scapulaire with his face turned upward as in the act of devotion and his hands folded from which his string of beads was dependent on the other side was a tomb in the italian taste composed of the most beautiful statuary marble and accounted a model of modern art it was erected to the memory of isabellas mother the late mrs vere of ellieslaw who was represented as in a dying posture while a weeping cherub with eyes averted seemed in the act of extinguishing a dying lamp as emblematic of her speedy dissolution it was indeed a masterpiece of art but misplaced in the rude vault to which it had been consigned many were surprised and even scandalized that ellieslaw not remarkable for attention to his lady while alive should erect after her death such a costly mausoleum in affected sorrow others cleared him from the imputation of hypocrisy and averred that the monument had been constructed under the direction and at the sole expense of mr ratcliffe  before these monuments the wedding guests were assembled they were few in number for many had left the castle to prepare for the ensuing political explosion and ellieslaw was in the circumstances of the case far from being desirous to extend invitations farther than to those near relations whose presence the custom of the country rendered indispensable next to the altar stood sir frederick langley dark moody and thoughtful even beyond his wont and near him mareschal who was to play the part of bridesman as it was called the thoughtless humour of this young gentleman on which he never deigned to place the least restraint added to the cloud which overhung the brow of the bridegroom  the bride is not yet come out of her chamber he whispered to sir frederick i trust that we must not have recourse to the violent expedients of the romans which i read of at college it would be hard upon my pretty cousin to be run away with twice in two days though i know none better worth such a violent compliment  sir frederick attempted to turn a deaf ear to this discourse humming a tune and looking another may but mareschal proceeded in the same wild manner  this delay is hard upon dr hobbler who was disturbed to accelerate preparations for this joyful event when he had successfully extracted the cork of his third bottle i hope you will keep him free of the censure of his superiors for i take it this is beyond canonical hoursbut here come ellieslaw and my pretty cousinprettier than ever i think were it not she seems so faint and so deadly palehark ye sir knight if she says not yes with right goodwill it shall be no wedding for all that has come and gone yet  no wedding sir returned sir frederick in a loud whisper the tone of which indicated that his angry feelings were suppressed with difficulty  nono marriage replied mareschal theres my hand and glove ont  sir frederick langley took his hand and as he wrung it hard said in a lower whisper mareschal you shall answer this and then flung his hand from him  that i will readily do said mareschal for never word escaped my lips that my hand was not ready to guaranteeso speak up my pretty cousin and tell me if it be your free will and unbiassed resolution to accept of this gallant knight for your lord and husband for if you have the tenth part of a scruple upon the subject fall back fall edge he shall not have you  are you mad mr mareschal said ellieslaw who having been this young mans guardian during his minority often employed a tone of authority to him do you suppose i would drag my daughter to the foot of the altar were it not her own choice  tut ellieslaw retorted the young gentleman never tell me of the contrary her eyes are full of tears and her cheeks are whiter than her white dress i must insist in the name of common humanity that the ceremony be adjourned till tomorrow  she shall tell you herself thou incorrigible intermeddler in what concerns thee not that it is her wish the ceremony should go onis it not isabella my dear  it is said isabella half faintingsince there is no help either in god or man  the first word alone was distinctly audible mareschal shrugged up his shoulders and stepped back ellieslaw led or rather supported his daughter to the altar sir frederick moved forward and placed himself by her side the clergyman opened his prayerbook and looked to mr vere for the signal to commence the service  proceed said the latter  but a voice as if issuing from the tomb of his deceased wife called in such loud and harsh accents as awakened every echo in the vaulted chapel forbear  all were mute and motionless till a distant rustle and the clash of swords or something resembling it was heard from the remote apartments it ceased almost instantly  what new device is this said sir frederick fiercely eyeing ellieslaw and mareschal with a glance of malignant suspicion  it can be but the frolic of some intemperate guest said ellieslaw though greatly confounded we must make large allowances for the excess of this evenings festivity proceed with the service  before the clergyman could obey the same prohibition which they had before heard was repeated from the same spot the female attendants screamed and fled from the chapel the gentlemen laid their hands on their swords ere the first moment of surprise had passed by the dwarf stepped from behind the monument and placed himself full in front of mr vere the effect of so strange and hideous an apparition in such a place and in such circumstances appalled all present but seemed to annihilate the laird of ellieslaw who dropping his daughters arm staggered against the nearest pillar and clasping it with his hands as if for support laid his brow against the column  who is this fellow said sir frederick and what does he mean by this intrusion  it is one who comes to tell you said the dwarf with the peculiar acrimony which usually marked his manner that in marrying that young lady you wed neither the heiress of ellieslaw nor of mauley hall nor of polverton nor of one furrow of land unless she marries with my consent and to thee that consent shall never be given downdown on thy knees and thank heaven that thou art prevented from wedding qualities with which thou hast no concernportionless truth virtue and innocencethou base ingrate he continued addressing himself to ellieslaw what is thy wretched subterfuge now thou who wouldst sell thy daughter to relieve thee from danger as in famine thou wouldst have slain and devoured her to preserve thy own vile lifeay hide thy face with thy hands well mayst thou blush to look on him whose body thou didst consign to chains his hand to guilt and his soul to misery saved once more by the virtue of her who calls thee father go hence and may the pardon and benefits i confer on thee prove literal coals of fire till thy brain is seared and scorched like mine  ellieslaw left the chapel with a gesture of mute despair  follow him hubert ratcliffe said the dwarf and inform him of his destiny he will rejoicefor to breathe air and to handle gold is to him happiness  i understand nothing of all this said sir frederick langley but we are here a body of gentlemen in arms and authority for king james and whether you really sir be that sir edward mauley who has been so long supposed dead in confinement or whether you be an impostor assuming his name and title we will use the freedom of detaining you till your appearance here at this moment is better accounted for we will have no spies among usseize on him my friends  but the domestics shrunk back in doubt and alarm sir frederick himself stepped forward towards the recluse as if to lay hands on his person when his progress was suddenly stopped by the glittering point of a partisan which the sturdy hand of hobbie elliot presented against his bosom  ill gar daylight shine through ye if ye offer to steer him said the stout borderer stand back or ill strike ye through naebody shall lay a finger on elshie hes a canny neighbourly man aye ready to make a friend help and though ye may think him a lamiter yet grippie for grippie friend ill wad a wether hell make the bluid spin frae under your nails hes a teugh carle elshie he grips like a smiths vice  what has brought you here elliot said mareschal who called on you for interference  troth mareschalwells answered hobbie i am just come here wi twenty or thretty mair o us in my ain name and the kingsor queens ca they her and canny elshies into the bargain to keep the peace and pay back some ill usage ellieslaw has gien me a bonny breakfast the loons gae me the ither morning and him at the bottom ont and trow ye i wasna ready to supper him upye needna lay your hands on your swords gentlemen the house is ours wi little din for the doors were open and there had been ower muckle punch amang your folk we took their swords and pistols as easily as ye wad shiel peacods  mareschal rushed out and immediately reentered the chapel  by heaven it is true sir frederick the house is filled with armed men and our drunken beasts are all disarmed draw and let us fight our way  binna rashbinna rash exclaimed hobbie hear me a bit hear me a bit we mean ye nae harm but as ye are in arms for king james as ye ca him and the prelates we thought it right to keep up the auld neighbour war and stand up for the tother ane and the kirk but well no hurt a hair o your heads if ye like to gang hame quietly and it will be your best way for theres sure news come frae loudoun that him they ca bang or byng or what ist has bangd the french ships and the new king aff the coast however sae ye had best bide content wi auld nanse for want of a better queen  ratcliffe who at this moment entered confirmed these accounts so unfavourable to the jacobite interest sir frederick almost instantly and without taking leave of any one left the castle with such of his attendants as were able to follow him  and what will you do mr mareschal said ratcliffe  why faith answered he smiling i hardly know my spirit is too great and my fortune too small for me to follow the example of the doughty bridegroom it is not in my nature and it is hardly worth my while  well then disperse your men and remain quiet and this will be overlooked as there has been no overt act  hout ay said elliot just let byganes be byganes and a friends again deil ane i bear malice at but westburnflat and i hae gien him baith a het skin and a cauld ane i hadna changed three blows of the broadsword wi him before he lap the window into the castlemoat and swattered through it like a wildduck hes a clever fallow indeed maun kilt awa wi ae bonny lass in the morning and another at night less wadna serve him but if he disna kilt himsell out o the country ise kilt him wi a tow for the castleton meetings clean blawn ower his friends will no countenance him  during the general confusion isabella had thrown herself at the feet of her kinsman sir edward mauley for so we must now call the solitary to express at once her gratitude and to beseech forgiveness for her father the eyes of all began to be fixed on them as soon as their own agitation and the bustle of the attendants had somewhat abated miss vere kneeled beside the tomb of her mother to whose statue her features exhibited a marked resemblance she held the hand of the dwarf which she kissed repeatedly and bathed with tears he stood fixed and motionless excepting that his eyes glanced alternately on the marble figure and the living suppliant at length the large drops which gathered on his eyelashes compelled him to draw his hand across them  i thought he said that tears and i had done but we shed them at our birth and their spring dries not until we are in our graves but no melting of the heart shall dissolve my resolution i part here at once and for ever with all of which the memory looking to the tomb or the presence he pressed isabellas hand is dear to mespeak not to me attempt not to thwart my determination it will avail nothing you will hear of and see this lump of deformity no more to you i shall be dead ere i am actually in my grave and you will think of me as of a friend disencumbered from the toils and crimes of existence  he kissed isabella on the forehead impressed another kiss on the brow of the statue by which she knelt and left the chapel followed by ratcliffe isabella almost exhausted by the emotions of the day was carried to her apartment by her women most of the other guests dispersed after having separately endeavoured to impress on all who would listen to them their disapprobation of the plots formed against the government or their regret for having engaged in them hobbie elliot assumed the command of the castle for the night and mounted a regular guard he boasted not a little of the alacrity with which his friends and he had obeyed a hasty summons received from elshie through the faithful ratcliffe and it was a lucky chance he said that on that very day they had got notice that westburnflat did not intend to keep his tryste at castleton but to hold them at defiance so that a considerable party had assembled at the heughfoot with the intention of paying a visit to the robbers tower on the ensuing morning and their course was easily directed to ellieslaw castle    chapter xviii       last scene of all      to close this strange eventful historyas you like it  on the next morning mr ratcliffe presented miss vere with a letter from her father of which the following is the tenor  my dearest child the malice of a persecuting government will compel me for my own safety to retreat abroad and to remain for some time in foreign parts i do not ask you to accompany or follow me you will attend to my interest and your own more effectually by remaining where you are it is unnecessary to enter into a minute detail concerning the causes of the strange events which yesterday took place i think i have reason to complain of the usage i have received from sir edward mauley who is your nearest kinsman by the mothers side but as he has declared you his heir and is to put you in immediate possession of a large part of his fortune i account it a full atonement i am aware he has never forgiven the preference which your mother gave to my addresses instead of complying with the terms of a sort of family compact which absurdly and tyrannically destined her to wed her deformed relative the shock was even sufficient to unsettle his wits which indeed were never overwell arranged and i had as the husband of his nearest kinswoman and heir the delicate task of taking care of his person and property until he was reinstated in the management of the latter by those who no doubt thought they were doing him justice although if some parts of his subsequent conduct be examined it will appear that he ought for his own sake to have been left under the influence of a mild and salutary restraint  in one particular however he showed a sense of the ties of blood as well as of his own frailty for while he sequestered himself closely from the world under various names and disguises and insisted on spreading a report of his own death in which to gratify him i willingly acquiesced he left at my disposal the rents of a great proportion of his estates and especially all those which having belonged to your mother reverted to him as a male fief in this he may have thought that he was acting with extreme generosity while in the opinion of all impartial men he will only be considered as having fulfilled a natural obligation seeing that in justice if not in strict law you must be considered as the heir of your mother and i as your legal administrator instead therefore of considering myself as loaded with obligations to sir edward on this account i think i had reason to complain that these remittances were only doled out to me at the pleasure of mr ratcliffe who moreover exacted from me mortgages over my paternal estate of ellieslaw for any sums which i required as an extra advance and thus may be said to have insinuated himself into the absolute management and control of my property or if all this seeming friendship was employed by sir edward for the purpose of obtaining a complete command of my affairs and acquiring the power of ruining me at his pleasure i feel myself i must repeat still less bound by the alleged obligation  about the autumn of last year as i understand either his own crazed imagination or the accomplishment of some such scheme as i have hinted brought him down to this country his alleged motive it seems was a desire of seeing a monument which he had directed to be raised in the chapel over the tomb of your mother mr ratcliffe who at this time had done me the honour to make my house his own had the complaisance to introduce him secretly into the chapel the consequence as he informs me was a frenzy of several hours during which he fled into the neighbouring moors in one of the wildest spots of which he chose when he was somewhat recovered to fix his mansion and set up for a sort of country empiric a character which even in his best days he was fond of assuming it is remarkable that instead of informing me of these circumstances that i might have had the relative of my late wife taken such care of as his calamitous condition required mr ratcliffe seems to have had such culpable indulgence for his irregular plans as to promise and even swear secrecy concerning them he visited sir edward often and assisted in the fantastic task he had taken upon him of constructing a hermitage nothing they appear to have dreaded more than a discovery of their intercourse  the ground was open in every direction around and a small subterranean cave probably sepulchral which their researches had detected near the great granite pillar served to conceal ratcliffe when any one approached his master i think you will be of opinion my love that this secrecy must have had some strong motive it is also remarkable that while i thought my unhappy friend was residing among the monks of la trappe he should have been actually living for many months in this bizarre disguise within five miles of my house and obtaining regular information of my most private movements either by ratcliffe or through westburnflat or others whom he had the means to bribe to any extent he makes it a crime against me that i endeavoured to establish your marriage with sir frederick i acted for the best but if sir edward mauley thought otherwise why did he not step manfully forward express his own purpose of becoming a party to the settlements and take that interest which he is entitled to claim in you as heir to his great property  even now though your rash and eccentric relation is somewhat tardy in announcing his purpose i am far from opposing my authority against his wishes although the person he desires you to regard as your future husband be young earnscliff the very last whom i should have thought likely to be acceptable to him considering a certain fatal event but i give my free and hearty consent providing the settlements are drawn in such an irrevocable form as may secure my child from suffering by that state of dependence and that sudden and causeless revocation of allowances of which i have so much reason to complain of sir frederick langley i augur you will hear no more he is not likely to claim the hand of a dowerless maiden i therefore commit you my dear isabella to the wisdom of providence and to your own prudence begging you to lose no time in securing those advantages which the fickleness of your kinsman has withdrawn from me to shower upon you  mr ratcliffe mentioned sir edwards intention to settle a considerable sum upon me yearly for my maintenance in foreign parts but this my heart is too proud to accept from him i told him i had a dear child who while in affluence herself would never suffer me to be in poverty i thought it right to intimate this to him pretty roundly that whatever increase be settled upon you it may be calculated so as to cover this necessary and natural encumbrance i shall willingly settle upon you the castle and manor of ellieslaw to show my parental affection and disinterested zeal for promoting your settlement in life the annual interest of debts charged on the estate somewhat exceeds the income even after a reasonable rent has been put upon the mansion and mains but as all the debts are in the person of mr ratcliffe as your kinsmans trustee he will not be a troublesome creditor and here i must make you aware that though i have to complain of mr ratcliffes conduct to me personally i nevertheless believe him a just and upright man with whom you may safely consult on your affairs not to mention that to cherish his good opinion will be the best way to retain that of your kinsman remember me to marchiei hope he will not be troubled on account of late matters i will write more fully from the continent meanwhile i rest your loving father richard vere  the above letter throws the only additional light which we have been able to procure upon the earlier part of our story it was hobbies opinion and may be that of most of our readers that the recluse of mucklestanemoor had but a kind of a gleaming or twilight understanding and that he had neither very clear views as to what he himself wanted nor was apt to pursue his ends by the clearest and most direct means so that to seek the clew of his conduct was likened by hobbie to looking for a straight path through a common over which are a hundred devious tracks but not one distinct line of road  when isabella had perused the letter her first enquiry was after her father he had left the castle she was informed early in the morning after a long interview with mr ratcliffe and was already far on his way to the next port where he might expect to find shipping for the continent  where was sir edward mauley  no one had seen the dwarf since the eventful scene of the preceding evening  odd if onything has befaen puir elshie said hobbie elliot i wad rather i were harried ower again  he immediately rode to his dwelling and the remaining shegoat came bleating to meet him for her milking time was long past the solitary was nowhere to be seen his door contrary to wont was open his fire extinguished and the whole hut was left in the state which it exhibited on isabellas visit to him it was pretty clear that the means of conveyance which had brought the dwarf to ellieslaw on the preceding evening had removed him from it to some other place of abode hobbie returned disconsolate to the castle  i am doubting we hae lost canny elshie for gude an a  you have indeed said ratcliffe producing a paper which he put into hobbies hands but read that and you will perceive you have been no loser by having known him  it was a short deed of gift by which sir edward mauley otherwise called elshender the recluse endowed halbert or hobbie elliot and grace armstrong in full property with a considerable sum borrowed by elliot from him  hobbies joy was mingled with feelings which brought tears down his rough cheeks  its a queer thing he said but i canna joy in the gear unless i kend the puir body was happy that gave it me  next to enjoying happiness ourselves said ratcliffe is the consciousness of having bestowed it on others had all my masters benefits been conferred like the present what a different return would they have produced but the indiscriminate profusion that would glut avarice or supply prodigality neither does good nor is rewarded by gratitude it is sowing the wind to reap the whirlwind  and that wad be a light harst said hobbie but wi my young leddies leave i wad fain take down eishies skeps o bees and set them in graces bit flower yard at the heughfootthey shall neer be smeekit by ony o huz and the puir goat she would be negleckit about a great toun like this and she could feed bonnily on our lily lea by the burn side and the hounds wad ken her in a days time and never fash her and grace wad milk her ilka morning wi her ain hand for elshies sake for though he was thrawn and cankered in his converse he likeit dumb creatures weel  hobbies requests were readily granted not without some wonder at the natural delicacy of feeling which pointed out to him this mode of displaying his gratitude he was delighted when ratcliffe informed him that his benefactor should not remain ignorant of the care which he took of his favourite  and mind be sure and tell him that grannie and the titties and abune a grace and mysell are weel and thriving and that its a his doingthat canna but please him ane wad think  and elliot and the family at heughfoot were and continued to be as fortunate and happy as his undaunted honesty tenderness and gallantry so well merited  all bar between the marriage of earnscliff and isabella was now removed and the settlements which ratcliffe produced on the part of sir edward mauley might have satisfied the cupidity of ellieslaw himself but miss vere and ratcliffe thought it unnecessary to mention to earnscliff that one great motive of sir edward in thus loading the young pair with benefits was to expiate his having many years before shed the blood of his father in a hasty brawl if it be true as ratcliffe asserted that the dwarfs extreme misanthropy seemed to relax somewhat under the consciousness of having diffused happiness among so many the recollection of this circumstance might probably be one of his chief motives for refusing obstinately ever to witness their state of contentment  mareschal hunted shot and drank clarettired of the country went abroad served three campaigns came home and married lucy ilderton  years fled over the heads of earnscliff and his wife and found and left them contented and happy the scheming ambition of sir frederick langley engaged him in the unfortunate insurrection of 1715 he was made prisoner at preston in lancashire with the earl of derwentwater and others his defence and the dying speech which he made at his execution may be found in the state trials mr vere supplied by his daughter with an ample income continued to reside abroad engaged deeply in the affair of laws bank during the regency of the duke of orleans and was at one time supposed to be immensely rich but on the bursting of that famous bubble he was so much chagrined at being again reduced to a moderate annuity although he saw thousands of his companions in misfortune absolutely starving that vexation of mind brought on a paralytic stroke of which he died after lingering under its effects a few weeks  willie of westburnflat fled from the wrath of hobbie elliot as his betters did from the pursuit of the law his patriotism urged him to serve his country abroad while his reluctance to leave his native soil pressed him rather to remain in the beloved island and collect purses watches and rings on the highroads at home fortunately for him the first impulse prevailed and he joined the army under marlborough obtained a commission to which he was recommended by his services in collecting cattle for the commissariat returned home after many years with some money how come by heaven only knowsdemolished the peelhouse at westburnflat and built in its stead a high narrow onstead of three stories with a chimney at each enddrank brandy with the neighbours whom in his younger days he had plundereddied in his bed and is recorded upon his tombstone at kirkwhistle still extant as having played all the parts of a brave soldier a discreet neighbour and a sincere christian  mr ratcliffe resided usually with the family at ellieslaw but regularly every spring and autumn he absented himself for about a month on the direction and purpose of his periodical journey he remained steadily silent but it was well understood that he was then in attendance on his unfortunate patron at length on his return from one of these visits his grave countenance and deep mourning dress announced to the ellieslaw family that their benefactor was no more sir edwards death made no addition to their fortune for he had divested himself of his property during his lifetime and chiefly in their favour ratcliffe his sole confidant died at a good old age but without ever naming the place to which his master had finally retired or the manner of his death or the place of his burial it was supposed that on all these particulars his patron had enjoined him strict secrecy  the sudden disappearance of elshie from his extraordinary hermitage corroborated the reports which the common people had spread concerning him many believed that having ventured to enter a consecrated building contrary to his paction with the evil one he had been bodily carried off while on his return to his cottage but most are of opinion that he only disappeared for a season and continues to be seen from time to time among the hills and retaining according to custom a more vivid recollection of his wild and desperate language than of the benevolent tendency of most of his actions he is usually identified with the malignant demon called the man of the moors whose feats were quoted by mrs elliot to her grandsons and accordingly is generally represented as bewitching the sheep causing the ewes to keb that is to cast their lambs or seen loosening the impending wreath of snow to precipitate its weight on such as take shelter during the storm beneath the bank of a torrent or under the shelter of a deep glen in short the evils most dreaded and deprecated by the inhabitants of that pastoral country are ascribed to the agency of the black dwarf
