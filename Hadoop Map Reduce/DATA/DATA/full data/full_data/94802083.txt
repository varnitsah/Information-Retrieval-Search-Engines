me thats a fact but i can run a good deal faster than some fellers twice as big  the manager of the district messenger station did not attempt to conceal a smile as the boy spoke thus earnestly and continued the examination by asking  where do you live  down on east tenth street  mother and father alive  both dead  im boardin with mammy showers  as a rule we do not employ boys who have no parents  why not  cant they shinney round jest as well as other fellers  there is no question about that but we prefer to have some one to look out for them  so would i but theres no use kickin when a feller cant have all them luxuries jet said gravely  it aint so awful nice to hustle for yourself with a chance of bein fired outer the house if the board aint paid right up to the minute  how have you been earning a living  most any way that come handy  sometimes i sell papers an then agin i black boots  i did think one spell of goin into the theayter biz but i couldnt git the right kind of a job  i can dance a good many of them perfessionals way out of sight but the managers wont hire a performer what aint got good clothes  jet spoke in a businesslike tone which evidently pleased the manager for the latter said after a short pause  i will give you a trial and  you couldnt do better jet interrupted gravely for if i cant hump myself ahead of that fat chump over there i dont want a cent and he pointed to a very fleshy boy who was half asleep on a bench which extended across the rear of the room  here is a cap the manager continued  your number is fortyeight well find a coat which will answer until another is made and you are to go to work at once  can you read  why cert  then study this book of distances so you may know how much to charge for service and set on that bench until it is your turn to go out  jet took the articles and was about to turn away from the desk when a very important question came into his mind  how much money are you goin to give me a week  four dollars is the regular price for beginners but there are good chances to advance if you attend to business  this was evidently satisfactory to new number fortyeight for he did as directed and was soon busily engaged studying the tariff of prices seated beside the fat boy who was now slumbering calmly  for a short time jet thought more about financial matters than of his lesson  mammy showers charged him a dollar and a half per week for a small room hardly larger than a cupboard and two meals each day  he would now providing he did not indulge in too many luxuries while traveling around the city be able to save two dollars and a half every seven days and it seemed very much as if he had fairly started on the highway to fortune  well if they call this work id like to have two or three jobs of the same kind jet said aloud when he was tired of studying the printed instructions  ive been here a little moren an hour an havent been called off the bench once  this remark appeared to arouse the fat boy to the consciousness of being alive and on making great effort to sit upright he noticed jet for the first time  hello  youre a new feller i spose he said with a yawn  do you think i look very new  youve jest com here to work havent you  the way things look now ive come to set around an keep the flies offer them young gents as has ter sleep forenoons  youll be glad to do that same thing before youve worked here a week its dull now but wait awhile an then see how the fellers have to hump themselves  say do you ever do very much jet asked gravely  i was out on a job yesterday that i didnt get through with till past midnight  do the fellers have to work so late as that  once in a while  you have to go where the customers send you an some of the jobs are funny ones  how far have you ever been on an errand  up to albany to bring down a dog for a man what was goin huntin  did you get him here  of course i did  it must have been mighty rough on the dog  why  caus hed be away from home so long if he wasnt allowed to walk any faster than you can  think youre funny dont you and the fat boy made ready to resume his interrupted nap  before jet could turn his attention to the tariff again the boy at the desk called loudly number fortyeight and he went forward quickly well pleased that something had occurred to break the monotony  a summons had come from one of the hotels near by and on answering it he found nothing of more importance than to carry a letter to a certain house in the immediate vicinity but to jet it was particularly agreeable work since he was given ten cents more than the regular fee  if all the messages turn out like this one i shall have a mighty good thing of it he said to himself in a tone of satisfaction as he returned to the station  jet was called upon only twice more during this first day of his new work and when he went home it was with the pleasing knowledge that he had received as presents fifteen cents  on the following morning he was at his post so early that some of the night boys made sport of him for appearing at such an hour predicting that in less than a week he would have sense enough to stay at home till he was wanted  he was not allowed to remain idle very long however  number fortyeight the man at the desk called sharply and jet leaped to his feet  go to no  east fourteenth street  here is your slip  jet took the bit of paper and hurried away at full speed to find that he had been sent to a barroom which was by no means noted for bearing a good reputation so far as the honesty of its patrons was concerned  seated at one of the tables were two men  the elder tall and slim and the other of medium height but rather fleshy  come here the thin man called as the messenger entered and jet fancied that the fellows full beard looked suspiciously heavy and black  i wouldnt like to bet that all that hair grew on his face jet said to himself as he approached the table but he gave the matter no further thought for it was his business to obey orders and not criticize his patrons  how long will it take you to go to the corner of sixth avenue and fifteenth street  not more than ten minutes  take this satchel and give it to a party with red hair who is standing on the northwest corner  suppose there should be more than one jet asked as he took the travelingbag which was remarkably light in weight although it was apparently stuffed full to bursting  the right man will ask your number and you are to tell him it is one hundred and ten  but he can see by my cap that im fortyeight  do as i tell you and never mind about your cap do you hear  yes sir  he will give you something to bring back and you are not to stop on the way no matter what happens  im not in the habit of loafing jet replied just a trifle indignantly and before he could say anything more the short man added impatiently  then dont do it here  get on about your business for we want the answer in the ten minutes you promised  jet started at once feeling decidedly hurt at the tone used by the men and walking as rapidly as the crowds on the sidewalk would permit was soon at the appointed place  a rough booking fellow with a shock of red hair which looked quite as false as the tall mans whiskers was waiting for him  what is your number he asked nervously  i was told to say one hundred and ten but that isnt right  give me the bag and take this back the man said as he literally tore jets burden from him and thrust into the boys hands a paper parcel so heavy that it required all his strength to hold it on one arm  jet was on the point of handing this odd acting fellow the slip of paper that it might be signed according to the rules of the office but before he could so much as take it from his pocket the man had disappeared among the throng  i suppose its all right he said in a tone of perplexity but i wish people would let a fellow do as the boss insists upon  there was no time for delay if he intended to return within the ten minutes as had been promised and he hurried away arriving at the saloon only to be told by the bartender that the gentlemen had left some time previous  what am i to do with this and jet held up the paper parcel  they said you was to go to this number on the bowery  i reckon its one of them cheap lodging houses  jet took the card which was held toward him and stopping only long enough to read the written words and number hurried off once more  this last address was as the barkeeper had suggested a small hotel and on ascending the stairs to the tiny apartment called by courtesy the office found the tall man awaiting his arrival  i thought you was a boy who didnt do any loafing the gentleman said gruffly  i havent stopped a minute  who did you hang around chinning with  nobody  havent you been talking to that other messenger  which one  the fellow you met  i havent spoken to anybody except the redhaired man and he didnt give me a chance to do much talking  what is your fee  twentyfive cents  heres half a dollar  if anybody asks where you have been say that it was to the stock exchange  i dont care to have a lot of people talking about my business and a quarter should be enough to make you hold your tongue  will you sign this slip sir the manager wants the distance and time on there  do it yourself and put it down as i tell you  jet obeyed writing as the stranger dictated and when he presented himself at the station once more the manager had no reason to believe he had been anywhere except to the exchange     chapter ii  trouble  jet was not just certain when he seated himself on the bench to wait for another summons whether he had done right in obeying the tall man so implicitly but yet he could not understand how it would make any difference to the manager since he brought back the amount of money which was the lawful charge for such service  ill ask one of the other fellows he said to himself and then the rush of business was so great that he almost forgot the incident of the morning  until two oclock in the afternoon he was busily engaged and at that hour returned after having been to the postoffice to mail a large lot of circulars sent by a particularly testy and disagreeable old gentleman  you neednt sit down the manager said sharply as the boy laid the service slip on the desk  go with this man and see to it that you tell the whole truth  jet looked in surprise at a gentlemanly appearing person who was pointed out to him standing near the door and asked hesitatingly  what do you mean sir  exactly what i said  dont keep him waiting and come back here at once if they let you go today  this last remark was yet more mysterious than the first but jet did not have an opportunity to ask any more questions for at this instant the stranger took him by the arm saying as he did so  now walk sharp  ive lost too much time already  there was no other alternative but to obey for the man literally dragged him through the crowds on the sidewalks and continued on at a rapid pace until the two were at the entrance of police headquarters  what am i to go in there for jet asked as he tried to hold back  the inspector wants to see you the man replied and the boy ceased any show of resistance for he began to realize that he was a prisoner although on what charge he could not so much as guess  ten minutes later he was standing in front of the inspector and that gentleman was gazing at him scrutinizingly  what is your name he asked abruptly and when the answer had been given be continued by inquiring into all the particulars of his short life until jet cried in desperation  what do you think i have done sir  that remains to be seen was the unsatisfactory reply as after writing down all the boy had said the inspector summoned a man in the garb of an ordinary citizen to whom he handed the paper as he said in a low tone find out if this is correct and come back at once  then turning to jet  how long have you been a district messenger  two days  what time in the morning do you go on duty  seven oclock  what was the first call you had today  to no  east fourteenth street  tell me all that happened there and remember if you try to lie i shall know it  jet confused and bewildered by the strange position in which he found himself did as he was bidden  just for an instant he believed it would be only just toward the man who had hired him to repeat what he had been told to say but then came the thought that he was virtually under arrest and the truth should be spoken at every hazard  can you describe these men the inspector asked when his short story was told  jet did his best not omitting to say that the hair of one and the whiskers of another looked suspiciously false  would you know them again  im certain of it  the tall man i could spot even if the whiskers were taken off  at this point the officer who had been sent to learn the truth of jets statement regarding himself returned nodded his head in a significant manner and immediately disappeared through another doorway  over and over again did the inspector insist on jets telling the story of his mornings work and when fully an hour had been spent in this manner he said decidedly more kindly than before  i believe you have spoken the truth but you will be an important witness in a very serious case and i suppose it is my duty to send you to the house of detention  does that mean im goin to be locked up jet asked in alarm  you will be deprived of your liberty but it is very different from going to jail  dont do that  please dont do that  ive just got a job where i can earn a good deal of money and itll knock me out of it  besides jet added as a lucky thought occurred to him if i keep on about my business i may see them fellers again  you advance a very good argument and in fact i am depending on you to do that same thing but how shall i know that you wont give us the slip  ill stay right at the office except when im out with a message an come here every night if you say the word  do you know of any one who would go bail for your appearance when wanted  mammy showers would tell you that ill act square up to what i say  the inspector did not reply for several seconds and then it was to say  ill take your word for it my boy  you are to report to me or one of the officers here every twentyfour hours and in the meanwhile if you get a glimpse of either of those men follow him until word can be sent to me but do not speak of this matter to any one  it was evident that this ended the interview for the inspector rose to his feet and jet overjoyed at the prospect of escaping imprisonment hurried out of the gloomylooking building  on his return to the office the manager who was particularly busy at that moment motioned him to a seat on the messengers bench and the fat boy unusually wide awake asked in a bloodcurdling whisper  did you really have anything to do with that murder  what do you mean  there was a man killed an robbed over on east twentieth street last night and some of the fellers said you was down to headquarters tellin the police all about it  and it was the murderers i saw this morning jet repeated aloud astounded by the knowledge that he had possibly assisted the guilty ones to hide the evidences of their crime  then you was in it the fat boy exclaimed  now dont be a fool  i carried a bag for some men this morning but thats all i know about it  who was the murdered man  its all in that paper sankey left in his overcoat pocket  get it an you have the whole story  i wonder why they dont put you in jail  before jet could reply to this question he was ordered to the desk and from there sent to answer a call from the union square hotel  evidently it was not one of the regular patrons of the house who had summoned him  he found a gentlemanly looking party standing just outside the clerks desk who appeared particularly pleased on observing the number on his cap  i want you to go with me to yonkers and bring back certain papers which must be delivered before six oclock  can you go so far  i will run over to the office and find out  you see i havent been on the force very long and dont know exactly what to do when the work will keep me so long away  very well hurry as fast as possible for i want to leave here by the next train  jet ran swiftly back and in a very few moments returned with the information that he was at liberty to go wherever the gentleman desired so long as the office received the regular price per hour for his services  there wont be any difficulty about that  you are to go to pier 466 north river and wait there until i come  dont stop on the way for i shall probably ride down  i thought we were going on the cars  i changed my mind while you were away  we can get there just as quickly by boat  hurry off for i dont want to be kept waiting  jet left the hotel at once wondering why the gentleman did not give him a car fare if the business demanded so much speed and on his way to the pier he heard the newsboys crying the particulars of the terrible tragedy on east twentieth street  ill see what the story is jet said to himself as he bought one of the papers but he did not stop to read then lest he should arrive at the rendezvous too late  the gentleman was waiting for him on his arrival but did not express any anxiety to start for yonkers immediately  you can go up to my room and help me stow away some baggage he said glancing around as if to make certain they were not observed  aint this the albany boat  yes but i reckon theres nothing to prevent our getting out at yonkers  i didnt know she stopped there  you will probably have time to learn several things before youre many years older  but this steamer doesnt leave till night  ive made another change in my plans and it doesnt concern you since a messengers duty is to follow as long as he is paid for his services  this was said in such an angry tone that jet held his peace lest he should give further offense but at the same time the whole affair was beginning in his mind to assume a very mysterious aspect  the man motioned for him to walk by his side and led the way through the main saloon to a stateroom forward where through the halfopened door  jet failed to see the baggage which had been spoken of as needing stowing  go in the stranger said impatiently pushing jet into the apartment and following him  then the door was locked and the man carefully fastened both the shutter and window  now the messenger was alarmed and turned toward the door with upraised fist as if to pound for assistance when a hand was placed roughly over his mouth  dont try any such game as that or therell be trouble you young cub the man whispered and almost before jet knew what was being done a hard substance had been forced into his mouth and fastened there by a towel tied around his head  that he was a victim of foul play the young messenger could have no doubt and he struggled with all his strength to free himself but in vain  the stranger took from his pocket several lengths of stout rope bound first jets hands and then his feet after which he threw him roughly into one of the berths  i reckon youll lay there without making very much fuss till i get ready to let you go he said as he treated himself to a long draught from a black flask  when we do land at yonkers you can go back to police headquarters once more  the latter remark caused jet to associate this adventure with the one he had had in the morning and after looking intently at the stranger his suspicions became a certainty  this is the short fellow who got me to carry the valise he said to himself  they know about my goin to see the inspector and are bound to get me out of the way  the idea that his captor was a coldblooded murderer who probably would not hesitate to add another to his list of crimes was far from reassuring and the perspiration burst out on jets face as he thus persuaded himself he was in immediate danger of a violent death     chapter iii  the kidnappers  jets captor appeared to be perfectly contented after binding the boy and assuring himself that it was impossible an alarm could be given  he seated himself by the side of the berth lighted a cigar and began to read a newspaper although the light in the room was far from good owing to the blinds being closed  jet was lying in such a manner that he could see the fellows face plainly and was now able to understand why he had not recognized him before  at the saloon he had a heavy moustache and rather long hair  now his face was smooth and his head closely shaven  his face had then been so white as to be pallid whereas it was now bronzed deeply  in addition the mans clothing was of the most fashionable make while in the morning jet had seen him clad in coarse badly fitting garments  theres a big difference in his looks jet said to himself but yet i dont understand why i was such a fool as not to know him when he first spoke  messenger number fortyeight had ample time for reflection for fully an hour passed without any change in the relative position of affairs and then came a low quick tap at the door  when it was opened the tall man now without a beard and wearing a pair of green spectacles came quickly into the room locking the door carefully behind him  i see youve got the cub he said bending over jet to make certain of his identity  yes had him here an hour  have any trouble  not a particle  he was the first to answer my call and i took that as a sign we should get away without leaving a trail  we cant lug him around the country with us  youre right but we can drop him after hes where itll trouble him to get back  theres a safer way  i know what you mean joe but i dont like to do any more of that business thans necessary  the last one couldnt have been avoided but this can  its a big risk to carry him up the river and hed better be dropped  well talk about that later  have you heard anything new  not much  after this cub came from headquarters a detective was sent down to the bowery and by this time it is known pretty well what we looked like  the afternoon papers say the police are following a good clew but you know what such talk means bob  is the stuff salted away  all except what we need for a couple of months  the boys can send us more if we conclude to leave the quiet little place were bound for  then the two men had recourse to the flask and after taking a hearty drink the one who had been called bob proposed to go outside for a moment  you must be a fool to think of such a thing joe said angrily  you are not done up so well but that some body would be able to recognize you  we are lucky in getting under cover without trouble and here we stop till morning  its going to be mighty dull work staying in this coop all that time  not half so bad as a cell in the tombs  the two men relapsed into silence for a time and jet lay watching them as he tried to devise some way out of a position which was fraught with danger  it seemed impossible that he could aid himself bound as he was and exceedingly improbable any one would come to his assistance  study as he might jet could think of no way to extricate himself and he said mentally after racking his brain in vain  i dont see any way out but theres no use in giving up hope till a fellow is obliged to  the men alternately drank and smoked during the remainder of the afternoon but said very little more regarding their flight  when the steamer started jet expected to hear them decide what was to be done with him but in this he was mistaken  as the hours wore on he fell into an uneasy slumber despite the painfulness of his position and during this time of unconsciousness the matter must have been settled  it was yet dark when the steamer arrived at albany and very much to the prisoners surprise the two men left the room fastening the door behind them  then jet heard a noise as if something was being done to the lock after which a deep silence reigned  theyre going to leave me here and have put something into the lock so the door cant be opened in a hurry he said to himself and during the next ten minutes he struggled desperately to free himself  the bonds had been adjusted by an expert and he might as well have tried to fly as to hope to remove them unaided  he was both thirsty and hungry and every limb ached from being so long in one position  it seemed an almost endless time before the sounds of people moving proclaimed that the passengers were leaving the steamer  then another long interval during which he could hear the noises of the city and finally some one knocked on the door of the room  if he could have cried out then his term of imprisonment would have been speedily ended  some fool has broken the key in the lock he heard one of the servants say after trying several times to open the door  we may as well wait till the engineer can come up  jet was rapidly losing heart  he counted the minutes as if such a course would make the time pass more rapidly and was so thoroughly exhausted when at nearly three oclock in the afternoon the work of picking the lock was begun that he could not have made himself heard even had the gag been removed  the engineer was not a skillful locksmith and half an hour elapsed before the door was opened  even then it was several moments before the bedroom stewards perceived the prisoner and instead of unbinding him at once they ran in search of the purser  when that officer arrived jet was released from his uncomfortable position but his mouth was so dry and parched that he could not speak  the boy realized that he would be questioned closely and remembering the inspectors caution he resolved to tell no more than was absolutely necessary  therefore when the officers of the steamer insisted on being told how he chanced to be a prisoner he simply related the story of the capture without entering into particulars as to why the men should do such a thing  his account was looked upon with suspicion and after questioning him yet more closely the purser said  the boy is lying for some purpose probably to get a free passage why would two men want to steal a fellow like him  ive told the truth jet replied earnestly  dont you suppose i could have stowed away easier than by being tied up till i couldnt wink an waiting for you to come an find me  that sounds reasonable enough but at the same time i dont believe the story the purser said severely  get ashore now and if i catch you on this boat again youll have considerable trouble  it was with difficulty jet could walk owing to the cramps in his limbs but he hobbled ashore at once thinking that for a boy who had simply tried to do his duty he had been badly used  it was necessary he should return home at once but he had no money  he was hungry and yet had nothing with which to purchase a meal  his entire hoardings were in a box at mammy showers house and he did not have the value of a penny about him  its a mighty tight fix he said reflectively as he walked up from the river front and what makes it worse is that the inspector will be certain ive run away because i had something to do with the murder  there could be no question but that he was in a bad scrape and the more he thought of it the more serious did the whole affair appear  hello johnny  whater you doin up here  without really thinking he was the one addressed jet looked around and saw a small boy in district messengers uniform beckoning vigorously to him  was you calling me he asked as he crossed the street  sure  aint that a new york cap  yes  whater you doin here  thats what id like to know jet replied ruefully  well say whats crawlin on you  run away eh  jet was in that frame of mind when to confide in some one is a relief and he told him the same story the purser of the steamer refused to believe  his new acquaintance listened attentively and when jet had concluded asked  what do you spose they wanted with a feller like you  i dont know  hadnt anybodys else money eh  not a cent an im no richer now  what kind of lookin duffers was they  dressed pretty well the short one was  did the other one wear green spectacles an was he tall  yes have you seen em  there was a couple of duffers hangin round the other depot waitin for the train an i wouldnt wonder if they was the ones  the short feller bought two tickets for cooperstown junction  how did you happen to hear all that  i went after some parlor car tickets for our boss  has the train gone yet  it oughter left at seven this mornin  an its most night now so theyve got off  was they runnin away from somebody  just for an instant jet was on the point of telling this brother messenger the whole story but he checked himself in time and replied  i should think theyd want to after playin such a trick on me  say how am i goin back to new york  i dunno less you walk i dont reckon you wanter stow away on the boat  you bet i dont  at this moment the albany messenger remembered that he had been sent on an important errand and said as he turned to go  ill be through work at six oclock  come around by the office an well have another talk  food not conversation was what jet most wanted just then and as his new acquaintance departed in great haste he walked aimlessly along the streets wondering what could be done  the inspector thinks by this time that i lied to him and  by gracious why cant i follow those fellows  thats jest what he told me to do  this seemed like a lucky thought and without realizing that he had no means to prosecute even the shortest search jet went rapidly toward the depot     chapter iv  an engagement  it was necessary for jet to inquire the way to the depot spoken of by his new acquaintance and after arriving there his helplessness seemed more apparent than before  passengers coming and going paid no attention to the boy save to push him out of their road and he was even more alone in the hurrying throng than he had been on the street  after wandering to and fro trying to screw up courage enough to ask the conductor for a free ride and failing in the effort because none of the train hands would give him an opportunity to speak with them he sat down on a truck and mechanically plunged his hands in his pockets  the paper purchased on the evening previous was the only thing which met his touch  i might as well find out about this murder he said to himself as he unfolded the printed sheet  when a feller is readin he kinder forgets how hungry he is i reckon  to give the printed account in all its details would require too much space since there were no less than five columns in jets paper  the substance was to the effect that a wellknown merchant residing on east twentieth street had been found on the floor of his library the previous morning his skull crushed in as if with some heavy instrument like a crowbar or a burglars jimmy and the safe which was known to have contained money and bonds to the amount of fortysix thousand dollars was broken open and empty  the theory of the detectives was that thieves had entered the dwelling for the purpose of robbery but having been surprised by the owner killed him in order to make good their escape  a large tuft of hair in the dead mans hand told that he had grappled with his murderers and the overturned furniture spoke of a long and desperate struggle  singular as it may seem none of the other occupants of the house had heard any unusual noise although the uproar must have been great for some moments nor was any shock perceived when the safe door had been blown off  it was as the paper stated the most mysterious of the many detectivebaffling crimes which had been committed in new york city because of the fact that such a deed could have been done without alarming any one in the vicinity  nothing was said regarding the men for whom jet had carried the satchel because at the time the article had been written the police were not in possession of this very valuable clew  jet had finished reading the article and was studying the matter in his mind without being able to arrive at any definite conclusion regarding the course he should pursue except that he was eager to follow the men who had treated him so roughly when a stranger halted directly in front of him  you dont seem to be very busy  it kinder looks that way for a fact  taking a vacation  a good deal more of a one than i want  id like to pick up some kind of a job that would pay a little money between now an bedtime  live here  in new york  a couple of duffers hired me to come here an then skipped without payin  so youre stranded  youd think so if you didnt have a blessed cent an was hungry enough to eat up the whole town  do you want to earn money to take you back to the city  id rather go to cooperstown junction  then youd be worse off than you are here for it isnt any town  thats where i want to go all the same  i can give you a chance if youll work your way  what do you want me to do  ive got a minstrel company on the road and wouldnt mind paying the traveling expenses of a smart boy who will distribute programmes and make himself generally useful  a show  say i can do a mighty good turn at dancin and give some of these fellers what think they know it all a few points  step out and let me see what you can do  jet was by no means bashful in a few seconds he was dancing as spiritedly as if such discomforts as hunger and fatigue were unknown  youll do the stranger said approvingly when the boy ceased his efforts  ill take you along and pay a little something if youll do a turn  you can bet your life i will but i dont want to go any farther than cooperstown junction  very well therell be plenty of time to talk about that part of the business for we shall make three stands between here and there  take this money to buy something in the way of a lunch and in twenty minutes well start  jet was overjoyed  by this arrangement he saw an opportunity to follow the alleged murderers and at the same time earn money to return to new york if necessary  probably if he had told his new employer the whole story that gentleman would have advised him to call upon the inspector without delay rather than try to run the criminals down himself  as it was however he believed he knew exactly what course to pursue and had little doubt as to succeeding  two sandwiches and three boiled eggs were the provisions he purchased to break his long fast and when the train drew out of the depot the amateur dancer seated by the side of his employer thought he was very fortunate  cobleskill was the town where jet was to make his first bow before the public and with a costume which was rather off color because of having been contributed in fragments by the different members of the company he stepped on the stage feeling just a trifle nervous  to the surprise of his professional companions jet gave a really presentable performance  it is true some of his steps were not exactly artistic but he made up in quantity what might have been lacking in quality and the applause received was enough to make him proud  say my boy youll make a success of this thing if you do a little studying the manager exclaimed when jet finished his turn  ill give you ten dollars a week and pay all your expenses if you want to keep on the road with us  i dont reckon ill stay more than the three nights we talked about cause you see ive got some work to do when we strike cooperstown junction  youll be glad enough to drop it when you see what kind of a place it is  during the remainder of the evening jet had nothing to do save watch the other performers from the wings and but for the fear that the inspector might send an officer to arrest him he would have enjoyed himself hugely  on the following day he took part in the street parade at the next stopping place and during the afternoon read everything concerning the tragedy he could find in the hotel readingroom papers  he did not gain any great amount of information however  the particulars of the murder were related at greater length and it was said that several promising clews were being followed but no details were given concerning the work of the detectives  jest as likely as not ill surprise people before this thing is over if i can get on the track of them men something is goin to happen for a fact  he had already begun to speculate on the anticipated triumph when he should unaided bring the guilty men to justice as his gaze fell on an advertisement displayed in large type   information wanted  a suitable reward will be paid for information as to the whereabouts of jethro lewis  the said boy is fourteen years of age medium size curly hair and when last seen wore a suit of grey clothes with a district messengers cap on which were the figures 48  address   x y z herald office   the inspector is after me jet whispered as the paper fell from his grasp  now my jig is up an i reckon theres no chance but that ill have to go to jail  jet tore the advertisement from the sheet lest it should be seen by some member of the company and then went at once to the theater where he could remain screened from view of the townspeople  the one thought in his mind was that all would be well if he could get on the track of those who had kidnapped him and he blamed himself severely for not having gone straight on to cooperstown junction instead of remaining with the company but how that might have been done while he was penniless was something he did not attempt to solve  i wont stay any longer than tonight he said to himself as the curtain was raised for the evenings performance and the stage manager warned him to be ready for his cue  there must be some way of getting over to that place without waiting for the company  on this night he felt more confidence in himself having had two rehearsals with the leader of the orchestra and at the signal went before the audience confidently  on the previous performance he had not dared to look at the people but kept his eyes on the stage  now however he glanced around and the dance was hardly begun before he brought it to a close the musicians gazing at him in surprise  the cause of his sudden stopping was startling enough to have disconcerted a much older performer  facing him and not more than two rows of seats from the stage sat the two men he was so anxious to meet  go on the leader of the orchestra whispered hoarsely and from the wings he heard the angry command of the stage manager  get to work boy  do you want to queer the whole show  jet nerved himself to begin the dance but he was so exceedingly awkward that several of the audience guyed him a fact which deprived him of the small remnant of selfpossession remaining  without stopping to consider what the result might be he ran at full speed from the stage and the spectators hooted and yelled derisively  what is the matter with you the manager asked fiercely as he shook jet until his teeth chattered  them men are there the boy cried brokenly  i must go right out an get hold of them  youll go and stay you little villain  if you couldnt dance i wouldnt say a word but i know what you are able to do  where are you off to now  i want to change these clothes sos i can go around to the front of the house  what for  them men are there an ive got to find out where theyre stopping  what are they to you  dont stop to ask questions now but let me go jet cried impatiently as he tore himself from the angry mans grasp threw off the stage costume and ran from the building  with no idea his enemies had recognized him he continued on without fear until reaching the corner of the building where one of the men was standing half hidden by the shadow  the fellows hand was raised and as jet came up he struck the boy a crashing blow on the head with a stout stick felling him to the ground like one suddenly deprived of life     chapter v  baffled  when jet regained consciousness he was lying on the ground alone feeling dizzy and suffering from a most severe pain in his head  he raised his hand as if to relieve the anguish and found that his hair was matted together with a certain sticky substance which by aid of a light from a nearby lamp he discovered to be blood  from the theater music could be heard thus telling that the performance had not yet been brought to a close  it was only after the greatest difficulty that jet rose to his feet looked around for an instant as if expecting another attack and then staggered toward the stage entrance  he spent ten minutes covering a distance of twenty yards and on opening the door was greeted by one of the company who had evidently come out for a breath of fresh air  you had better not let the manager see you until after he cools off a little more for  what is the matter lad  this last question after the boys pale and bloodstained face could be seen  somebody struck me  struck you  it looks more as if they had been trying to kill you  perhaps that was what they did want to do and jet halfseated himself halffell on a trunk  however aggrieved the members of the company may have felt because of jets failure none of them were so hardhearted as to ignore the fact of his suffering  those not on the stage were immediately summoned by the boys questioner and in a very few seconds a messenger had been sent in search of a surgeon  dont bother about me ill be all right in a little while jet managed to say and then he fainted  it was soon found that the boys injuries while severe were not dangerous  the scalp had been laid open to such an extent that half a dozen stitches were necessary to close the wound and the surgeon said reassuringly as he bandaged the cut  he has lost considerable blood which accounts for his weak condition it will be some time before he feels all right again but hell come around in good shape  will it do him any harm to keep on traveling with us the manager asked  let him be quiet and i dont anticipate any evil results  do you know how it happened  no  he was very anxious to see some one in the audience and i fancy he went out immediately after breaking down in his act  then send around at once and learn if anybody left the hall just before the assault  this suggestion was acted upon immediately and the doorkeeper stated that two men one tall and the other of medium height went out very soon after jet ran off the stage  it must have been some fellow who had a grudge against him and he broke down from fright at seeing the man but i dont fancy it will do much good to attempt to trace the matter  show people cant afford to fool around a town waiting for the delays of the law when they are billed to play in other places therefore the whole thing had better be dropped  the surgeon received his fee and left the invalid after advising that he be kept perfectly quiet  the performers continued their efforts to amuse and jet lying on a pile of wardrobe stuff with the music of the orchestra and the applause of the audience ringing in his ears tried to decide upon his course of action  ill have to leave the show here an find them fellers he thought to himself and then the pain of his wound prevented any further study of the detective work he hoped to perform  it so chanced however that he did not carry out this resolution  when morning came he was too sick to have much choice in the matter and the kindhearted manager said as he wrapped the boy in an old overcoat  well take him along in the hope of his getting better  if he dont improve in a day or two he can be left in some other town for its certain his life isnt safe in this place  those fellows hit to kill last night and on a second attempt might be more successful  it was fortyeight hours before jet fully realized the condition of affairs and then the show was nearly a hundred miles from the scene of the attack  have we passed cooperstown junction he asked of the manager as the performers boarded a train  bless your heart lad we left that desolate place behind us the morning after you were hurt  how can i get back there  i shant allow you to try it yet awhile  in your present condition it would be as much as your life is worth to make the attempt  but i must go  see here jet why not tell me what is on your mind  i might be able to help you  some time you shall know all about it but not now  just as you please was the impatient reply  will you be able to do a turn tonight  i must get off the train at the next station  not much  thats what ive got to do  youve been mighty good to me but i cant go any farther from new york  how will you get back without money  walk if there isnt any other way  it was useless for the manager to make any protest  he was eager to keep jet with the company for he had seen that he could please the public but after quite a lengthy conversation the boys determination was so strong that it would have been useless to oppose him further  well if i cant help myself i suppose you must go  here are a couple of dollars to help out on the trip and i hope youll win whatevers in the wind  when does the train stop  in less than ten minutes  jet made his preparations for leaving by removing the coat which one of the company had contributed for his comfort but the manager insisted that he keep it and when he stepped upon the platform of a small station while the train continued on it was with a very decided sense of loneliness  his first care was to buy a new hat  his messengers cap was too conspicuous and afforded positive means of identification in case he met with any one who had read the advertisement  then came the question as to whether he should return by the train at the expense of his small capital or walk at the expense of time  it aint certain they stayed in that town after knockin me down an i stand as good a chance of meetin em on the road as anywhere else so ill tramp it  after investing twenty cents in crackers and cheese and consulting with the station master as to whether it would be advisable for him to follow the track or the carriage road jet set out on his journey  counting ties was not as easy a job as he had fancied and after an hours steady walking he sat down to rest a short distance from the road in the shelter of a shanty which looked as if it might originally have been intended for a toolhouse when that portion of the road was being built  he had not yet fully recovered from the effects of the murderous blow and the steady traveling tired him to such an extent that it became necessary to lie down  the natural result of this indulgence was that he soon fell asleep and even the rumbling of the trains as they passed failed to awaken him until after some time when he became aware of a tugging and pulling at his coat  opening his eyes he saw crouching by his side about as villainous a looking tramp as one would care to meet  what are you up to jet cried angrily as he attempted to rise to his feet but was prevented by the man who threw one arm around the boys body  lay still sonny an nobody shant hurt you  take your hand out of my pocket and jet cautiously drew up his legs ready for a sudden dash  now dont get into a fidget im only tryin to find out if youve got a license to travel over this ere road  the fellow was now doing his utmost to get at the contents of his prisoners pockets and although the special one on which he was working contained nothing of value jet did not intend to submit to the indignity  he had drawn his feet up as far as possible and was ready for the struggle  striking the man a blow in the eye with his disengaged hand he kicked upward an instant later hitting the tramp fairly on the back of the head as he involuntarily sprang backwards from the effects of the pain  this vigorous treatment sufficed to break the hold and jet sprang to his feet just in time to avoid a vicious blow  try to get the best of me will you the man cried savagely as he picked up a heavy cane which lay near by keeping his eye meanwhile on the boy  jet knew he must do his best or suffer for what had been done  he could see nothing which would serve as a weapon and was thinking it might be best to make a break for freedom when the man sprang upon him  luckily he succeeded in avoiding a blow from the cane by seizing with both hands the tramps right arm and then came a desperate struggle  not for a moment did he dare to release his hold lest the fellow should be able to use his weapon and in the meanwhile he was pummeled soundly  the mans left hand was at liberty and with it he showered blow after blow on the boys body  jet managed to screen his face by using the tramps arm as a shield and finding that he was getting the worst of it darted forward at the same time he kicked with all his strength  this sudden attack sent the man to the ground and as he fell jet wrested the cane from his grasp  its my turn now he cried as the fellow scrambled to his feet in a rage  make tracks out of this mighty fast or ill break every bone in your body  the man glared at him fiercely for an instant and then stepping back a few paces shouted loudly in a peculiar tone  stop that and jet ran forward with the stick uplifted  dont you dare to bring your friends here  you spoke a leetle too late sonny for theyre coming  jet glanced quickly down the track where could be seen two others of the same sort as his adversary running at full speed  i reckon we wont have any trouble about huntin for your license now the fellow said with a grin as he retreated to a safe distance  jet hesitated an instant  he knew that it would be useless to make a standup fight against all three but yet at the same time flight was impossible because of his exhaustion caused by the struggle with the tramp  looking quickly around he observed that the door of the shanty was open hanging by one hinge  the hut might serve as a place of refuge until some of the section hands should come that way and he leaped into the building  wrenching the door from its fastening he pulled it inside and set it up lengthwise as a sort of a barrier  theyll have to come within reach of this cane before getting at me an itll be hard luck if i dont give a good account of myself for a little while he said as with compressed lips he waited for the battle which he knew must soon begin     chapter vi  the battle  the two tramps who were coming down the track halted on reaching the one who had attacked jet and all had a brief conversation which evidently concerned the occupant of the shanty  jet watched every movement but while they were talking he had an opportunity to gaze around the hut in the hope of seeing other means of defense  it was empty with the exception of a pile of straw in one corner which most likely had served as a bed for these or other tramps  theres nothing for it but to stand up here as long as possible and perhaps somebody will come along before they can get the best of me he said grimly  if things are going on at this rate it would have been better for me if id stayed with the show for this isnt doin very much toward findin the murderers  the men had finished their conversation and were now approaching the shanty  jet raised the heavy cane and stood ready for the battle  it was not to begin as quickly as he thought for the three men halted a few yards away and one of them said in a wheedling tone as he stepped several paces nearer  see here sonny were poor hardworkin carpenters out of a job theres no need of havin trouble with you but were that hungry as to make a fight seem pleasant alongside of suckin our thumbs an eatin windpuddin all the time  what do you mean by all that  nothin moren to let you know how were fixed  it doesnt concern me  theres where youre makin a big mistake sonny  youve got money an were broke so its nothin moren fair you should whack up  im no better off than you are or i wouldnt be walking instead of riding on the cars  then come out like a man an show us what you have got  id be a fool to do that for its none of your business  now youre makin another mistake  weve been put here to find out sich things  theres no use of all this chinning for im not a fool jet cried angrily  i shant come out nor will you have a chance to rob me  im sorry you wont listen to reason for we may have to treat you mighty rough before this job is finished  do the best you know how but remember that im going to have something to say first and jet swung the cane threateningly  better take him right out well have visitors before long an it wont do to have sich a cub around the leader of the party said as he advanced after having armed himself with several huge rocks  now the battle began in downright earnest  almost before jet understood that the men were ready to make the attack a shower of stones were hurled against the shanty and two came unpleasantly near his head as they were flung through the door  if one of them hits me the jig is up jet muttered dodging his head barely in time to escape a huge fragment which would have crushed his skull like an eggshell  well give you one more chance to come out peaceable like the leader cried as he motioned for his companions to cease firing  if it had not been for the ignominy of backing down from the bold stand he had taken jet would have accepted the invitation  the small amount of money in his possession did not warrant a risk of life and then again he was but delaying the real purpose of his life by remaining  his pride prevented him from surrendering and he made no reply  again the men advanced with a shower of stones and now they were so near that jet could only find shelter by hugging the side of the hut nearest the door  cant some of you hit him the leader asked angrily  we mustnt keep the fun up very long for the boss is bound to come mighty soon an therell be a row that amounts to something if he finds us foolin like this  these words caused the men to renew their efforts and twice did jet receive a severe blow on the body before he found an opportunity to return the compliment  then one of the fellows leaning over the barricade in order to take better aim presented a fair target  jet brought the cane down on his head with full force and the fellow fell to the ground like one dead  a roar of rage went up from the others but they prudently fell back a short distance dragging their companion with them  you see it isnt going to be so onesided as you fancied jet cried now haul off an ill leave without saying another word  you wont have much more chance to talk the leader cried savagely as he gathered another armful of rocks but before he could renew the attack a shout from the distance caused him to drop his weapons very suddenly  the boss has come an now we shall get a tonguelashing one of the fellows said as if in alarm  i reckon that wont hurt us very much the leader replied but at the same time he dropped the rocks and stood ready to receive the newcomer  jet could not see the track from where he was standing but he heard what sounded like a familiar voice ask sharply  now what kind of deviltry are you fellers into  trying to drive out a rat weve got cornered in here  same old tricks eh  well some of these days youll bite off more than can be chewed easily an then the jig will be up for all hands cant you act decent one day in a month  that depends  when were left alone three or four weeks on mighty short allowance it stands us in hand to look out for ourselves the leader of the party replied insolently  take care of your tongue my friend or therell be something else needin care precious soon  let me see your game  jet heard the sound of rapid footsteps and an instant later the tall man whom he had such good cause to remember was standing at a safe distance trying to peer into the shanty  hello he cried in surprise as he recognized the boy  it seems that youve been doin a lucky stroke of business without knowing it dont let him give you the slip an bring him over to the house as soon as possible  somebody you know one of the fellows asked  yes a boy who has found out too much for his own good and he must be kept mighty close  it wouldnt take long to fix that for you was the significant reply  we may have to do it but bob is agin that kind of business an to humor him we must keep the cub awhile  has bob come back  he must be at the house by this time  have you brought grub  of course not  do you think we travel around the country loaded down like pack horses  better do that than go hungry  is everything used up  yes or we shouldnt be down here  ill see to layin in a stock an there shall be plenty to drink when you can get hold of the boy come along ill start now  the man disappeared from view and the sound of his footsteps told that he was walking rapidly away in the direction from which he had approached  what a fool i was to stay here fightin for less than two dollars when by giving it up i might have been half a mile from here before that villain came jet said bitterly as he nerved himself for what he knew must be the final struggle  he had good cause for fear  after the instructions which had been given there was little chance the men would let him slip through their fingers and with such an incentive on their part there was no hope the struggle could be prolonged  the man whom he had stricken down was now on his feet vowing vengeance and ready to continue the fight  close right in on him the leader said as he seized a stout rail from a nearby fence  he can only hit one blow and the job is ended  ill give them a chance to remember me jet said as he stood ready for the attack and the words had hardly come into his mind before the men were in front of him  striking out with all his strength his cane came in contact with the leaders weapon shattering the former and the fight was over  two of the men seized him by the arms and the third amused himself by slapping the helpless boy in the face until tired of the sport  tie his hands an well mosey along  joe is after something to drink an we must be there in time to get our share  one of the party had rope enough in his pocket to obey the order and in a twinkling jets arms were bound so tightly to his sides as to cause great pain  during all this time he had not spoken a word but he did a power of thinking  in the first place he scrutinized his captors carefully in order to be able to give a perfect description of them in case he succeeded in making his escape and then took a good survey of the surrounding country that he might find his way back again  now get along an walk sharp or what i have given you will seem no more than a fleabite alongside of the whalin youll get the leader said as one of the party started off and he pushed jet behind him  the prisoner could do no less than obey and despite the disadvantage of walking with his hands tied he managed to keep pace with the others  during nearly half an hour the party continued on at a rapid pace turning out of the railroad track about a quarter of a mile from the shanty and striking directly through the woods  at the end of this time they had arrived at what appeared to be little more than a clearing in the woods where was situated a rude log house of two stories around which was piled a complete circle of cordwood not less than six feet high  it may have been cut for fuel but it would serve admirably as breastworks if the place was attacked by officers  a small outbuilding which was evidently used as a stable stood fifteen or twenty feet in the rear of the main building inside the circle of wood and near the door were tied two savage looking dogs who tugged and pulled at their chains while they barked loudly as the party approached  if we had left them loose i dont reckon either the boss or bob would have cared to come very near while we were away the leader of the party said grimly as he went toward the stable leaving the others in charge of the prisoner  there aint much chance ill ever be able to tell the inspector what ive been doing jet thought as he entered the enclosure formed by the fuel and was led toward the single door of which the house boasted those dogs would be worse than a hundred men if a fellow was trying to sneak off  he had no further opportunity for speculation just then for the men pushed him roughly into the house and he stood in front of the short man who had so successfully acted the part of a gentleman at the union square hotel     chapter vii  a bold attempt  it seems to be pretty hard to get rid of you the man said with a grin as jet stood in front of him  i cant say its my fault  perhaps not and it shant be ours in the future  where have you been  trying to earn money enough to pay my way back home  well provide you a job here  if you behave yourself things wont go so very bad but therell be the very devil to pay if we find you trying to give us the slip  i shant stay any longern i can help jet replied stoutly  well take good care that you cant help it for some time  sam take him up stairs where the small press was i reckon hell be safe enough there and when joe comes back turn the dogs loose  then you an hell have to be mighty careful about goin into the yard for theyll tackle either of you as quick as they would this boy  so much the better  well look out for ourselves  there must be work done tonight so get ready for it while you are up stairs  the fellow waited an instant as if to learn whether there were any more directions to be given and then dragged jet out through a door which led to the apartments above  there were no stairs connecting the first with the second story  a stout ladder afforded the only means of ascent and since jet could not make his way up this while his hands were tied his jailor was forced to remove the rope  now get along but look out how you try to play any tricks for this is a mighty unhealthy place for anything of the kind  jet had no idea of attempting to escape while the odds were so decidedly against him and he obeyed meekly  the man conducted him to a small room at the rear of the building which looked as if it had lately been used as a workshop and there left him after locking and barring the door from the outside  the prisoner gazed around him curiously  the apartment did not contain a single article of furniture  one small window admitted the light and this was so heavily barred with wooden uprights that even with a sharp saw considerable time would have been required for the prisoner to cut through  in one corner was a heap of dirt and fragments of paper the floor was stained as if with ink as were the walls of hewn boards  from the window the stable was all with the exception of trees to be seen  a more desolate spot could not well be imagined and to add to its loneliness was the fact that it must be many miles from the nearest habitation  jet had no time to speculate upon his own condition the only thought in his mind just then was why these men chose to live in such a forsaken place  in an adjoining room he could hear some person walking around briskly evidently moving heavy articles from one spot to another and from below came the hum of conversation  having nothing better to do and still intent on trying to learn the purpose for which this house was intended jet began kicking away the pile of dirt  a bit of bright green attracted his attention  picking it up he found to his great surprise and delight that it was a new ten dollar bill  the fact that it was unsigned escaped his notice  well this isnt so bad he said in a tone of satisfaction  if i ever do get away from this place ill have money enough to pay my fare to new york  i spose it belongs to them fellers but im going to keep it all the same to even up for what theyve done  now the dirt pile had great attractions  he examined it closely and had the satisfaction of finding a second bill exactly like the first  these people must have plenty of money if they can afford to leave it around loose like this he said as he placed the newly found wealth in his stocking directly beneath his foot  quite a large quantity of plain paper in small strips was all that rewarded his further search among the dirt but he did not think there was any cause for complaint on his part  twenty dollars will come pretty nigh settlin for all them fellers have done to me  now lets try to study up a plan for gettin out of this place  there must be some way  a second examination of the window gave no encouragement for his strength was not sufficient to force aside the bars  the boards of the floor while not nailed with any remarkable care defied all his attempts to remove them  then he looked at the ceiling which was composed only of the rafters with beams poles and boards laid across the top but so far as he could judge unfastened  i dont know as i should be any better off if i was up there but it wont do much harm to make a try in that direction after dark  a fellow ought to be able to shin up the window bars  the more he thought of this possibility for escape the more simple did it seem and he resolved on putting the plan into execution  that the dogs were outside ready to try conclusions with any stranger he understood very well but it was useless to borrow trouble on this score until learning whether there was a chance for him to descend to their level  i dont spose itll amount to anything more than gettin into the loft an then coming down again but its better than laying still he said and from that time until sunset he remained at the window gazing out at the trees and the deepmouthed guardians of the place  when as nearly as he could judge two hours had passed from the time of his arrival the tall man drove up in a springless wagon which was apparently filled with food and liquor  the load was taken into the house the horse stabled and then the dogs were let loose  that they would be very disagreeable customers with whom to have any dispute could be well understood as they ran to and fro growling and snarling and despite his resolve not to borrow trouble until he knew there was a possibility it could come jet could not prevent himself from speculating upon what would happen if he suddenly appeared before them  it was nearly sunset before the door of his room was opened and then the short man entered bringing several slices of raw bacon half a loaf of bread and a bottle of water  i dont count on havin you starve to death he said as he placed the articles on the floor but you wont get enough to injure your health i reckon  why dont you let me go to new york  i havent done anything to harm you  that is because you havent had much of a chance as yet except to talk with the inspector my boy and we dont intend to give you one there isnt  here bob  whats the use of chinnin with that cub when the grub is ready  come down or i wont answer that your share will be left  this threat had the desired effect for bob went out of the room very quickly taking good care however to lock and bolt the door behind him  the night came jet could no longer distinguish objects from the window and the room was so dark that it was impossible to see his way around  crouching close by the window jet heard the heavy tramp as the men came upstairs and by the noises he knew they had entered the apartment adjoining his prison  the hum of conversation came through the rough partition quite distinctly and in a short time this was followed by a heavy thumping sound at regular intervals  it was as if the men were pounding with a wooden mallet except that the blows were fully thirty seconds apart  jet tried to guess what they were doing but the effort was in vain  whats the use bothering about them he said finally to himself so long as they stay where they are and dont trouble me i havent much right to complain though a fellow would find it mighty hard work to sleep in such a racket  it was time to make his explorations if he proposed doing so before morning and he arose to his feet  by the aid of the window bars it was not a difficult matter for one as agile as he to clamber to the rafters above and once there the remainder of the task was comparatively simple  hanging by one arm to the beams with his disengaged hand he pulled away the loose timbers and boards from above until a passage was made for his body  then raising himself by both hands he was soon standing where he could touch the roof of the building but unable to see his surroundings because of the intense darkness  i dont see that i am much better off up here he muttered grimly as he walked cautiously along without any very good idea of what he expected to find  just then a twinkling star was seen and he discovered that one of the roofboards was badly rotted  now there was something tangible in the way of escape and he eagerly began to tear away the decayed wood laying the pieces gently on the flooring until there was an aperture sufficiently large to admit of his passing through  an instant later he was seated astride the ridgepole looking down into the yard where the ferocious dogs were running wildly to and fro as if having already scented their prey  now indeed was jet at a loss to know what to do  even if the animals had not been below he would have hesitated to leap from the roof of the building lest he should strike upon the barricade of cordwood with which the house was surrounded  he must go down regardless of the many dangers or return to the room where the men could murder him whenever they felt so disposed and after a few seconds reflection he chose the former course  there is one chance of getting away from the dogs an no show whatever that ill ever leave here alive unless i go now he said to himself  clutching at the rough boards literally with his fingernails he slid slowly down toward the edge of the roof at a point farthest from the stable  he could see the wall of wood directly beneath him and hear the low growling of the dogs as they sniffed the air to discover the cause of the sounds which had aroused their suspicions  to remain very long deliberating would be to run the risk of the animals giving an alarm and jet gathered himself for a spring  putting forth all his strength in order to clear the obstacle he leaped  the ends of the cordwood just grazed his clothing as he passed over them and jet struck the soft ground which gave forth no warning sound to those who were in the building on that side of the clearing where the trees were nearest  he was unhurt although badly shaken up and would have started at full speed to gain the partial shelter of the forest but for the fact that just then a heavy body leaped over the barricade  it was one of the dogs and jet knew he must now fight desperately if he would live  a stick of wood about as thick as his wrist was the first weapon which came to his hand as he clutched at the top of the pile to draw himself up and with this he awaited in silence the onset     chapter viii  an arrest  jet understood only too well that even if he should come off victorious in this battle with the dog and in so doing make sufficient noise to be heard by the inmates of the house all his efforts would have been in vain  although the moon had not yet risen the light of the stars permitted the boy to see his antagonist who on first striking the ground on the outside of the barricade stood for an instant as if at a loss to locate the intruder  jet thought it possible he might yet escape and started toward the shelter of the trees but the sound of his footsteps soon told the brute where to look for his prey  with a low angry yelp he turned standing motionless a few seconds during which time jet continued to back farther away from the house in order that there might be less chance the noise of the conflict would be overheard  then the dog crouched for a spring and jet every muscle strained to its utmost tension stood ready to receive him  the battle was short  while the dog was yet in the air jet struck out with the heavy stick and his aim was perfect  the club fell squarely on the brutes head crushing the skull as if it had been an eggshell and without so much as a moan the dog dropped dead  there was yet another to be met but so far he had not made his presence known save by angry barks and jet ran for the woods with all speed  he gained the shelter of the trees and paused for an instant to look back  if he must meet the companion of the animal he had killed it would be better to do so at the edge of the undergrowth where he could have a fair view of his antagonist rather than fight in the darkness where the branches would obstruct his movements  no sound came from the inmates of the house to show that they had been alarmed  from the window of the room where jet had heard them moving about a bright light could be seen and what seemed very strange considering the fact that the night was far from cold the men had built such a roaring fire that the sparks were coming from the chimney in wreaths  even where he stood jet could hear those dull heavy blows at regular intervals which since it proved their work had not been interrupted showed that the men had no idea their prisoner was making his escape  the remaining dog was rushing to and fro barking furiously but contrary to jets expectations he did not leap over the barrier  i dont reckon theres any use waiting longer for him  it will be better to take my chances of fighting among the trees than to stay until those fellows come out  with this thought in his mind jet started at a rapid pace through the woods exerting himself to the utmost to keep ever before him the direction of the mornings journey  the bread and bacon he had put in his pocket before attempting the escape and now as he made his way through the underbrush he ate leisurely for strength was the one thing needful for the successful completion of the task and to retain this food was essential  more than once he fell over the trunk of a tree or was thrown by the vines which caught his feet as in a snare but each time he arose to his feet undismayed and the weary tramp was continued without a halt until considerably past midnight when he had arrived at the railroad track  with plenty of money in his pocket there was no thought of walking any farther than necessary and jets only desire was to find a depot  by continuing on half an hour longer in a direction opposite the one taken by him when he met the three apparent tramps the boy found that for which he sought  the night train would be along in ten minutes so the stationagent said and jet bought a ticket for albany  he had been tempted to change one of the tendollar bills for this purpose but decided not to do so after realizing that it might be imprudent to display so much money  of the amount given him by the manager of the minstrel company he had enough left to pay for a passage and purchase something to eat in the morning consequently there was no necessity of using that which he had found  of the journey to albany he knew absolutely nothing  the long tramp had given him an overpowering desire for sleep and the soft seat was restinviting therefore in less than five minutes from the time he boarded the train his eyes were closed in slumber  on arriving at his destination one of the brakemen awakened him with a vigorous shaking which would have done credit to a giants strength and he went out in the early morning air decidedly refreshed  his plans had all been laid during the tramp through the woods and he knew exactly what to do  first breakfast was necessary and this important duty he attended to without delay spending therefor the last of his change  it was six oclock when he arrived at the hudson river depot and learned that a train for new york would leave in a short time  give me a ticket he said producing one of the bills found in the house from which he escaped  the ticketseller took the money looked at it scrutinizingly for an instant and then at the boy  where did you get this he asked  out on the road a piece  dont think i stole it do you  tell me where you got it  i dont know  it wasnt any town an i aint acquainted round this way  who gave it to you  a man  did you earn it  say mister whats the matter and now jet began to be alarmed for the ticketagent looked very stern  instead of replying the man beckoned to an officer who was standing near by and said in a low tone  take this boy on a charge of passing counterfeit money  i will be up to make a complaint as soon as i can get away  come with me and the officer laid his hand heavily on jets shoulder  whats the matter jet asked as he tried to release himself but succeeded only in getting such a choking as nearly deprived him of breath  youd better come along without any trouble for i dont want to club a little shaver like you  but im going to new york an that man has got my money  i reckon you wont need it yet awhile  tell me what business youve got to haul me off like this  youll find out soon enough  by this time quite a crowd had began to gather and realizing that it would be useless to make any further objections jet added  let up on my collar a little sos i can breathe an ill go along peaceable  the officer did as he had been requested but not to such an extent that there was any danger his prisoner would have an opportunity to escape and the two walked rapidly along the street followed by a throng of boys  at the police station jet was led in front of a high desk and the officer said in reply to a question from the sergeant  charged by the ticketseller at the depot with passing counterfeit money  the small prisoner was asked his name age and place of residence to all of which he made truthful answers and then he was searched thoroughly  as a matter of course this could only result in the finding of the second bill and the sergeant said severely  i reckon this isnt his first offense of the same kind  who sent you out to pass that money my boy  jet hesitated  he had believed it would be possible for him to give such information to the inspector as would result in the arrest of the murderers and was not willing to tell these officers the whole story  i didnt know the money was bad he said after a brief time of reflection  is that the only reason why you are going to keep me here  before the business is ended youll find that to be serious enough  but is it all  yes  then will you send word to the inspector in new york that district messenger no 48 is here and wants to see him right away  so  youre the boy who is wanted so badly in new york eh  i dont know anything about that but i must see the inspector mighty soon or itll be too late  too late for what  thats jest what i cant tell you  it may be possible i shall make you  you can try but it wont be any use for i wont say a word to anybody but him  he has nothing to do with this case of passing counterfeit money  i know it but theres somethin else of a good deal more importance that hes got a finger in  it dont make any difference to me about the money for ive done nothin wrong however you try to fix it  jet spoke in such a tone of independence that the sergeant would have made him feel the weight of his authority but for the fact that word had been sent out from the new york police headquarters in such a peculiar manner as to leave no doubt of the boys being an important prisoner or witness and he could not well decline to grant the request  you may think to get out of the scrape by playing this game but i promise youll be in a worse box than ever if the inspector dont like your message  ill run the risk jet replied calmly feeling that his arrest would be a matter of but little moment if through it he should be able to communicate with the inspector before the men in the woods would have time to get away  it would be much better if you confided in me for just at present you are in a disagreeable position and i could do considerable toward helping you  well let things go as they are providin you let the inspector know ive got to see him right away jet replied and the sergeant could not well continue the conversation  the small prisoner was confined in one of the cells but due care was taken in regard to his comfort for by this time all in the station had begun to look upon him as a very important person  jet was not disturbed because of the fact that he had been arrested on a charge of passing counterfeit money already he had a shrewd suspicion as to the value of his discoveries and felt quite certain he would receive a warm and friendly reception from the inspector     chapter ix  the detective  the only thing which troubled jet as he sat alone in the narrow cell was the possibility that the inspector might not get his message in time to bag the suspected men before they left the house in the woods for now that he had made his escape it was reasonable to suppose they would be alarmed  on this score however he need have had little fear  before sunset a gentleman was ushered into his cell and the door locked behind him  you wanted to see the inspector the stranger began as he seated himself on the narrow bench which served as a bed  well sposin i did jet asked thinking this man was some one attached to the station  he has sent me to know where you have been  did you come from new york  yes on the last train  why didnt the inspector come  he never leaves the city there are plenty of officers at headquarters to do such work  now what do you know  moren ill tell to anybody but him  in that case i shall have to take you back to the city  but then it will be too late them fellers are bound to skip when they find out ive got away  what fellows  jet looked up suspiciously  i dont want to say a word to anybody but the inspector  i told you he sent me to do the business  you can talk as freely as to him  who are you  detective harvey  from new york  see here my boy i dont blame you for having doubts and to set them at rest ill prove that what i say is true and the detective pounded on the bars of the cell door until the turnkey appeared  i wish you would ask the sergeant to step this way a moment  that officer obeyed the summons at once and when he stood at the door the detective said to him  will you kindly tell this boy who i am  he is afraid i am sailing under false colors  you are detective harvey sent by the inspector at new york in answer to a telegram i wired this morning  to give him perfect confidence in you i will say further that at present he is confined for passing counterfeit money but if you should ask to have him released i guarantee that the charge will be withdrawn  are you satisfied now my boy  yes i reckon its all right  ill take the chances but if you fellers are playin any game the inspector is bound to raise a terrible row when i see him  that part of it is all right  tell harvey what you know and i answer for it that it will be the same as if the inspector himself was here  with this remark the sergeant walked away and jet said in a low tone  now ill tell the whole story but first i want to know why that advertisement about me was put in the papers  we thought those two men might have gotten hold of you more especially since the manager at the district messenger station reported that you spoke of being hired to go to yonkers  jet now gave with careful attention to detail the story of his misadventures from the time of leaving the union square hotel and detective harvey received the information with no slight degree of excitement  i suppose the bills you found in the pile of dirt are in the sergeants hands he said half to himself when jet concluded  i reckon so anyway they took both away from me  we will go up stairs and look at them  if im not mistaken my boy we shall run to earth the gang who are flooding the country with the most dangerous counterfeit known at the same time that we bag the murderers  do you think you could lead me to the house in the woods  im certain of it but we shall have to walk a long distance  i wouldnt grumble if it was fifty miles providing we finally succeeded  come with me  again he summoned the turnkey ordered him to open the door and said to jet  follow me  aint they goin to keep me here any longer  i should say not  you heard what the sergeant said and we must be out of this town within an hour  jet followed his conductor up stairs and in a few moments the two were in earnest consultation with the albany chief of police  the counterfeits were found to be the same which had given the authorities so much trouble  they were so well executed as to pass without suspicion in the majority of cases and the fact that the two discovered by jet were imperfect impressions which had been thrown aside by the makers was probably the only cause of their having been refused by the ticketseller  it is lucky you were arrested harvey said in a tone of satisfaction  why jet asked in surprise  it wasnt any fun to stay in that little cell all day  i can fancy not but if you had come to new york a great deal of time would have been wasted and as it is we can start in search of those fellows at once  but you an i cant handle the crowd if they show fight  we dont intend to try  when we leave this town our party will be large enough  how many men do you want the chief asked the detective  two providing they are ready at once  i suppose you will go a certain portion of the way on the train  certainly  on that road the next one leaves in about an hour  i will have the best men i know of waiting at the depot  is there anything else to be done  not now  jet and i will go for dinner and meet you at the station can you lend the boy a revolver one more weapon may come in handy in case of a fight and unless those fellows have already made a change of base i reckon we shall have a lively time  the chief gave jet a weapon and plenty of cartridges and district messenger no 48 felt exceedingly proud as he walked out of the station with the revolver in the inside pocket of his coat  harvey was no niggard so far as caring for the comfort of his small assistant was concerned  a dinner at the delavan house such as jet had never set down to before was indulged in and when the messenger arose from the table it was with the sensation of being full almost to bursting  to the boys relief harvey informed him that the inspector never for a moment believed he had run away but attributed his absence to exactly the true cause and all which had been done toward finding him was with this view of the case  it will be a mighty big thing for you if we succeed tonight the detective added for the rewards which have been offered both for the counterfeiters and the murderers amount to no small sum a portion of which will of course belong to you  im satisfied if i make wages out of the thing but its too bad that money i found wasnt good for i allowed to put the most of it away sos to pay my board till i got another job  you neednt hunt very far for work if this thing turns out all right ill take care of that part of it  since jet was to be the guide on the expedition his advice was asked for when the tickets were purchased and in order to be certain of his bearings he thought best to return to the town where he boarded the cars during his flight  two officers dressed in citizens clothes reported to harvey at the depot and one would say judging from their personal appearance that they were well able to cope with twice the number of desperate characters who might be found in the house in the woods  it was late in the evening when the party alighted from the train and jet set out up the track leading the way until he arrived at the point where he emerged from the woods  this is the place he said pointing to the trunk of a dead tree  i took especial notice of that sos id be able to know where to strike in again  in what direction is the house situated harvey asked  about there and jet pointed toward the north  do you think you could find it in the night  im certain i could when it was light but there is a long distance to walk so whats to hinder our goin as far as i traveled an then waiting for morning  its a good idea  go ahead and when you think we are far enough call a halt  i dont fancy camping in the woods all night and that is about what you are preparing to do one of the albany officers said grumblingly  this is a case where we must put up with considerable discomfort for the sake of bagging our game  let the boy do as he chooses ill answer for it that hes got brains enough to lead us right  harvey was ready to undergo any discomfort in order to gain the desired end but his companions were not as enthusiastic  they complained at being under the guidance of a boy in whom they did not feel the most perfect confidence and harvey was obliged to speak very harshly before they would consent to follow  jet led the way with no slight degree of mental disquietude  if he failed to conduct the party correctly it might be said he was playing the traitor and the task set for him was a difficult one considering the fact that he had only been over the ground once before  nevertheless he was willing to do all in his power trusting for success to the chapter of accidents rather than any especial skill of his own and the men followed close at his heels  during his flight he had noted carefully all the prominent landmarks and the fact that he had seen them only in the night aided him now  during at least four hours he advanced at a rapid pace stopping now and then to take counsel with harvey and at the expiration of that time he said as he pointed toward a clump of alder bushes  there is where i first began the tramp after the fight with the dog  are you certain of that  you can make sure by crawling through the bushes three or four hundred yards when the house should be in sight  ill go ahead now  if i get off the course stop me and harvey took command of the party  that jet had made no mistake was shown ten minutes later when the outlines of the building with its barricade of cordwood could be seen against the gray sky  the house was wrapped in darkness presenting a striking contrast with the scene as viewed by jet a few hours previous and the latter said mournfully  i reckon all hands have skipped  it wont take us long to find out for well overhaul the place at once     chapter x  one prisoner  the brute guardian of the house was at his post as was soon learned when the newcomers drew nearer  the deep baying of the dog was heard before the party had gained the edge of the woods where an unobstructed view of the house could be had and jet whispered to harvey in a tone of satisfaction  its a good thing i killed the other for now there cant be much of a fight with only one to be taken care of  does that woodpile run all around the house the detective asked  it does so far as i could see except at the gate  where is that  to the right  how high is it  about the same as the woodpile and made of planks  it was evident the place had been built with especial reference to sustaining an attack and there seemed little chance but that it would be stoutly defended  three men inside could snap their fingers at a hundred harvey said half to himself but at the same time four on the outside could keep a dozen of them prisoners  you are bound to have a fight jet whispered  theres little doubt about that my boy  you are to stay under cover of the barricade near the gate while we rush in  why dont i go with you  because theres too much danger  it will be enough if you prevent any of the crowd from giving us the slip  but i want to do my share it was through me that you found out where they were and it isnt fair to make me stay behind  youre a brick my boy harvey exclaimed as he grasped jets hand warmly  if we finish this work all right ill show you a chance to earn a living for you shall be my partner  do you mean it jet cried speaking incautiously loud in his excitement  every word but well drop the matter now and attend to business ive got a general idea of the lay of the land and there must be no more time wasted  keep close behind me  harvey then held a whispered conversation with his companions during which it was decided that the barricade should be scaled near the gate and the dog silenced if possible in the manner jet settled the other one  dont shoot unless it is absolutely necessary harvey said in conclusion for we must take those fellows by surprise  it isnt likely theyve been obliging enough to leave the door open so we can walk in one of the party suggested  by attacking that with the heaviest sticks of cordwood after the brute is killed we should be able to pound our way through in a very few seconds  now come on and work lively after we are in the yard  harvey led the way and on arriving at the gate it was found to be an extremely difficult point at which to effect an entrance because of its height therefore the plan was so far changed as to move farther toward the rear of the building where the party began clambering the wood  during all this time the dog had kept up a furious barking and when harvey stood on the top of the barricade ready to leap down the animal was directly beneath him ready for a spring  it would have been an easy matter to shoot him then and there but the detective was not willing to discharge his weapon and armed with a heavy stick he leaped upon him  unfortunately just as he jumped some of the wood rolled from beneath his feet and he was turned in such a manner that he fell prostrate before the enraged brute  in another instant and before he could have scrambled to his feet the dog would have had him by the throat but for jet who was on the alert for just such an accident  in a twinkling he was inside the enclosure and the remainder of the party hardly had time to understand what had happened before his club descended on the animals head  one such blow was sufficient to put an end to this portion of the battle and when harvey stood erect once more the dog was still in death save for the muscular twitching of his body  again harvey clasped the boy by the hand for the latters timely action had saved the man from severe wounds if nothing more serious and then all advanced cautiously toward the house  listening at the door an instant not a sound could be heard  from the silence all believed the men had made their escape but yet it would not be wise to take that for granted  harvey raised his weapon looked around to make certain his companions were ready to join in the assault and then whispered  now  strike together and keep it up till something gives way  the words had hardly been spoken when the heavy sticks of wood were launched against the door and before a second blow could be given the report of a revolver rang out sharp and angry on the night air  we have got them the detective shouted triumphantly for there was no reason why they should remain silent  work quickly boys  again and again were the blows delivered causing the barrier to splinter and creak on its hinges and the fusillade of shots was kept up during this portion of the task  the assaulting party were so near within the shadow of the building that those inside who appeared to be in the upper story could not take good aim without exposing themselves and the bullets fled wide of their mark  crash  crash  with each blow portions of the door were splintered off until before one hardly had time to count twelve from the beginning of the assault the besiegers had free access to the building  let one stay here and the others follow me harvey cried as he drew his revolver and rushed at full speed up the ladder  jet was close at his heels  he intended to take a mans part in the capture and for the time being all thought of danger was forgotten  the firing had come from the front room and there harvey ran after gaining the upper floor  stand back jet theyre bound to shoot when the door is opened he said as he halted before the second barrier  ill take my share of it the boy replied and he pressed forward for the honor of entering first but harvey pushed him back quickly as he laid his hand on the wooden latch  to the surprise of both the door yielded readily to the hand instead of being locked as was supposed  harvey sprang in and jet stepped so close behind as almost to tread on his leaders heels  one man stood in the center of the apartment brandishing a revolver which he discharged full at the detective  the latter had stooped suddenly on entering and the bullet buried itself in the woodwork above his head  quick as thought harvey threw himself forward overturning the defender of the house and causing him to lose his weapon  stand guard over this fellow and shoot him as you would a dog if he so much as makes the least motion to get up the detective shouted to jet  then he sprang back to the ladder  they have given us the slip get into the yard while i search the other rooms  the albany detectives had not yet had time to ascend and they obeyed at once while harvey ran quickly through the other rooms  a search of five minutes was sufficient to show that the building had no other occupant than the prisoner whom jet was guarding and harvey returned to the front room  when did your pals leave he asked as he slipped a pair of handcuffs on the fellows wrists  they went away this morning  what right have you to break into innocent mens houses  we will explain that matter later  tell me where the others went  dont you wish you may find out  it will be better for you to give all the information possible if you want to save your own skin  ive heard roosters like you before so theres no use in crowing to me  can you find a light jet  i want to see what the scoundrel looks like  youll see enough of me before this thing is ended the man said with a growl and harvey looked around suspiciously so confident was the fellows tone  jet soon found a candle on the rude affair which answered as a table but its light revealed nothing of importance  the room had no other furniture than a cot bed on which were a pile of coarse blankets two stools and a sort of shelf that served as a table  by this time the detectives had come in from the yard with the report that nothing could be found to show when the others left  the stable was empty and had evidently been so for several hours  one of you stand guard over this fellow and we will search the house come on jet and show me where you were imprisoned harvey said as he took up the candle and left the room  the boy obeyed and a thorough search was made of the premises  to the surprise of all nothing of importance was found  if the men had had machinery for making counterfeit money everything had been taken away  the building contained nothing more than might have been found in any honest dwelling and harvey said in a tone of disappointment  they must have worked like beavers from the time it was learned the boy had made his escape and that fellow in the other room was pretty near right when he made his threats for we have broken into a building without legal right to do anything of the kind  if they had presses here we should be able to find them in the morning for the whole plant must be buried near by it couldnt have been carried away in this short time the men from albany suggested  this seemed reasonable and harvey decided to make a thorough search before returning  the prisoner was secured to the heavy table in the back room on the lower floor and until daylight the party discussed the matter in all its bearings  then harvey said as he went toward the door  now lets get to work and finish this job by nightfall if possible  at that instant he stepped outside and at the same moment the reports of two weapons were heard from the direction of the woods the bullets striking within an inch of the detectives head  he leaped back under cover saying bitterly as he did so  the villains are sharper than i gave them credit for and have got us like rats in a trap  we were allowed to come in and now they propose to shoot us down at their leisure for the gang cant afford to let us leave here alive     chapter xi  close quarters  if either of the party had looked at the prisoner when the shots were heard it would have been possible to understand that he was expecting something of the kind  his face lighted up with an expression of joy and one could readily fancy he believed the time near at hand when the tables would be turned with a vengeance  harvey was more chagrined than frightened  the fact that he had not suspected something of the kind when it was learned the house had been virtually abandoned cut deep into his professional pride and he blamed himself more severely than any other member of the party could have done  a child would have had more sense than to fancy they had given us the slip and taken all their stuff with them he said angrily  i have simply done what they allowed a fool would do and now we must pay the piper  but theyll make a mighty poor fist of trying to take us out of here one of the detectives said consolingly  that goes without saying but how about our leaving when we get ready they have us where we cant show our noses outside and in this desolate spot we neednt expect any help for it would take a month of steady work for a person to find us and i dont reckon the house is provisioned to stand such a siege  i havent seen anything in the way of food and ive been into every room  most likely youll find that the stock of water is quite as low were penned up here without a chance of helping ourselves unless were willing to stand a regular battle  well i dont see why we shouldnt be able to do that  according to the boys story there are only three without counting this man therefore the forces are equal in numbers  that is true but they have the advantage of position by being hidden in the woods and we cant show our noses out of doors without the certainty of acting as targets while they are under cover  it was not necessary to discuss the matter at any very great length in order to understand that they had voluntarily entered a trap and the entire party gazed at each other in silence while the prisoner appeared to enjoy the situation hugely  i cant see why they want to pen us up here jet said in a low tone to harvey when the two were in one of the rear rooms gazing from the window and the remainder of the party were with the prisoner  it is plain enough was the petulant reply  when they found that you had escaped it was quite natural to suppose you would lead officers here  those fellows wanted to get their precious bodies out of the way but yet were not willing to leave all their belongings behind the work was done systematically  everything was first carried a short distance into the woods and a man left here on guard so we should be certain to come into the trap  well  well while we are here those fellows are carting off their stuff and when that has been safely done we shall be allowed to go free or they may possibly try to rescue the prisoner although that would be needless since we have no evidence against him  wouldnt things be all right if you could know where the things were hidden  of course why do you ask  because it seems to me that i might slip out of here after dark and watch them  there would be too much danger in such a job  they had rather get hold of you than succeed in carrying the stuff away for you are an important witness against them and once in their hands your lease of life would be cut mighty short  ill run the risk of their getting hold of me  but i wont so there is no need of discussing the matter  i am going to post the men at the windows in the hope we shall get a shot at one of the crowd and while that is being done you must make another search of the house to find out what we have got in the way of water and provisions  jet obeyed at once and the detective placed his assistants at different points where a view of the woods could be had impressing upon them the importance of trying to shoot down one or more of the besiegers  a search of the building failed to reveal anything which would aid in holding the fort  not so much as a cracker could be found and the supply of water was hardly more than a quart which had been left in a pail on the kitchen table  harvey had nothing to say when jet made his report  he had joined his assistants in trying to get a shot at the men and seemed to think of nothing else  left to himself jet wandered around the building trying to devise some means of helping his companions and before noon he fancied he had a plan which promised success  at the rear of the house next to the barn was a pile of fuel prepared for the stove and near by were two water barrels  there is enough around to prevent them from seeing me if i crawled out to the barn and im going to do it tonight whether mr harvey is willing or not he said to himself as he ascended the stairs  all the men were on guard but nothing suspicious had been seen  there is no need of their showing themselves and i question if more than one is on guard harvey said in reply to the boys question  i want to do something jet said and then he explained the plan he had formed  there must be an outlet from the barn at the back and even if there isnt i can get through all right in the darkness  we cant stay idle while those fellows are carrying off their goods the detective said after some thought and i believe i will go with you  well leave the others here a while and see what it is possible to do  jet would have preferred to make the attempt alone but he could say nothing against the officers decision and the latter at once began to make his plans  the two men from albany were told what was to be tried and cautioned to keep the house well guarded during the absence of the others  above all things have your eyes open for the prisoner harvey said warningly  it is of the utmost importance that we hold him and you must shoot the fellow rather than let him give you the slip  a series of signals were decided upon so that the defenders might know when their comrades were coming back the weapons were carefully examined to make certain they were in good working order and then there was nothing to be done but await the coming of night  all hands were both hungry and thirsty but since nothing could be done to relieve their wants no one complained  when the night had fully settled down harvey laid his hand on jets shoulder to signify that he was ready for the prisoner was to be kept in ignorance concerning their movements and the two followed by one of the other detectives descended to the kitchen  barricade the door as soon as we go out the leader whispered for it isnt impossible that the men have crept nearer the building since sunset  suppose you should meet them before getting out of the house  then we must fight alone unless you can aid us from the upper window for i would rather get the worst of it than to let that fellow escape follow me jet and dont attempt to go ahead  harvey opened the door softly dropped to his hands and knees and crawled into the yard  jet copied every movement and the two worked their way toward the barn stopping every few feet to listen for some sound from the enemy  all was quiet as the grave and not even so much as the rustling of the leaves broke the stillness  the barn door was not fastened and harvey pulled it open a short distance rising to his feet as he gained the entrance  a moment later the two were in the building groping their way from one point to another in the hope of finding a place of exit  now harvey stopped for a final word  if it should happen that those fellows on the outside get the best of me make every effort to escape  not at the cost of leaving you alone  at any price so that you can telegraph in my name for more men to be sent up  do you want the inspector to know it  no wire the chief of police at albany and wait at the first station you reach for them to come  here is money  he handed jet what seemed like quite a large roll of bills and then advanced in the darkness once more  by good fortune rather than skill he found a moment later that for which he was seeking  a small window used for throwing out offal was before him and through this he crawled turning as he gained the outside to assist jet  they were now in the shadow of the building with a cleared space of about twenty yards to be traversed before they could gain the shelter of the trees  again the detective dropped to his hands and knees jet following his example  silently and cautiously they crept across the opening but just as they were half way it seemed to jet as if a solid sheet of fire lighted up the clearing and the reports which followed were almost deafening  the enemy had expected exactly the move which was being made and were counting on killing their foes  fortunately the bullets had passed over the heads of the two reclining figures and jet was about to leap to his feet when harvey said sternly  stay where you are and give them a dose  at the same instant he began firing his revolver aiming at the place from which the flash of weapons had been seen  jet did as he was bidden until his weapon was emptied and then he saw harvey leap to his feet and run at full speed diagonally across the opening  he did the same loading the weapon as he went and just as both reached the fringe of foliage the detective fell before the fire of those in the woods  are you hurt jet whispered as he knelt by the side of his friend regardless of the danger  they have put a bullet through my leg and i reckon that does me up  let me try to get you back  it cant be done my boy  remember what i told you and start at once  but i dont want to leave you here  you must our only hope is that you can reach a telegraph station run the best you know how while i give them something to occupy their attention  jet hesitated no longer  it seemed cruel to desert a wounded friend but the order had been given and he could not refuse to obey it  harvey discharged his weapon rapidly and the boy ran at full speed in the opposite direction fearing he would never again see in life the man who had promised to befriend him     chapter xii  the encounter  jet was now traveling over a country with which he was not familiar and to continue on would be to take great chances of losing his way at least during the hours of darkness  it was necessary therefore or at least he thought so to get into that section of the woods over which he had previously journeyed  to do this he was forced to make a half circle around the building and as he ran keeping at about the same distance from the house as he and harvey had gained the sounds of the conflict could be distinctly heard  judging from the noise one would say at least half a dozen men were engaged and jet said to himself  the men from albany are taking a hand in the row probably firing from the windows  if they could wipe the whole gang out there wouldnt be any need for me to try to strike a telegraph office  he could not afford to await the result of the contest however for if his friends were worsted just so much valuable time would be lost and he pressed on at full speed until when he was near the spot where he began his first journey there was a rustling of the foliage in front of him as a voice cried  hold up or ill fire  that this threat was made by one of the gang from whom he was trying to escape there could be no question and jet darted aside quickly as he cocked his revolver  this had hardly been done when he saw a long tongue of flame leap out of the bushes at the right not more than ten feet away and a bullet whistled so near his ear that he could hear it shrieking like a minnie ball  if he could wound one of these fellows matters would be just so much better for his friends and jumping behind the trunk of a tree he fired every chamber of his revolver as rapidly as possible  not until the weapon was emptied did he start on his course again shoving cartridges in the chambers as he ran and followed by a volley of shots  it was evident he had not done any damage and once more he wheeled and fired  there was no reply to this last fusillade and he continued the flight straining every muscle to outdistance the enemy in case an attempt should be made to follow him  at the expiration of ten minutes he was forced to halt in order to regain his breath and while standing panting and blowing behind a tree he listened for some token of the enemy  not a sound save those made by himself broke the silence of the forest and there was every reason to believe he had for the second time given the fellows the slip  but what about harvey  in fancy he saw him lying dead or dying within the shelter of the bushes while the gang were making a desperate attack upon the house and this thought nerved him to continue the flight before he had fairly recovered his wind  the journey was a succession of brief halts and mad races for every moment might be precious now and he took no heed of fatigue save when exhausted nature literally forced him so to do  in less than half the time it had cost him to traverse the same distance when no one but himself was in danger he accomplished the task and stood on the platform of the station at which harveys party stopped the night previous  the building was closed  while he was rattling at the door in the vain hope that there might be a watchman inside a resident of the town passed  whats going on he asked in an unsteady voice which told quite plainly why he was away from home at such an hour  i want to send a very important telegram  well sendhicher if you wanter  where is the operator  at home i reckon if he aint thats where he oughter be this time in the morning  do you know when he will be here  bout midnight if he counts on lookin out for the express  can you tell me what time it is now  it was rather a difficult matter for the tipsy party to get at his watch but he was in an obliging mood and after some trouble succeeded in clutching the timepiece  come here an see for yourself he said after trying in vain to make out the position of the hands  i reckon i must have bought four or five watches by the looks of these though im blest if i remember anything about it  youve only got one there jet said as he gazed over the strangers shoulder  it lacks only ten minutes of being twelve oclock i shant have long to wait  id stay with you if i didnt have to call upon a sick friend the man replied after some difficulty and then he staggered on while jet paced to and fro as if only by exercise could he control his impatience  in less than five minutes he was joined by two men or at least they came on the platform but seemingly took care to prevent him from seeing their faces  he could hear them talking in low earnest tones but was so engrossed by his own thoughts that he made no attempt to distinguish the words  finally the station agent who was also the telegraph operator arrived and as he unlocked the door jet asked eagerly and sufficiently loud for the strangers to hear  can i send a message to albany  not now  come tomorrow morning after eight oclock  but this is very important and must go as soon as possible  ill attend to you in the morning  it will be too late then jet cried excitedly  the chief of police must have the news at once  the operator looked at jet scrutinizingly and the two men stepped a few paces nearer  whats the matter the official asked  it is necessary detectives be sent here at once  murder or something of that kind eh  all i know is that i was sent by a man who said the telegram must go at the earliest possible moment  very well come in and write it  ill see if the albany office will answer my call  jet walked into the waitingroom so excited that he failed to notice the strangers who crowded behind him but stood where their faces would be in the shadow  after a moments reflection he wrote the following   to the chief of police   albany ny  send more men at once they have us foul  my messenger will wait at the station until assistance arrives  harvey   it was a simple matter for the strangers to read this by looking over jets shoulder and as soon as they had done so they slipped quietly out of the building where the following conversation might have been heard  thats the boy joe and bob brought up from new york  i thought so and now he is working for harvey  who has gone to the house in the woods to pull the boys and has got the worst of it  i dont reckon we could prevent the operator from sending that message  not without putting ourselves in the hole  we can make sure though that the boy isnt here to show them the place when the officers arrive  which forces us to stay here another day and according to the looks of things i dont think it safe  what made the fools come after agreeing to lay over in the city till we showed up  thats what i cant say  its enough to know weve got to bear a hand for if one of the crowd is caught all hands stand a good chance of being sent up  shall we nab the boy as soon as the train passes  no ive got a better plan than that  well wait till the western express arrives and make him think were the officers who have come in reply to his telegram  then we must keep out of sight  lets take a turn around the town where he wont be likely to see us  the men walked quietly away and in the depot jet was congratulating himself upon having been able to give the alarm so quickly  the operator had been very eager to learn why officers should be summoned from the city but jet professed entire ignorance of the matter repeating again and again that he had only brought the message from a stranger a short distance up the road and the questioner finally ceased trying to extract information  there was no difficulty about getting a telegram through and in a few moments jet rejoiced at hearing the man say  its done and now youll only have to wait until the parties arrive  how long before they can come  theres a morning express which leaves albany in an hour but it doesnt stop here so theyll have to wait for the five oclock train  jet was not troubled as to where he should spend the time  he was so tired that he could sleep anywhere and walked across the track to the waiting shed where he laid down on one of the benches glad of an opportunity to rest his weary limbs  while paying for the telegram he noticed with surprise that harvey had intrusted him with twenty dollars and he said to himself as his eyes were closing in sleep  i wonder why he gave me so much  it cant be possible he thought the message would cost all that  then he was unconscious of everything around him  the midnight express arrived stopped and with a loud snort from the engine went on again but the noise barely sufficed to make jet aware that something unusual had happened  during the next hour he slept peacefully and then the two strangers came up the track talking in low tones  by the glare of the station lamp they saw the sleeping boy  what is the use of waiting for the train when it may be possible the officers will come  the morning express doesnt stop here  what of that  the conductor would let the officers off if the chief should ask him as an especial favor  well how can we hurry matters  he is asleep and all we have to do is to swear the train has just passed  he probably hasnt got a watch and cant tell whether one hour or four has passed since he closed his eyes  but if he should be suspicious he might make trouble  say youre getting to be a regular coward  weve got to take some chances if we want to prevent joe and bob from being pulled and it will be rough if you and i cant handle a boy like that  do as you please of course im bound to stand at your back all the time  the first speaker looked around once to make certain no one was near and then stepping quickly into the shed shook jet roughly     chapter xiii  the snare  whats the matter jet cried as he arose to a sitting posture and rubbed his eyes  are you the fellow who sent a message to the albany chief of police one of the men asked  yes has there been an answer  i should say so  dont we look like a pretty substantial reply to almost any kind of a telegram  but how did you get here  on the morning express  it wasnt much of a job to persuade the conductor to slow up about here when he knew what our business was  the morning express jet repeated  why it hasnt been more than ten minutes since i fell asleep  you are not awake yet  its twenty minutes past three and the man looked at his watch as if to assure himself that he had made no mistake  now what is the matter and where did you leave harvey  jet gazed around him in bewilderment at the thought that he had been sleeping so long but as the man asked these last questions it seemed certain everything was all right and he replied without hesitation  i left mr harvey wounded near a house about five miles from here  then he told the entire story the men glancing triumphantly at each other as he proceeded  can you lead us to the place one of them asked when he concluded  of course thats what i waited for  how many men has harvey with him  didnt you know he brought two from albany  so he did i remember now  and they are shut up in the house  i suppose so  then the sooner we leave the better for it stands us in hand to arrive about daybreak  are you well armed  dont worry about us my son  we know what we are about when we start on a job like this  i only spoke because they have been shooting pretty lively  things will be changed when we get there was the reply in a significant tone  if you are ready well tramp along  jet leaped to his feet feeling woefully stiff and sore but the thought that he was guiding those who would aid harvey served to make him forget in a measure his weariness  he led the way down the track to that portion of the woods with which he was familiar and then struck across the country walking so rapidly that more than once his companions insisted on less speed  we must get there as soon as possible he said slackening his speed unwillingly  a few minutes more or less cant make any difference and we were mighty nigh used up before we started  the next time harvey undertakes a job i hope hell have sense enough to carry it through without calling on all the men in the country  jet was about to make an angry protest against this criticism of his friend but he reflected that it would not be well to get into a controversy and more especially when he could better employ his breath  he continued on as rapidly as his companions would permit stopping to rest only when they insisted upon it and succeeded in making such good headway that the sun had not yet shown himself when they arrived at a point near the house  here we are jet said as he halted and listened for some sound which would give him an inkling of the position of affairs  where is the building  about a hundred yards in that direction and jet pointed toward the east  are you certain harvey and his men are there  i know the men are inside if they obeyed orders but im afraid the villains have got mr harvey  say we must have walked mighty quick if it was past three oclock when you wakened me for it isnt daylight yet  i said you was rushing too fast  now how are we to get inside  go over the woodpile on this side  theyll shoot not knowing who we are  whistle twice while you are in the woods and wait for an answer before coming out of cover  that was the signal agreed upon  then you young cub i reckon we are through with you and as the man spoke he clasped jet tightly around the waist while his companion clapped his hand over the boys mouth  jet was taken so completely by surprise that he did not struggle for an instant and then the humiliating truth began to dawn upon him  where is the rope you brought to tie him with the man who was holding jet asked and after a moments pause the other said with a curse  it has slipped out of my pocket while we were coming through the woods  now what shall we do  you can manage to spoil a good thing quicker than any fellow i ever knew  why didnt you look out for it  because i didnt was the surly reply  if id had my way these fools would have been left to take care of themselves  dont turn rusty now when our work is about done  use a stick of wood for a gag and tie it in with your handkerchief  when this had been done and it required several moments owing to the shortness of the impromptu rope jets hands were secured with another handkerchief and his body lashed to a tree with a pair of suspenders in this position he was unable to make any outcry but he felt positive he could release himself from the bonds after two or three attempts  now listen to me one of the men said in a low tone as he shook his fist unpleasantly near jets nose  i reckon youre made fast here but if by chance you should find anybody fool enough to untie you and undertake to run away it will be a case of shooting you on sight  youve been too fresh altogether and both joe and bob are to blame for not having taken the wind out of your body long ago  jet made no reply for the very good reason that it was impossible for him to speak and the men walked hurriedly away in the direction of the house  that he had suffered himself to be thus fooled caused the boy more distress of mind than did the fact of his being powerless at the very time when he was most needed  the real officers would soon arrive from albany but if no one met them at the depot they could do nothing since they had no idea of the location of the house  his whole nights work had resulted only in bringing aid to the enemy and what made the situation worse was the fact that he had explained how the villains could gain access to the house without a struggle  if mr harvey knew what i had done hed give over trying to help me along in case we ever do get out of this scrape he said to himself i aint fit even to carry a message let alone trying to help a regular detective  then came the thought that mr harvey might no longer be alive and this caused jet such mental distress that several moments passed before he was sufficiently composed to make any attempt at effecting his own rescue  he began by stiffening his muscles and throwing his body forward with the idea of stretching the suspenders to such an extent that he could crawl out of them but was suddenly stopped by hearing sounds as of some one coming through the underbrush  the only thought in his mind was that one of the enemy was coming to kill him and he redoubled his efforts until a familiar voice whispered  jet jet  is it you  he could not reply in words but he managed to give vent to a faint moan at the same time moving his feet over the dead leaves to make a yet louder noise  its me harvey the voice continued  i heard a couple of men talking about having left some one tied up and thought it must be you  while he spoke the detective continued to advance drawing himself along the ground by the hands as if his lower limbs were useless and on reaching jet raised his body with an effort until he could feel the bonds which held the boy  it was but the work of an instant to remove the gag and untie his hands after which he could finish the work without assistance  did you send the message harvey asked eagerly  yes and made a fool of myself afterward jet replied quickly  tell me what you mean and speak quickly for there is no knowing how long we may be able to talk with each other  in the fewest words possible the boy related the events of the night sparing himself not one whit and when he had finished the detective said soothingly  an older hand than you might have been taken in  they probably got a glimpse of your telegram and were thus able to deceive you so dont feel badly  but they will now be able to get into the house  im not so sure of that  those there must fancy that one or both of us were hurt in the scrimmage and would look mighty close before letting two enter without a struggle  are you wounded badly jet asked  my leg is useless and i lost considerable blood before i had time to get a bandage around it  how did you give them the slip  after you left i fired two rounds and then crawled into the bushes they didnt dare to hunt me out while it was dark because i could have killed the first who came near so i had a chance to circle around the clearing  i wanted to be here when you came up with the reinforcements  have the fellows in the woods done much firing  no they have kept mighty quiet and im hoping that some of our bullets hit the mark by chance  we must get out of here as soon as possible  cant you find something that would answer as a crutch thus far ive hunted in vain  ill do better than that mr harvey if youll get on my back  you cant carry me  indeed i can for a while and at a good pace  at that instant a shrill whistle sounded twice and jet said in a mournful tone  now they are trying to get into the house  theres the answer the detective said a moment later  we shall hear some firing soon whether they are successful or not  he had hardly ceased speaking when the sound of firearms rang out on the still air and harvey exclaimed as he pointed toward the sky  well hope they tried their plan too late  day is breaking and in the clearing it should be possible to distinguish the forms of men quite distinctly  if our fellows are fooled i fancy we shall never see them again  are we to leave without making one try to give them warning  it is too late now and was when i first found you  ill see if you can carry me a short distance and then we must find a hidingplace for whether they are successful in this scheme or not the counterfeiters will soon be on the hunt for me     chapter xiv  a capture  for harvey to attempt to walk however good a crutch might be found would have been foolhardy for it was only with the greatest difficulty he could stand upright  jet understood this quite as well as did the detective and he also knew there was no time to be lost if they expected to find a hidingplace before the day had fairly dawned  i am going to take you on my back he said in a decided tone and we mustnt fool around here talking about it  will you climb up without making a row or must i use force  i will obey harvey replied with a smile as jet backed toward him and a few seconds later the boy was making his way through the underbrush  jets burden was heavier than he had anticipated and he staggered from side to side before twenty yards had been traversed causing harvey to say firmly  it is no use for you to try anything of the kind jet  this will only result in both of us being overhauled  heres a place where we can stop for a rest and jet halted in front of a thick clump of fir bushes  by crawling in there we shall soon be out of sight and ill start back for the depot as soon as you think it is safe  he lowered the detective gently to the ground aided him in making his way through the tangled underbrush to the center of the clump and then returned to the outside of the little thicket in order to replace the branches and foliage generally to their ordinary position that those who should come in search might not be able to see the trail  this done he skirted around to the opposite side and entered in a manner which would have done credit to an indian  now youve got a chance to tie up your leg as it ought to be he said  shall i take that handkerchief off  i dont think it will pay to disturb it my boy  the flow of blood has been stopped and might start again if the compress was removed besides there is no water with which to wash it  how long are you counting on staying around here  until you can get to the town and send some one back to help me in i couldnt crawl that far in a month  then the sooner i go the better and jet rose to his feet despite the fatigue which almost overpowered him  wait a while  in the first place you need rest and secondly those men will soon come back to find you after which a hunt is certain to be made for both of us  hold on until we see what they are going to do in order to the better decide upon our own course of action  jet was not sorry to sit down again although in view of the desperate situation he knew he could afford to halt but a short time  do you think you can make another round trip today harvey asked after a short pause  it has got to be done so theres no use in thinking anything about it  what troubles me is how you are going to get along without food or water while i am gone  probably in the same way you will keep on your feet after having walked nearly all nightby sheer force of will  but suppose  jet ceased speaking very suddenly for at that instant the sound as of some one coming through the underbrush was heard  harvey drew his revolver and jet followed his example  both weapons were fully loaded and those in hiding knew it must be a fight to the death if they were discovered  by parting the bushes in front of him slightly jet could see through to where the foliage was less dense and as he did so joe the tall man who had been the cause of all his trouble came in view walking slowly and peering from side to side  that he was searching for harvey there could be no doubt and seeing him alone a bold plan came into jets mind  without making any sign to his companion he began to move noiselessly toward the newcomer on his hands and knees arriving at the edge of the bushes just as joe had passed  harvey laid his hand on jets leg as a signal for him to come back but the boy paid no attention to the mute command  joe had halted about three feet from the edge of the bushes and was evidently trying to decide in which direction he should go when jet rose up behind him so noiselessly that not even the rustling of a leaf could have been heard  by reaching up he could just touch the back of the mans head and suddenly pressing the muzzle of the revolver against the fellows neck he said quickly  throw up your hands or ill fire  under such circumstances there was but one thing for joe to do  he raised both hands not daring to so much as turn his head and jet continued sternly  stay where you are or a bullet goes into your head  i aint sure anyway but what it would be better to shoot first and talk afterward  harvey understood from the words exactly what had been done and jet heard him crawling out from the bushes in order to assist at the capture  take your time sir the boy said calmly  ive got this fellow where he wont care to run the chances of wiggling very much  ill kill you some day the man growled hoarsely  you wont try it for quite a while yet  look out  hold your hands higher  this last remark was called forth as joe lowered his arms ever so slightly probably for the purpose of learning if his captor was on the alert  by this time harvey had managed to crawl from his place of concealment and at the expense of severe pain raised himself to his feet directly in front of the prisoner  keep your revolver where it is and fire at the least show of resistance he said to jet as he proceeded to search joes pockets  now lower your hands but dont take a step forward he said when the mans weapons and money had been thrown on the ground  joe obeyed sullenly and jet heard the dick of a pair of handcuffs as they were fastened on the formers wrists with his arms behind his back  now sit down the detective said as he gathered up two revolvers an ugly looking dirkknife and a wellfilled pocketbook  joe obeyed in silence but if a glance could have killed his captors would soon have been lying lifeless before him  hadnt we better take him into the thicket jet asked  no  stand in front of him while i write a note  now you must start for the town without delay  and take this fellow along  certainly we cant afford to run the chances of a rescue  it was such a job as jet did not fancy but he made no protest  when harvey had ceased writing on a leaf of his notebook he handed it to jet as he said  march your prisoner into the first town you come to and demand to be shown to a magistrate  give him the letter which will explain the outlines of who this fellow is and tell him all of the story save such as is connected with the murder  that we will keep secret for a while then telegraph to the inspector to send an officer without delay to carry him to the city  is that all sir  except as to the manner of traveling  keep your prisoner in advance and do not hesitate to shoot if he fails to obey every reasonable order  above all do not allow him to face you  suppose some of the gang should overtake us  put this fellow in front and let them shoot through him if they choose  aim to kill or seriously disable if you are attacked and in order that there be no lack of ammunition take one of his revolvers in addition to your own  by dividing his cartridges we shall each have enough to stand quite a siege  what about sending help to you  i hope the officers from albany will wait around the depot until you arrive when they can decide what is best to be done but dont make another mistake as to the identity of those you want to see  i reckon i shant fall into the same kind of a trap for a long while to come  get something to eat while you are in town and take a short rest matters wont be very serious here until nightfall  i shant stop long for it would be a pretty poor sort of a fellow who couldnt walk twenty miles under these circumstances  do as you choose you have money enough for all expenses and it may be as well to hire a saddle horse to carry me back  ill attend to everything jet replied and the sooner i leave the better  you are right  remember what i said about shooting the prisoner if he shows a disposition to turn rusty and keep him in front of you  i wont forget sir  then good luck to you  harvey held out his hand jet grasped it for an instant and said to his prisoner  get up now and go ahead at your best pace  you have heard the advice given me and i shall act upon it without hesitation  joe looked sullenly around and then obeyed asking as he set out  which way shall i walk  straight ahead  i reckon you know the road better than i do  thats a fact  there is a short cut after we get down here a bit which will save nearly two miles of distance  dont let him guide you harvey shouted he having heard the remark keep on the course you are familiar with  never fear ill let him show me anything jet replied cheerily and he ordered the man to step out more briskly  during the next ten minutes the two walked at a rapid pace in silence and then joe said without turning his head  i suppose you count on making a big pile by taking me to prison  thats where you are mistaken  im only trying to square things after the scrape you got me into  would you like to make five thousand dollars  of course i would  then unfasten these handcuffs and ill guarantee to give you that amount within the next three days  more likely youd give me a clip over the head  but even if i was certain of having the money you couldnt get away so walk on briskly and dont let me hear you speak again  joe glanced savagely around at the boy and there was that in his face which told what desperate chances he would take in order to effect his escape  hes studying mischief jet said to himself and ive got to look sharp or find myself in the soup as i was this morning  at the best it was a difficult task to walk at any degree of speed through the woods but the labor was more than doubled by having a prisoner over whom it was necessary to keep the strictest watch     chapter xv  assistance  during the first hour jet thought it would be impossible for him to hold out to reach the town but the knowledge of what the result would be not only to himself but to those whom he had left behind enabled him to battle against the fatigue which threatened to overpower him  not a word had been spoken since joe made the proposition to purchase his liberty until fully an hour passed and then he said in a meek tone  dont you think it is about time to take a rest  im pretty nigh played out  jet was only too willing to do so and said  sit down at the foot of that tree ill stay in the rear as mr harvey advised  what damage do you think i could do with my arms handcuffed behind me  that is exactly what i dont know and shall take good care you havent a chance to show me  i dont deny that i would run a good many risks rather than be taken to jail but at the same time im not such a fool as to kick when there isnt the least show of getting the upper hands  you are wasting your breath talking to me in that manner for i intend to follow mr harveys advice to the letter  joes face was contorted with a grimace of rage as jet thus showed that it would be impossible to wheedle him into carelessness and suddenly changing his tone he said angrily  you dont have any idea of the trap youre running into  theres more belonging to our gang than that fool detective fancies and the minute we show up in town youll be marked  that wont hurt i reckon  it will be enough to cause your death  then im to be murdered eh  that is exactly what will happen when any of our crowd get the chance and you may make sure they wont lay down till youre out of the way  well  thats all unless youre willing to make a trade with me  therell be more in it than by sticking to harvey wholl throw you over as soon as this job is finished  get up and make another start jet said abruptly  if you have rested enough to talk i reckon you can push ahead  youll regret not having listened to me while there is a chance  get up  the man obeyed with a very bad grace and once more the two were traveling at a fair rate of speed toward the village  twice again during the journey did joe attempt to bribe or frighten his captor and desisted from his efforts only when they were within sight of the town  this walking through a settlement behind a man at whose head a cocked revolver is held naturally created considerable excitement and jet found himself surrounded by a curious throng before he had reached the main street  the thought occurred to him that among these people might be friends of his prisoner and his anxiety became even greater than while they were in the woods  he was overwhelmed with questions but refused to make any explanations asking simply that some one would show him the nearest magistrates office and his silence served to anger the crowd  are we going to let a boy walk through this town with his revolver at a mans head one of the party shouted angrily and joes face lighted up wonderfully  im an innocent man whom a party of villains are trying to down he cried  if there are any here who like fair play take me along decently rather than in this style  i can explain who and what i am  shove that boy out of the way another member of the crowd shouted and jet believed his prisoner was about to be rescued  drawing his second revolver he held it in his left hand as he said firmly  this fellow has nearly killed a detective who was sent to arrest him and i have the proof of that in my pocket which i will show to the magistrate  my orders were to deliver him up to justice and make sure he didnt give me the slip  if any one interferes i shall fire first at the prisoner and then at him who dares try to help him  just for an instant the crowd fell back and then the man who had first spoken cried angrily  hasnt somebody got the nerve to knock that cub down  ill see to it that the prisoner is taken before the magistrate in a proper manner  thats a fair offer joe said eagerly  im willing to go along peaceably but i dont want to walk with a revolver at my head as if i was too dangerous to be in a town with my hands behind my back  knock the boy down  shoot him  dont let such an outrage be committed in our town  will you let a cub like that play the part of desperado in a quiet village  these and similar shouts were heard as the throng drew nearer jet who now understood that joes friends must be making the row for the purpose of releasing the prisoner and he looked around in vain for a friendly face  will no one help me do my duty he cried  well take the man to the magistrate decently some one replied  that simply means that a few of you are determined on a rescue  he would have said more but joes pals fearing the influence his words might have upon the crowd drowned his voice by angry shouts  jet realized that the crisis was at hand  he and his prisoner had just turned down the main street and the plot must be carried out at once  half a dozen men had crowded so near that they could easily have thrown him to the ground before he would have an opportunity to use his weapons  it was high time to carry his threat into execution but he knew that the instant he fired for the purpose of keeping the nearest back his prisoner would be torn from him  i have failed at the moment when i thought the work was done he said to himself despairingly and at that instant two men ranged themselves either side of him  have you been sent here by harvey one of them asked and jet could have shouted for very joy for he understood these must be the officers who had come from albany  yes and this is one of the men he was so anxious to arrest  where is he now  hiding in the woods wounded so badly that he cant walk  and the others  penned up in the building with a prisoner  during this short conversation the crowd had grown more unruly and were now clustered around joe so closely as to impede his progress  the officer who had been speaking to jet motioned to his companion and the two sprang in front of the prisoner as the former shouted  make way or i shall do more than the boy promised and he drew a revolver  who are you  officers from albany who have come to assist in the arrest of this man  the first who interferes shall be taken in custody and i warn you that it is a serious matter to try to rescue a prisoner  this short speech had a decidedly good effect upon the majority of the crowd who fell back at once but joes friends had not yet despaired of success  they faced the officers boldly trying to force their way between the prisoner and jet and in a twinkling two of them were seized by the strangers who clasped bracelets on their wrists without delay  if there are any more who want to try the same weve got plenty of time to attend to them for all we ask is a chance to pick out this fellows pals  the street was now cleared each member of the throng endeavoring to be the first to escape suspicion and the officers called to jet  start your man along lively  well lead you to a magistrate and then come back for a few of those who were shouting the loudest  ten minutes later jets work was accomplished  the prisoners were confined in the village lockup and a message sent to the inspector detailing what had been done  before jet had finished the meal he was so much in need of an answer came  it read as follows   have sent for the tall man by train which is just leaving  report the result of harveys injuries as soon as possible   that will be when we come back from the woods one of the officers said as he read the telegram which jet handed him  you had better lie down an hour or so and then well start  id rather go now  if we can hire a horse with which to bring mr harvey here ill be able to ride part of the way  one of the officers went out to attend to this portion of the work and when he returned it was with the information that he had secured just the kind of an animal they required  hes too old to be afraid of anything and theres no danger of his running away after harvey mounts  both the men insisted that jet should ride the entire distance and when he objected they reminded him that by so doing it would be possible to arrive at the desired place just so much sooner  the strain of caring for his prisoner had fatigued him quite as much as the tramp and it is doubtful if he could have covered the distance again in less than three or four hours  the officers walked on either side of the horse and during the journey he had ample opportunity to explain why he had not met them at the arrival of the train  we knew from the station agent that a boy had sent the telegram and intended to wait for us therefore it was only natural to suppose some of the crowd had got the best of you  when we heard the row both of us hurried from the depot thinking you were in some way the cause of it  i was afraid you might leave when i failed to show up  not much  on such a job as this wed have stayed here more than one day before jumping back  during the last portion of the journey jet dozed as he rode along forcing himself to open his eyes now and then to make certain he was on the right course and it was while he was thus in a semiconscious condition that a shout from a clump of bushes told the tramp was nearly at an end  that is mr harvey jet cried gleefully all desire for slumber gone from his eyelids now     chapter xvi  on the trail  the detective had crawled out of the bushes by the time the newcomers were opposite his place of concealment and before speaking to the two men he clasped jet warmly by the hand as he said  i knew you could do the job if it was in the power of any one my boy  after making the capture singlehanded it would have been strange if you had failed at the last minute  he didnt tell us that it was him who took the fellow prisoner one of the men said in surprise  but he did it nevertheless and i would trust him as far as any person i ever saw  then the men held a short consultation as to what should be done and harvey insisted on making a detour in order to approach the house on the side opposite where he believed the enemy were stationed  if you help me on the horse i can ride he said and it will be possible to hold communication with the besieged if nothing more  but you should go where your wound can be dressed properly  there is time enough for that  i want to get hold of bob and then ill give you fellows a chance to clear up the counterfeiting case  since harvey was really the leader of the expedition the others could do no more than advise against his engaging in work and he led the way seated on the saddle with his wounded leg fastened to the pommel in such a manner that it would not be injured by the trees while they were passing through the woods  in due time the party came to a point from which the building could be seen  a deep silence reigned  one would have said the house had long been deserted  ill go where they can see me and if no one shoots climb over the woodpile jet suggested  to this plan harvey would not listen  he first sent the newcomers to beat the thicket on this side for the purpose of learning if any of the enemy were in the vicinity and when they returned with the information that no one had been seen he advanced to the very edge of the bushes where the signal was given  they wont be likely to answer it after having been fooled this morning jet suggested and without waiting for orders he stepped beyond the shelter of the trees  instantly he did so one of the besieged appeared at the window and hailed  are you alone  there are three besides me jet replied and the words were hardly out of his mouth before the remainder of the party came into view  are you all right harvey shouted  except for being mighty hungry and thirsty  have you seen anything of the enemy  not since early this morning  its my opinion that they have skipped after trying to get in here  we can soon find out harvey said  well go boldly up to the gate and before it is torn down we shall know how many are in the vicinity  during the time jet and the two men were forcing an entrance nothing more was heard from the adjoining woods and when the party entered the yard it was with the belief that the gang had been frightened away by the escape of the detective and jet and the disappearance of their leader  it wont do to take chances harvey said as his friends opened the door of the house  go out with these gentlemen who have just arrived and make careful search  the boy and i will care for things here  this order was obeyed after the detective had been assisted into the building and the horse fastened in the stable  the prisoner was occupying the same position as when jet saw him last and appeared to be thoroughly tired of the whole business  if you had brought up some food we might have stayed here until morning but as it is i reckon we must make a move pretty soon  how strange that i never thought of such a thing jet replied and straightway he began to blame himself until his companion said soothingly  after what you have gone through with it is not strange such a thing should have escaped your mind  we shant suffer very much if we dont get anything for a few hours more  a short time later the searchers returned laden down with provisions and reported that they failed to find any signs of the enemy  they had come upon a place where the ground appeared to have been lately disturbed and on digging there discovered a large store of bacon hardtack flour and potatoes  before waiting to discuss the situation the hungry men at once proceeded to cook a hearty meal two of them going in search of water and while this work was being done harvey had a long serious conversation with jet  there is no question but that they have grown frightened and run away he said by way of beginning and to this remark jet assented nodding his head  our trip will have been a failure despite the fact of having captured joe unless we also get bob  itll be mighty hard work to find him now  that may be but yet i am depending upon you to do the work  me jet repeated in surprise  certainly what is to prevent  i dont even know where to look for him  neither do i but we shall hit upon the trail after a while for i believe in the maxim that all things come to him who waits  but surely some of these men could do better than i  are you afraid to try it harvey asked as he looked jet full in the face  not a bit of it  i only thought that thered be more chance of success if somebody else took the job  you see ive made a big fool of myself half a dozen times since this thing was started  and by so doing have gained just so much experience  i want the whole work done by you and i except when we have to call for assistance as in the present case  its professional pride my boy and i look to you to take my place until i can crawl around once more  ill be only too willing to do anything you say mr harvey  then it is all right jet and before three months go by well have our friend bob behind the bars  now lie down and take a nap so as to be in condition for our final trip to the town  then you have given up all hopes of finding the men here  yes although it may be possible they will be foolish enough to come back  well leave two men here on watch for a few days  jet threw himself on the floor and in a very few seconds was sleeping soundly  when he was awakened the hunger of those who had been so long without food was appeased and all preparations made for the return trip  as a matter of course harvey rode on the horse jet walked by his side and the officers traveled in advance  the last arrivals were perfectly willing to remain on guard in the house a few days now that there were plenty of provisions and they were busily engaged repairing the gate when the little party started  nothing of especial interest occurred during the journey and when they arrived in town an officer was met who had come from new york to take charge of the prisoner  the two men who had attempted to rescue joe were held on the charge of resisting an officer and it was believed they could be detained until it might be possible to connect them with the manufacture or passing of counterfeit money  to this last however harvey paid but little attention allowing the officers from albany full charge of the case  he was on the trail of a murderer and all else seemed of but trifling importance  a surgeon in the village dressed harveys wound and when that had been done there was yet two hours remaining before a train bound for albany would arrive  now you and i will have a final talk jet the detective said when the two were left alone in one of the rooms at the hotel  why  aint you counting on taking me with you  certainly not  i thought it was agreed you were to search for bob  so i am but i didnt know i was to be left here  that is not exactly what will be done although it amounts to much the same thing  i propose to have you get on the train with us as if you were going off and then stopping at the next station travel back thirty or forty miles to whichever town we may decide upon as the most promising  what am i to do there sir  look for bob  move about from town to town just as seems best at the moment and i have no doubt but that you will soon strike his trail  am i to let you know when i find it  certainly  can you write  yes sir  then let me hear from you every day  here is an address where the letters will reach me at the earliest possible moment  but mr harvey cant you tell me how to begin the work  no circumstances must decide  i have no question but that you will succeed finally and in two weeks if the job isnt finished before i hope to be with you again  the detective wrote on a slip of paper the address to which letters should be sent gave jet more money and concluded the interview by saying  it isnt well to let even the officers from albany know what you propose to do  i will cook up some story to satisfy their curiosity now go and buy me a through ticket and one for yourself to the next station  jet did as he was directed and as he entered the depot saw joe who guarded by the officer sent from new york was waiting the coming of the train  the alleged murderer bestowed a wicked look on the boy who had captured him and then turned his head away  if he ever gets the chance i shall have a hot time of it jet thought as he transacted his business with the ticketseller and then returned to harvey  the latter was just being brought down stairs for the time of departure was near at hand and jet followed him to the station where the detective was warmly greeted by joes guard  here jet felt proud by being introduced as the one who had made the arrest and afterward brought his prisoner safely through the woods where the remainder of the gang were lurking and district messenger no 48 felt amply rewarded by the words of praise for all he had suffered  the cars arrived  jet followed his companions on board and twenty minutes later alighted at a small village where it would be necessary he should wait half an hour before a western bound train came along  its a tough job ive undertaken he said to himself when the long line of coaches had pulled out leaving him alone and somehow or other i feel pretty certain im going to come to grief before this thing is ended     chapter xvii  an old friend  to jet the idea of loitering around first one town and then another with no definite plan unless the simple hope of meeting the man by accident could be called one was in the highest degree unsatisfactory  he had embarked on the enterprise however and it was now too late for regrets  in due time the train arrived and stepping on board he was surprised at hearing a familiar voice ask  hello jet  have you concluded to join us again  it was his old friend the manager of the minstrel company who appeared to take it for granted jet had boarded this particular train for no other purpose than that of going into the show business again  where are you playing the boy asked without answering the question  nowhere tonight or i shouldnt be here  weve been having mighty hard luck and had to lay off to reorganize  at least thats the best way of putting it  the company is about twenty miles down the road and we shall play that town tomorrow  while the manager was speaking jet thought to himself that he could attend to his particular business as well if not better by traveling with the show a few days than in any other way and he asked  do you want a good dancer  if you mean yourself ill say yes mighty quick  will you come  there is no reason why i shouldnt for a while providing you wont make any objection if i should leave very suddenly  say my boy what are you up to in this section of the country eh  nothing in particular or perhaps it would be best to say nothing that i can explain  then i wont ask any questions  how much do you want a night to do two turns and help us out in any other way that may come up  if youll pay my traveling expenses and hotel bills ill go on for one night and perhaps a week but when it comes to leaving this section of the country i shall have to stay behind  ill accept the offer and reckon we can keep you with us a good while if you are so stuck on this part of the state for we intend to remain within a circle of fifty miles for a couple of weeks  business has been so bad that we cant afford to make many long jumps and there are plenty of little towns where i hope to pull out money enough to set us on our feet  this plan exactly suited jet and he believed he had been very fortunate in thus meeting the manager  when the conductor came for the tickets jets friend paid his fare to the town where the company had been waiting for funds ever since the day the young dancer felt forced to leave them  it was a very cordial greeting which he received from the members of the show party that night and many times was he forced to give an evasive answer in reply to their searching questions lest his secret should be discovered  during the evening he wrote to harvey telling him how he proposed to travel and concluded by saying   you see by this means i can stay around here a long while without spending any of your money and it seems as if there is less chance of being suspected by friends of bobs whom i might meet without knowing them   during the following day he helped distribute programmes put the hall to rights and otherwise made himself so useful that all looked upon him as a decided acquisition to the company  on this night he did his regular turn and instead of trying to prevent himself from looking at the audience stared at each person every time he came on the stage hoping he might get a glimpse of bob  it was doubtful he admitted to himself whether he would recognize the two who had played the part of albany officers for he saw them only at night and in the feeble rays of light cast by the station lamps  as to bob he was confident of knowing him under almost any disguise that might be assumed  however this nights appearance before the public brought him no other result than that of establishing himself yet more firmly in the minds of his companions as a good dancer and he had no reason to be discouraged since that which must necessarily be a long task had but just begun  according to promise he wrote a short letter to harvey and on the following morning received a reply to his first  among other things the detective wrote   i am glad you had an opportunity to join the company for it is the best way you could prosecute the search  it would do no harm to go even farther from the house in the woods than you propose doing since bob will most likely give that place a wide berth for some time to come  do not get discouraged and use as much money as may be necessary for your comfort  my wound is improving rapidly under proper treatment and i am told that in two weeks i shall be able to walk with the aid of a cane   it is true this was not a very important communication but it was highly satisfactory to jet since it showed that the detective approved of his course  the second performance after the reorganization of the company was given in a small town of about twelve hundred population and the receipts at the door were not enough to pay the hotel bill and traveling expenses to the next town therefore on that same evening the manager called the performers to his room for consultation  we shall take big money in the next place providing we can get there early enough in the morning to make a parade but i am broke again and want your advice  no one spoke for some time and jet asked  how far is it  only six miles  i will walk or pay my own expenses either one you choose  now thats what i call coming to the front in great shape  whos willing to walk  it was some time before he could persuade the other members of the company to agree  they had received no wages for several weeks and it seemed particularly hard to ask them to work for nothing and in addition tramp from town to town  it was finally decided two of the company should ride in order to transport the baggage and that the remainder would take to the road as soon as sunrise next morning  the manager knowing that jet had some money because of his offer to pay his own railroad fare borrowed five dollars of him with the promise that it should be repaid with the first money taken at the door on the next evening and the amateur detective went to bed feeling that perhaps he could travel around the country more cheaply than by working for a manager who borrowed his funds  all hands were called at an early hour on the following morning and jet set out immediately after breakfast with those who were to travel on shanks mare  it was unfortunate that some of these involuntary pedestrians while not having enough to pay their railroad fare managed to scrape together sufficient to buy a large bottle of whisky and when a trifle more than half the distance had been traversed several were under the influence of the fiery liquor  jet had many invitations to drink but he stoutly refused even to taste of the stuff and walked on ahead with the other temperate members of the company  the dissipated portion of the party danced and sang to the amusement or disgust of the inhabitants whose houses they passed and the town was in sight when a loud shout from the rear caused jet and his companions to look back  half a dozen of the men had scaled a fence and were industriously engaged filling their pockets with fruit paying no attention to the damage done the trees as they broke branches or threw heavy clubs up to bring down the apples or pears  say this wont do jet shouted as he ran toward them  you stand a good chance to be arrested and then how shall we get out of town  walk as we had to this time some one replied with a laugh and the thefts went on with redoubled eagerness  jet tried to persuade the fellows to desist but deaf ears were turned to all his entreaties and he was leaning over the fence when two women and a boy came out to drive the intruders away  the drunken men paid no attention either to threats or entreaties but continued at the work until a sufficient amount of fruit had been obtained when they continued the journey  immediately after arriving in town jet had plenty to do in the way of distributing programmes and finished the task only to take his place in the street parade  the drunkards had sobered off in a measure by this time and managed to march through the village without reeling but the fumes of liquor were quickly driven from their brains on returning to the hotel when one after another was arrested for trespass and theft preferred by the owner of the orchard who brought the two women and boy into town as witnesses  jet was not made a prisoner when the majority of the party were marched to the squires office nor did he anticipate any trouble for he had done nothing more than try unsuccessfully to prevent the mischief  therefore he followed those under arrest to learn what disposition would be made of the case and as he entered the closelypacked room was surprised at hearing one of the women say in a voice loud enough to be understood by all  theres another of emthat boy  i seen him standin there all the time  but i was only trying to make the others stop jet said quickly as if the remark had been addressed to him  dont you believe him squire he was doin that to poke fun at me an jest egged the others on  to jets surprise the magistrate included him in the list of prisoners and he had the questionable satisfaction of hearing all three of the witnesses swear that he was aiding and abetting the thieves  jet tried hard to defend himself but the squire had evidently made up his mind in advance as to what the sentence should be for without allowing the prisoners to make more than a shadow of defense he said sternly  its time you show people got to learn that you cant travel round the country cuttin up shines an then tryin to excuse yourselves by sayin you was under the influence of licker  this court dont recognize any sich pleadin an sentences every one of the crowd to pay ten dollars an costs  do you mean that each man must pay that fine the manager asked in dismay  thats what i said an if theres any row kicked up ill double it  jet was literally stunned and could make no reply  it is true he had sufficient money with which to settle his fine but he did not feel that he was entitled to do such a thing and besides the injustice of the verdict was so great as to overshadow everything else  extra constables were sent for to convey the prisoners to the village lockup until such time as they should pay the money and when one of these officials entered the room jets anger and surprise was changed to bewilderment  the man who advanced to carry him to jail was none other than a member of that party of alleged tramps who had attempted to rob him on the railroad track and consequently a pal of the murderers  the fellow was unquestionably at the house in the woods when harvey and his men were besieged and had since then returned to this town where of course he lived  the question in jets mind now was as to whether bob and the others had accompanied this one  being arrested may turn out to be a mighty good thing after all he said to himself and i wouldnt be surprised if i held off a long while before paying my fine     chapter xviii  jail life  the manager of the minstrel company was and quite naturally in a high state of excitement when his people were marched off to the lockup  if he was not able to raise sufficient money to pay for the railroad tickets it was useless to think he could satisfy the claim which alleged justice had against the men  to remain there even for twentyfour hours without giving a performance would result in utter bankruptcy and in case he was willing to desert the company he did not have money enough to go out of the town except by leaving the baggage behind and walking  an hour after the now saddened minstrels had been lodged behind the bars the manager called upon them  ive been trying to chin that old fool of a squire into letting you off for this evening sos we can give a show but he wont listen to anything of the kind the visitor announced in a disconsolate tone  if you could rope off the yard and put up some seats we might perform behind the bars  advertise that the gentlemen composing the greatest aggregation of minstrel talent in the known world will attempt the difficult feat of playing themselves out of jail  this suggestion was made by the funny man of the party but the distressed manager failed to see in it anything witty or comical  cant some of you fellows suggest a plan he asked  announce that we are to lay off a short time in order totowell anything you can think of  that is no plan at all it would look rather fishy to reorganize twice in one week  say that we are studying our parts for a realistic drama entitled would you put yourself in their places  now see here boys this isnt a thing to joke about  we must give a show tonight and the question is how can it be done the manager asked in a tone of despair  this was what no one could answer  it surely seemed as if the squire had been prompted by an unkind fate to lay the heavy hand of the law upon this particular branch of the minstrel business in order to deter others from traveling in the same path and to prevent this company from inflicting stale jokes upon the public  finding that the chief performers could not suggest a way out of the difficulty the manager took jet as far aside as the size of the cell would permit  how much money have you got he asked in a whisper  none that belongs to me  the five dollars i loaned you was put in my hands for an especial purpose and i really had no right to dispose of it as i did  but if youve got enough to pay these fines ill promise faithfully that you shall have every cent we take in until the full amount is paid back  there isnt any risk my boy for we shall certainly do a big business here  although jet had had but little experience in this line he knew that the receipts at the door even if the small hall should be filled would not amount to enough to settle the bills and from it must necessarily be taken sufficient to carry the party to the next town  i havent got half as much as you need and if i had it would be wrong to use it  then you intend to pay your own fine and give us the slip eh  i should have a perfect right to do so because i took no part in the stealing of the fruit but i shall stay with the rest  during the next ten minutes the manager pleaded in vain with the boy and then recognizing the uselessness of his arguments left the building in a pet  meanwhile the members of the company did not look upon the imprisonment as such a very great hardship  say who has to pay our board while we are here one of the party asked the jailer  i reckon itll come on the town  then so long as it costs us nothing whats the use of repining and the man started a song in which he was joined by his companions until the dilapidated building fairly shook with the alleged melody  as a matter of course this had the effect of drawing the idle ones to the jail doors and the applause from the outside induced a continuance of the free concert  all those who could show any right to enter the building crowded in and among them was the constable whom jet had recognized  while his companions were amusing the visitors and themselves he edged along as near this particular man as he could without exposing himself too freely and during the pauses between the songs he was fortunate enough to overhear the following conversation between the fellow in whom he was interested and a brother constable  youve been away quite a while eh jabe  only three weeks  where was you  tendin to some private business  i thought when a man was elected constable hed got to stay round in case he might be needed  i didnt ask for the office an dont intend to loaf here when theres a chance of makin a dollar outside  what have you been up to  thats my own business  of course it is jabe but i know youre makin money somehow an it seems as if you might give me a show  well i cant  i had a good thing for a while but its busted now  if jet had had any doubts as to the identity of the man they would have been dispelled by this last remark and he listened eagerly for a continuation of the conversation  got company up to your house aint you the inquisitive party asked  howd you know that  some of the folks said you brought some friends back  it seems as if the people in this town had nothin better to do than watch their neighbors  then it is true  ive got an old friend visitin me for a spell but hes sick now an we dont want folks round to disturb him  that must be bob jet said to himself  perhaps he was wounded and has come here to stay till he gets better  now how can i send word to mr harvey  this was the one important thing to do in view of what he had learned but it would be necessary that none of the townspeople should see the letter and the manager of the company was so angry with him that it was a question if he would attend to the matter  he seated himself in one corner of the room where his face could not be seen plainly and waited for this particular constable to leave the building  in about an hour the prisoners tired of giving a free concert and finding they were not likely to be amused any longer the visitors took their departure  from one of his companions jet begged a few leaves out of a notebook from another he borrowed a pencil and thus equipped he sat down to detail what he thought was important news  sending for money to pay your fine jet one of the party asked jokingly and this caused the others to think of what they might do  i reckon a good many of us had better try the same game a second man said seriously  the manager cant get us out of the hole and we may as well begin to hustle for ourselves  it wont cost much to do it jet replied thinking that if a number of letters were sent from the jail his would attract less attention  nearly all the party concluded to make the attempt and a call was made upon the turnkey for envelopes  jet offered ten cents to pay for the same and in a short time the notebook was stripped of its leaves as each prisoner set about making a written appeal for funds  the question of postage was next raised and to this jet was forced to respond in order that his missive should be sent without delay  by the time the letters had been made ready the member of the company who came over on the cars with the manager paid his companions a visit and quite naturally agreed to post the mail matter  now that he was reasonably certain harvey would soon know the exact condition of affairs jet felt very lighthearted  it seemed almost positive he had stumbled upon bobs hidingplace and if such should prove to be the case the second man implicated in the murder must be captured within a few days  shortly before midday the squire came over to interview his prisoners  it was possible he had been figuring the cost to the town in case this party of twelve should remain contentedly in jail and perhaps he was beginning to believe the sentence too severe when taken in the aggregate  your manager has been tryin to talk me into lettin you fellers out he began assuming a friendly tone and air  i told him that justice couldnt be tampered with an have come round to see what youre goin to do bout payin the fines  squire did you ever try to get blood out of a stone one of the party asked  what has that got to do with it eh  nothing except that it would be as easy to bleed a rock as to get cash from them who are flat broke  but bless my heart you cant stay here forever you know  it depends on you  if the manager has made any kind of a fair offer i advise you to accept it for it will cost something to feed this crowd and i dont suppose you would care to take the responsibility of starving us to death  the squire wiped the perspiration from his face although the room was by no means warm  if you could pay somethin on account an give bonds for the rest  i dont believe you could scare up a dollar among the whole of us and as for bondswho would sign them  but you cant expect me to let you go free after robbing a mans orchard an bein sentenced in a regular court  certainly not and for that reason we have settled down to the belief that we shall be your guests a very long while  if i should let you out long enough to give a show would you come back here the squire asked after a long pause  who would get the money taken at the door  it would go toward payin your fines  thats a matter we shall have to discuss for it isnt a pleasant lookout to give a performance for the benefit of your court when we need money so badly ourselves  ill come back in an hour an get your answer the squire replied with considerable show of dignity as he left the building  jet was distressed at the thought that it might be possible the fines would be paid in a short time for then he could make no excuse for loitering about the town and even if he should do so there was every reason to believe the constable he was eager to have arrested would recognize him     chapter xix  the dinner  dinner consisting of soup with a liberal supply of meat and bread was served to the prisoners at twelve oclock and half an hour later the manager arrived to talk with his company regarding the proposition to reduce the fines so far as was possible by giving a performance  the funny man of the party acted as spokesman for his companions and jet listened with deepest interest to the following conversation  there is no question about persuadin that idiotic squire to give all hands a few hours liberty if you agree to return here as soon as the performance is ended the manager began  and in what way shall we be benefited  at least a portion of the fines will be paid and it may then be possible to get his consent to our moving on to the next town  how will you get there if he insists on taking all the receipts  there must be some kind of a bargain made whereby we can take carfares and expenses out of the show  although the majority of the prisoners were responsible for the deed which committed them to prison not one seemed willing to give an evenings work in order to pay a portion of the amount exacted  the fines were so large in the aggregate considering the value of the property taken that all felt as if it would be the proper thing to let the town support them for a time  to the manager the case presented itself in a different aspect  he had made dates ahead and if the company failed to keep them after having already disappointed the public once his position would be that of a veritable bankrupt with whom the owners of the halls would refuse to transact business  therefore it was that he spent considerable time urging his company to do as he hoped the squire might approve of and finally much to jets mental discomfort he succeeded in extracting a promise from each that he would agree to go on the stage and afterward return to the jail  then he went to try his powers of persuasion on the squire  during the afternoon the other member of the party who was at liberty reported that the matter had been arranged satisfactorily and dodgers were now being distributed around the town calling upon the people to aid in rescuing from imprisonment a number of gentlemen whose exuberance of spirit rather than evil propensities had plunged them into sore distress  more than one of the company predicted that the appeal would be a signal failure and jet earnestly hoped these exuberant gentlemen would prove truthful prophets  evening came and with the shadows of night the constables arrived to conduct the performers to the hall  a supper of bread cold meat and tea had been served and save for the severe headaches with which the intemperate portion of the party were suffering all were in reasonably good spirits  both the squire and the manager were at the door to take the money from the charitably inclined and the owner of the hall also stood near by to make certain of receiving his rent from the first cash paid over  watching through the peephole in the curtain jet saw the constable in whom he was especially interested seated near the stage and for an instant he resolved not to appear lest he should be recognized  a moments reflection however showed him that such a course would unquestionably arouse suspicion and he settled the matter by blackening his face a disguise which under the glare of the footlights would prove most effective  the inhabitants of the town did not respond very generously to the appeal  when the curtain rose on the first act there were hardly more than enough in the hall to pay the actual running expenses of the evening and there was no longer any hope of being able to reduce the amount owed for fines  both the manager and the squire looked despondent the latter particularly so for he had saddled upon the town what might prove to be a white elephant before the matter was ended  despite the discouraging state of affairs the performers did their best and the audience were delighted  jet danced until it was impossible to take another step and then on being called before the curtain was forced to bow his thanks instead of responding to the fourth encore  during all the time he was on the stage he had scrutinized the faces of the spectators but without recognizing any face other than the one before him and it was in a decidedly contented frame of mind that he followed his companions back to jail after the result of the show was made known  by this evenings work after the hall rent printing and services of the musicians had been paid the company were able to reduce the entire amount of fines exactly four dollars and one of the party remarked laughingly  at this rate by hard work providing the people are willing to come to a show every night we may manage to pull through in about three months which wont be a profitable speculation considering the fact that we might have bought all the fruit for a dollar at the outside  on the following afternoon jet received a reply to his letter and in it harvey said   pay your fine and come out of jail at once  you can avoid our constable by remaining with the company the greater portion of the time but it is necessary you should learn who the visitor is  cant you walk around that way now and then  i dont fancy bob will stay in the house all the time  this work can be done better now by you than any one i could send since the presence of a stranger in the little village would attract attention   while reading this jet was busily engaged in trying to make some excuse whereby he could do as harvey ordered without arousing the suspicion of his companions  if he had paid the fine in the first place all would have been simple but reason must be given for leaving after telling the manager that he did not dare to spend the money he had on his person  a happy thought occurred to him  pretending to read after the letter was finished he contrived without being seen to take fifteen dollars from his pocket and holding them up triumphantly he cried  heres enough with which to pay my fine and ill have more in a few days if you fellows dont get out  as a matter of course his companions supposed the money had been taken from the letter  several tried to persuade him that it would be useless to spend that amount when by waiting the squire might be forced to free them but he professed to be sick of life in a jail and summoned the turnkey to take him to the magistrates office  twenty minutes later he was formally released from custody and the squire began to believe that two or three more days of imprisonment would force the others to follow jets example  he went at once to the hotel paid twentyfour hours board in advance and on turning after completing this transaction found himself face to face with the manager  so you concluded that it wouldnt be so very much out of the way to use some of that money eh the latter asked sarcastically  i wrote for funds and got fifteen dollars by the last mail  was that the best you could do  it wasnt to be supposed i could pay the whole amount  no but since you have friends with money enough to let you loaf around this section of the country i didnt know but that we might raise a stake somehow  now jet regretted having followed harveys advice for if the manager should make this same remark in the hearing of the constable many and grave suspicions might be aroused for of course the man would be on the alert for anything which needed an explanation  thats where you are making a big mistake he said with an assumption of carelessness which was far from natural  i only wanted to stay here till i could get a job  that wasnt the way you talked when i met you the other day but it doesnt make much difference now for i am beginning to see my way out of this snarl  how  theres a constable in this town who seems to be pretty well fixed and he gave me to understand that he might take the company out of jail providing id let him act as treasurer until the amount was paid  which one is he jet asked trying hard not to betray the eagerness for knowledge which he felt  the fellow who took you to jail  are you pretty certain hell make the trade  here he comes now to talk the matter over it wont take us long to find out  jet glanced toward the door and saw the man in whom he felt so great an interest  the manager eager to clinch the bargain advanced to meet him and the boy keeping his back toward the newcomer managed to walk out of the opposite door without being observed  now the one question in the mind of the amateur detective was as to why this man should be willing to travel with the show  it did not require many minutes for him to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion  he has got a lot of that counterfeit money with him and by running the company through a number of towns some distance from here can pass it jet said to himself  now what shall i do if he makes the trade  the proper thing seemed to be to send a letter at once and going to his room he wrote a full account of what he had heard concluding by saying   tonight i shall lay around his house trying to get a sight of the man who is visiting there   this done he went into the office once more and there saw the manager who was highly elated  it is all arranged he said  the fines will be fixed in some way tomorrow and we shall start once more  we only lose tonights stand and then go on with a backer who has plenty of money  will you tell the boys of our good luck while i make arrangements for sending the posters ahead  jet promised to carry the tidings and stopped only long enough to add the following postscript to his letter   the trade has been made and the constable will leave here tomorrow with the company  i shall loaf near his house this evening and walk to the next town to send you a telegram if i learn anything   this letter he mailed in time for the night train and then visited the jail delivering news which the prisoners were not particularly glad to hear since it gave them no immediate prospect for money  we have made up our minds to tire the squire out one of them said and i dont take favorably to the idea of working to pay the fines when theres no real need of it     chapter xx  a recognition  jet did not spend much time trying to induce the prisoners to take advantage of the constables offer  it suited his plans best to have them refuse and after giving the information he walked back to the hotel as if the one desire of his life was to get a good supper  when the meal was finished the night had fully come and he would have set out at once to loiter around the constables house but for the fact that as yet he did not know where that gentleman lived  while standing in the office trying to make up his mind whom he could approach in order to get this information the manager joined him as he asked  what did the boys say when you told them what was to be done  i didnt wait to hear very much but it struck me that they were not particularly well pleased  why not  they think it is foolish to work for the money when it may be possible to tire the squire out by holding on a while and letting the town support them  is it possible they can be such fools  come with me and well see if it isnt possible to beat some sense into their stupid heads  jet did not want to waste the time but since he could make no good excuse there was nothing for it but to comply and the two started at once  on arriving at the jail the turnkey informed them that it was against orders to admit any one after dark but he intimated that the matter might be arranged with any one of the constables who had brought the prisoners there  then it wont take us long to fix it the manager said as he beckoned jet to follow him and when they were in the open air again he added barker will see that we get in  who is he  why jabe barker the constable who wants to take the company on the road  jet made no reply but congratulated himself on thus having the house pointed out to him without any questions on his part  a walk of ten minutes brought them to quite a large residence on the outskirts of the village and the manager said  thats where he lives and im told he owns the entire property so you see well have a capitalist to back us  i guess id better not go any farther with you jet said halfapologetically as he halted  why not  you and he may want to talk business and perhaps it wouldnt look well for me to be where i could listen  you are right my boy  go back to the hotel and ill meet you there in a short time  jet turned as if to obey and walked slowly toward the center of the village until he saw that the manager had been admitted to the building when he clambered over a fence ran across a piece of plowed land and stood at the rear of the outbuildings when mr barker and the manager emerged  not until they were lost to view in the gloom did he dare to make a move and then he crept softly around in search of a place of vantage from which the house could be watched  he finally found it immediately behind the woodshed where by climbing on the sloping roof it was possible to look in at the uncurtained windows of the first and second story  during fully an hour he lay at full length upon the hard boards without seeing that for which he sought  now and then a female form would pass one of the lighted windows but nothing more and he was beginning to think he had struck the wrong trail when barker returned  he was whistling merrily while coming up the lane which led to the house and as if this was a signal a man came from the building with a pipe in his mouth  jets heart beat fast and loud  although it was impossible in the gloom to distinguish any object clearly he felt certain that this man was the one whom harvey was so eager to find  the stature form and general appearance was bobs and jet believed his search had come to an end  it was evident that the two had some business to discuss which they did not care to speak of in the house where the other members of the family could hear them for they walked directly toward the shed on which the boy was lying and fortunately for his purpose sat down on a log almost directly beneath him  it is all arranged barker was saying  the fool actors kicked at first about working for nothing as they called it but we soon brought them to terms  when are you going to start  day after tomorrow  why do you wait  i think we had better find out first what the officers did after we left and a few hours cant make much difference for ill get rid of plenty of the queer to keep us going before weve been out a day  im not certain that it is best for you to do this thing jabe  a minstrel show can be tracked a dozen times where one man could give the officers the slip without trouble  im not intending to shove so much that therell be any fuss  just enough to put us in funds so we can skip if things begin to look black we wouldnt be in this shape if my advice had been taken i always insisted that there was no reason why joe should carry all the cash  hes a slick one joe is and could get out of a tight place where you or i would be pulled  well with all his smartness hes cornered this time  that remains to be proven  he may have had to skin out while we were watching the house  if he was arrested we should have heard it before this  that isnt certain none of the gang have showed up yet and hello  who is this  jet looked toward the road and there saw the form of a man coming cautiously up the lane as if trying to avoid observation from those in the house  bob and barker were on their feet in an instant both acting ill at ease until a low peculiar whistle was heard which the latter answered in the same manner and then said to his companion in a tone of relief  now we shall hear the whole story  who is it  sam i reckon yes it is and jabe advanced to seize the newcomer by the hand  well bob asked as if impatient to hear the news  were cornered or at least poor joe is  we did all we could and the result is that ive left the other fellows in jail on the charge of resisting an officer  then sam went on to tell of jets appearing in town with his prisoner and the remainder of the story which is already known  bob was silent for several moments after the newcomer ceased speaking and then said savagely  but for me that cub would have been put out of the way before hed done anything except tell a certain story in new york  now all i ask is a chance to get hold of him again and ill swear to it that he wont do any more mischief  what is the new york racket barker asked curiously  ive noticed that you and joe had a secret which bothered you moren this matter did  if i dont tell you therell be no danger of your splittin on us was the gruff reply  what i want to know is whether theres any show of our being tracked to this place  of course no man can say that to a dead certainty but unless the fellows who are jugged give the snap away were safe here providing jabe can take care of us sam replied  mr barker did not venture any advice possibly because he feared it might not be safe to have too many guests at his house for the villagers to gossip about  what about the house in the woods bob finally asked  two fellows from albany stayed there a couple of days and then got tired of waiting  they took the train home last night  did they find anything  no i went up to the big oak this morning and there were no signs the ground had been disturbed since we left  again bob was silent and when he finally spoke jet was considerably surprised  this part of the country is getting too hot for me and im goin to make a jump  where  almost any place is better than layin around so near  what do you say to a hunting trip in the adirondacks sam  it would suit me  how much cash have you got  enough to see us through  then im ready any time  when can we leave here jabe  i dont reckon you want to go through albany  of course not you fool  then at five tomorrow morning youll get a train from here to schenectady and there are plenty out of there to take you into the mountains  i dont fancy running around those big towns sam said hesitatingly  very well stay behind if you choose im going and bob terminated the interview by walking toward the house  its something besides shoving the queer thats crawling on him now jabe said as the short man passed out of hearing  i reckon so but at the same time im bound to be with him for if there is a man in this country who can steer clear of trouble he is the one and i dont care to be pulled on a charge of counterfeiting  jabe made no reply and a few seconds later the two followed their friend into the house leaving jet to ponder upon the magnitude of the task he felt bound to undertake  not until everything was quiet did the boy venture to come down from his hidingplace and then his plans were formed  between now and tomorrow morning i can walk fifteen miles he said to himself when he had gained the highway once more and then i should be mighty near the junction  there i shall be able to telegraph at any hour and have everything ready to board this five oclock train when it comes along  but if we should reach the adirondacks and those fellows ever got hold of me there it would be all up with jet lewis  it was indeed a desperate undertaking for him to follow these men into the wilderness where he could not call upon his friend for assistance but never for a moment did he think of shirking the responsibility  his first move was to see the manager and represent that he was going down the road a short distance in order to prevent anything being said to the constable before the two men should leave  ill most likely meet you at the next town he said cheerily as he went up stairs apparently to retire and half an hour later he had slipped out of the house without being recognized by any one he knew  at this late hour the village was in a state of repose and he hurried to the railroad saying to himself as he started down the track on the ties  now well see how many miles i can cover between this and sunrise     chapter xxi  the adirondacks  jet gave no heed to his own fatigue during this nights traveling  his one desire was to reach the junction in time to send the telegram to harvey and make such changes in his costume as would serve to disguise him in some slight degree  in order to effect this purpose it would be necessary to travel every moment of the time at full speed  this he did and it was one quarter past four in the morning when he arrived at the junction  he had more than two hours before the train would arrive and his first care was to send the following telegram to the detective   he with a friend has just started for the adirondacks hunting  if possible will let you know where they stop but i may not be able to get out of the woods while they stay   it had taken jet a long while to write the message  he wished to word it so the operator could not understand that he was tracking a man and yet it was necessary the detective should realize it might be many days before he could send any further information  if the men had remained at jabes house one day after he discovered positively that bob was there the whole work would have been finished in a few hours for an officer could have been sent from albany to capture him  under the circumstances therefore nothing could be done save to follow the men until it should be possible to let harvey know where an arrest might be effected  after the message had been delivered to the operator jet walked around the town waiting for the stores to be opened  the earliest bird was a clothing dealer and he caught the worm without difficulty  jet bought a reefers jacket a slouch hat and such articles of underwear as might be needed  he also invested a dollar in a cheap carpetbag  then he waited a few moments longer for the shoemaker of whom he purchased a pair of top boots  tucking his trousers into these he had the satisfaction of knowing that he bore very little resemblance to the district messenger boy who had left new york believing his destination to be yonkers  id like to buy a gun and some cartridges if i could get a good bargain he said to the shoemaker and the latter replied eagerly  ive got jest what you want  an ordinary breechloading doublebarrelled gun was produced from behind the counter and after some bargaining a trade was made on the basis of eight dollars for the weapon and sixty cartridges  by this time jets stock of ready cash was running low but he did not feel particularly worried since there was yet enough remaining to pay his railroad fare to and from the mountains with something over for the purchase of provisions  a hearty breakfast at the depot restaurant a wait of five minutes and the train arrived  jet had good reason to believe his game would go direct to plattsburgh before striking into the wilderness for the shoemaker had told him it was the most direct route to the hunting region and he procured a ticket for that point  on boarding the train he went into the smokingcar and there saw the men he intended to fellow  the seat behind them was vacant and he took it at once pulling his hat down over his eyes in such a manner that one could not see his face without considerable difficulty  the men were half asleep but the conductor awakened them and jet was made glad by a glimpse of their tickets  they were bound for plattsburgh as he had guessed and he resolved that at the next station he would telegraph this information to harvey  i dont suppose he could get a man there before these fellows strike into the woods he said to himself but theres just a chance theyll hang around the town a while and it is best he should have all the information possible  at schenectady it was necessary to change cars and here jet found an opportunity to send harvey word  on boarding the other train the boy again succeeded in getting a seat directly behind his men without apparently having been observed by them  they had not started without an ample supply of liquid refreshments and both indulged liberally but not to such an extent as to loosen their tongues  jet listened eagerly but not a word of particular interest or importance to him could he hear  owing to several delays it was nightfall before the train reached plattsburgh and now came the hardest part of the amateur detectives task  it was necessary to keep the men in sight and yet at the same time avoid being seen by them  he was convinced that it would be necessary for him to stand watch all night but fortune favored him in a signal manner  observing bob going toward the ticketoffice he slipped through the crowd and heard the following conversation  when does the next train leave for saranac lake  seven tomorrow morning  from what depot  this one  what is the fare  three thirtyfive  give me two tickets  i reckon thats enough for me jet said to himself joyfully theres no question about where they are going and i can do as i please until morning  after bob left the window to rejoin sam the boy purchased a ticket for the same point and then went to a small hotel near the depot where he registered as david small  the two men had evidently sought shelter elsewhere for he saw nothing of them during the evening  after a hearty supper which was all the more needed because he had refrained from buying dinner in order to husband his rapidly decreasing store of cash jet wrote a long letter to harvey telling him all he had learned and urging that some officer be sent to saranac lake in order to make the arrest   i shall keep on their track as long as i can he said in conclusion but after they get into the woods its going to be a hard job and the sooner they are pulled the more certain well be of having them   this done he went to bed and slept soundly until awakened at six oclock  half an hour later he was at the depot and took a seat in the smokingcar  neither bob nor sam were there but they arrived five minutes before the train left and seated themselves some distance from jet  from that time until considerably past noon the boy could do no more than watch his men but he was well content knowing they had no suspicion as to being followed  then the end of the first stage of the journey was finished and the real work of trailing the human game began  jet loitered around the station asking questions relative to the best way of getting into the woods but all the while keeping his eye on the men  their movements puzzled him  neither appeared to be in any hurry to leave the town  they also asked a number of questions but jet was not near enough to overhear the conversation and then both went to the hotel  a boy about his own age was standing near the depot platform eying jet curiously and the latter asked more as an excuse for remaining where he was than anything else  do you know where a fellow could find some good hunting  youd have to go down to the lake and strike into the woods most anywhere  where is the lake  down that road a couple of miles  isnt there any other way of getting into the woods  not unless you strike through the fields an then youd be goin right away from the best hunting  theres a fork in the road a little more than a mile down an the people mostly take the righthand turn how far are you countin on traveling  i dont know just want to have a little trip  i dont reckon you want a guide eh  i guess i couldnt stand anything quite so expensive  i heard one of them fellers say he wanted three dollars a day  yes some of em get pretty big prices but id put myself alongside of the best less it comes to deers  and how much do you charge  ill go for nothin if youll pay the bills  bills for what  grub hire of a boat powder an shot an sich things  have you got a gun  of course but shes not so good as yourn  ill take you along  when will you be ready  in five minutes ive only got to run home a second to get some things  dont be away any longer than you can help  the boy started off at full speed and jet congratulated himself on having made the arrangement  that fellow can do a good deal to help me and since he lives around here bob wont recognize me so quick because hell be apt to take me for one of the natives  jets guide returned in a very short time  he brought with him several fishinglines an old muzzleloading gun some cooking utensils and a small bundle of provisions  now youve got to buy a lot of grub an then well have so much to carry that a team will be needed to haul em  i know where we can get a boat  ill stay here while you pick out as much as well need but dont spend moren ten dollars  ten dollars  why half of thatll be enough  go ahead an call me when youve found out how much the bill is  why dont you come too  i didnt know but i might see a friend an i want to kinder watch out for a while  the boy hurried away and returned half an hour later  the stuff comes to six dollars an eighty cents an well have to pay a dollar to get it hauled down  jet was averse to losing sight of the hotel door even for a moment but it was necessary to settle the bill and he hurried off just as the stage drove up  he paid the amount asked for and had turned toward the store door when he saw bob and sam with guns rods and quite an amount of baggage clambering on the roof of the coach  hurry up an get your team he said in a low tone to his new friend id like to know where that stage stops  i can show you any time the boy replied carelessly but he obeyed the injunction and in a few moments after the public conveyance rolled away the amateur detective was following it     chapter xxii  the small guide  the driver of the vehicle which jet had hired did not seem disposed to push his sorrylooking horse to his utmost speed and the boy experienced no slight amount of mental anxiety through fear that the men would escape him  once they entered the woods without his having some idea of their course the chase would be wellnigh hopeless  his small guide commenced the process of becoming acquainted by asking jets name  david small was the prompt reply  whats yours  jim crosby  then jet was obliged to explain considerably more about himself he said he lived in albany sold news papers there and having laid by a little money concluded to see what the adirondack region looked like  if you dont have to go back too soon ill show you the whole place jim replied with an air of profound wisdom such as one might have expected from the oldest inhabitant in the vicinity  then the small guide went on to explain where he proposed to take his friend and patron and before his recital was finished the wagon stopped at the lake side  here everything was in a state of seeming confusion  sportsmen and tourists were setting out for their respective destinations but jet had no thought for any save the two he had followed so far  you hire a boat and ill stay here he said to jim who hurried away leaving him where he could see all who left the shore by the waterway  again fortune favored him  bob and sam had just concluded their arrangements for a craft and were loading it not more than twenty yards away  before jim returned they had started alone  these two who thought more of hiding themselves than of hunting or fishing did not need a guide  jet kept his eyes fixed on them as they rowed leisurely down the lake and when jim returned he said  see here cant we keep about half a mile behind those fellows  what do you want to do that for  they wont know where to find the best sport  ive got a particular reason for wanting to see where they stop an will make it worth your while  oh thats all right i dont want to be paid for anything of the kind  come on an help me put this stuff aboard before they get around the point  jet was so eager to be off that he did most of the work himself and jim promised to take the first trick at the oars  dont pull very fast i only want to keep them in sight jet explained as he shoved the light craft off and leaped into the sternsheets  you steer and tell me when were coming too near for i cant keep lookin around  say what game are you up to  i dont understand you  i reckon you know what i mean  why do you wanter keep on the track of that boat  i just had an idea thats all  they are going without a guide and id like to see how theyll come out  theres plenty of them kind of fellers who think they can save money by workin it alone but they dont travel very far  whats your other reason  unquestionably jim was suspicious and jet began to study the question of how much he could tell him for it would soon be necessary to make some more definite explanation  while he was thus trying to decide the small guide continued to ply him with questions until he came to the conclusion that the best plan would be to give a portion of the story otherwise in case he met the men jim might ask them to solve the riddle  if youll cross your throat never to tell a living person till we get out of the woods again ill let you into the secret and whats more ill agree to give you twenty dollars if this job is finished up right  twenty dollars the boy repeated in surprise  what do you want me to do and he turned to look at the boat  nothing just at present but row slowly without turning around  will you agree not to tell anybody  of course an id do a good deal moren that to earn so much money  then here it is and if you breathe a single word i wouldnt wonder if you got into jail  ive been hired to watch them fellows till officers can get here and arrest them  then youre a reglar detective jim cried breathlessly  hold your tongue or everybody on the lake will hear you  i aint anything of the kind  didnt i say id only been hired to watch them sos to let the officers know where they stop  what have they been doing  i dont reckon its very much but somebody in albany seems to think itll pay to catch them  why didnt the constables come with you  because nobody but me knew theyd started for this place  it the men make a camp we can send back word but if they have the least little idea that were on their trail therell be a mighty good chance of our getting our throats cut  ill be still as a fish but i do wish i knew more about em  if they are arrested you can find out the whole story  this promise seemed to satisfy jim and he rowed on in silence probably fancying he was doing some skillful piece of detective work which might be spoiled by so much as the splashing of the oars  an hour later the men were taking matters so leisurely that it was necessary the boys should make a pretense of landing in order to remain behind otherwise their evident loitering would have caused suspicion  jet explained this to his companion and the latter proposed that they utilize the time by cooking dinner  the boat was run ashore and jim soon proved that he was a valuable assistant in the woods by preparing a hot lunch which to jet was decidedly palatable  by the time the meal was ended the men were a couple of miles in advance and the boys resumed the chase with jim still at the oars  ill bet you they are bound for the falls the guide said shortly after the second start  if thats so well have to make a carry an that cant be done between now and sunset  whats a carry  a place where you have to lug your boat for a while an its no fun ill tell you  if they do it i reckon we can  of course only its a lot of work  we must expect plenty of that before the money is earned  that jim was correct in his surmise was shown later when bob and sam turned their craft into the stream which led to round lake and then landed evidently for the night  how near shall we go to them jim asked  it wont do to stay too far away for we must make it appear as if we intended to run down the same stream  well hold up here  jet steered the craft into an indentation on the shore about a quarter of a mile from where the others had stopped and at a spot from which he could keep them in view  ill rig up a camp and you keep your eyes on them while youre getting some of the grub out the small guide proposed  the boys made preparations for the night and while so occupied could see that the men were doing the same  then fires were lighted in both camps and jet watched the one down stream until his eyes closed in slumber despite all his efforts to keep them open  the gray light of dawn could be but faintly seen in the eastern sky when the amateur detective awakened and his heart was made glad by the sight of a glow from the lower encampment  they havent started yet he said as he awakened the guide and it stands us in hand to be ready to leave the minute they do  better let em get to the carry first  when they keep on down the stream well know where theyre headed for an can get through in time for i dont reckon theres a chance of their stayin on round lake  there may be and we mustnt run any risks  the boys were ready to continue the journey some time before the men gave any sign of leaving camp and they bustled around first in one direction and then another to make it appear as if they were doing work of importance in case the game should be suspicious  not until bob and sam had been half an hour on their way would jim consent to start and that he had been wise in so doing could be seen after the fatiguing labor of the carry had been performed  the fugitives were not more than two hundred yards in advance when the boys came out of the woods with the last load and jim said with a chuckle  i knowed theyd take the wrong turn an wed been a good bit ahead if it hadnt been for layin back  by working slowly the boat was not reloaded until some time after the men were out of sight and then when she had been pulled to the entrance of round lake jet insisted on remaining there a while concealed by the bushes to watch the movements of the other craft  i swow  they are goin to stop here after all jim exclaimed as he saw the men turn toward the shore about a mile from the stream theres one thing about it though theyre bound to leave before many days  why  cause theres no game round here an the fishin aint anything to speak of  i dont reckon they care so long as the provisions hold out  of course they can get fish enough if they only want them to eat but i never heard of anybody campin here  thats probably the very reason why they stop no one would think of looking for them where theres so little sport to be had  now well slip down about halfway between here and there and build our camp  this time jet rowed and his companion steered the little craft to a small point within less than half a mile of where bobs boat could be seen  the guide took upon himself the task of building a shelter and he had a very respectable looking leanto finished before night  the boat was drawn up on the shore the goods stored underneath her and everything was ready for the night  jim caught four fish from the bank and these he fried in a most appetizing manner after which the boys rested from their labors  a campfire had been built and jet was lying inside the shanty where the smoke would not disturb him while jim remained outside to brighten the blaze whenever the fuel should bum too low  both were enjoying the luxury of repose when an exclamation from the guide caused the amateur detective to glance quickly toward the waters edge  that which he saw was sufficient to cause his heart to beat rapidly  bob with his gun thrown carelessly over his shoulder was coming directly toward them     chapter xxiii  the visit  there could be no question but that the man was coming for the sole and only purpose of paying them a visit and jet was quite confident he had grown suspicious he and his companion were being followed  the boys first thought was to edge farther into the shanty in order to prevent his face from being seen so plainly but he did not dare make very much of a move lest the man should be aware of his purpose  he knows what were here for jim whispered in a tone of fear  dont let him see you think it  act as if we wasnt talking of anything but hunting and fishing  remember hell kill us if he knows the truth  this was sufficient to drive away what little selfpossession jim had left and he stood stupidly staring at the visitor until jet said sharply  pick up that hatchet and begin to cut wood we havent enough to last over night  jim would have obeyed almost any order at that moment  he was so dazed with fear as not to know what he was about and mechanically he began to do as he was bidden  bob advanced leisurely looked carelessly around at the boat the stack of provisions and the weapons after which he asked much as if it was really a matter of no concern to him  come up here on a hunting trip eh  more for fishing than anything else jet replied keeping his face in the shadow as much as possible  is this a good place for that kind of sport  we havent had a chance to find out yet but my chum caught four from the shore just after we landed  do you live anywhere around here  im from plattsburgh but jim lives at the village of saranac lake  then he ought to be acquainted with the best fishing grounds  he thinks he is and wanted me to keep on into the upper lake but after that long carry i thought id had enough of such work and so weve hauled up here a while  going to stay long  i dont reckon we can be away moren a week  do many of the visitors stop on this lake bob asked as he turned to jim and jet took advantage of the opportunity to move farther inside the shanty  no sir they mostly keep farther on  this place has been fished over so much that theres no fun for the city chaps what wanter catch big fellows  under jets example jim was rapidly recovering his presence of mind and since the visitor did not immediately set about killing them he dared to look him in the face  this answer seemed to please bob and jet could readily understand why  he gazed around once more and then started back much to the relief of his hosts  jim attempted to say something a moment afterward but jet interrupted him by crying loudly  dont you think wed better try to fix this camp up a little more before night  why shes good enough jim replied in surprise as he came to the front of the hut which gave jet the opportunity to whisper  dont you dare to say a word about him yet a while  theres no knowing how near he may be  it was fully a quarter of an hour before the small guide ventured to speak again and then jet had seen both the men on the shore in front of their hut  you can talk now he said as he rose to his feet but in the future be mighty careful where those fellows are before opening your mouth about them  what were you going to say  i dont know now you frightened it out of my head  i swow but i thought hed come over to raise the very old harry with us  it wasnt pleasant to see him so near but now im glad he made the visit for i dont think he suspects anything and wont have a reason to prowl around  we must spend a good deal of time fishing tomorrow  why dont you send word for them fellers to come up an nab him  perhaps we will tomorrow if they are still here but you must remember that it isnt yet certain theyll stay very long and by the time the officers arrived both might be out of the way  of course youve got the management of this job but if it was in my hands id want to have it over as soon as i could  so do i but at the same time it wont do to make a mistake  how long would it take you to walk back to the village if i rowed you to the falls  pretty nigh one whole day  would you go up there and send a telegram  couldnt you come to  no because they might leave while we were gone  then i spose id have to do it jim replied but it could readily be seen that he did not care for such a job  without saying anything to his companion jet decided that if the men should be in this camp on the morning of the second day he would send jim to the village and take the chances of their concluding to make a change of location  surely bob would not think of starting off that night therefore the amateur detective felt it was safe for him to take all the rest he needed and after a hearty supper he and jim turned in  the sun was an hour high in the heavens when the boys awakened next morning  as a matter of course the first thought of both was regarding the game they were watching and their gaze was at once directed toward the other camp  both men could be seen lounging around the fire and jet said in a tone of relief  its all right so far  if they are there tomorrow you shall go back  jim made no protest unless one might have been read in the expression of his face  this second day in the woods was spent in a lazy fashion by the occupants of both camps  it was nearly noon before jim and his companion were ready to go out fishing and then the sport was so dull that they did not remain very long  half a dozen mediumsized fish was the only result of their labor and these the guide proposed to roast because as he explained it would save the trouble of cleaning them  he set about the task in the most approved backwoods style and succeeded in bringing forth a most acceptable dish  after this meal the boys did nothing save watch their neighbors and when night came jet began to discuss the details of the return trip for he was now confident the men were permanently located  go right to the telegraph office as soon as you get home he said to jim and if the operator asks who sent the message say it was some one you met in the woods who hired you to bring it  sposen he wont take it  theres no danger of that  ill give you the money and hell be bound to do as you say  youll have to stay here all night alone for of course i cant get back the same day  i shant mind it except that i may be lonesome but i mustnt think of such a thing now  jim brought up various reasons why it would be better both should go but jet would not listen to them and when they laid down to sleep it was understood that the guide would start at an early hour  next morning shortly after sunrise bob and sam were seen cooking breakfast and jet wrote the following message to harvey   come at once to saranac lake and hire a boat to round lake  i will watch for you   when this had been done the amateur detective suddenly realized that if both he and jim should set out in the craft and but one returned it might arouse suspicion therefore he said to the guide  it wont pay to run any risks and youll have to walk the whole distance  heres money enough so you can buy anything you think we may need  he handed jim three dollars and that young gentleman was so delighted at having such an amount to spend as he saw fit that all objections to the journey were forgotten  go up along fast as possible you can take your time coming back jet said as his companion shouldering the muzzleloader was ready to set out and dont delay sending that message  ill fix things in great shape was the confident reply and then the small guide disappeared amid the foliage  during the next hour jet bustled around considerably more than was necessary in order to make it appear as if both he and jim were there and as a means of causing the time to pass more quickly attempted to cook an elaborate dinner  this was a failure however owing to his lack of skill and he dined on boiled potatoes which were not particularly palatable owing to the fact that they had been thoroughly scorched  the men appeared to be well contented with their camp  they lounged around near the shore but without showing any desire to fish and otherwise behaved as if determined to remain  when night came jet felt more than lonely  the night noises of the forest almost frightened him and only by piling the fire high with wood could he keep his courage screwed to the sticking point  he had not slept more than half an hour and was promising himself a long nap after the sun rose but when the day dawned he had something more serious to think about  he watched bob and sam as they prepared breakfast and then much to his surprise and sorrow saw them launch the boat packing into her all their belongings  jimminy  theyre going to leave and ive sent that telegram just at the wrong time  now whats to be done  there could be no question but that the men were intending to break camp and uncertain as to what he should do jet watched until all the camp equipage had been stowed on board the craft  then they pushed off rowing leisurely down the lake and again jet asked himself what should be done  to pursue them in the boat no matter how far in the rear he might keep himself would simply be to tell the men he intended to watch them and unfamiliar as he was with the country or woodcraft it seemed both foolish and dangerous to follow on land  not until those he so ardently wished to keep in sight had rowed fully a mile away did he arrive at any decision and then he said to himself  theres no other way out of it  i must go on and take the chances i only hope when jim comes back he wont be such a fool as to pull down the lake in search of me for theyd be certain to see him  filling his pockets with cartridges and wrapping in a paper a small stock of provisions he set off only to come back a moment later and write on a piece torn from a paste board box   i have had to go down the lake  wait here for me   this he fastened to a tree where jim would be most likely to see it immediately on his arrival and then he started for the second time  when jet set out the boat containing the men was a long distance in advance heading directly toward the lower end of the lake where were a number of small islands  at first it had seemed a simple thing to follow a craft by keeping close to the edge of the water but in a short time he learned the difference to his cost     chapter xxiv  a stern chase  for a certain distance jet could walk through the fringe of bushes growing at the waters edge enabled to see the boat and its occupants distinctly and then a bit of marsh or small stream would force him to a detour of a mile or more  at this rate im making about three times the distance they have to he said as he staggered across a shallow watercourse so laden with the provisions and the gun that he could not hold the branches back from his face and thus received many a severe blow  most likely the next time i get to the edge of the lake they will be behind one of those islands and then whats to be done  the catastrophe he feared did not occur quite as soon as he feared although it came finally  twice more he saw the little craft sam rowing and bob steering and then she had disappeared  by this time he was so near the outlet of the lake that it was impossible to say whether the men had crossed over into upper saranac or were making camp near by  during half an hour jet sat concealed by the bushes where he could have a full view of the water and no sign of life met his anxious gaze  the only benefit derived from this halt was that he had lightened the bundle of provisions by making a hearty meal from a portion of its contents and enjoyed the repose  theres no question but that they have either gone into camp on one of the islands or kept on through the stream he said as he rose to his feet but i declare i dont know which way to turn  he finally decided to walk to the outlet scanning the shores of the island as he passed and failing in seeing any signs there continue on until nightfall  he tramped steadily for an hour without finding that for which he sought and by this time was at the carry with the gloom of night settling rapidly around him  added to the desolateness of the situation was the sorrow caused by the belief that he had lost the trail at the very time when allowing harvey to believe the men were where they could be arrested without difficulty  if i hadnt sent that telegram he thought mournfully jim would have been here to help keep them in sight or if we lost them entirely as i have done hed have some sort of an idea where they went to  the thought of the small guide gave him a new idea  ill go back to our camp if it takes all night he said resolutely turning his face in the direction he believed it was located  we can come down in the boat and find out whether they stopped on one of the islands  now he walked rapidly in order to cover as much ground as possible before it grew so dark as to shut out surrounding objects from view  weary as he was and owing to the broken ground his progress was exceedingly slow and night had fully shut her black curtain down before he reached the edge of the lake  then he was forced to proceed at a snails pace lest he inadvertantly walked into one of the small streams but he continued manfully on until it was no longer possible to take another step  now came the alarming knowledge that he was lost  had he been going in the right direction he should have reached the lake before sunset and it could not then be less than nine oclock  he was no longer able to find the stream which had served him as guide and stretched himself on the ground at the foot of a gigantic tree feeling as if it made but little difference whether he ever arose again or not  in utter despair he remained silent and motionless until slumber came to his relief and he remained wrapped in blissful unconsciousness for several hours  when he awoke it was yet dark and he was benumbed with the chill which came from the damp earth  theres no need of freezing to death if i am lost he said to himself  things are so bad now that they cant be much worse and i may as well make the best of a bad bargain  by feeling carefully around he succeeded in getting together a small quantity of decaying wood and this he lighted after some difficulty  its lucky i had to cook dinner today or i shouldnt have had a match he said grimly as he sat about gathering more fuel  in a short time he had a cheerful blaze and the warmth which was so grateful served to revive his courage  slowly the hours passed  now and then he fell into a light slumber but only for a few moments at a time and it seemed as if forty hours must have elapsed before the sun lightened the sky again  toasting some of the crackers on the coals and refreshing himself with water from a tiny stream he made ready to continue his search  now he took his bearings carefully with the sun as a guide and knowing the lake must lie to the west pushed straight across the wilderness  one two three hours and then his heart was made glad by a glimpse of the water  never had anything looked as beautiful as did the lake at that moment  he ran to the bank and looked out through the bushes  he was nearly opposite the islands at the exact spot where the trail was lost on the previous afternoon  to reach the camp it would be necessary to travel the greater portion of the day and the important question was as to whether jim would remain quietly there until he returned  theres no use thinking about it ive got to take the chances he said resolutely to himself and the weary march was resumed  more than once before the journey came to an end was he tempted to give himself up to the rest he so sadly needed but the thought that he might be forced to spend another night in the woods alone without a shelter prevented him from giving way  the last of the provisions were eaten for dinner  a halt of half an hour was indulged in and then he trudged forward once more traveling a trifle more easily since one of his hands was now free  it was late in the afternoon when he finally arrived within sight of the encampment but there were no signs of jim  before reaching the shanty he shouted loudly receiving no reply save the mocking echoes  now he ran the short distance remaining and looked around eagerly  everything was apparently as he had left them  the notice was still fastened to the trunk of the tree  the store of provisions was untouched and he went to the waters edge  the boat had not been launched and this in itself was sufficient to show the small guide had not returned  it was time he arrived even supposing he remained over night at his home as had been intimated and the only reason for delay which he could imagine was that the young gentlemans parents refused to let him continue the hunting trip  if that had been the case it seemed strange he did not come back to let jet know he could no longer act as guide and assistant detective  thoroughly disheartened jet threw himself on the ground near the front of the shanty trying to decide what he could do when the sound as of some person forcing his way through the underbrush caused a look of joy to come over his face  an instant later it was replaced by one of disappointment  instead of seeing jim as he had hoped a very disreputablelooking stranger came from the direction of the upper carry approaching jet with a careless howdy  good afternoon jet responded  out here on a fishin trip eh  yes something of that sort  been round long  a few days  i reckon you dont want to hire a good guide who can beat any one in this section cooking eh  no and i havent got the money if i did want to  id go mighty cheap seeins how business is dull  jet shook his head  well theres no harm done  i dont reckon youd kick agin givin a feller a bite eh  help yourself the provisions are under the boat  the stranger proceeded to overhaul the outfit in the most matteroffact way possible even grumbling because certain articles he evidently expected were not to be found  how would it do if i got up a dinner for both of us he finally asked  all right go ahead  it made very little difference to jet what the fellow did so long as he left him free to think the matter over and he paid no attention to his movements  after an hour had passed the stranger invited jet to fill up from his own stock of provisions and as he accepted the invitation the boy discovered that whatever this man might think of his abilities he was certainly a very poor cook  id adone better if youd had more stuff he said halfapologetically and then he began an attack on the food which speedily emptied the dishes  the visitor made no move toward clearing away the cooking utensils but leaving them where they were last used proceeded to fill his pipe  then he stretched himself out inside the shanty and took as he said solid enjoyment  i allow theres no reason why i cant stay here till morning eh  much as jet disliked the proposed companionship he could not well refuse the request therefore he gave consent with rather an illwill  seen anybody else huntin round here the fellow asked after a pause  there were two men camping down there a bit but they left yesterday  when did they come  three or four days ago  do you know where they went  jet fervently wished he did but he simply answered no  the visitor appeared deeply interested in these men but his host showed such a disinclination to talk that he finally relapsed into silence  jet soon fell asleep and was so tired that he did not awaken again until an hour or more after sunrise  to his delight the stranger was no longer there  he glanced around leisurely and to his surprise found that more than the man had disappeared  the boat his gun the store of provisions and even the pot and fryingpan had taken their departure  the thief he cried leaping to his feet and then a thought which was little less than an inspiration came to him  he is one of bobs gang  that is why he wanted to know so much when i spoke of two men  jabe probably told him where bob and sam were bound for and he came here hunting them     chapter xxv  jim  the idea that he had been tricked by one of the gang he was hoping to run down seemed particularly humiliating and during at least five minutes jet stood silent and motionless gazing across the lake  then anger took the place of bewilderment and he managed to say some very vigorous things which might have excited the ire of the gentleman who claimed to be such a skillful cook had he been there to hear  scolding doesnt as a rule make any material difference in a fellows situation and this jet came to understand when he was forced to cease from sheer lack of breath  what a fool im making of myself he exclaimed  the idea of standing here raving when i ought to be trying to mend matters  it was difficult however when he began to reflect to decide upon his course  should he go toward the town in search of jim and also to hire another boat  that would involve the loss of two days during which time the officer for whom he had telegraphed might arrive and failing to find him go down the lake on a wild goose chase  to attempt to search for the men alone and on foot seemed the height of folly and while he stood near the waters edge deliberating upon the question of whether he could replenish his stock of provisions without paying a visit to the settlement the rustling of the bushes proclaimed an arrival  jet looked around half expecting to see his seedy friend of the previous evening come back to tell him it was all a joke when the small guide jim stepped into view  he was evidently in the best of spirits and gazed at jet as if wondering why he was not welcomed more warmly  ive made two dollars though i aint got em yet since ive been gone he said as he threw on the ground in front of the shanty a wellfilled bag an now theres as much grub in camp as will last us for a month providin we do a little cookin  what made you stay so long  why you see it was to earn the two dollars i was tellin about  i met a feller the other side of the carry what was askin if id seen two men round here fishin an we had a real sociable talk  was that when you were going up to the village jet interrupted  of course  and the fellow had black whiskers on his chin and said he was a guide and cook  thats the very one  have you seen him  i will tell you after your story is finished  well we had a right nice time together  i gave him part of my lunch an then he wanted me to come back with him but i told him id got to get to the telegraph office  did you let him know what you were going there for jet asked excitedly  of course not though he tried mighty hard to find out  he was lookin for a party whats coming through the carry in a day or two an has got a job with em at four dollars a day  he said they was over to pine pond an promised to give me two dollars if id see if i could find em  why didnt he go jet asked in a peculiar tone  cause he didnt know the way  funny kind of a guide not to be better acquainted than a boy who never attempted anything of the kind  well you see the most of his work has been done round raquette lake way  so you went over to the pond for him  yes it wouldnt take me so very much longer an it was earnin two dollars mighty easy  but what about the telegram  oh thats all right  he offered to carry it to the village for me an to pay the charges out of his own pocket though it was to be taken from what he owed me when i got back  and you gave it to him jet asked his face growing very pale  yes it would get there jest the same an id be helpin buy the grub jim replied in a matteroffact tone wholly unconscious of the black looks jet was bestowing upon him  i couldnt find anybody round the pond an i reckon the party must have come that very day for when i got back to the village the man wasnt there but ill have the money when he finishes the job  did you ask the telegraph operator if the message had been sent  no what was the use of that so long as hed promised to fix everything  but say jim cried suddenly as he looked toward the waters edge wheres the boat  your friend the raquette lake guide borrowed her this morning  so hes been here eh  did he say anything about meetin me  not a word jet replied grimly  i guess he was too busy getting ready to leave for he had to pack all our provisions my gun and the other things which were lying around into the boat  what do you mean jim cried as he gazed about him and failed to see any of their outfit  i reckon hes gone to raquette lake with the two fellows who were camping over on the point  have they skipped and now jims eyes were opened very wide  went yesterday morning bag and baggage  whatll we do when the officer comes to arrest em  see here jim are you so stupid as not to know what has happened  why dont you tell me the guide screamed  because you have been giving me the story  the very jolly fellow you met was a friend of the men i came here to watch he talked with you long enough to find out that the telegram you were carrying concerned them in some way and cooked up the yarn about pine pond in order to get hold of it  then he came down to hunt me stole the things to prevent our following him and skipped on to look for his pals  jim gazed at his friend with dilated eyes while this explanation was being made and when jet concluded he said in a halfwhisper  then im to blame for all that has happened  theres no question but you have been the means of informing those fellows what we are here for was the gloomy reply  do you know where they have gone  jet told of his fruitless journey and when he concluded jim said decidedly  they didnt go into the upper lake if they want to keep out of sight ill bet theyve landed on dollar island  which is that  the one nearest the outlet  its a good place to camp and from it they can keep track of everybody coming or going  suppose that fellow who said he was a guide hasnt found em yet  well what then  we might catch him before the others find out about the telegram message  he has a boat and we havent  but hes bound to land somewhere and i know of a trail down this side which would take us to the outlet in short order  it isnt moren two miles  are you willing to go and take the chances  remember if bob and sam have learned what we are here for it will likely be a case of life or death with us  see here dave ive spoiled all your plans without meanin to do wrong an now im ready to take any risks if things can be straightened out  youve got a revolver eh  yes  then lets see what can be done  jim was thoroughly excited now and his determination to rectify the error put new life into jet  he sprang to his feet at once reloaded his weapon lest the cartridges should have been dampened during the night in the woods and while he was thus occupied jim packed the provisions into a more convenient shape for carrying  when all was ready and but a few seconds had been spent in these preparations jim led the way to a well defined trail a hundred yards or so from the shore of the lake saying as he did so  its queer you didnt find this when you were lost  i shouldnt have noticed it if id come across it because the most of the tramping was done after dark and in the morning i thought only of finding the lake  we shall see it two or three times before coming to the outlet  the boys walked at their best pace jet carrying jims gun and the latter with the greater portion of the provisions slung over his shoulder  at the end of a quarter of an hour the trail brought them to the edge of the lake and they looked out over the water eagerly but without seeing any signs of life  again their way wound through the woods and when the journey was a trifle more than twothirds finished they were within sight of the water once more  unless that fellow has made straight for the upper lake he ought to be round here somewhere so wed better not show ourselves jim suggested as he crept cautiously down to the fringe of bushes bordering the banks  the boys were now where they could see between the cluster of islands to the opposite shore and after gazing for some time in silence jet said as he pointed directly across the lake  isnt that a line of smoke over there  it is an ill bet our man has made camp to watch for his chums lets go over  it seemed to be a sort of forlorn hope but the chances were well worth taking in view of the possible result and jet replied  go ahead but we must keep a good watch of the shores in case that should not be the fellow we are searching for  jim hardly needed this caution  since having done so much harm he was careful to a fault and many times before reaching the outlet did he run to the edge of the wood to search with his eyes the borders of the lake  each time he reported that no one was in sight and always concluded the information with the assurance  im certain the two men are on dollar island  the outlet was reached and crossed at the expense of a wetting but the boys thought nothing of that it was too trifling a matter to be considered at such a time  from this on there was no trail to follow and jim led the way as near the waters edge as possible  finally the moment came when they were so near the thin curl of blue smoke that the utmost care was necessary lest a noise should give token of their approach  jim crept through the bushes in the most approved manner of alleged indian hunters and when they had thus traveled a couple of hundred yards he motioned for jet to look as he parted the foliage in front of him  there on the shore was the boat which had been stolen and farther up near a hastily constructed shelter of branches sat the man who had promised to send the telegram for the small guide     chapter xxvi  success  the man was sitting in front of a small fire over which he had evidently been cooking for the fryingpan was close at hand and the odor of bacon could be distinguished in the air  most likely he had just finished his morning meal and was now solacing himself with a pipe  the stolen gun had been leaned against a tree close by the hut and about a half a dozen yards from its new possessor but on the opposite side from where the boys were crouching  what are you goin to do jim whispered  weve got to get hold of him somehow and by that means prevent bob and sam from knowing what we are about  jim nodded to show that he agreed fully in this assertion  i dont spose youd dare to shoot him  of course not that would be murder  then how is it to be fixed  jet studied the situation for several minutes and whispered  we must manage to creep around on the other side and get hold of the gun first  then ill cover him with my revolver and you must do the same with the other weapon  when he sees that both of us have got the drop on him i reckon there wont be much trouble in keeping him quiet  jim did not stop to argue the matter  according to his opinion the sooner the job was finished the better and he started off at right angles with the camp jet following him  the boys moved so slowly and cautiously that not so much as a leaf was disturbed and the man by the fire heard nothing to arouse his suspicions  jim made a needlessly long detour  many times before it was ended jet felt convinced that the guide had made a mistake and once he stopped the boy to say so but the latter replied in the tone of a fellow who knows perfectly well where he is  were all right  the camp is just over there and i want to come in sight of the lake once more before turning toward it  twenty minutes later jim pointed ahead with a gesture of triumph  jet could see dimly through the foliage the outlines of the hut but the trees hid the man from view  now the progress was even more slow and cautious  it seemed at times as if jim hardly moved so afraid was he of making a noise but the advance was certain and finally he stopped motioning for jet to come beside him  the two were hardly more than a dozen feet from the weapon and about the same distance farther away was the man they hoped to make prisoner  his pipe had gone out his head was sunk on his breast and there was every indication of his having fallen asleep  can you get the gun jet whispered  jim nodded his head  then creep up to it  ill have the revolver ready and jump in if he awakens  in case hes still asleep well go toward him until he opens his eyes  start now and jet drew his weapon  the boys advanced side by side until jim grasped the gun and then jet motioned for him to rise to his feet he setting the example  they stepped forward softly each with his weapon leveled at the halfreclining man who did not so much as move until the boys were close upon him  then he lazily opened his eyes and turned his head ever so slightly  throw up your hands but dont make the slightest noise or ill shoot you as i would a dog jet said sternly  the fellow obeyed the first order with alacrity as he saw the muzzles of the weapons within a few inches of his head and said in a careless tone  i reckon you didnt care about lendin me your outfit  thats just the size of it and there is other business to be settled  by this time the prisoner had caught a glimpse of jims face and he added with a smile  come to collect that two dollars eh  we mustnt stand here chinning jet said as he pressed the muzzle of the revolver to the back of the mans head  look around for something to tie him with jim and be quick about it  what are you up to now the fellow growled  it wont take long to find out and i shall be forced to waste this cartridge if you make any row  i thought i was behavin myself in proper shape  so you are just at present but i am ready for any change of plans and want you to understand fully how little it would take to induce me to send a bullet into your worthless head  this was sufficient to silence the prisoner  i cant find anything but the boats painter jim cried  shall we use that  yes and be quick about it  the rope was soon detached from the craft and as jim approached with it jet said to the man  now put your hands behind you  this order was obeyed without a murmur and the small guide began to tie them securely  the painter was of sufficient length to serve as bonds for the fellows legs also and when he was thus trussed up jet began fashioning a gag from a piece of pine wood  having had this instrument of torture applied to himself on two occasions he was well prepared to put it on in a proper fashion although the prisoner begged abjectly to be spared the indignity  we have got to take care of ourselves and i wouldnt trust to your oath if you should swear from now till christmas  when it was impossible for the fellow to move or speak jet made a thorough search of his clothing and succeeded in finding among several unimportant things the telegram jim had supposed was sent many hours ago  it hasnt been a bad forenoons work the amateur detective said as he wiped the perspiration from his face for the mental anxiety of the past few hours had caused the big drops to flow down his cheeks as the heat of the sun never could have done  what are we going to do with him  take him back to the camp of course  it wont pay to let him out of our sight until the officers take charge of affairs  before making preparations for the return jet scanned closely the shores of the islands which were situated nearer the opposite side of the lake hoping to discover some signs of bob and sam but in this he was disappointed  nothing in the shape of a boat could be seen and he said to the small guide  im afraid they have gone into the other lake  it doesnt seem reasonable and i shant believe it until we have searched over all those islands  how can we do that now weve got this fellow to look out for  thats what you must figger out im willin to carry out whatever you say  of course the first thing is to get back to the camp  do you suppose we can load that fellow into the boat so in case the men are where our movements may be seen they wont suspect it is a human being  cover him over with a lot of pine boughs  thats the idea  come on we have no time to lose for we must do something toward finding the others before night  jim hastily gathered an armful of branches and threw them over the prisoner completely concealing his form and then the boys carried him to the boat much as if he had been nothing more than a log of wood  the fellow was laid in the bottom of the craft and around him were packed the goods he had stolen from the camp  it will load the old boat down pretty heavy but theres no wind blowing an we shant have a very hard pull back jim said as he took his place at the oars leaving jet to push off  it was not much past noon when the start was effected and the boys had the supreme satisfaction of knowing that the most important of their human game had not been warned of what was being done  say how would it do to move our camp down opposite dollar island after dark jim asked when they were some distance from the shore we could then take the chances of running over to search the place and wouldnt have so far to go  well try it jet replied as he steered the boat away from the islands  when the two arrived at the camp the prisoner was carried into the shanty and there so covered with boughs and blankets that any one passing would not have had any suspicion a human being was concealed in the vicinity  a hearty dinner was next on the programme and then arrangements were made for moving camp  jim thought they would not be warranted in building a shanty at the proposed haltingplace unless loose brush could be found since the noise of an axe might betray their whereabouts and he also decided against a fire  ill cook up a lot of stuff this afternoon he said and then we must get along with cold grub  cant you catch some fish while im working over there  jet rowed the boat a short distance out into the lake and soon had all he could do to attend to his line so rapidly did the finny denizens of the water attack the bait  he brought ashore as many as would serve them for food during the next three days and the small guide cooked every one  all this work was not completed until after nightfall and jim was eager to be off  it is so dark that they cant see us now he said and after the moon rises things will be different  well feed the prisoner for i reckon he needs something by this time  jet removed the gag while jim stood over the fellow with a cocked revolver and a plentiful supply of fish bacon and water was put in his mouth after which he was bottled up again as the guide expressed it  the craft was loaded as before but this time jet took the oars because jim was so well acquainted with the lake that he was needed at the helm  be careful not to run too near the islands the amateur detective said as he made ready for work and after we start not a word must be spoken for sound travels farther on the water than the land  dont pull too hard and be careful about splashing with the oars  shove off im ready  during the next hour nothing was said  the little boat moved silently through the waters and at the end of this time jet could see the loom of the islands on the right  they were near the proposed campingplace and every precaution should be observed  suddenly jim leaned forward touched his companion on the arm and pointed to the right  a light as from a campfire could be seen among the trees and the small guide whispered triumphantly  i told you they were there  then we must contrive to get hold of one or both in the morning  it wont pay to wait for the officers     chapter xxvii  reconnoitering  the small guide steered the boat into the mouth of a tiny creek as skillfully as if it had been noonday and when her bow grounded motioned for jet to step ashore  then he followed the example and hauled her farther up to prevent any possibility of the crafts drifting away after which he stood motionless as if awaiting orders  how far from here do you count on camping jet asked in a cautious whisper  a short bit straight back is a thick clump of cedars  we could stay there a month without being seen no matter how many people might come on the lake  take hold of the fellows feet and ill carry his head  hed better be taken care of first  jim obeyed and thus loaded down led the way to the place he had described  it was indeed just such a spot as jet would have asked for  the cedars with their branches growing to the very ground covered about fifty square feet of space and through the center of this apparently impenetrable thickness ran the stream at whose mouth the boat had been brought  it would not have been possible to put up a decentlysized shanty because the trees were so near together but there was ample opportunity for a hundred boys to find comfortable places in which to sleep and the foliage would shelter them sufficiently well except in case of a rainstorm  although it hardly seemed necessary jet insisted that the prisoner should be made fast to one of the trees in a sitting posture and not until this had been done was the balance of the work attended to  first the provisions were carried into the natural camp and stored in the center then the other goods were cared for in the same manner and nothing but the boat remained to mark their landing  its goin to be a hard job but shes got to come here too jim said when they stopped for a moment to rest  do you think we can do it  oh yes she isnt so heavy but that we could take her around a carry and i reckon its to be done here  how long before the moon rises  somewhere about midnight  then suppose we try to find out for certain if those camping on dollar island are the ones we want to keep in sight  im willing if you say the word  then come on  that fellow is safe enough and we shall be just so much farther ahead with our work  jim led the way back to the boat removed his shoes and stockings as a precaution against making a noise jet doing the same and the two started with the small guide paddling instead of rowing  the faint glimmer of light served as a beacon and toward it they advanced slowly until the boats bow struck the shore  jim motioned for his companion to help him pull her up and then stole through the woods as noiselessly as a shadow  the gloom was so dense that it was necessary jet should hold on to the leaders coat otherwise they would speedily have been separated and a watcher ten feet away could not have said a human being was passing  thanks to the firelight it was not a difficult matter for the two to go straight to the camp and in a comparatively short time they were where it was possible not only to see the occupants but to hear everything which was said  jets spirits rose very high as he recognized the two he had followed so long and now all previous discomforts and suffering were forgotten in the knowledge that he was once more carrying out harveys instructions to the letter  the men had built quite a comfortable looking hut in the center of the island where it would not be seen from the water and near by was the boat turned bottomup as if they did not expect to use her for some time  the fact that they allowed themselves a campfire at a time when it could be distinguished from a distance was probably owing to the fact that visitors seldom visited this particular lake after dark since the absence of deer in the vicinity prevented hunters from scouring the banks with a jack light  both were ready for trouble however as could be told by the guns stacked within reach while they smoked and drank in front of the cheery blaze and jet was forced to admit to himself that these men could not be made prisoners with as much ease as in case of the other  for some time the boys watched in silence mentally jotting down all the details of the camp for future reference and then sam said with a yawn  this is what i call mighty dull sport  it aint very lively for a fact but i reckon its way ahead of what poor joes having  if its so bad now what will it be in another week  i dont think i can stand it very long  theres nothin to prevent your goin any time you get ready but here i stay for quite a spell  what about more liquor an grub  there wont be any trouble in getting all we want as long as the money holds out  and by fall youll have bark on your back  better that than a striped coat  it isnt so bad as you make out though  we can move our camp whenever we feel like a change an then theres plenty of fishin an sich like that the swells call sport  sams only reply was another prolonged yawn as he stretched himself out at full length and bob replenished the fire without moving from his seat  jet understood that it was time for them to take their departure  when the men got ready to turn in for the night one or the other might take a fancy to have a look around to make sure they had no unwelcome visitors in which case the spies would be discovered  motioning jim to follow his example he started toward the shore moving at a snails pace to prevent a noisy disturbance among the foliage and not until they were in the boat once more paddling toward the opposite bank did he feel at liberty to draw a long breath  arriving at the point from which they started jim insisted on carrying the boat to the clump of cedars and this required so much time and labor that it was nearly midnight before they could seek the wellearned rest  even then jet took pity on the prisoner and removed the gag sufficiently long to give him food and water the small guide standing over him with the cocked revolver lest he should make an outcry  what are you boys countin on doin with me he asked when his hunger and thirst had been appeased  deliver you to the officers in a day or two  am i to be kept trussed up in this fashion until then  its pretty rough i know but theres no other way out of it  youd treat us the same or worse if the tables were turned and were bound to take care of ourselves  i dont reckon it would do any good if i was to swear i wouldnt so much as yip  not a bit for we shouldnt dare run the risk you would break your word  the prisoner had nothing more to say but obligingly held his mouth open so that jet might replace the gag and after this had been done the boys wrapped themselves in their blankets lying down in the softest spot they could find  how are we ever goin to get the best of them fellers jim whispered when they were ready to go to sleep  i dont know but we must cook up some kind of a plan  dont you think it would be better to send for the officers an let them do the job  im afraid the fellows will make another move before anybody could get here  you heard what sam said and it shows he is so discontented that hell be insisting on breaking camp very soon unless he turns his back on this place entirely  thats all right enough but at the same time i dont see that we can do anything without somebody to help us jim said with a sigh and then he rolled over as if determined not to rack his brain with the perplexing subject any longer  neither of the boys slept very soundly on this night  the fact of the prisoner in their midst and the problem which they must solve shortly prevented that feeling of restfulness which is necessary for profound slumber  the sun had not yet risen when jet awakened shook jim into consciousness and made his toilet in the tiny stream which wound its way through the camp  well feed the prisoner the first thing and then keep watch of the island jet proposed and this task was performed as quickly as possible neither captive nor jailors indulging in conversation during the operation  there was to be no cooking and the boys carried as much food as they thought would afford them a hearty meal to the edge of the water they crouching behind the bushes with their gaze centered on the spot where they knew the camp to be located  have you thought of anything jim asked while they were eating the not very palatable meal  jet shook his head despairingly  half an hour passed and neither spoke  then both started as if electrified for they saw both the men approaching the shore of the island nearest the main land  they heard us last night and are comin over here to see who has come jim whispered his face growing pale  it certainly looked as if he had guessed correctly and jet drew his revolver  the men were carrying the boat between them and on reaching the water launched it  the distance was not so great but that a conversation carried on in an ordinary tone could be distinguished from one shore to the other and the first words spoken by the fellows caused the greatest relief  now dont fool your time away up there bob said sharply as sam took his seat in the boat and pushed her off  why  do you think this is such a pleasant place that i shouldnt lose the opportunity to stay here as many hours as possible  i think that if you once begin drinking youll get full and five minutes afterward every loafer in the village will know we are hiding here  you must allow im a fool  so i do or youd be willing to stay twentyfour hours longer without liquor rather than run the first minute the bottle is empty  there would be jest as much risk tomorrow as now so whats the use waitin with our tongues hangin out when plenty can be got by takin a short walk  when shall i expect you  some time before mornin  ill start back within half an hour after i land  if you do that therell be little harm come to us and bob disappeared amid the foliage while sam rowed vigorously up the pond  there is no need of our trying to cook up a plan now jet whispered  why  because it is all arranged  we must tackle bob before sam comes back  jim appeared thoroughly alarmed by his companions bold statement  he looked upon bob as the most desperate of the three men as really was the case and the idea of a struggle with him seemed alarming but yet he said nothing against the plan  what puzzles me is why they launched the boat on this side of the island  they had to bring her way across  perhaps they have seen some one on the opposite shore and dont care to let folks know where the boat started from  do you suppose that fellow will call at our old camp  i shouldnt be surprised but it will be too late to do us any harm unless he comes directly back with the news that we have made a change of base  you seem to think there isnt a question but we shall get the best of that fellow  i didnt say anything of the kind  we shall either have him prisoner or be in the same fix ourselves in his camp by the time sam gets back bob will take good care we are not in condition to trouble him again if we fail this day  how are we to set about it  in the same way as the other was taken  trust to our chances of finding him asleep or so far from his gun that he cant get at it until we have the drop on him  dont you suppose he carries a revolver  of course he does  then hell be certain to shoot  this case is different from the other  there i had no right to fire but here i should take the chances rather than let him kill me     chapter xxviii  the struggle  jet was talking altogether too boldly to please the small guide and he began to repent ever having consented to take part in such work  it wont do to call on our friend for some time so lets go back to the thicket and make ready jet said as he arose to his feet and jim followed like one who feels positive he is going to his doom  once inside the shelter of the trees the amateur detective set about preparing for the work on hand  he examined the revolver carefully greased the lock with a bit of bacon rind and assured himself that every part worked freely and correctly  then he loaded the gun with ball cartridge and put half a dozen in his pocket  the bacon rind was also used with good effect and jet said as he slipped a couple of crackers in his coat  now come on jim  we may as well sit there as here and we shall know if he leaves the place  he cant unless he swims for the other fellow has got the boat  i forgot that but anyhow it wont do any harm to be ready  well carry the boat down to the bushes on the bank and that will take some time  the small guide obeyed  the craft was taken as near the water as possible without exposing her to view in case bob should look that way and then the boys settled down for the last rest before the struggle  how long are we to wait here jim asked  a couple of hours  he will have all his chores done up by that time and theres more chance of finding him lying down  why wouldnt it be as well to row around boldly and make believe weve jest come for a visit  then when he wasnt looking you could clap your revolver to his head  im afraid that wouldnt work  in the first place hed be pretty certain to recognise me in the daylightyou know my face was halfhidden in the shadow of the shanty when he called at the other camp  then again i question if any visitors could catch him unawares after first showing themselves  he has reason to know there are a good many hunting for him and is too old a bird to take chances  jim sighed  almost any plan seemed to him preferable to trying to steal upon a fellow who would be likely to shoot at the first alarm and he had little faith in the ultimate success of the undertaking  jet waited patiently another hour and then he said as a look of resolution came over his face  we must start now  if he happens to see us rowing over we must pretend that we came to look at the island and then get away as soon as possible  in case we land without his knowledge the thing must be worked exactly as was the other creep up till we see him and take advantage of the first chance that offers  shall i carry the gun  no here is the revolver and be sure to use it if things get hot  we shall be fighting for our lives when we tackle him  jet took hold on one side of the boat and jim with an expression of despair on his face cared for the other launching the little craft without a splash  the amateur detective motioned his companion to take up the oars and then shoved off leaping lightly on the sternsheets where he could handle the tiller  there was no attempt at conversation now for the utmost silence was necessary if they would land without making their coming known to the man both feared  jet steered the boat under an overhanging tree made the painter fast and then crept softly onto the bank leaving his companion to follow  since both the boys knew the exact location of the camp their task was just so much the easier and they crept cautiously along in a straight line but keeping a close watch ahead lest bob should suddenly appear  half an hour after landing they were where the shanty could be seen clearly but its occupant was not in it  jet had begun to fear he might have circled around the island merely for the sake of walking and would come up in their rear but this cause for alarm was soon found to be groundless  jim espied the man lying under the shade of some trees where he could have a full view of any who might pass and pointed him out to jet  there was no chance to creep upon him as in the case of the other fellow for he was unmistakably awake and on the alert  we shall have to wait until he changes his position the boy whispered  it wont do to tackle him yet a while  jim breathed more freely  any respite however brief was a great relief  when ten minutes had passed and there was no change in the position of affairs jet said  im going to creep around the hut and try to get through the back the guns are probably there and it will be a big thing if we get hold of them  how long are you goin to be gone  i dont know but in case i stay you can make up your mind that ive concluded to do the business there and when he comes toward the shanty be on your feet ready to jump in the minute you hear my voice  hadnt we better keep together  if theres a good chance to hide i shall wait and try to get the drop on him from the inside  then jet started off as if fearing his companion might attempt to dissuade him from his purpose  bob was so far away that there was no reason for moving with such extreme caution and he walked rapidly around through the underbrush until the hut was between himself and the man after which he went boldly forward  it was not a difficult matter to make his way into the shelter constructed as it was only of brush and he entered at once  the hut was entirely enclosed on all sides save where a narrow doorway had been left open and jet soon realized that he could ask for no better place to attempt the capture  he found both guns in one corner and these he carried out hiding them under the leaves some distance away  it was well he finished this work quickly for he had hardly regained the shelter of the shanty when from between the branches he could see bob rise to his feet yawn wearily and then come leisurely up the incline  the decisive moment had arrived and only by the greatest exercise of will power could jet prevent his hands from trembling violently  gently pushing the muzzle of the gun through the brush which formed the side of the hut the boy waited until the man should be within a few feet  bob came on in a lounging fashion looking back every now and then as if undecided what to do and thus approached the shanty in the exact direction which best served the purpose of his wouldbe captor  not until he was within a couple of yards did jet shout as he pushed the muzzle of the gun farther out and took careful aim  hold up your hands quick  i shall fire at the first move you make  bob obeyed instinctively as any other man would have done in the same position with that ominouslooking barrel almost touching him  now remember that the slightest movement will cost you your life for i shall let both barrels go if you do more than wink  i know what your reputation is and dont intend to take any chances  where are you jim  here was the prompt reply and jet saw the small guide coming rapidly from his place of concealment  stand on one side of that fellow so you wont spoil my aim and take his revolver away  be quick and dont fear his hurting you for he cant make but one move  bob scowled fiercely but did not dare to offer any resistance perhaps if he had known who was behind that gun the case might have been different but there was every reason to believe an officer held it and he could not afford to run any risk  jim searched the prisoner carefully and then when a revolver and a knife had been thrown into the camp jet said  now stand directly behind him with your revolver pressed to the back of his head and pull the trigger if you feel him move ever so slightly  jim was beginning to regain his courage and obeyed without hesitation  the amateur detective now came into view and bob literally gnashed his teeth in rage  i wish id known it was you he cried savagely  be careful or your head will move so much my friend will shoot his hand trembles so now that theres danger your brains will be blown out unintentionally  on first entering the shanty jet had seen plenty of ropes with which to bind the prisoner and these he brought out lashing bobs arms behind his back and tying his legs securely together  during this last operation the prisoner struggled most desperately for jims revolver had been lowered in order that he might assist his companion and before the boys finally got him under subjection they were reeking with perspiration in addition to being nearly tired out  well jim said triumphantly as he rose to his feet that part of the work was done as slick as grease and at this rate it wont take us long to wind the whole gang up  im afraid the hardest job is ahead jet replied as a most unaccountable fit of gloominess came over him  you know the other makes the third one and superstitious people believe a fellow always comes to grief on that number     chapter xxix  bob  when bob was fettered beyond his power to make any resistance he relapsed into a sullen silence which troubled jet more than reproaches or threats would have done  he had expected to be overwhelmed with curses and fancied the man would rave and struggle uselessly until he was completely worn out but such was not the fact  it was much as if bob had suddenly conceived the idea of reserving his strength until the time should come when he could use it with effect  he lay silent and motionless on the ground and when jet had prepared a gag he was even so complaisant as to open his mouth to receive it  sposen we let up on his legs a little sos he can walk down to the shore jim suggested  hes goin to make a big load if we try to carry him  this seemed to be a very good idea and jet acted upon it at once saying to the prisoner  if youll come along quietly well treat you the best we can under the circumstances  bob did not move  get up jet said in a louder tone as if believing his first remark was not understood  bob shook his head and there was no mistaking the look on his face as he did so  he had no intention of aiding his captors in any manner and if they claimed him as prisoner they must take him by sheer expenditure of strength or not at all  theres no use spending time trying to coax or drive him jet said after a long pause  if he wont walk weve got to carry him and thats the end of it  jim who had been examining the shanty while resting after the battle discovered a hammock tucked away in one corner and he proposed that this should be used as a litter for the man could be conveyed more easily on something than if the boys raised him simply by the head and feet  roll him in here and well run this pole through the ends so all the weight will be on our shoulders  this was done at once and although the prisoner was bent nearly double when the density of the foliage forced the bearers to approach each other closely the labor of removing him to the boat was greatly lessened  theres no chance sam will be back until late in the night jet said as bob was deposited in the bottom of the craft with no gentle force so we can move about without fear of being discovered and you might give us a hot dinner  well take our ease this day an thatll put us in better shape for tackling the other feller tonight  if he helps himself to the liquor as he comes down the lake we may have our hands full  thats what im afraid of jet replied gloomily and then recovering himself as with an effort he added theres no use borrowing trouble however and we should be mighty thankful weve succeeded so well in getting two of them  you can bet i am thankful jim replied with such emphasis that jet could not prevent himself from laughing heartily  by this time bob had been carried to the cedar thicket and an expression of surprise came over his face as he saw the first prisoner but jet did not intend to allow them an opportunity to communicate with each other even by signs  bob was made fast to a tree at the farther end of the encampment where he could not see his former companion and then jet went to the first prisoner as he said  if you will promise not to speak ill take the gag out of your mouth for a while because we shall likely be here a long time  there was an expression of deepest thankfulness in the fellows eyes and the amateur detective felt reasonably certain that he would not attempt to make any disturbance  now if i hear you so much as whisper back it goes he said as he removed the uncomfortable preventive of speech  you neednt be afraid was the meek reply  ill do anything rather than have that thing put in my mouth agin  how did you get hold of bob  took him unawares as we did you  well all i can say is you fellers are corkers  this in a tone of admiration  if any one had told me that a couple of boys could get the best of him id said it was a lie an here you sneak off an bring him in when you get ready  we shouldnt have done it if youd found them  thats a fact but you cant expect that a feller wouldnt help his pals  thats all right since no harm has been done jet replied feeling very magnanimous now he had been so successful  the boy had every reason to feel proud of what had been accomplished he had acted as harvey wished and in addition arrested the man so particularly wanted with one of his companions  now if he could transfer them to the charge of an officer his triumph would be complete and the detective have good reason to keep his promise relative to employing him as an assistant  it was the fact of his having been successful more than anything else that caused jet to fear the third attempt at capturing a man would be attended with signal failure and several times during the day was he tempted to bundle the two into the boat instead of waiting to make prisoners of all three  he even went so far as to suggest this to jim saying  we could get up to the village with these fellows before morning and im not sure it wouldnt be the best plan for if sam downs us these will be set free  then all this work counts for nothing  lets go the whole hog or nothing the small guide replied bravely for he was rapidly beginning to think that he and jet could accomplish anything they might attempt  then jim set about cooking an elaborate dinner as a sort of thanksgiving  the fire was built inside the thicket between the two prisoners so that the boys might keep watch of both at the same time and when the food had been prepared detective harveys assistants set themselves down to enjoy it to the utmost  then it was necessary to feed the prisoners a task which required considerable time  jim attended to the stranger while jet fed bob and the latter said when his gag was removed  i reckon youre countin on turnin us over to the albany officers  yes unless some one comes from new york  aint you the messenger boy i smuggled up on the boat  yes  i dont suppose you expected to see me again eh  i wish id done as joe wanted me to  you could have been thrown over that night and no one would have been any the wiser  lucky for me you didnt know as much as you do now  you can well say that was the surly reply and during the next five minutes bob paid strict attention to receiving the food which jet held to his lips  i wonder if it would be any use to try an buy you off the fellow said half to himself when the meal was finished  not a bit joe tried that but it wouldnt work  are you the same boy who nabbed him  yes  its hard mighty hard to be pulled by a cub like you and bob shook his head mournfully  a feller expects something of the kind from a reglar officer if it so be that hes put himself in the way of trouble but it comes tough to be downed by a couple of whiffletts i could break all up with one hand  it does seem queer we should be able to do so much jet replied modestly and then he added if you give me your word as a man that not a word shall be spoken and no noise made ill leave this gag out until sunset otherwise it must go in again  ill agree because youve got me foul  very well but if i hear so much as a whisper it will go in your mouth again not to be taken out till the officers get here  i know when im licked bob growled an dont need threats after i cant help myself  during the remainder of the afternoon the boys had nothing to do save discuss the chances of taking sam a prisoner and when they were tired of this jet suggested that each take a nap  from this out we shall have to keep our eyes open pretty much all the time unless sam succeeds in getting the best of us and it will be a good idea to scoop in what rest we can now  you lie down first and ill stand watch  the small guide was quite ready to act upon this suggestion and it seemed as if he had but just rolled over on the blanket when his eyes were closed in slumber  when the sun was an hour high jet awakened his companion and said as he prepared to take his turn at sleeping  be sure to call me at sunset and keep your eyes on those fellows all the time  i dont reckon theres much chance of their being able to get free but we mustnt run any risks  his orders were obeyed to the letter and the sun had but just sunk behind the trees when jim shook him into wakefulness as he was instructed to do  i havent seen so much as a boat he said  the men have been quiet as mice sleeping a good deal of the time  when shall we start for the island  as soon as weve had supper and gagged the prisoners again  it wont do to let them have the chance of warning sam  it aint likely hell get back before midnight  thats true but in the meanwhile we have a good deal to do  the campfire must be lighted to prevent him from being suspicious when he comes in sight of the island and we need to look about a bit for a hidingplace  have you made up your mind how we are to strike him  i think it will be best to wait near the shore and knock him down if he comes back halfdrunk he wont be likely to put up his hands very quickly even if a revolver is at his head and i dont want to shoot  you were willing enough to do so in bobs case  that was different  sams crime isnt as serious  whats bob accused of  murder  i swow and jim looked around in alarm even though the man was powerless to so much as move his hands  if id known that i wouldnt have gone to help catch him for a hundred dollars  that is exactly why i didnt go into any particulars when we made the trade for you to help me jet replied quietly  now lets get our work done and row over to the island for what i hope will be the last time     chapter xxx  a failure  the boys soon had their camp in order  the prisoners were gagged again their bonds examined to make certain there could be no chance of an escape and the smouldering remains of the fire carefully extinguished  i reckon everything will be safe if we are gone all night jet said as he looked around for the last time to assure himself nothing had been forgotten but those fellows would have a pain in their jaws if we should stay so long  jim insisted on carrying his muzzleloader on this expedition believing it a more trustworthy weapon than the revolver and jet made no objections although he would have much preferred that the ancient musket had been left behind  the boys did not draw the boat upon shore when they landed with bob therefore they had nothing to do but step on board  the small guide pulled her across to the hidingplace under the overhanging trees and there she was made fast  then the boys went directly to the camp and built a fire after which nothing could be done save wait and watch  since it was not known on which side of the island sam would come ashore the two went to the extreme northern point where they could see the fellow in time to hasten back and get into ambush  jets plans were already formed and had been explained to his companion  he now said as they sat among the bushes waiting for the first sound which should betoken the coming of the man they hoped to make captive  i shall hit him over the head with the butt of the revolver and the moment he drops you must be ready to jump on him for itll be sharp work if i dont stun him at the first blow  aint you afraid of killing him  not a bit of it hed stand up under a good deal harder blow than i shall give him  then the conversation ceased and after a time jims heavy breathing told that he was sleeping at his post of duty  jet had quite as much as he could do to keep his eyes open but he succeeded after a fashion and when they had been in hiding at least three hours the alleged melody of a song coming across the still waters told their hopedfor captive was approaching  that sam had been indulging to a considerable extent in liquor could be plainly understood by the sound of his voice and again jet felt the same misgivings which had assailed him immediately after the capture of bob  the newcomer had no thought of prudence but was evidently bent on landing in front of the camp on the outside of the island  jet shook jim at the same time placing his hand over the boys mouth to prevent a possible outcry and whispered  theres no time to lose  we must get there ahead of him or the jig is up and according to the noise hes rowing mighty fast  jim was on his feet in an instant and the two started at full speed through the underbrush paying little attention to the disturbance of the foliage because sam was so nearly intoxicated that he would not heed slight sounds  hell land somewhere here jet said breathlessly as he halted where the glimmer of the campfire could be seen  if he dont we must creep up while hes fastening the boat  sam was evidently amusing himself by making the light craft spin through the water and when he turned for the shore the boys saw that they had stationed themselves in the most advantageous position  it was not necessary to move out of their tracks for after landing the man came directly toward where they were standing  jet raised his revolver by the muzzle and jim stood ready to make a spring  sam reeled along shouting for bob and lurching from side to side  the time had not come to strike the blow but the boy believing he was about to be discovered struck at the fellows head  the blow was not delivered fairly but glanced off and instead of being stunned sam was only alarmed  leaping back quickly before jet could strike again he fired into the bushes from whence he believed the attack had come  the bullet whistled so near jims nose that the young gentleman leaped back with a howl and this outcry was sufficient to show sam where to send another  before the echoes had fairly died away the sound of hurried footsteps through the bushes told that the small guide had taken refuge in flight  jet was alone amid darkness so intense that he had no means of judging the whereabouts of his enemy save by the flash when the revolver was discharged  the knowledge of danger had sobered sam and he understood he must make a desperate fight or be arrested for quite naturally the first thought was that the officers of the law were on his track  jet was wholly at a loss to know what course should be pursued  sam was not charged with a capital crime and harvey never intimated that he cared to take him prisoner therefore to shoot now save actually in selfdefense would be little less than murder  sam emptied the chambers of his weapon while retreating toward the boat and that he had reloaded before reaching her was told by the second volley which he sent in the direction of jet  by the grating of wood and sand the amateur detective knew the boat was being pushed off from the shore and at that moment he could have fired with a very good chance of hitting the mark but he refrained from doing so  the most important thing just now was to assure the safety of the prisoners in the other camp and he made his way across the island hurriedly lest by accident sam should happen to stumble across his comrades  neither jim nor the boat were to be seen when he arrived at the clump of trees where the craft had been moored  the small guide had thought only of his own safety and paid no attention to what might happen to his friend  jet would have tried to summon him by whistling but for the fear sam might hear the signal and come that way  it was possible to swim across the intervening space but it would be at the cost of wetting both weapons and he decided against the idea almost before it took form in his mind  he splashed the water gently hoping jim would believe it a signal to come back  then he waited in silence nearly an hour fancying all the previous work would speedily be undone and when it seemed certain the small guide had deserted him entirely he heard his name whispered  is that you jim he asked in a low tone  yes  wheres that feller  left the island i think  why dont you row in here  is it safe  it wont be if you dont take me off precious quick  this threat had the effect of deciding the timid guide and in a few moments the boat was paddled alongside the bank  what did you run away for jet asked angrily when they were a short distance from the shore  what for  didnt you hear that bullet come across my nose  of course he fired but there wasnt much chance of being hit in the darkness  there was too good a chance to suit me  if that bullet had come an inch nearer id be dead by this time  but it didnt and when you found he hadnt hit the mark you told him where you was by runnin away  i couldnt help it jim replied apologetically  i dont reckon i was cut out for a detective an when folks begin shootin right at me im bound to run  have you been up to the camp  not much  i stayed right here in the boat to find out what was goin on  then theres no knowing but he has been ashore and set the men free  if thats so the sooner we get out of this place the better and jim would have headed the boat toward the outlet but that jet prevented him by pulling lustily on the other oar  look here the latter said angrily if you act like this ill dump you overboard or shoot whichever comes handiest  now row for our camp and do the best you know how if you dont want to get into a pile of trouble with me  jim obeyed meekly and a few moments later jet was running at full speed toward the clump of cedars  the encampment was apparently just as they had left it and jet gave vent to a sigh of relief as he ascertained that the prisoners were still bound securely  then he ran back to help jim bring the boat ashore and the guide asked in a trembling voice  are you goin to try to stay here now  what else can we do  it would be running a big risk to start in the boat with both men for sam is rowing around somewhere and hes certain to help his friends if he sees them in trouble  suppose he should find out we were here  thats exactly what im afraid of  we must keep mighty close for a day or two and then ill try to send another message  i cant stay as long as that  very well start for the village now and ill hold my own against him if he comes  but i dont dare to go off by myself while hes prowlin round  then dont be a fool but help me keep things quiet until he gets tired of hunting for us and leaves  jim was not in such a frame of mind as would best fit him to be an assistant in such a desperate case as was now before the boys but in the absence of other help jet could do no less than utilize him in some way and he began by threatening all kind of punishments if he didnt stand up like a man and do his duty  there was no sleep for the amateur detective on this night  he spent the time pacing to and fro in the encampment watching the prisoners going to the waters edge or listening to the slightest unusual sound fearing it might be made by sam  when daylight came jet was hidden among the fringe of bushes which bordered the lake and the first living thing he saw was the man whom he had failed to capture on the previous evening  sam was standing on the shore of the island apparently on the point of embarking in the boat  while jet could have counted twenty he remained there and then stepping on board began to row directly toward the spot where the boy was in hiding     chapter xxxi  an attack  it could not have been other than an accident which caused sam to head for this particular spot but excited as he was jet believed the man knew they were encamped in the cedars  the first question in his mind was whether he had best make a stand on the shore or in the thicket and the latter course was decided upon  sam was not more than two boat lengths from the island when he started and there would be several moments in which to arrange for a defense before the man could land  jim was overhauling the cooked provisions preparatory to feeding the prisoners when his comrade burst into the encampment looking quite as excited as he felt  sam must have come to the conclusion that those who hit him last night were not officers of the law for he went back to the island and now is heading straight for this place  what jim cried sharply as he leaped to his feet dropping a handful of fried fish  now dont get excited and above all keep quiet  it isnt dead certain he has any suspicion there is a camp here but we must be prepared for the worst  what are you goin to do jim asked in a voice trembling with fear  fight him off if he tries to come inside this thicket  it will be strange if two of us well armed and under cover cant hold our own against one man  but how is it to end  he may keep us shut up here till the provisions are all gone  there is no need to look so far ahead  get your gun and come with me  jim obeyed very unwillingly  this was one of the moments when he felt more like running away than fighting but jet took good care that he should not have an opportunity  the two crept to the very edge of the thicket where it would be possible to see any one who came up from the lake and they had hardly concealed themselves before the man appeared  he was walking slowly gazing around scrutinizingly as if expecting to find enemies and carried a revolver in his hand  jet hoped sincerely that he would pass the cedars without devoting to them any especial attention but in this he was disappointed  sam had already noted the place and came straight on as if determined to examine every inch of the ground  there was no time for hesitation  already he was within a dozen yards of where the boys were crouching and in a moment more would be upon them  jet suddenly pushed the muzzle of his gun out from among the branches and cried  put up your hands or ill fire  unfortunately sam was not taken by surprise as the others had been his revolver was ready for use and it seemed as if the words had hardly been uttered when he fired three times in rapid succession  he aimed directly for the muzzle of jets gun but was forced to discharge his weapon so quickly that there was no time to shoot with any degree of accuracy  two of the bullets whistled past jet but the third lodged in the fleshy portion of his arm  for the instant he was conscious of nothing more than a sharp twinge such as might have been caused by the sudden application of a galvanic battery and he pulled both triggers of his gun at the same instant  unfortunately neither of the bullets took effect  at the moment he fired sam leaped behind a tree thus shielding himself from what might otherwise have put a speedy end to the battle  stay where you are and fire whenever he shows himself jet whispered sternly to jim who was showing signs of beating a retreat  wheres the use the small guide whined  youre pretty nigh killed an what am i goin to do  im all right theres no need to worry about me if youll only do your share  but look at the blood and jim pointed to his friends shoulder down which the life fluid was flowing copiously  just at that instant jet had no time to bestow upon his own injuries  he had seen sam edging around as if to advance nearer and he emptied two chambers of his revolver as a warning that it would be dangerous for him to make the attempt  the man shrank behind the tree very suddenly and this gave the amateur detective an opportunity to slip a couple of cartridges into his gun  shall i go to see if the prisoners are all right jim whispered theyll be sure to try an give us the slip after hearin all this shootin  stay here and keep your eyes oh that fellow  the others must be left to do as they can for a while  this scheme of jims for getting out of the way of danger had proven a failure and with a deep sigh he turned his attention once more to the enemy in front  jet knew how dangerous it would be to allow sam a chance to rush in upon them and after loading his gun he fired one ball at the fellows leg which was visible from behind the tree  a smothered curse and two shots fired at random told that he had succeeded in making matters even so far as wounds were concerned and jet whispered  fire whenever you see a bit of his clothes that will prevent him from jumping in on us  during the next ten minutes no less than a dozen shots were exchanged without apparent effect  sam was growing more cautious  the discharge of jims weapon thus showing there were at least two confronting him had taught a salutary lesson and he now appeared eager to find a better shelter  jet understood what the man wished to do and determined to prevent it if possible  sam in his present position did not dare show himself long enough to take aim and while he remained behind this particular tree there was little danger he could do very serious damage  by this time jets wound had begun to make itself felt  the pain had become great and the blood was yet flowing freely  once he thought he would creep over to jim that the latter might fasten a ligature above the aperture thus checking the blood but in order to do so it would have been necessary to expose himself to a certain extent and also give sam the desired opportunity to gain a better shelter  i dont see any way out of the scrape he said to himself for theres no chance anybody will come this way and hes bound to get the best of us after a time because i cant hold out a great while longer if i keep on growing weak but anything is better than surrendering willingly  therefore he remained where he was firing on the slightest chance of hitting the mark and using the revolver when the gun was empty  the only ray of hope which jet could see in the entire business was the fact that sam might not have a full supply of cartridges  he no longer shot at random reserving his fire as if it was necessary to make every shot count but this might mean nothing more than a desire to tire the others out  jet was growing weaker each moment  jim watched his companion anxiously ready to take flight the instant he was overcome  jet knew exactly what would happen the instant he failed to show a bold front and between two evils be chose the one which seemed the least  loading the gun and the revolver he laid both at his side and stripped off his coat to stanch the flow of crimson fluid  sam must have seen this movement for at that moment he ran for a clump of trees half a dozen yards farther off and succeeded in gaining the desired spot before jet could pick up his weapons  why didnt you fire the latter asked sharply  i didnt know he was goin to leave so sudden was the innocent reply  that move was just what ive been trying to guard against and now we must push back a bit to prevent him from picking us off  the small guide was only too willing to beat a retreat even though it was only for a short distance and he followed his companion quickly  an overturned tree twenty feet away was the barricade jet selected and when they were sheltered by it he said  tie this handkerchief around my arm above that bullet hole and then twist it with a stick until the blood stops  ill use the revolver in the meanwhile so hell know we havent gone far  jim did as he was directed and jet discharged one chamber of the weapon every few seconds taking good aim at the clump of bushes behind which he believed sam was hiding  twice he loaded his revolver and twice exploded every cartridge before the surgical work was done and then jim seized his own weapon saying as he did so  that fellow has got a good chance now to creep around behind us an let the others loose  then the fat will be in the fire for certain because we shant even have a chance to run away  this was a possibility which jet had failed to take into consideration and for the first time since the battle began he was thoroughly alarmed  he did not know whether it would be best to go up to the encampment or remain where he was either course seemed fraught with danger and he was beginning to despair when the sound of a human voice startled both him and jim  hold up your hands some one shouted the speaker evidently being between the lake and sams hidingplace  drop that revolver but dont lower your arm was the next command and jet cried joyfully  some one has come to help us jim and it dont make much matter who for we can get him to help take the prisoners up to the village  the small guide had recovered all his lost courage immediately upon hearing the words and was dancing about in a triumphant manner but much too cautious to venture from his hidingplace until knowing to a certainty that the enemy was really disarmed  during a couple of minutes not another sound was heard and then the listeners could distinguish the words  go up farther and find out what this fellow was shooting at  there was a sound as of some one making his way through the foliage and again the voice shouted  hello there  whats the matter  who is that jet cried  harvey  come on  come on  youve got here just in time and jet started down the slope to meet the one person in the world whom he particularly wished to see at that moment     chapter xxxii  harvey  co  when jet was where he could see the newcomers sam had been handcuffed and was in charge of a stranger who was dressing the wound in his leg while the detective walking with a cane was coming up the ascent in advance of another man  it seems as if youd been in pretty snug quarters harvey said as he clasped jet warmly by the hand  who is this fellow who has been making a target of you  one of the gang we met at the house in the woods  he introduced himself to me when he was made up as a tramp on the railroad track  you are wounded harvey interrupted as he pointed to the boys arm let me see if it is serious you are looking pale  i shall be all right now you are here  come up to our camp and you can attend to it  jet led the way hurriedly to the cedar thicket taking such a route that his visitor must pass bob who was looking woefully disconsolate and uncomfortable  hello harvey cried in astonishment im blest if you havent bagged the game already and once more he clasped jets hand  i knew you would suit me for a partner and from this day out well work in company or my names not dan harvey  how long have you had this fellow  since last night and thats why sam was trying to get the best of us we attempted to capture him but made a botch of the business  bobs arrest is enough to cover you with glory my boy for youve done what every man on the force would have liked to had a hand in here downs he continued to the man behind him slip the bracelets on this man and take the gag out  i reckon his jaws ache by this time  when this order was obeyed jet led his visitors to where the other prisoner was trussed up and harveys amazement was complete  is this another one of the gang  yes in the counterfeit money business and when we get back i calculate the constable can be found without much trouble  well jet youve done this job up about as brown as possible and therell be no mean reward coming when bob reaches new york  what do you mean  one thousand dollars has been offered for the apprehension of those charged with murder and in regard to the makers of the queer uncle sam ought to shell out liberally for having them brought in so cleverly  the firm shall be harvey  co for a boy who can do so much single handed will be an ornament to the force even though he isnt larger than a pint of cider  i had jim to help me jet replied modestly  who is jim  a boy i met up at the village and promised twenty dollars if we succeeded  but i havent earned it jim cried i was mightily frightened an would have run home long ago if youd let me  the money has been earned harvey said as he took a roll of bills from his pocket and ill add ten on my own account  the small guide looked in bewilderment at the thirty dollars and then broke into a dance which was quite as vigorous if not so skillful as jets performances with the minstrel company  how did it happen you got here in the nick of time jet asked after jim had ceased his contortions  when i received your letter telling me you were coming into the woods it was enough to show you would want assistance  i never thought for a moment youd be able to bag the whole gang but only counted on saving them from cutting your throat  not being well enough to walk very handily i brought a couple of friends along and now weve got force enough to take our men back  how did you happen to find me  we heard at the village that a couple of boys one a stranger had come this way and we started on chances  last night we camped this side of the first carry and was striking for the upper lake when the reports of your weapon gave us a clew  it was easy to tell that the shots were not fired by hunters and we rounded up your friend sam on general principles  while this conversation was being carried on harveys companions released the prisoners from the bonds which had been put on by the boys and shackled them in much more secure and less painful fashion  then jim remembered that none of his party had breakfasted and he cooked the remainder of the provisions at once when all hands joined in the meal  harvey had already examined jets wound and pronounced it a trifling one more painful than dangerous  the ball was extracted the arm bandaged properly and fastened in a sling the detective saying when the work was finished  youll come around all right in a week or two with care and that ill guarantee you shall have in abundance  it was not yet noon when the party were ready to leave round pond harvey and the boys traveled in the boat jet had hired and the other craft which was considerably larger carried the two officers and their prisoners  except at the carry where all hands were forced to assist in transporting the boats the journey was made in a leisurely fashion and that night jet slept in a comfortable bed at the saranac lake house  jim disappeared as soon as the party arrived at the village  he was eager to show the money earned and to tell his chums of his wonderful skill as a detective but it is not probable he spoke of the many times when he would have sold his position very cheaply  he was on hand next morning to see his friend and companions take their departure and then jet was forced to promise he would visit the adirondacks on a regular hunting trip as soon as his business would permit  id like to go out with you once when there wasnt a lot of ruffians round to make trouble jim said and a moment later the train rolled out of the depot  jet was praised and petted by the officers at headquarters when the party arrived in new york at a rate which would have turned many another boys head but he knew in his heart that a good portion of the success was due to luck rather than detective skill  harvey kept his word in regard to taking him in partnership and today jet lewis young as he is does a full share of detective harveys work  in fact that gentleman often says that without his partner he would fail in many cases which he now works up successfully  jet received the reward of one thousand dollars for the arrest of joe and bob and those worthies are serving a life sentence at sing sing for murder the crime having been fully proven against them  sam the constable and the fellow who stole the boys boat have been sentenced to ten years for uttering counterfeit money and jet insists that at some future time he will find the plates they buried in the vicinity of the house in the woods for he keeps well in mind what he heard regarding the big oak
