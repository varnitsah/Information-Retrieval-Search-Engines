77351443	jeanne of the marshes   by  e phillips oppenheim    author of  a maker of history the missioner the governors etc    illustrated by  j v mcfall and c e brock     book i  chapter i   the princess opened her eyes at the sound of her maids approach she turned her head impatiently toward the door  annette she said coldly did you misunderstand me did i not say that i was on no account to be disturbed this afternoon  annette was the picture of despair eyebrows and hands betrayed alike both her agitation of mind and her nationality  madame she said did i not say so to monsieur i begged him to call again i told him that madame was lying down with a bad headache and that it was as much as my place was worth to disturb her what did he answer only this that it would be as much as my place was worth if i did not come up and tell you that he was here to see you on a very urgent matter indeed madame he was very very impatient with me  of whom are you talking the princess asked  but of major forrest madame annette declared it is he who waits below  the princess closed her eyes for a moment and then slowly opened them she stretched out her hand and from a table by her side took up a small gilt mirror  turn on the lights annette she commanded  the maid illuminated the darkened room the princess gazed at herself in the mirror and reaching out again took a small powderpuff from its case and gently dabbed her face then she laid both mirror and powderpuff back in their places  you will tell monsieur she said that i am very unwell indeed but that since he is here and his business is urgent i will see him turn out the lights annette i am not fit to be seen and move my couch a little so  madame is only a little pale the maid said reassuringly that makes nothing these englishwomen have all too much colour i go to tell monsieur  she disappeared and the princess lay still upon her couch thinking soon she heard steps outside and with a little sigh she turned her head toward the door the man who entered was tall and of the ordinary type of wellborn englishmen he was carefully dressed and his somewhat scanty hair was arranged to the best advantage his features were hard and lifeless his eyes were just a shade too close together the maid ushered him in and withdrew at once  come and sit by my side nigel if you want to talk to me the princess said walk softly please i really have a headache  no wonder in this close room the man muttered a little ungraciously it smells as though you had been burning incense here  it suits me the princess answered calmly and it happens to be my room bring that chair up here and say what you have to say  the man obeyed in silence when he had made himself quite comfortable he raised her hand the one which was nearest to him to his lips and afterwards retained it in his own  forgive me if i seem unsympathetic ena he said the fact is everything has been getting on my nerves for the last few days and my luck seems dead out  she looked at him curiously she was past middle age and her face showed signs of the wear and tear of life but she still had fine eyes and the rejuvenating arts of bond street had done their best for her  what is the matter nigel she asked have the cards been going against you  he frowned and hesitated for a moment before replying  ena he said between us two there is an ancient bargain and that is that we should tell the truth to one another i will tell you what it is that is worrying me most i have suspected it for some time but this afternoon it was absolutely obvious there is a sort of feeling at the club i cant exactly describe it but i am conscious of it directly i come into the room for several days i have scarcely been able to get a rubber this afternoon when i cut in with harewood and mildmay and another fellow two of them made some sort of an excuse and went off i pretended not to notice it of course but there it was the thing was apparent and it is the very devil  again she looked at him closely  there is nothing tangible she asked no complaint or scandal or anything of that sort  he rejected the suggestion with scorn  no he said i am not such an idiot as that all the same there is the feeling they dont care to play bridge with me there is only young engleton who takes my part and so far as playing bridge for money is concerned he would be worth the whole lot put together if only i could get him away from themmake up a little party somewhere and have him to myself for a week or two  the princess was thoughtful  to go abroad at this time of the year she remarked is almost impossible besides you have only just come back  absolutely impossible he answered besides i shouldnt care to do it just now it looks like running away a week or so ago you were talking of taking a villa down the river i wondered whether you had thought any more of it  the princess shook her head  i dare not she answered i have gone already further than i meant to this house and the servants and carriages are costing me a small fortune i dare not even look at my bills another house is not to be thought of  major forrest looked gloomily at the shining tip of his patent boot  its jolly hard luck he muttered a quiet place somewhere in the country with engleton and you and myself and another one or two and i should be able to pull through as it is i feel inclined to chuck it all  the princess looked at him curiously he was certainly more than ordinarily pale and the hand which rested upon the side of his chair was twitching a little nervously  my dear nigel she said do go to the chiffonier there and help yourself to a drink i hate to see you white to the lips and trembling as though death itself were at your elbow borrow a little false courage if you lack the real thing  the man obeyed her suggestion with scarcely a protest  i had hoped ena he remarked a little peevishly to have found you more sympathetic  you are so sorry for yourself she answered that you seem scarcely to need my sympathy however sit down and talk to me reasonably  i talk reasonably enough he answered but i really am hard up against it dont think i have come begging i know youve done all you can and its a matter with me now of more than a few hundreds my only hope is engleton cant you suggest anything  the princess rested her head slightly upon the long slender fingers of her right hand bond street had taken care of her complexion but the veins in her hand were blue and art had no means of concealing a certain sharpness of features and the thin lines about the eyes nameless suggestions of middle age yet she was still a handsome woman she knew how to dress and how to make the best of herself she had the foreigners instinct for clothes and her figure was still irreproachable she sat and looked with a sort of calculating interest at the man who for years had come as near touching her heart as any of his sex curiously enough she knew that this new aspect in which he now presented himself this incipient cowardicethe firstfruits of weakening nervesdid not and could not affect her feelings for him she saw him now almost for the first time with the mask dropped no longer cold cynical and calculating but a man moved to his shallow depths by what might well seem to him a dweller in the narrow ways of life as a tragedy it looked at her out of his grey eyes it showed itself in the twitching of his lips for many years he had lived upon a little less than nothing a year now for the first time his means of livelihood were threatened his longsuffering acquaintances had left him alone at the cardtable  you disappoint me nigel she said i hate to see a man weaken there is nothing against you dont act as though there could be as to this little houseparty you were speaking of i only wish i could think of something to help you by the by what are you doing tonight  nothing he answered except that engleton is expecting me to dine with him  i have an idea the princess said slowly it may not come to anything but it is worth trying have you met my new admirer mr cecil de la borne  forrest shook his head  do you mean a dandifiedlooking boy whom you were driving with in the park yesterday  the princess nodded  we met him a week or so ago she answered and he has been very attentive he has a country place down in norfolk which from his description is i should think like a castle in hermitland jeanne and i are dining with him tonight at the savoy you and engleton must come too i can arrange it it is just possible that we may be able to manage something he told me yesterday that he was going back to norfolk very soon i fancy that he has a brother who keeps rather a strict watch over him and he is not allowed to stay up in town very long at a time  i know the name forrest remarked they are a very old roman catholic family well come and dine if you say that you can arrange it but i dont see how we can all hope to get an invitation out of him on such a short acquaintance  the princess was looking thoughtful  leave it to me she said i have an idea be at the savoy at a quarter past eight and bring lord ronald  forrest took up his hat he looked at the princess with something very much like admiration in his face for years he had dominated this woman today for the first time she had had the upper hand  we will be there all right he said engleton will only be too glad to be where jeanne is i suppose young de la borne is the same way  the princess sighed  every one she remarked is so shockingly mercenary     chapter ii   the princess helped herself to a salted almond and took her first sip of champagne the almonds were crisp and the champagne dry she was wearing a new and most successful dinnergown of black velvet and she was quite sure that in the subdued light no one could tell that the pearls in the collar around her neck were imitation her afternoons indisposition was quite forgotten she nodded at her host approvingly  cecil she said it is really very good of you to take in my two friends like this major forrest has just arrived from ostend and i was very anxious to hear about the people i know there and the frocks and all the rest of it lord ronald always amuses me too i suppose most people would call him foolish but to me he only seems very very young  the young man who was host raised his glass and bowed towards the princess  i can assure you he said that it has given me a great deal of pleasure to make the acquaintance of major forrest and lord ronald but it has given me more pleasure still to be able to do anything for you you know that  she looked at him quickly and down at her plate such glances had become almost a habit with her but they were still effectual cecil de la borne leaned across towards forrest  i hear that you have been to ostend lately major forrest he said i thought of going over myself a little later in the season for a few days  i wouldnt if i were you forrest answered it is overrun just now with the wrong sort of people there is nothing to do but gamble which doesnt interest me particularly or dress in a ridiculous costume and paddle about in a few feet of water which appeals to me even less  you were there a little early in the season the princess reminded him  major forrest assented  a little later he admitted it may be tolerable on the whole however i was disappointed  lord ronald spoke for the first time he was very thin very long and very tall he wore a somewhat unusually high collar but he was very carefully not to say exactly dressed his studs and links and waistcoat buttons were obviously fresh from the rue de la paix the set of his tie was perfection his features were not unintelligent but his mouth was weak  one thing i noticed about ostend he remarked they charge you a frightful price for everything we never got a glass of champagne there like this  i am glad you like it their host said from what you say i dont imagine that i should care for ostend i am not rich enough to gamble and as i have lived by the sea all my days bathing does not attract me particularly i think i shall stay at home  by the by where is your home mr de la borne the princess asked you told me once but i have forgotten some of your english names are so queer that i cannot even pronounce them much more remember them  i live in a very small village in norfolk called salthouse cecil de la borne answered it is quite close to a small markettown called wells if you know where that is i dont suppose you do though he added it is an outoftheway corner of the world  the princess shook her head  i never heard of it she said i am going to motor through norfolk soon though and i think that i shall call upon you  cecil de la borne looked up eagerly  i wish you would he begged and bring your stepdaughter you cant imagine he added with a glance at the girl who was sitting at his left hand how much pleasure it would give me the roads are really not bad and every one admits that the country is delightful  you had better be careful the princess said or we may take you at your word i warn you though that it would be a regular invasion major forrest and lord ronald are talking about coming with us  its just an idea forrest remarked carelessly i wouldnt mind it myself but i dont fancy we should get engleton away from town before goodwood  well i like that engleton remarked forrests a lot keener on these social functions than i am as a matter of fact i am for the tour on one condition  and that the princess asked  that you come in my car lord ronald answered i havent really had a chance to try it yet but its a sixty horse mercedes and its fitted up for touring take the lot of us easy luggage and everything  i think it would be perfectly delightful the princess declared do you really mean it  of course i do lord ronald answered its too hot for town and im rather great on rusticating myself  i think this is charming the princess declared here we have one of our friends with a car and another with a house but seriously cecil we mustnt think of coming to you there would be too many of us  the more the better cecil said eagerly if you really want to attempt anything in the shape of a restcure i can recommend my home thoroughly i am afraid he added with a shrug of the shoulders that i cannot recommend it for anything else  a rest the princess declared is exactly what we want life here is becoming altogether too strenuous we started the season a little early i am perfectly certain that we could not possibly last till the end until i arrived in london with an heiress under my charge i had no idea that i was such a popular person  the girl who was sitting on the other side of their host spoke almost for the first time she was evidently quite young and her pale cheeks dark full eyes and occasional gestures indicated clearly enough something foreign in her nationality she addressed no one in particular but she looked toward forrest  that is one of the things she said which puzzles me i do not understand it at all it seems as though every one is liked or disliked here in london at any rate according to the amount of money they have  upon my word miss jeanne it isnt so with every one lord ronald interposed hastily  she glanced at him indifferently  there may be exceptions she said i am speaking of the great number  for heavens sake child dont be cynical the princess remarked there is no worse pose for a child of your age  it is not a pose at all jeanne answered calmly i do not want to be cynical and i do not want to have unkind thoughts but tell me lord ronald honestly do you think that every one would have been as kind to a girl just out of boardingschool as they have been to me if it were not that i have so much money  i cannot tell about others lord ronald answered i can only answer for myself  his last words were almost whispered in the girls ears but she only shrugged her shoulders and did not return his gaze their host who had been watching them frowned slightly he was beginning to think that engleton was scarcely as pleasant a fellow as he had thought him  well he said miss le mesurier will find out in time who are really her friends  it is a safe plan major forrest remarked and a pleasant one to believe in everybody until they want something from you then is the time for distrust  jeanne sighed  and by that time perhaps she said ones affections are hopelessly engaged i think that it is a very difficult world  the princess shrugged her shoulders  three months she remarked is not a long time wait my dear child until you have at least lived through a single season before you commit yourself to any final opinions  their host intervened he was beginning to find the conversation dull he was far more interested in another matter  let us talk about that visit he said to the princess i do wish that you could make up your mind to come of course i havent any amusements to offer you but you could rest as thoroughly as you like they say that the air is the finest in england there is always bridge you know for the evenings and if miss jeanne likes bathing my gardens go down to the beach  it sounds delightful the princess said and exactly what we want we have a good many invitations but i have not cared to accept any of them for i do not think that jeanne would care much for the life at an ordinary country house i myself she continued with perfect truth am not squeamish but the last houseparty i was at was certainly not the place for a very young girl  make up your mind then and say yes cecil de la borne pleaded  you shall hear from us within the next few days the princess answered i really believe that we shall come  the little party left the restaurant a few minutes later on their way into the foyer for coffee the princess contrived to pass out with forrest as her companion  i think she said under her breath that this is the best opportunity you could possibly have we shall be quite alone down there and perhaps it would be as well that you were out of london for a few weeks if it does not come to anything we can easily make an excuse to get away  forrest nodded  but who is this young man de la borne he asked i dont mean that i know who he is of course but why should he invite perfect strangers to stay with him  the princess smiled faintly  cant you see she answered that he is simply a silly boy he is only twentyfour years old and i think that he cannot have seen much of the world he told me that he had just been abroad for the first time he fancies that he is a little in love with me and he is dazzled of course by the idea of jeannes fortune he wants to play the host to us let him i should be glad enough to get away for a few weeks if only to escape from these pestering letters i do think that ones tradespeople might let one alone until the end of the season  forrest who was feeling a good deal braver since dinner on the whole favoured the idea  i do not see he remarked why it should not work out very well indeed there will be nothing to do in the evenings except to play bridge and no one to interfere  besides which the princess remarked you will be out of london for a few weeks and i dare say that if you keep away from the clubs for a time and lose a few rubbers when you get back your little trouble may blow over  i suppose forrest remarked thoughtfully this young de la borne has no people living with him guardians or that sort of thing  no one of any account the princess answered his father and mother are both dead i am afraid though he will not be of any use to you for from what i can hear he is quite poor however engleton ought to be quite enough if we can keep him in the humour for playing  ask him a few more questions about the place forrest said if it seems all right i should like to start as soon as possible  they had their coffee at a little table in the foyer which was already crowded with people their conversation was often interrupted by the salutations of passing acquaintances jeanne alone looked about her with any interest to the others this sort of thingthe music of the redcoated band the flowers and the passing throngs of people the handsomest and the weariest crowd in the worldwere only part of the treadmill of life  by the by mr de la borne the princess asked how much longer are you going to stay in london  i must go back tomorrow or the next day the young man answered a little gloomily i shant mind it half so much if you people only make up your minds to pay me that visit  the princess motioned to him to draw his chair a little nearer to hers  if we take this tour at all she remarked i should like to start the day after tomorrow there is a perfectly hideous function on thursday which i should so like to miss and the stupidest dinnerparty on earth at night should you be home by then do you think  if there were any chance of your coming at all the young man answered eagerly i should leave by the first train tomorrow morning  i think the princess declared softly that we will come dont think me rude if i say that we could not possibly be more bored than we are in london i do not want to take jeanne to any of the country houseparties we have been invited to you know why she really is such a child and i am afraid that if she gets any wrong ideas about things she may want to go back to the convent she has hinted at it more than once already  there will be nothing of that sort at salthouse cecil de la borne declared eagerly you see i shant have any guests at all except just yourselves dont you think that would be best  i do indeed the princess assented and mind you are not to make any special preparations for us for my part i simply want a little rest before we go abroad again and we really want to come to you feeling the same way that one leaves ones home for lodgings in a farmhouse you will understand this wont you cecil she added earnestly laying her fingers upon his arm or we shall not come  it shall be just as you say he answered as a matter of fact the red hall is little more than a large farmhouse and there is very little preparation which i could make for you in a day or a day and a half you shall come and see how a poor english countryman lives whose lands and income have shrivelled up together if you are dull you will not blame me i know for all that you have to do is to go away  the princess rose and put out her hand  it is settled then she declared thank you dear mr host for your very delightful dinner jeanne and i have to go on to harlingham house for an hour or two the last of these terrible entertainments i am glad to say do send me a note round in the morning with the exact name of your house and some idea of the road we must follow so that we do not get lost i suppose you two she added turning to forrest and lord ronald will not mind starting a day or two before we had planned  not in the least they assured her  and miss le mesurier cecil de la borne asked will she really not mind giving up some of these wonderful entertainments  jeanne smiled upon him brilliantly it was a smile which came so seldom and which when it did come transformed her face so utterly that she seemed like a different person  i shall be very glad indeed she said to leave london i am looking forward so much to seeing what the english country is like  it will make me very happy cecil de la borne said bowing over her hand to try and show you  her eyes seemed to pass through him to look out of the crowded room as though indeed they had found their way into some corner of the world where the things which make life lie it was a lapse from which she recovered almost immediately but when she looked at him and with a little farewell nod withdrew her hand the transforming gleam had passed away  and there is the sea too she remarked looking backwards as they passed out i am longing to see that again     chapter iii   perhaps there was never a moment in the lives of these two men when their utter and radical dissimilarity physically as well as in the larger ways was more strikingly and absolutely manifest like a great sea animal huge blackbearded bronzed magnificent but uncouth andrew de la borne in the oilskins and overalls of a village fisherman stood in the great bare hall in front of the open fireplace reckless of his drippings at first only mildly amused by the half cynical half angry survey of the very elegant young man who had just descended the splendid oak staircase with its finely carved balustrade black and wormeaten cecil de la borne stared at his brother with the angry disgust of one whose sense of all that is holiest stands outraged slim of graceful though somewhat undersized figure he was conscious of having attained perfection in matters which he reckoned of no small importance his grey tweed suit fitted him like a glove his tie was a perfect blend between the colour of his eyes and his clothes his shoes were of immaculate shape and polish his socks had been selected with care in the rue de la paix his hair was brushed until it shone with the proper amount of polish his nails were perfectly manicured even his cigarette came from the dealer whose wares were the caprice of the moment that his complexion was pallid and that underneath his eyes were faint blue lines which were certainly not the hallmarks of robust health disturbed him not at all these things were correct health was by no means a desideratum in the set to which he was striving to belong he looked through his eyeglass at his brother and groaned  really andrew he said calmly but with an undernote of anger trembling in his tone i am surprised to see you like this you might i think have had a little more consideration cant you realize what a sight you are and what a mess youre making  andrew took off his cap and shook it so that a little shower of salt water splashed on to the polished floor  never mind cecil he said goodhumouredly youve all the deportment thats necessary in this family and salt water doesnt stain these boards have been washed with it many a time  the young mans face lost none of his irritation  but what on earth have you been doing he exclaimed where have you been to get in a state like that  andrews face was suddenly overcast it did not please him to think of those last few hours  i had to go out to bring a mad woman home he said kate caynsard was out in her catboat a day like this it was suicide if i hadnt reached her in time  youdid reach her in time the young man asked quickly  andrew turned to face the questioner and the eyes of the brothers met again the differences between them seemed to be suddenly and marvellously accentuated andrews cheeks bronzed and hardened with a life spent wholly out of doors were glistening still with the salt water which dripped down from his hair and hung in sparkling globules from his beard cecil was paler than ever there was something almost furtive in that swift insistent look perhaps he recognized something of what was in the others mind at any rate the goodnature left his mannerhis tone took to itself a sterner note  i came back he said grimly i should not have come back alone she was hard to save too he added after a moments pause  she is mad cecil muttered a queer lot all the caynsards  she is as sane as you or i his brother answered she does rash things and she chooses to treat her life as though it were a matter of no consequence she took a fifty to one chance at the bar and she nearly lost but by heaven you should have seen her bring my little boat down the creek with the tide swelling and a squall right down on the top of us it was magnificent cecil  well  why does kate caynsard treat her life as though it were of less value than the mackerel she lowers her line for do you know  the younger man dropped his eyeglass and shrugged his shoulders contemptuously  since when he demanded have i shown any inclination to play the village lothario thick ankles and robust health have never appealed to mei prefer the sicklier graces of civilization  kate caynsard andrew said thoughtfully is not of the villagers she leads their life but her birth is better on her fathers side at any rate than our own  if i might be allowed to make the suggestion cecil said regarding his brother with supercilious distaste dont you think it would be just as well to change your clothes before our guests arrive  why should i andrea asked calmly  they are not my friends i scarcely know even their names i entertain them at your request why should i be ashamed of my oilskins they are in accord with the life i live here i make no pretence you see cecil he added with a faintly amused smile at being an ornamental member of society  his brother regarded him with something very much like disgust  no he said sarcastically no one could accuse you of that  something in his tone seemed to suggest to andrew a new idea he looked down at the clothes he wore beneath his oilskinsthe clothes almost of a working man he glanced for a moment at his hands hardened and blistered with the actual toil which he lovedand he looked his brother straight in the face  cecil he said i believe youre ashamed of me  of course i am the younger man answered brutally its your own fault you choose to make a fisherman or a labouring man of yourself i havent seen you in a decent suit of clothes for years you wont dress for dinner your hands and skin are like a ploughboys and dn it all youre my elder brother ive got to introduce you to my friends as the head of the de la bornes and practically their host no wonder i dont like it  there was a moments silence if his words hurt andrew made no sign with a shrug of the shoulders he turned towards the staircase  there is no reason he remarked carelessly enough why i should inflict the humiliation of my presence on you or on your friends i am going down to the island you shall entertain your friends and play the host to your hearts content it will be more comfortable for both of us  cecil prided himself upon a certain impassivity of features and manner which some fin de siecle oracle of the cities had pronounced good form but he was not wholly able to conceal his relief such an arrangement was entirely to his liking it solved the situation satisfactorily in more ways than one  its a thundering good idea andrew if youre sure youll be comfortable there he declared i dont believe you would get on with my friends a bit theyre not your sort seems like turning you out of your own house though  it is of no consequence andrew said coldly i shall be perfectly comfortable  you see cecil continued theyre not keen on sport at all and you dont play bridge  andrew had already disappeared cecil turned back into the hall and lit a cigarette  phew what a relief he muttered to himself if only he has the sense to keep away all the time  he rang the bell which was answered by a butler newly imported from town  clear away all this mess james cecil ordered pointing in disgust to the wet places upon the floor and the still dripping southwester and serve tea here in an hour or directly my friends arrivetea and whisky and soda and liqueurs you know with sandwiches and things  i will do my best sir the man answered the kitchen arrangements are a littlebehind the times if i might venture to say so  i know i know cecil answered irritably the place has been allowed to go on anyhow while i was away do what you can and let them know outside that they must make room for one or perhaps two automobiles  upstairs andrew was rapidly throwing a few things together with an odd little laugh he threw into the bottom of a wardrobe an unopened parcel of new clothes and a dress suit which had been carefully brushed in less than twenty minutes he had left the house by the back way with a small portmanteau poised easily upon his massive shoulders as he turned from the long illkept avenue with its straggling windsmitten trees all exposed to the tearing ocean gales into the high road a great automobile swung round the corner and slackened speed major forrest leaned out and addressed him  can you tell me if this is the red hall my manmr de la bornes place he asked  andrew nodded without a glance at the veiled and shrouded women who were leaning forward to hear his answer  the next avenue is the front way he said mind how you turn inthe corner is rather sharp  he spoke purposely in broad norfolk and passed on  what a goliath engleton remarked  i should like to sketch him the princess drawled his shoulders were magnificent  but neither of them had any idea that they had spoken with the owner of the red hall     chapter iv   about halfway through dinner that night cecil de la borne drew a long sigh of relief at last his misgivings were set at rest his party was going to be was already in fact pronounced a success a glance at his fair neighbour however who was lighting her third or fourth russian cigarette since the caviare sent a shiver of thankfulness through his whole being what a sensible fellow andrew had been to clear out this sort of thing would not have appealed to him at all  my dear cecil the princess declared i call this perfectly delightful jeanne and i have wanted so much to see you in your own home jeanne isnt this nicer ever so much nicer than anything you had imagined  jeanne who was sitting opposite lifted her remarkable eyes and glanced around with interest  yes she admitted i think that it is but then any place that looks in the least like a home is a delightful change after all that rushing about in london  i agree with you entirely major forrest declared if our friend has disappointed us at all it is in the absence of that primitiveness which he led us to expect one perceives that one is drinking veuve clicquot of a vintage year and one suspects the nationality of our hosts cook  you can have all the primitivism you want if you look out of the windows cecil remarked drily you will see nothing but a line of stunted trees and behind miles of marshes and the greyest sea which ever played upon the land listen you dont hear a sound like that in the cities  even as he spoke they heard the dull roar of the north wind booming across the wild empty places which lay between the red hall and the sea a storm of raindrops was flung against the window the princess shivered  it is an idyll the last word in the refining of sensations major forrest declared you give us sybaritic luxury and in order that we shall realize it you provide the background of savagery in the carlton one might dine like this and accept it as a matter of course appreciation is forced upon us by these suggestions of the wilderness without  not all without either cecil de la borne remarked raising his eyeglass and pointing to the walls see where my ancestors frown down upon usyou can only just distinguish their bare shapes no de la borne has had money enough to have them renovated or even preserved they have eaten their way into the canvases and the canvases into the very walls you see the empty spaces too a reynolds and a gainsboro have been cut out from there and sold i can show you long empty galleries pictureless and without a scrap of furniture we have ghosts like rats rooms where the curtains and tapestries are falling to pieces from sheer decay oh i can assure you that our primitivism is not wholly external  he turned from the princess who was not greatly interested to find that for once he had succeeded in riveting the attention of the girl whose general attitude towards him and the whole world seemed to be one of barely tolerant indifference  i should like to see over your house mr de la borne she said it all sounds very interesting  i am afraid he answered that your interest would not survive very long we have no treasures left nor anything worth looking at for generations the de la bornes have stripped their house and sold their lands to hold their own in the world i am the last of my race and there is nothing left for me to sell he declared with a momentary bitterness  hadnt youa half brother the princess asked  cecil hesitated for a moment he had drifted so easily into the position of head of the house it was so natural he felt that he filled the place so perfectly  i have he admitted but he counts i am sorry to say for very little you are never likely to come across himnor any other civilized person  there was a subtle indication in his tone of a desire not to pursue the subject his guests naturally respected it there was a moments silence then cecil once more leaned forward he hesitated for a moment even after his lips had parted as though for some reason he were inclined after all to remain silent but the consciousness that every one was looking at him and expecting him to speak induced him to continue with what after all he had suddenly and for no explicit reason hesitated to say  you spoke miss le mesurier he began of looking over the house and as i told you there is very little in it worth seeing and yet i can show you something not in the house itself but connected with it which you might find interesting  the princess leaned forward in her chair  this sounds so interesting she murmured what is it cecil a haunted chamber  their host shook his head  something far more tangible he answered although in its way quite as remarkable hundreds of years ago smuggling on this coast was not only a means of livelihood for the poor but the diversion of the rich i had an ancestor who became very notorious his name seems to have been a byword although he was never caught or if he was caught never punished he built a subterranean way underneath the grounds leading from the house right to the mouth of one of the creeks the passage still exists with great cellars for storing smuggled goods and a room where the smugglers used to meet  jeanne looked at him with parted lips  you can show me this she asked the passage and the cellars  cecil nodded  i can he answered quite a weird place it is too the walls are damp and the cellars themselves are like the vaults of a cathedral all the time at high tide you can hear the sea thundering over your head tomorrow if you like we will get torches and explore them  i should love to jeanne declared can you get out now at the other end  cecil nodded  the passage he said starts from a room which was once the library and ends halfway up the only little piece of cliff there is it is about thirty feet from the ground but they had a sort of apparatus for pulling up the barrels and a rope ladder for the men the preventive officers would see the boat come up the creek and would march down from the village only to find it empty of course they suspected all the time where the things went but they could not prove it and as my ancestor was a magistrate and an important man they did not dare to search the house  the princess sighed gently  those were the days she murmured in which it must have been worth while to live things happened then today your ancestor would simply have been called a thief  as a matter of fact cecil remarked i do not think that he himself benefited a penny by any of his exploits it was simply the love of adventure which led him into it  even if he did major forrest remarked that same predatory instinct is alive today in another guise the whole world is preying upon one another we are thieves all of us to the tips of our fingernails only our roguery is conducted with due regard to the law  the princess smiled faintly as she glanced across the table at the speaker  i am afraid she said with a little sigh that you are right i do not think that we have really improved with the centuries my own ancestors sacked towns and held the inhabitants to ransom today i sit down to bridge opposite a man with a wellfilled purse and my one idea is to lighten it nothing i am convinced but the fear of being found out keeps us reasonably moral  if we go on talking like this lord ronald remarked we shall make miss le mesurier nervous she will feel that we and the whole of the rest of the world have our eyes upon her moneybags  i am absolutely safe jeanne answered smiling i do not play bridge and even my signature would be of no use to any one yet  but you might imagine us lord ronald continued waiting around breathlessly until the happy time arrived when you were of age and we could pursue our diabolical schemes  jeanne shook her head  you cannot frighten me lord ronald she said i feel safe from every one i am only longing for tomorrow for a chance to explore this wonderful subterranean passage  i am afraid their host remarked that you will be disappointed with the passing of smuggling the romance of the thing seems to have died there is nothing now to look at but mouldy walls a bare room and any amount of the most hideous fungi i can promise you that when you have been there for a few minutes your only desire will be to escape  i am not so sure the girl answered i think that associations always have an effect on me i can imagine how one might wait there near the entrance hear the soft swish of the oars look down and see the smugglers hear perhaps the muffled tramp of men marching from the village fancy how breathless it must have been the excitement the fear of being caught  cecil curled his slight moustache dubiously  if you can feel all that in my little bit of underground world he said i shall think that you are even a more wonderful person  he dropped his voice and leaned toward her but jeanne laughed in his face and interrupted him  people who own things she remarked never look upon them with proper reverence dont you see that my mother is dying for some bridge     chapter v   the princess was only obeying a faint sign from forrest she leaned forward and addressed her host  it isnt a bad idea she declared where are we going to play bridge cecil in some smaller room i hope this one is really beginning to get on my nerves a little there is an ancestor exactly opposite who has fixed me with a luminous and a disapproving eye and the blank spaces on the wall ugh i feel like a goth we are too modern for this place cecil  their host laughed as he rose and turned towards jeanne  your mother he said is beginning to be conscious of her environment i know exactly how she is feeling for i myself am a constant sufferer are you too sighing for the gilded salons of civilization  not in the least jeanne answered frankly i am tired of mirrors and electric lights and babble i prefer our present surroundings and i should not mind at all if some of those disapproving ancestors of yours stepped out of their frames and took their places with us here  cecil laughed  if they have been listening to our conversation he said i think that they will stay where they are like royalty he continued we can boast an octagonal chamber i fear that its glories are of the past but it is at least small and the wallpaper is modern i have ordered coffee and the cardtables there shall we go  he led the way out of the gloomy room chilly and bare yet in a way magnificent still with its reminiscences of past splendour across the hall modernized with rugs and recent furnishing into a smaller apartment where cheerfulness reigned a wood fire burnt in an open grate lamps and a fine candelabrum gave a sufficiency of light the furniture though old was graceful and of french design it had been the sitting chamber of the ladies of the de la borne family for generations and it bore traces of its gentler occupation one thing alone remained of primevalism to remind them of their closer contact with the great forces of nature the chamber was built in the tower which stood exposed to the sea and the roar of the wind was ceaseless  here at least we shall be comfortable i think cecil remarked as they all entered my frescoes are faded but they represent flowers not faces there are no eyes to stare at you from out of the walls here princess  the princess laughed gaily as she seated herself before a louis quinze cardtable and threw a pack of cards across the faded green baize cloth  it is charming this she declared shall we challenge these two boys nigel you are the only man who understands my leads and who does not scold me for my declarations  i am perfectly willing forrest answered smoothly shall we cut for deal  cecil de la borne leaned over and turned up a card  i am quite content he remarked what do you say engleton  engleton hesitated for a moment the princess turned and looked at him he was standing upon the hearthrug smoking his face as expressionless as ever  let us cut for partners he drawled i am afraid of the princess and forrest the last time i found them a quite invincible couple  there was a moments silence the princess glanced toward forrest who only shrugged his shoulders  just as you will he answered  he turned up an ace and the princess a three  after all he remarked with a smile it seems as though fate were going to link us together  i am not so sure cecil de la borne said also throwing down an ace it depends now upon engleton  engleton came to the table and drew a card at random from the pack forrests eyes seemed to narrow a little as he looked down at it engleton had drawn another ace  forrest and i he remarked jolly low cutting too i have played against you often forrest but i think this is our first rubber together heres good luck to us  he tossed off his liqueur and sat down they cut again for deal and the game proceeded  jeanne had moved across towards the window and laid her fingers upon the heavy curtains cecil de la borne who was dummy got up and stood by her side  do you know she said although your frescoes are flowers i feel that there are eyes in this room too only that they are looking in from the night can one see the sea from here mr de la borne  it is scarcely a hundred yards away he answered this window looks straight across the german ocean and if you look long enough you will see the white of the breakers listen you will hear too what my forefathers and those who begat them have heard from the birth of the generations  the girl with strained face stood looking out into the darkness outside the wind and sea imposed their thunder upon the land within there was no sound but the softer patter of the cards the languid voices of the four who played bridge a curious little company on the whole the princess of strurm whose birth was as sure as her social standing was doubtful the heroine of countless scandals ignored by the great heads of her family impoverished living no one knew how yet remaining the legal guardian of a stepdaughter who was reputed to be one of the greatest heiresses in europe the courts had moved to have her set aside and failed a cardinal of her late husbands faith empowered to treat with her on behalf of his relations offered a fortune for her cession of jeanne and was laughed at for his pains whatever her life had been she remained custodian of the child of the great banker whom she had married late in life she endured calmly the threats the entreaties the bribes of jeannes own relations jeanne she was determined should enter life under her wing and hers only in the end she had her way jeanne was entering life now not through the respectable but somewhat bourgeois avenue by which her great monied relatives would have led her but under the auspices of her stepmother whose position as chaperon to a great heiress had already thrown open a great many doors which would have been permanently closed to her in any other guise the princess herself was always consistent she assumed to herself an arrogant right to do as she pleased and live as she pleased she was of the house of strurm which had been noble for centuries and had connections with royalty that was enough a few forgot her past and admitted her claim those who did not she ignored  then there was lord ronald engleton an orphan brought up in paris a wouldbe decadent a dabbler in all modern iniquities redeemed from folly only by a certain not altogether wholesome cleverness yet with a disposition which sometimes gained for him friends in most unlikely quarters he had excellent qualities which he did his best to conceal impulses which he was continually stifling  by his side sat forrest the sphynx more than middleaged a man who had wandered all over the world who had tried many things without ever achieving prosperity and who was searching always with tired eyes for some new method of clothing and feeding himself upon an income of less than nothing a year he had met the princess at marienbad years ago and silently took his place in her suite why no one seemed to know not even at first the princess herself who thought him chic and adored what she could not understand curious flotsam and jetsam these four of society which had something of a continental flavour personages every one of them with claim to recognition but without any noticeable hallmark  there remained the girl jeanne herself half behind the curtain now her head thrust forward her beautiful eyes contracted with the effort to penetrate that veil of darkness one gift at least she seemed to have borrowed from the woman who gambled with life as easily and readily as with the cards which fell from her jewelled fingers in her face although it was still the face of a child there was the same inscrutable expression the same calm languor of one who takes and receives what life offers with the indifference of the cynic or the imperturbability of the philosopher there was little of the joy or the anticipation of youth there and yet behind the eyes as they looked out into the darkness there was somethingsome such effort perhaps as one seeking to penetrate the darkness of life must needs show and as she looked the white living breakers gradually resolved themselves out of the dark thin filmy phosphorescence and the roar of the lashed sea broke like thunder upon the pebbled beach she leaned a little more forward carried away with her fancythat the shrill grinding of the pebbles was indeed the scream of human voices in pain     chapter vi   with the coming of dawn the storm passed away northwards across a sea snowflecked and still panting with its fury and leaving behind many traces of its violence even upon these waste and empty places a lurid sunrise gave little promise of better weather but by six oclock the wind had fallen and the full tide was swelling the creeks on a sandbank far down amongst the marshes jeanne stood hatless with her hair streaming in the breeze her face turned seaward her eyes full of an unexpected joy everywhere she saw traces of the havoc wrought in the night the tall rushes lay broken and prostrate upon the ground the beach was strewn with timber from the breaking up of an ancient wreck eyes more accustomed than hers to the outline of the country could have seen inland dismantled cottages and unroofed sheds groups of still frightened and restive cattle a snapped flagstaff a fallen tree but jeanne knew none of these things her face was turned towards the ocean and the rising sun she felt the sting of the sea wind upon her cheeks all the nameless exhilaration of the early morning sweetness far out seaward the long breakers snowflecked and white crested came rolling in with a long monotonous murmur toward the land above the grey sky was changing into blue almost directly over her head rising higher and higher in little circles a lark was singing jeanne half closed her eyes and stood still engrossed by the unexpected beauty of her surroundings then suddenly a voice came travelling to her from across the marshes  she turned round unwillingly and with a vague feeling of irritation against this interruption which seemed to her so inopportune and in turning round she realized at once that her period of absorption must have lasted a good deal longer than she had had any idea of she had walked straight across the marshes towards the little hillock on which she stood but the way by which she had come was no longer visible the swelling tide had circled round through some unseen channel and was creeping now into the land by many creeks and narrow ways she herself was upon an island cut off from the dry land by a smoothly flowing tidal way more than twenty yards across along it a man in a flatbottomed boat was punting his way towards her she stood and waited for him admiring his height and the long powerful strokes with which he propelled his clumsy craft he was very tall and against the flat background his height seemed almost abnormal as soon as he had attracted her attention he ceased to shout and devoted all his attention to reaching her quickly nevertheless the salt water was within a few feet of her when he drove his pole into the bottom and brought the punt to a momentary standstill she looked down at him smiling  shall i get in she asked  unless you are thinking of swimming back he answered drily it would be as well  she lifted her skirts a little and laughed at the inappropriateness of her thin shoes and openwork stockings andrew de la borne held out his strong hand and she sprang lightly on to the broad seat  it is very nice of you she said with her slight foreign accent to come and fetch me should i have been drowned  no he answered as a matter of fact the spot where you were standing is not often altogether submerged you might have been a prisoner for a few hours perhaps as the tide is going to be high your feet would have been wet but there was no danger  she settled down as comfortably as possible in the awkward seat  after all then she said this is not a real adventure where are you going to take me to  i can only take you he answered to the village i suppose you came from the hall  yes she answered i walked straight across from the gate i never thought about the tide coming up here  you will have to walk back by the road he answered it is a good deal further round but there is no other way  she hung her hand over the side rejoicing in the touch of the cool soft water  that she answered does not matter at all it is very early still and i do not fancy that any one will be up yet for several hours  he made no further attempt at conversation devoting himself entirely to the task of steering and propelling his clumsy craft along the narrow way she found herself watching him with some curiosity it had never occurred to her to doubt at first but that he was some fisherman from the village for he wore a rough jersey and a pair of trousers tucked into seaboots his face was bronzed and his hands were large and brown nevertheless she saw that his features were good and his voice though he spoke the dialect of the country had about it some quality which she was not slow to recognize  who are you she asked a little curiously do you live in the village  he looked down at her with a faint smile  i live in the village he answered and my name is andrew  are you a fisherman she asked  certainly he answered gravely we are all fishermen here  she was not altogether satisfied he spoke to her easily and without any sort of embarrassment his words were civil enough and yet he had more the air of one addressing an equal than a villager who is able to be of service to some one in an altogether different social sphere  it was very fortunate for me she said that you saw me are you up at this hour every morning  generally he answered i was thinking of fishing higher up in the reaches there  i am sorry she said that i spoiled your sport  he did not answer at once he in his turn was looking at her in her tailormade gown short and fashionably cut her silk stockings and highheeled shoes she certainly seemed far indeed removed from any of the women of those parts her dark hair was arranged after a fashion that was strange to him her delicately pale skin her deep grey eyes and unusually scarlet lips were all indications of her foreign extraction he looked at her long and searchingly this was the girl then whom his brother was hoping to marry  you are not english he remarked a little abruptly  she shook her head  my father was a portuguese she said and my mother french i was born in england though you i suppose have lived here all your life  all my life he repeated we villagers you see have not much opportunity for travel  but i am not sure she said looking at him a little doubtfully that you are a villager  i can assure you he answered that there is no doubt whatever about it can you see out yonder a little house on the island there  she followed his outstretched finger  of course i can she answered is that your home  he nodded  i am there most of my time he answered  it looks charming she said a little doubtfully but isnt it lonely  he shrugged his shoulders  perhaps he answered i am only ten minutes sail from the mainland though  she looked again at the house long and low with its plaster walls bare of any creeping thing  it must be rather fascinating she admitted to live upon an island are you married  no he answered  do you mean that you live quite alone she asked  he smiled down upon her as one might smile at an inquisitive child i have a sersome one to look after me he said except for that i am quite alone i am going to set you ashore here you see those telegraph posts that is the road which leads direct to the hall  she was still looking at the island watching the waves break against a little stretch of pebbly beach  i should like very much she said to see that house can you not take me out there  he shook his head  we could not get so far in this punt he said and my sailing boat is up at the village quay more than a mile away  she frowned a little she was not used to having any request of hers disregarded  could we not go to the village she asked and change into your boat  he shook his head  i am going fishing he said in a different direction allow me  he stepped on to land and lifted her out she hesitated for a moment and felt for her purse  you must let me recompense you she said coldly for the time you have lost in coming to my assistance  he looked down at her and again she had an uncomfortable sense that notwithstanding his rude clothes and country dialect this man was no ordinary villager he said nothing however until she produced her purse and held out a little tentatively two halfcrowns  you are very kind he said i will take one if you will allow me that is quite sufficient you see the hall behind the trees there you cannot miss your way i think and if you will take my advice you will not wander about in the marshes here except at high tide the sea comes in to the most unexpected places and very quickly too sometimes good morning  good morning and thank you very much she answered turning away toward the road        cecil de la borne was standing at the end of the drive when she appeared a telescope in his hand he came hastily down the road to meet her a very slim and elegant figure in his wellcut flannel clothes smoothly brushed hair and irreproachable tie  my dear miss jeanne he exclaimed i have only just heard that you were out do you generally get up in the middle of the night  she smiled a little halfheartedly it was curious that she found herself contrasting for a moment this very elegant young man with her roughly dressed companion of a few minutes ago  to meet with an adventure such as i have had she answered i would never go to bed at all i have been nearly drowned and rescued by a most marvellous person he brought me back to safety in a flatbottomed punt and i am quite sure from the way he stared at them that he had never seen openwork stockings before  are you in earnest cecil asked doubtfully  absolutely she answered i was walking there among the marshes and i suddenly found myself surrounded by the sea the tide had come up behind me without my noticing a most mysterious person came to my rescue he wore the clothes of a fisherman and he accepted half a crown but i have my doubts about him even now he said that his name was mr andrew  cecil opened the gate and they walked up towards the house a slight frown had appeared upon his forehead  do you know him she asked  i know who he is he answered he is a queer sort of fellow lives all alone and is a bit cranky they say come in and have some breakfast i dont suppose that any one else will be down for ages  she shook her head  i will send my woman down for some coffee she answered i am going upstairs to change i am just a little wet and i must try and find some thicker shoes  cecil sighed  one sees so little of you he murmured and i was looking forward to a teteatete breakfast  she shook her head as she left him in the hall  i couldnt think of it she declared ill appear with the others later on please find out all you can about mr andrew and tell me  cecil turned away and his face grew darker as he crossed the hall  if andrew interferes this time he muttered there will be trouble     chapter vii   the princess appeared for luncheon and declared herself to be in a remarkably good humour  my dear cecil she said helping herself to an ortolan in aspic i like your climate and i like your chef i had my window open for at least ten minutes and the sea air has given me quite an appetite i have serious thoughts of embracing the simple life  you could scarcely cecil de la borne answered come to a better place for your first essay i will guarantee that life is sufficiently simple here for any one i have no neighbours no society to offer you no distractions of any sort still i warned you before you came  dont be absurd the princess declared you have the sea almost at your front door and i adore the sea if you have a nice large boat i should like to go for a sail  cecil looked at her with upraised eyebrows  if you are serious he said no doubt we can find the boat  i am absolutely serious the princess declared i feel that this is exactly what my system required i should like to sit in a comfortable cushioned seat and sail somewhere if possible i should like you men to catch things from the side of the boat  you will get sunburnt lord ronald remarked drily perhaps even freckled  adorable the princess declared a touch of sunburn would be quite becoming it is such an excellent foundation to build a complexion upon jeanne is quite enchanted with the place shes had adventures already and been rescued from drowning by a marvellous person who wore his trousers tucked into his boots and found fault with her shoes and stockings she has promised to show me the place after luncheon and i am going to stand there myself and see if anything happens  you will get your feet very wet cecil declared  and sand inside your shoes forrest remarked  these the princess declared are trifles compared with the delightful sensation of experiencing a real adventure in any case we must sail one afternoon cecil i insist upon it we will not play bridge until after dinner my luck last night was abominable oh you neednt look at me like that she added to cecil i know i won but that was an accident i had bad cards all the time and i only won because you others had worse please ring the bell mr host and see about the boat  really cecil remarked as he called the butler and gave him some instructions i had no idea that i was going to entertain such enterprising guests  oh there are lots of things i mean to do the princess declared i am seriously thinking of going shrimping i suppose there are shrimps here and i should love to tuck up my skirts and carry a big net like somebodys picture  perhaps cecil suggested you would like to try the golf links i believe there are some quite decent ones not far away  the princess shook her head  no she answered golf is too civilized a game we will go out in a fishing boat with plenty of cushions and we will try to catch fish i know that jeanne will love it and that you others will hate it between the two of you it should be amusing  very well cecil declared with an air of resignation whatever happens will be upon your own shoulders there is a boat in the village which we can have i will have it brought up to our own quay in an hours time if the worst comes to the worst and we are bored to death we can play bridge on the way  there will be no cards upon the boat the princess declared decidedly i forbid them we are going to lounge and look at the sea and get sunburnt jeanne can wear a veil if she likes i shall not  cecil shrugged his shoulders  very well he said whatever happens dont blame me        the princess had her way and behaved like a schoolgirl she sat in the most comfortable place surrounded with a multitude of cushions with her tiny japanese spaniel in her arms and a box of french bonbons by her side jeanne stood in the bows bareheaded and happy lord ronald who was feeling a little seasick sat at her feet  i had no idea he remarked plaintively that your mother was capable of such crudities if i had known i certainly would not have trusted myself to such a party this sea air is hateful it has tarnished my cigarettecase already and ones nails will not be fit to be seen to be out of doors like this is worse than drinking unfiltered water  jeanne smiled down at him a little contemptuously  you are a child of the cities lord ronald she remarked next year i am going to buy a yacht myself but i shall not ask you to come with us  lord ronald groaned  that is the worst of all heiresses he said you have such queer tastes i shall never summon up my courage to propose to you  there is always leap year jeanne reminded him  what a bewildering suggestion he murmured looking uncomfortably over the side of the boat i say forrest what do you think of this sort of thing  idyllic forrest declared cynically to sit upon a hard plank and to have ones digestion unmercifully interfered with like this is unqualified rapture if only there were cabins one might sleep  there will be cabins on my yacht jeanne declared laughing but i shall not ask either of you you are both of you knights of the candle light i shall get some great strong fisherman to be captain and i shall go round the world and forget the days and the months  forrest shivered slightly  the country he remarked to the princess is having a terrible effect upon your stepdaughter  the princess nodded and thrust a bonbon into the languid jaws of the dog she was holding  it is my fault she declared it is i who have set this fashion it was a whim and i am tired of it tell our host that we will go back  they tacked a few minutes later and swept shoreward jeanne still standing in the bows was gazing steadfastly upon the little island at the entrance of the estuary  i should like she declared pointing it out to cecil to land there and have some tea  cecil looked at her doubtfully  we shall be home in a little more than an hour he said and i dont suppose we could get any tea there even if we were able to land  i have a conviction that we should jeanne declared mother she added turning round to the older woman there is an island just ahead of us with a delightful looking cottage i believe my preserver of this morning lives there wouldnt it be lovely to go and beg him to give us all tea  charming the princess declared sitting up amongst her cushions i should love to see him and tea is the one thing in the world i want to make me happy  cecil de la borne stood silent for a moment or two looking steadfastly at the whitewashed cottage upon the island it seemed impossible after all to escape from andrew  the man lives there alone i believe he said i dont suppose there is any one to get us tea he would only be embarrassed by our coming and not know what to do  jeanne smiled reflectively  i do not think she said that it would be easy to embarrass mr andrew however if you like we will put it off to another afternoon on one condition  let me hear the condition at any rate cecil asked  that we go straight back and that you show us that subterranean passage jeanne declared  agreed cecil answered i warn you that you will find it only damp and mouldy and depressing but you shall certainly see it  the girl moved toward the side of the boat and stood leaning over with her eyes fixed upon the island standing on the small grass plot in front of the cottage she could see the tall figure of a man with his face turned toward them a faint smile parted her lips as she watched she took out her handkerchief and waved it the man for a moment stood motionless and then raising his cap held it for a moment above his head the boat sped on and very soon they were out of sight she stood there however watching until they had rounded the sandy spit and entered the creek which led into the harbour there was something unusually piquant to her in the thought of that greeting with the man whose response to it had been so unwilling almost ungracious     chapter viii   not another step the princess declared i am going back at once  i too forrest declared your smuggling ancestors my dear de la borne must indeed have loved adventure if they spent much of their time crawling about here like rats  as you will cecil answered the expedition is miss jeannes not mine  and i am going on jeanne declared i want to see where we come out on the beach  this way then cecil said you need not be afraid to walk upright the roof is six feet high all the way you must tread carefully though there are plenty of holes and stones about  the princess and forrest disappeared jeanne with her skirts held high in one hand and an electric torch in the other followed cecil slowly along the gloomy way the walls were oozing with damp glistening patches like illuminated salt stains and queer fungi started out from unexpected places sometimes their footsteps fell on the rock awaking strange echoes down the gallery sometimes they sank deep into the sand cecil looked often behind and once held out his hand to help his companion over a difficult place at last he paused and she heard him struggling to turn a key in a great wormeaten door on their right  this is the room he explained where they held their meetings and where the stuff was hidden it was used for more than twenty years and the customs people never seemed to have had even an inkling of its existence  he pushed the door open with difficulty they found themselves in a gloomy chamber with vaulted roof and stone floor a faint streak of daylight from an opening somewhere in the roof partially lit the place here too the walls were damp and the odour appalling there were some fragments of broken barrels at one end and an oak table in the middle of the floor jeanne looked round and shivered  let us go on to the end she said  cecil nodded and they made their way on down the passage  the roof is getting lower now he said you had better stoop a little  she stopped short  what is that she asked fearfully  a sound like rolling thunder faint at first but growing more distinct at every step broke the chill silence of the place  the sea cecil answered we are getting near to the beach  jeanne nodded and crept on louder and louder the sound seemed to become until at last she paused half terrified  where are we she gasped it sounds as though the sea were right over our heads  cecil shook his head  it is an illusion he said the sound comes from the airhole there we are forty yards from the cliff still  they crept on until at last after a turn in the gallery they saw a faint glimmering of light a few more yards and they came to a standstill  the entrance is boarded up you see cecil said but you can see through the chinks there is the sea just below and the rope ladder used to hang from these staples  she looked out sheer below was the sea breaking upon the rocks and sending a torrent of spray into the air with every wave  we cant get out this way then she asked  he shook his head  no we should want a rope ladder he said and a boat have you seen enough  more than enough jeanne answered let us get back        jeanne sank into a garden seat a few minutes later with a little exclamation of relief  never she declared have i appreciated fresh air so much i think mr de la borne that smuggling though it was a very romantic profession must have had its unpleasant side  cecil nodded  there were more airholes in those days he said but our ancestors were a tougher race than we coarse brutes most of them i imagine he added lighting a cigarette drank beer for breakfast and smoked clay pipes before meals fancy if one had their constitutions and our tastes  the two would scarcely go together jeanne remarked but after all i should think that absinthe and cigarettes are more destructive i am dying for some tea let us go in and find the others  tea was set out in the hall but only engleton was there forrest and the princess were walking slowly up and down the avenue  i imagine the latter was saying drily that we are fairly free from eavesdroppers here now tell me what it is that you have to say nigel  i am bothered about engleton forrest said i didnt like his insisting upon cutting last night what do you think he meant by it  the princess shrugged her shoulders  nothing at all she answered he may have thought that we were lucky together and of course he knows that you are the best player there is no reason why he should be willing to play with cecil de la borne when by cutting with you he would be more likely to win  you think that that is all forrest asked  i think so the princess answered what had you in your mind  i wondered forrest said thoughtfully whether he had heard any of the gossip at the club  the princess frowned impatiently  for heavens sake dont be imaginative nigel she declared if you give way like this you will lose your nerve in no time  very well forrest said let us take it for granted then that he did it only because he preferred to play with me to playing against me what is to become of our little scheme if we cut as we did last night all the time  the princess smiled  you ought to be able to manage that she said carelessly you are so good at card tricks that you should be able to get an ace when you want it i always cut third from the end as you know  thats all very well forrest answered but we cant go on cutting two aces all the time i ran it pretty fine last night when for the second time i gave you a three or a four and drew a two myself but he seems to have the devils own luck they cut under us as you know  the princess looked up toward the house she had seen jeanne and cecil appear  those people are back from their underground pilgrimage she remarked have you anything definite to suggest if not we had better go in  there is only one way ena forrest said in which we could improve matters  and what is that she asked quickly  dont you think we could get our host in  the princess was silent for several moments  it is a little dangerous i am afraid she said  i dont see why forrest answered if he were once in hed have to hold his tongue and you can do just what you like with him he seems to me to be just one of those pulpy sort of persons whom you could persuade into a thing before he had had time to think about it  i will drop him a hint if you like the princess said thoughtfully and see how he takes it are you sure that the game is worth the candle  absolutely forrest answered eagerly i saw engleton drop two thousand playing baccarat one night and he never turned a hair i wasnt playing worse luck  if i can get cecil alone before dinner the princess said i will sound him i think we had better go back now we are a little old for romantic wanderings and the wind is beginning to disarrange my hair  see what you can do with him then forrest said as they retraced their steps ill call in and hear if youve anything to tell me on my way down for dinner  the princess nodded they entered the hall and cecil at once drew an easychair to the teatable  my good people the princess declared i am famished your sea air cecil is the most wonderful thing in the world for years i have not known what it was like to be hungry hot cakes please and jeanne please make my tea jeanne knows just how i like it tell us about the smugglers cave jeanne was it really so wonderful  jeanne laughed  it was very very weird and very smelly she said i think that you were wise to turn back     chapter ix   andrew came face to face with his brother in the village street on the next morning he looked at him for a moment in surprise  what have you been doing he asked drily sitting up all night  cecil nodded dejectedly  pretty well he admitted we played bridge till nearly five oclock  you lost i suppose andrew asked  yes i lost cecil admitted  your party andrew said does not seem to me to be an unqualified success  it is not cecil admitted miss le mesurier has been quite unapproachable the last few days shes just civil to me and no more she isnt even half as decent as she was in town i wish i hadnt asked them here its cost a lot more money than we can afford and done no good that i can see  andrew looked away seaward for a moment was it his fancy or was there indeed a slim white figure coming across the marshes from the hall  cecil he said are you quite sure that your guests are worth the trouble you have taken to entertain them i refer more particularly to the two men  they go everywhere cecil answered lord ronald is a bit of a wastrel of course and i am not very keen on forrest but we were all together when i gave the invitation and i couldnt leave them out  andrew nodded  well he said i should be careful how i played cards with forrest if i were you  cecils face grew even a shade paler  you do not think he muttered that he would do anything that wasnt straight  on the contrary andrew answered i have reason to believe that he would isnt that one of your guests coming you had better go and meet her  andrew passed on his way and cecil walked towards jeanne all the time though she was looking over his shoulder to where andrews tall figure was disappearing  what a nuisance she pouted i wanted to see mr andrew and directly i came in sight he hurried away  can i give him any message cecil asked with faint irony he will no doubt be up with the fish later in the day  she turned her back on him  i am going back to the house she said i did not come out here to walk with you  considering that i am your host he began  you lose your claim to consideration on that score when you remind me of it she answered really the only man who has not bored me for weeks is mr andrew you others are all the same you say the same things and you are always paving the way toward the same end i am tired of it stop  she turned suddenly round  i quite forgot she said i must go into the village after all i am going to send a telegram  they retraced their steps in silence as they entered the telegraphoffice andrew was just leaving and the postmistress was wishing him a respectful farewell he touched his hat as the two entered and stepped on one side jeanne however held out her hand  mr andrew she said i am so glad to see you i want to go out again in that great punt of yours please when can you take me  i am afraid andrew answered that i am rather busy just now i  he stopped short for something in her face perplexed him it was impossible for her of course to feel disappointment to that extent and yet she had all the appearance of a child about to cry he felt suddenly awkward and ill at ease  of course he said if you really care about it i should be very pleased to take you any morning toward the end of the week  tomorrow morning please she begged  he glanced towards his brother who shrugged his shoulders  if miss le mesurier is really inclined to go andrew the latter said i am sure that you will take good care of her perhaps some of us will come too  she nodded her farewells to andrew and turned back with her host toward the hall cecil looked at her a little curiously it was certain that she seemed in better spirits than a short time ago what a creature of caprices  will you tell me mr de la borne she asked why the postmistress called mr andrew sir if he is only a fisherman  habit i suppose cecil answered carelessly they call every one sir and maam  i am not so sure that it was habit she said thoughtfully i think that mr andrew is not quite what he represents himself to be no one who had not education and experience of nice people could behave quite as he does of course he is rough and brusque at times i know but then many men are like that  cecil did not reply a grey mist was sweeping in from the sea and jeanne shivered a little as they turned into the avenue  i wonder she said pensively why we came here my mother as a rule hates to go far from civilization and i am sure lord ronald is miserable  i think one reason why your mother brought you here cecil said slowly is because she wanted to give me a chance  she picked up her skirts and ran ran so lightly and swiftly that cecil who was taken by surprise had no chance of catching her from the hall door she looked back at him panting behind  too many cigarettes she laughed you are out of training if you do not mind you will be like lord ronald an old young man and i would never let any one say the sort of things you were going to say who couldnt catch me when i ran away  she went laughing up the stairs and cecil de la borne turned into his study the princess was playing patience and the two men were in easychairs  at last the princess remarked throwing down her cards my dear cecil do you realize that you have kept us waiting nearly an hour  i thought perhaps he answered that you had had enough bridge  absurd the princess declared what else is there to do come and cut and pray that you do not draw me for a partner my luck is dead outat patience anyhow  mine cecil remarked with a hard little laugh seems to be out all round touch the bell will you forrest i must have a brandy and soda before i start this beastly game again  the princess raised her eyebrows  i trust she said that my charming ward has not been unkind  your charming ward cecil answered has as many whims and fancies as an elf she yawns when i talk to her and looks longingly after one of my villagers hang the fellow  a very superior villager the princess remarked if you mean mr andrew  forrest looked up and fixed his cold intent eyes upon his host  i suppose he said you are sure that this man andrew is really what he professes to be and not a masquerader  i have known him cecil answered since i was old enough to remember anybody he has lived here all his life and only been away three or four times  they played until the dressingbell rang then cecil de la borne rose from his seat with a peevish exclamation  my luck seems dead out he said  the princess raised her eyebrows  possibly my dear boy she said but you must admit that you also played abominably your last declaration of hearts was indefensible and why you led a diamond and discarded the spade in lord ronalds no trump hand heaven only knows  i still think that i was right cecil declared a little sullenly  the princess said nothing but turned toward the door  any one dining tonight mr host she said  no one he answered to tell you the truth there is no one to ask within a dozen miles and you particularly asked not to be bothered with meeting yokels  quite right the princess answered only i am getting a little bored and if you had any yokels of the mr andrew sort with just a little more polish they might be entertaining you three men are getting deadly dull  princess lord ronald declared reproachfully how can you say that you never give any one a chance to see you until the afternoon and then we generally start bridge one cannot be brilliantly entertaining while one is playing cards  the princess yawned  i never argue she said i only state facts i am getting a little bored some one must be very amusing at dinnertime or i shall have a headache  she swept up to her room  i suppose wed better go and change cecil remarked leading the way out into the hall  forrest who was at the window screwed his eyeglass in and leaned forward a faint smile had parted the corner of his lips and he beckoned to cecil who came over at once to his side on the top of the sanddyke two figures were walking slowly side by side jeanne with the wind blowing her skirts about her small shapely figure was looking up all the time at the man who walked by her side and who against the empty background of sea and sky seemed of a stature almost gigantic  quite an idyll forrest remarked with a little sneer  cecil bit his lip and turned away without a word     chapter x   i dont think engleton said slowly that i care about playing any morejust now  the princess yawned as she leaned back in her chair both forrest and de la borne who had left his place to turn up one of the lamps glanced stealthily round at the speaker  i am not keen about it myself forrest said smoothly after all though its only three oclock  cecils fingers shook so that his tinkering with the lamp failed and the room was left almost in darkness forrest glad of an excuse to leave his place went to the great north window and pulled up the blind a faint stream of grey light stole into the room the princess shrieked and covered her face with her hands  for heavens sake nigel she cried pull that blind down i do not care for these rembrandtesque effects tobacco ash and cards and my complexion do not look at their best in such a crude light  forrest obeyed and the room for a moment was in darkness there was a somewhat curious silence the princess was breathing softly but quickly when at last the lamp burned up again every one glanced furtively toward the young man who was leaning back in his chair with his eyes fixed absently upon the table  well what is it to be forrest asked reseating himself one more rubber or bed  ive lost a good deal more than i care to cecil remarked in a somewhat unnatural tone but i say another brandy and soda and one more rubber there are some sandwiches behind you engleton  thank you engleton answered without looking up i am not hungry  the princess took up a fresh pack of cards and let them fall idly through her fingers then she took a cigarette from the gold case which hung from her chatelaine and lit it  one more rubber then she said after that we will go to bed  the others came toward the table and the princess threw down the cards they all three cut engleton however did not move  i think he said that you did not quite understand me i said that i did not care to play any more  three against one the princess remarked lightly  why not play cutthroat then engleton remarked it would be an excellent arrangement  why so forrest asked  because you could rob one another engleton said it would be interesting to watch  a few seconds intense silence followed engletons words it was the princess who spoke first her tone was composed but chilly she looked toward engleton with steady eyes  my dear lord ronald she said is this a joke i am afraid my sense of humour grows a little dull at this hour of the morning  it was not meant for a joke engleton said my words were spoken in earnest  the princess without any absolute movement seemed suddenly to become more erect one forgot her rouge her blackened eyebrows her powdered cheeks it was the great lady who looked at engleton  are we to take this lord ronald she asked as a serious accusation  you can take it for what it is madam engleton answeredthe truth  cecil de la borne rose to his feet and leaned across the table his cheeks were as pale as death his voice was shaking  i am your host engleton he said and i demand an explanation of what you have said your accusation is absurd you must be drunk or out of your senses  i am neither drunk nor out of my senses engleton answered nor am i such an utter fool as to be so easily deceived the fact that you as my partner played like an idiot made rotten declarations and revoked when one rubber was nearly won i pass over that may or may not have been your miserable idea of the game apart from that however i regret to have discovered that you forrest and you madam he added addressing the princess have made use throughout the last seven rubbers of a code with your fingers both for the declarations and for the leads my suspicions were aroused i must confess by accident it was remarkably easy however to verify them look here  engleton touched his forehead  hearts he said  he touched his lip  diamonds he added  he passed his fingers across his eyebrows  clubs he remarked  he beat with his fourth finger softly upon the table  spades  major forrest rose to his feet  lord ronald he said i am exceedingly sorry that owing to my introduction you have become a guest in this house as for your ridiculous accusation i deny it  and i the princess murmured  naturally engleton answered smoothly i really do not see what else you could do i regret very much to have been the unfortunate means of breaking up such a pleasant little houseparty i am going to my room now to change my clothes and i will trespass upon your hospitality mr de la borne only so far as to beg you to let me have a cart or something of the sort to drive me into wells as soon as your people come on the scene  engleton rose to his feet and with a stiff little bow walked toward the door he too seemed somehow during the last few minutes to have shown signs of a greater virility than was at any time manifest in his boyish somewhat unintelligent face he carried himself with a new dignity and he spoke with the decision of an older man for a moment they watched him go then forrest obeying a lightninglike glance from the princess crossed the room swiftly and stood with his back to the door  engleton he said this is absurd we can afford to ignore your mad behaviour and your discourtesy but before you leave this room we must come to an understanding  lord ronald stood with his hands behind his back  i had imagined he said that an understanding was exactly what we had come to my words were plain enough were they not i am leaving this house because i have found myself in the company of sharks and cardsharpers  forrests eyes narrowed a quick little breath passed between his teeth he took a step forward toward the young man as though about to strike him  engleton however remained unmoved  you are going to carry away a story like this he said hoarsely  i shall tell my friends engleton answered just as much or as little as i choose of my visit here since however you are curious i may say that should i find you at any future time in any respectable house it will be my duty to inform any one of my friends who are present of the character of their fellowguest will you be so good as to stand away from that door  no forrest answered  engleton turned toward cecil  mr de la borne he said may i appeal to you as it is your house to allow me egress from it  cecil came hesitatingly up to the two the princess with a sweep of her skirts followed him  major forrest is right she declared we cannot have this madman go back to london to spread about slanderous tales major forrest will stand away from that door lord ronald as soon as you pass your word that what has happened tonight will remain a secret  engleton laughed contemptuously  not i he answered exactly what i said to major forrest i repeat madam to you and to you sir my host i shall give my friends the benefit of my experience whenever it seems to me advisable  forrest locked the door and put the key into his pocket  we shall hope lord ronald he said quietly to induce you to change your mind     chapter xi   every one down for luncheon jeanne declared what energy where is lord ronald by the by she added looking around the room he promised to take me out sailing this morning i wonder if i missed him on the marshes  the princess yawned and glanced at the clock  by this time she remarked lord ronald is probably in london he had a telegram or something in the middle of the night and went away early this morning  jeanne looked at them in surprise  how queer she remarked i was down before nine oclock had he left then  long before then i believe forrest answered he is very likely coming back in a day or two  jeanne nodded indifferently the intelligence after all was of little importance to her  has the luncheon gong gone she asked i have been out since ten oclock and i am starving  cecil led the way across the hall into the diningroom  come along he said i wish we all had such healthy appetites  she glanced at him and then at the others  well she said you certainly look as though you had been up very late last night what is the matter with you all  we were very foolish major forrest said softly we sat up a great deal too late and i am afraid that we all smoked too many cigarettes you see it was our last night for without engleton our bridge is over  we must try cecil said and find some other form of entertainment for you would you like to sail again this afternoon princess  i believe she answered that i should like it if i may have plenty of cushions and a soft place for my head so that if i feel like it i can go to sleep really these late nights are dreadful i am almost glad that lord ronald has gone at least there will be no excuse for us to sit up until daylight  tonight major forrest remarked let us all be primitive we will go to bed at eleven oclock and get up in the morning and walk with miss le mesurier upon the marshes what do you find upon the sands i wonder he added turning a little suddenly toward the girl to bring such a colour to your cheeks and to keep you away from us for so many hours  jeanne looked at him for a moment without change of features  it would not be easy she said for me to tell you for i find things there which you could not appreciate or understand  you find them alone major forrest asked smiling  she turned her left shoulder upon him and addressed her host  major forrest is very impertinent she said i think that i will not talk with him any more tell me mr de la borne do you really mean that we can go sailing this afternoon  if you will he answered i have sent down to the village to tell them to bring the boat up to our harbourage  she nodded  i shall love it she declared it will be such a good thing for you three too because it will make you all sleepy and then you will be able to go to bed and not worry about your bridge when is lord ronald coming back  he was not quite sure the princess remarked it depends upon the urgency of his business which summoned him away  how odd jeanne remarked to think of lord ronald as having any business at all i cannot understand even now why i did not hear the car go my room is just over the entrance to the courtyard  it is a proof major forrest remarked that you sleep as soundly as you deserve  i am not so sure about that jeanne said last night for instance it seemed to me that i heard all manner of strange sounds  cecil de la borne looked up quickly  sounds he repeated do you mean noises in the house  she nodded  yes and voices once i thought that you must be all quarrelling and then i thought that i heard some one fall down after that there was nothing but the opening and shutting of doors  and after that the princess remarked smiling you probably went to sleep  exactly jeanne admitted i went to sleep listening for footsteps i think it was very rude of ronald to go away without saying goodbye to me  you would have thought it still ruder cecil remarked if he had had you roused at five oclock or so to make his adieux  the princess and jeanne left the table together a few minutes before the other two and jeanne asked her stepmother a question  how long are we going to stop here she inquired i thought that our visit was for two or three days only  the princess hesitated  cecil is such a nice boy she said and he is so anxious to have us stay a little longer what do you say you are not bored  i am not bored jeanne answered so long as you can keep him from saying silly things to me on the contrary i like to be here i like it better than london i like it better than any place i have been in since i left school  the princess looked at her a little curiously  i wonder she said whether i ought to be looking after you a little more closely my child what do you do on the marshes there all the time do you talk with this mr andrew  i went with him in his boat this morning jeanne answered composedly it was very pleasant we had a delightful sail  the princess shrugged her shoulders  well she said one must amuse oneself and i suppose it is only reasonable that we should all choose different ways i think i need not tell even such a child as you that men are the same all the world over and that even a fisherman if he is encouraged may be guilty sometimes of an impertinence  jeanne raised her eyebrows  i have not the slightest fear she said that mr andrew would ever be guilty of anything of the sort i wish i could say the same of some of the people whom i have met in our own circle of society  the princess smiled tolerantly  nowadays she remarked it is perfectly true that men do take too great liberties well amuse yourself with your fisherman my dear child it is your legitimate occupation in life to make fools of all manner of men and there is no harm in your beginning as low down as you choose if it amuses you  jeanne walked deliberately away the princess laughed a little uneasily as she watched jeanne ascend the stairs forrest and cecil came out into the hall they all three moved together into the further corner where coffee was set out upon a small table and it was significant that they did not speak a word until they were there and even then major forrest looked cautiously around before he opened his lips  well he asked  the princess smiled scornfully at their white anxious faces  what are you afraid of she asked contemptuously jeanne suspects nothing of course there is nothing which she could suspect she has not mentioned his name even  cecil drew a little breath of relief his face seemed to have grown haggard during the last few hours  i wish to god he muttered we were out of this  the princess turned her head and looked at him coldly  my young friend she said you men are all the same you have no philosophy the inevitable has happened or rather the inevitable has been forced upon us what we have done we did deliberately we could not do otherwise and we cannot undo it remember that and if you have a grain of philosophy or courage in you keep a stouter heart and wear a smile upon your face  cecil rose to his feet  you are right he said are you ready forrest will you come with me  forrest rose slowly to his feet  of course he said by the by a sail this afternoon was a good idea we must develop an interest in country pursuits it is possible even he added that we may have to take to golf  the princess too rose  come into my room one of you she said and see me for a moment afterwards i suppose we shall start for our sail about three  cecil nodded  the boat will be here by then he said  and i will come up and bring you the news if there is any forrest added     chapter xii   the man who stood with a telescope glued to his eye watching the coming boat shut it up at last with a little snap he walked round to the other side of the cottage where andrew was sitting with a pipe in his mouth industriously mending a fishing net  andrew he said there are some people coming here and i am almost sure that they mean to land  andrew rose to his feet and strolled round to the little stretch of beach in front of the cottage when he saw who it was who approached he stopped short and took his pipe from his mouth  by jove its cecil he exclaimed and his friends  his companion nodded he was a man still on the youthful side of middle age with bronzed features and short closelycut beard he looked what he was a traveller and a sportsman  so i imagined he said but i dont see ronald there  andrew shaded his eyes with his hand  no he said there is the princess and cecil and major forrest and miss le mesurier no one else they certainly do look as though they were going to land here  why not the other man remarked why shouldnt cecil come to visit his hermit brother  andrew frowned  berners he said i want you to remember this if they land here and you see anything of them will you have the goodness to understand that i am mr andrew fisherman and that you are my lodger  andrews companion looked at him in surprise  what sort of a game is this andrew he asked  andrew de la borne shrugged his shoulders and smiled goodnaturedly  never mind about that dick he answered call it a whim or anything else you like the fact is that cecil had some guests coming whom i did not particularly care to meet and who certainly would not have been interested in me i thought it would be best to clear out altogether so i have left cecil in possession of the hall and they dont even know that i exist  the man named berners looked up at his host with twinkling eyes  right he said so far as i am concerned you shall be mr andrew fisherman will you also kindly remember that if any curiosity is evinced as to my identity i am mr berners and that i am here for a restcure by the by how are you going to explain that elderly domestic of yours  he is your servant of course andrew answered he understands the position i have spoken to him already yes they are coming here right enough suppose you help me to pull in the boat for them  the two men sauntered down to the shelving beach the boat was close to them now and cecil was standing up in the bows  we want to land for a few minutes he called out  throw a rope then andrew answered briefly you had better come in this side of the landingstage  the rope was thrown and the boat dragged high and dry upon the pebbly beach the princess after a glance at him through her lorgnette surrendered herself willingly to andrews outstretched hands  i am quite sure she said that you will not let me fall you must be the wonderful person whom my daughter has told me about is this queer little place really your home  i live here andrew de la borne said simply  jeanne leaned over towards him  wont you please help me mr andrew she said smiling down at him  he held out his arms and she sprang lightly to the ground  i hope you dont mind our coming she said to him i was so anxious to see your cottage  there is little enough to see andrew answered but you are very welcome  we are sorry to trouble you cecil said a little uneasily but would it be possible to give these ladies some tea  certainly andrew answered i will go and get it ready  oh what fun jeanne declared i am coming to help please mr andrew do let me help i am sure i could make tea  it is not necessary thank you andrew answered i have a lodger who has brought his own servant as it happens he was just preparing some tea for us if you will come round to the other side where it is a little more sheltered i will bring you some chairs  they moved across the grassgrown little stretch of sand the princess peered curiously at berners  your face she remarked seems quite familiar to me  berners did not for the moment answer her he was looking towards forrest who was busy lighting a cigarette  i am afraid madam he said after a slight pause that i cannot claim the honour of having met you  the princess was not altogether satisfied jeanne had gone on with andrew and she followed slowly walking with berners  i have such a good memory for faces she remarked and i am very seldom mistaken  i am afraid berners said that this must be one of those rare occasions if you will allow me i will go and help andrew bring out some seats  he disappeared into the cottage and came out again almost directly with a couple of chairs this time he met forrests direct gaze and the two men stood for a moment or two looking at one another forrest turned uneasily away  who the devil is that chap he whispered to cecil ill swear ive seen him somewhere  very likely cecil answered wearily throwing himself down on the turf ive no memory for faces  jeanne had stepped into the cottage and gave a little cry of delight as she found herself in a small sittingroom the walls of which were lined with books and guns and fishingtackle  what a delightful room mr andrew she exclaimed why  she paused and looked up at him a little mystified  do the fishermen in norfolk read shakespeare and keats she asked and french books too de maupassant and de musset  they are my lodgers andrew answered this is his room i sit in the kitchen when i am at home  his dialect was more marked than ever and his answer had been delivered without any hesitation nevertheless jeanne was still a little puzzled  may i come into the kitchen please she asked  certainly he answered you will find mr berners servant there getting tea ready  jeanne peeped in and looked back at andrew who was standing behind her  what a lovely stone floor she exclaimed and your copper kettle too is delightful do you mean that when you have not a lodger here you cook and do everything for yourself  there are times he answered composedly when i have a little assistance it depends upon whether the fishing season has been good  berners came in and threw himself into an easychair in the sittingroom  make what use you like of my man andrew he said i will have a cup of tea in here afterwards  im very much obliged sir andrew answered  the princess called out to him and he stepped back once more to where they were all sitting  it is a shame she said that we drive your lodger away from his seat will you not ask him to take tea with us  i am afraid andrew answered that he is not a very sociable person he has come down here because he wants a complete rest and he does not speak to any one unless he is obliged he has just asked me to have his tea sent into his room  where does he come from this strange man the princess asked it is all the time in my mind that i have met him somewhere i am sure that he is one of us  i believe that he lives in london andrew answered and his name is berners mr richard berners  i do not seem to remember the name the princess remarked but the mans face worries me what a delightful looking teatray mr andrew you must really sit down with us we ought to apologize for taking you by storm like this and i have not thanked you yet for being so kind to my daughter andrew stepped back toward the cottage with a firm refusal upon his lips but jeannes hand suddenly rested upon the arm of his coarse blue jersey  if you please mr andrew she begged i want you to sit by me and tell me how you came to live in so strange a place do you really not mind the solitude  andrew looked down at her for a moment without answering for the first time perhaps he realized the charm of her pale expressive face with its rapid changes and the soft insistent fire of her beautiful eyes he hesitated for a moment and then remained where he was leaning against the flagstaff  it is very good of you miss he said as to why i came to live here i do so simply because the house belongs to me it was my fathers and his fathers we folk who live in the country make few changes  she looked at him curiously the men whom she had known even those of the class to whom he might be supposed to belong were all in a way different this man talked only when he was obliged all the time she felt in him the attraction of the unknown he answered her questions and remarks in words the rest remained unspoken she looked at him contemplatively as he stood by her side with a teacup in his hand leaning still a little against the flagstaff notwithstanding his rough clothes and heavy fishermans boots there was nothing about his attitude or his speech save in its dialect to denote the fact that he was of a different order from that in which she had been brought up she felt an immense curiosity concerning him and she felt too that it would probably never be gratified most men were her slaves from the moment she smiled upon them this one she fancied seemed a little bored by her presence he did not even seem to be thinking about her he was watching steadily and with somewhat bent eyebrows cecil de la borne and forrest something struck her as she looked from one to the other  i read once she remarked that people who live in a very small village for generation after generation grow to look like one another in a certain way i cannot conceive two men more unlike and yet at that moment there was something in your face which reminded me of mr de la borne  he looked down at her with a quick frown decidedly he was annoyed  you are certainly the first he said drily who has ever discovered the likeness if there is any  it does not amount to a likeness she answered and you need not look so angry mr de la borne is considered very goodlooking dear me what a nuisance do you see we are going  andrew de la borne took the cup from her hand and helped to prepare the boat with a faint smile upon his lips he heard a little colloquy between cecil and the princess which amused him the princess as he prepared to hand her into the boat showed herself at any rate possessed of the instincts of her order she held out her hand and smiled sweetly upon andrew  we are so much obliged to you for your delightful tea mr andrew she said i hope that next time my daughter goes wandering about in dangerous places you may be there to look after her  andrew looked swiftly away towards jeanne somehow or other the princess words seemed to come to him at that moment charged with some secondary meaning he felt instinctively that notwithstanding her thoroughly advanced airs jeanne was little more than a child as compared with these people she met his eyes with one of her most delightful smiles  some day i hope she said that you will take me out in the punt again i can assure you that i quite enjoyed being rescued  the little party sailed away cecil with an obvious air of relief andrew turned slowly round and met his friend issuing from the door of the cottage  andrew he said no wonder you did not care about being host to such a crowd  there was meaning in his tone and andrew looked at him thoughtfully  do you knowanything definite he asked  berners nodded  about one of them he said i certainly do i wonder what on earth has become of ronald he was with them yesterday  had enough perhaps andrew suggested  berners shook his head  i am afraid not he answered slowly i wish i could think that he had so much sense     chapter xiii   cecil came into the room abruptly and closed the door behind him he was breathing quickly as though he had been running his lips were a little parted and in his eyes shone an unmistakable expression of fear forrest and the princess both looked towards him apprehensively  what is it cecil the latter asked quickly you are a fool to go about the house looking like that  cecil came further into the room and threw himself into a chair  it is that fellow upon the island he said you remember we all said that his face was familiar i have seen him again and i have remembered  remembered what the princess asked  where it was that i saw him last cecil answered it was in pall mall and he was walking withwith engleton it was before i knew him but i knew who he was he must be a friend of engletons what do you suppose that he is doing here  cecil was shaking like a leaf the princess looked towards him contemptuously  come she said there is no need for you to behave like a terrified child even if you have seen him once with lord ronald what on earth is there in that to be terrified about lord ronald had many friends and acquaintances everywhere this one is surely harmless enough he behaved quite naturally on the island remember  cecil shook his head  i do not understand he said i do not understand what he can be doing in this part of the world unless he has some object i saw him just now standing behind a tree at the entrance to the drive watching me drive golf balls out on to the marsh i am almost certain that he was about the place last night i saw some one who looked very much like him pass along the cliffs just about dinnertime  you are frightened at shadows the princess declared contemptuously if he were one of lord ronalds friends and he had come here to look for him he wouldnt play about watching you from a distance besides there has been no time yet lord ronald onlyleft here yesterday morning  what is he doing then watching this house cecil asked that is what i do not like  the princess raised her eyebrows contemptuously  my dear cecil she said it is just a coincidence and not a very remarkable one at that lord ronald had the name you know of having acquaintances in every quarter of the world  cecil drew a little breath  it may be all right he said but i am not used to this sort of thing and it gives me the creeps  of course it is all right the princess said composedly one would think that we were a pack of children to take any notice of such trifles it is too early my dear cecil by many a day to look for trouble yet lord ronald always wandered about pretty much as he chose it will be months before  dont go on cecil interrupted i suppose i am a fool but all the time i am fancying things  forrest moved away with a little laugh and the princess rose and thrust her arm through cecils  silly boy she said you have nothing to be frightened about i can assure you  i am not frightened cecil answered i dont think that i was ever a coward all the same there are some things about this fellow which i dont quite understand  the princess laughed as she swept from the room  dont be foolish cecil she said remember that we are all here and that nothing can go wrong unless we lose our nerve  forrest found the princess alone a little later in the evening waiting in the hall for the dinnergong he drew her into a corner under pretext of showing her one of the old engravings dark with age which hung upon the wall  ena he said i suppose that you trust cecil de la borne you havent any fear about him eh  the princess shrugged her shoulders  no she answered he is a coward at heart but he has enough vanity i believe to keep him from doing anything foolish all the same i think it is wiser not to leave him alone here  he would not stay forrest remarked he told me so only this morning  you suggested leaving the princess asked  forrest nodded  i couldnt help it he said a little sullenly there is something about these great empty rooms and the silence of the place thats getting on my nerves i start every time that great frontdoor bell clangs or i hear an unfamiliar footstep in the hall god what fools we have been he added with a sudden bitter strength i couldnt have believed that i could ever have done anything so clumsy fancy giving ourselves away to a fool like engleton a selfopinionated young cub scarcely out of his cradle  he felt his damp forehead the princess was watching him curiously  dont be a fool nigel she said we underrated engleton that was all if ever a man looked an idiot he did and you must remember that we were in a corner yet she added leaning a little forward in her chair and gazing with hard set face into the fire it was foolish of me with jeanne to play with i ought to have had no such difficulties i never counted upon the tradespeople being so unreasonable if they had let me finish the season it would have been all right  forrest walked restlessly across the room and stood for a moment looking out of the window outside the wind had suddenly changed the sunshine had departed and a grey fog was blowing in from the sea he turned away with a shiver  what a cursed place this is he muttered ive half a mind even now to turn my back upon it and to run  the princess watched his pale face scornfully  i thought nigel she said that you were a more reasonable person remember that if we show the white feather now it is the end of everythingthe colonies if you like or a little cheap wateringplace at the best as for me i might have a better chance of brazening it out but remember that i could never afford to be seen in the company of a suspected person  it was the fear of losing you he muttered which made me so rash  the princess laughed very softly  my dear friend she said i do not believe you i may seem to you sometimes very foolish but at least i understand this life with you is self self self and nothing more you have scarcely a generous instinct scarcely a spark of real affection left in you  and yet he began quietly  and yet she whispered repulsing him with a little gesture but with a suddenly altered look in her face and yet we women are fools  she turned round to meet her host who was crossing the hall and almost simultaneously the dinner gong rang out their party was perhaps a little more cheerful than it had been on any of the last few evenings forrest drank more wine than usual and exerted himself to entertain cecil followed his example and the princess who sat by his side looked often into his face and whispered now and then in his ear jeanne was the only one who was a little distrait she left the table early as usual and slipped out into the garden the princess contrary to her custom rose from the table and followed her a sudden change of wind had blown the fog away and the night was clear the wind however had gathered force and the princess held down her elaborately coiffured hair and cried out in dismay  my dear jeanne she exclaimed but it is barbarous to wander about outside a night like this  jeanne laughed her own more simply arranged hair was blown all over her face  i love it she explained you dont want me indoors i am going to walk down the grove and look at the sea  come back into the hall one moment the princess said i want to speak to you  jeanne turned unwillingly round and her stepmother drew her into the shelter of the open door  jeanne she said you seem to meet your friend the fisherman very often if you should see anything of him tomorrow i wish you would inquire particularly as to his lodger you know whom i mean the man who was on the island with him yesterday afternoon  jeanne looked at her stepmother curiously  what am i to ask about him she demanded  where he comes from and what he is doing here the princess said find out if you can if berners is really his name i have a curious idea about him and cecil fancies that he has seen him before  jeanne looked for a minute interested  you are not usually so curious about people she remarked  the princess lowered her voice a little  jeanne she said i will tell you something lord ronald when he left here was very angry with us all there was a quarrel and he behaved very absurdly cecil fancies that this man berners is a friend of lord ronalds we want to know if it is so  jeanne raised her head and looked her stepmother steadily in the face  this is all very mysterious she said i do not understand it at all we seem to be almost in hiding here seeing no one and going nowhere and i notice that major forrest whenever he walks even in the garden is always looking around as though he were afraid of something what did you quarrel with lord ronald about  it is no concern of yours the princess answered a little sharply major forrest has had a somewhat eventful career and he has made enemies it was chiefly his quarrel with lord ronald and it was over a somewhat serious matter he has an idea that this man berners is connected with it in some way or other do find out if you can theres a dear child  i do not suppose jeanne said that mr andrew would know anything however when i see him i will ask him  the princess turned away from the open door shivering  you are not really going out she said  certainly i am jeanne answered i suppose you three will play cards and it does not interest me to watch you there is nothing which interests me here at all except the gardens and the sea i am going down to the beach and then i shall sit there behind the hollyhocks until it is bedtime  the princess looked at her curiously  youre a queer child she said turning away  it is not strange that jeanne answered with a little curl of the lips  the princess went back to the library coffee and liqueurs had already been served and the cardtable was set out although none of the three had the slightest inclination to play jeanne walked along the beach and then came back to her favourite seat sheltered by the little grove of stunted trees and the tall hollyhocks which bordered the garden her eyes were fixed upon the darkening sea whitened here and there by the long straight line of breakers the marshes on her right hand were hung with grey mists floating about like weird phantoms and here and there between them shone the distant lights of the village she half closed her eyes the soft falling of the waves upon the sand below and the murmur of the wind through the bushes and scanty trees was like a lullaby she sat there she scarcely knew how long she woke up with a start conscious that two men were standing talking together within a few yards of her in the rough lane that led down to the sea     chapter xiv   the princess was attempting a new and very complicated form of patience forrest was watching her their host was making an attempt to read the newspaper  in five minutes the princess declared i shall have achieved the impossible this time i am quite sure that i am going to do it  a breathless silence followed her announcement the princess looking up in surprise found that the eyes of her two companions were fixed not upon her but upon the door she laid down her cards and turned her head it was jeanne who stood there her hair tossed and blown by the wind her face ashen white  what is the matter child the princess demanded  jeanne came a little way into the room  there were two men she faltered talking in the shrubbery close to where i was sitting behind the hollyhocks i could not understand all that they said but they are coming here they were speaking of lord ronald  go on forrest muttered leaning forward with dilated eyes  they spoke as though something might have happened to him here the girl whispered oh it is too horrible this what do you think that they meant  she looked at the three people who confronted her there was nothing reassuring in the faces of the two men the princess leaned back in her chair and laughed  my dear child she said you have been asleep and dreamed these foolish things or if not these yokels to whom you have been listening are mad what harm do you suppose could come to lord ronald here  i do not know jeanne said speaking in a low tone and with the fear still in her dark eyes  i told you the princess continued that there was some sort of a quarrel what of it lord ronald simply chose to go away do you suppose that there is any one here who would think of trying to hinder him look at us three and ask yourself if it is likely look at major forrest here for instance who never loses his temper and whose whole life is a series of calculations or our host look at him the princess continued with a little wave of her hand he may have secrets that we know nothing of but if he is a desperate criminal i must say that he has kept the knowledge very well to himself as for me you know very well that i quarrel with no one le jeu ne vaut pas la peine  jeanne drew a little breath her face was less tragic there was a moments silence then cecil de la borne moved toward the fireplace he was pale but his manner was more composed the princess speech drawn out and very slowly spoken of deliberate intent had achieved its purpose the first terror had passed away from all of them  i will ring the bell cecil said and find out who these trespassers are wandering about my grounds at this hour of the night or shall we all go out and look for them ourselves  as you will forrest answered personally i should think that miss jeanne has overheard some gossip amongst the servants and misunderstood it however this sort of thing is just as well put a stop to  a sudden peal rang through the house the frontdoor bell a huge unwieldy affair seldom used because save in the depths of winter the door stood open suddenly sent a deep resonant summons echoing through the house the bareness and height of the hall and the fact that the room in which they were was quite close to the front door itself perhaps accounted for the unusual volume of sound which seemed created by that one peal it was more like an alarm bell ringing out into the silent night than any ordinary summons coming in the midst of those tense few seconds it had an effect upon the people who heard it which was almost indescribable cecil de la borne was pale with the nervousness of the coward but forrests terror was a real and actual thing stamped in his white face gleaming in his sunken eyes as he stood behind the cardtable with his head a little thrust forward toward the door as though listening for what might come next the princess if she was in any way discomposed did not show it she sat erect in her chair her head slightly thrown back her eyebrows a little contracted it was as though she were asking who had dared to break in so rudely upon her pastime jeanne had sunk back into the window and was sitting there her hands clasped together  cecil de la borne glanced at the clock  it is nearly eleven oclock he said the servants will have gone to bed i must go and see who that is  no one attempted to stop him they heard his footsteps go echoing down the silent hall they heard the harsh clanking of the chain as he drew it back and the opening of the heavy door they all looked at one another in tense expectation they heard cecils challenge and they heard muffled voices outside then there came the closing of the door and the sound of heavy footsteps in the hall forrest grasped the table with both hands and his face was bloodless the princess leaned towards him  for gods sake nigel she whispered in his ear pull yourself together one look into your face is enough to give the whole show away even jeanne there is watching you  the man made an effort even as the footsteps drew near he dashed some brandy into a tumbler and drank it off cecil de la borne entered followed by the man who had been andrews guest and another a small dark person with glasses and a professional air cecil who had been a little in front turned round to usher them in  i cannot keep you out of my house gentlemen i suppose he said although i consider that your intrusion at such an hour is entirely unwarrantable i regret that i have no other room in which i can receive you what you have to say to me you can say here before my friends if i remember rightly he added your name is berners and you are lodging in this neighbourhood  the man who had called himself berners bowed to the princess and jeanne before replying his manner was grave but not in any way threatening his companion stood behind him and remained silent  i have called myself berners he said because it is more convenient at times to do so i am richard berners duke of westerham a recent guest of yourslord ronaldis my younger brother  the silence which reigned in the room might almost have been felt the duke looking from one to the other grew graver  i suppose he continued i ought to apologize for coming here so late at night but my solicitor has only just arrived from london and reported to me the result of some inquiries he has been making ronald is my favourite brother although i have not seen much of him lately i trust therefore he continued still speaking to cecil de la borne that you will pardon my intrusion when i explain that from the moment of quitting your house my brother seems to have completely disappeared i have come to ask you if you can give me any information as to the circumstances of his leaving and whether he told you his destination  cecil de la borne was white to the lips but he was on the point of answering when the princess intervened she leaned forward toward the newcomer and her face expressed the most genuine concern  my dear duke she said this is very extraordinary news that you bring lord ronald left here for london do you mean to say that he has never arrived there  the duke turned towards his companion  my solicitor here mr hensellman he said has made the most careful inquiries and has even gone so far as to employ detectives my brother has certainly not returned to london we have also wired to every country house where a visit from him would have been a probability without result under those circumstances and others which i need not perhaps enlarge upon i must confess to feeling some anxiety as to what has become of him  naturally the princess answered at once and yet she continued it is only a few days ago since he left here your brother duke who seemed to me a most delightful young man was also distinctly peculiar and i do not think that the fact of your not being able to hear of him at his accustomed haunts for two or three days is in any way a matter which need cause you any anxiety  the duke bowed  madam he said i regret having to differ from you i beg that you will not permit anything which i say to reflect upon yourself or upon mr de la borne whose honour i am sure is above question but you have amongst you a person whom i am assured is a very bad companion indeed for boys of my brothers age i refer to you sir he added addressing forrest  forrest bowed ironically  i am exceedingly obliged to you sir he said for your amiable opinion although why you should go out of your way to volunteer it here i cannot imagine  i do so sir the duke answered because during the last two or three days cheques for a considerable amount have been honoured at my brothers bank bearing your endorsement i may add sir that i came down here to see my brother i wished to explain to him that you were not a person with whom it was advisable for him to play cards  forrest took a quick step forward  sir he exclaimed you are a liar  the duke bowed  i do not quote my own opinion he said i speak from the result of the most careful investigations your reputation you cannot deny even at your own clubs men shrug their shoulders when your name is mentioned i will give you the benefit of any doubt you wish i will simply say that you are a person who is suspected in any assembly where gentlemen meet together and that being so as my brother has disappeared from this house after several nights spent in playing cards with you i am here to learn from you and from you sir he added turning to cecil de la borne some further information as to the manner of my brothers departure or to remain here until i have acquired that information for myself  the princess rose to her feet and laid her hand upon forrests shoulder the veins were standing out upon his forehead and his face was black with anger he seemed to be in the act of springing upon the man who made these charges against him  nigel she said please let me talk to the duke remember that after all from his own point of view what he is saying is not so outrageous as it seems to us cecil please dont interfere she added turning towards him duke she continued speaking firmly and with much of the amiability gone from her tone you are playing the modern don quixote to an extent which is unpardonable even taking into account your anxiety concerning your brother lord ronald was a guest here of mr de la bornes and to the best of my knowledge he lost little more than he won all the time he was here in any case on major forrests behalf and as an old friend i deny that there was any question whatever as to the fairness of any games that were played your brother received a telegram and asked to be allowed the use of the car to take him to lynn station early on the following morning he promised to return within a week  you have heard from him since he left the duke asked quickly  we have not the princess answered only yesterday morning i remarked that it was slightly discourteous your brother left here on excellent terms with us all you can interview if you will any member of the household you can make your inquiries at the station from which he departed your appearance here at such an untimely hour and your barely veiled accusations remind me of the fable of the bull in the china shop if you think that we have locked your brother up here pray search the house if you think she added with curling lip that we have murdered him pray bring down an army of detectives invest the place and pursue your investigations in whatever direction you like but before you leave i should advise you if you wish to preserve your reputation as a person of breeding to apologize to mr de la borne for your extraordinary behaviour here tonight and the extraordinary things at which you have hinted  the duke smiled pleasantly  madam he said i came here tonight not knowing that you were amongst the difficulties which i should have to deal with i wish to speak to mr de la borne you will permit me  the princess shrugged her shoulders and turned away  i have ventured to speak for both of them she remarked for the sake of peace because i am a woman and can keep my temper and they are men who might have resented your impertinence  the duke remained as though he had not heard her speech he laid his hand upon cecils shoulder  de la borne he said you and i are scarcely strangers although we have never met there have been friendships in our families for many years dont be afraid to speak out if anything has gone a little wrong here and you are ashamed of it i want to be your friend as you know very well tell me now cant you help me to find ronald havent you any idea where he is  none at all cecil answered  tell me this then the duke said his clear brown eyes fixed steadily upon cecils miserable white face were there any unusual circumstances at all connected with his leaving here  none whatever cecil answered with an uneasy little laugh except that i had to get up to see him off and it was a beastly cold morning  the lawyer who had been standing silent all this time drew the duke for a moment on one side  i should recommend sir he whispered that we went away if they know anything they do not mean to tell and the less we let them know as to whether we are satisfied or not the better  the duke nodded and turned once more to cecil  i am forced to accept your word mr de la borne he said and when my brother confirms your story i shall make a special visit here to offer you my apologies madam he added bowing to the princess i regret to have disturbed your interesting occupation  forrest he completely ignored turning his back upon him almost immediately cecil went out with them into the hall in a moment the great front door was opened and closed cecil came back into the room and the perspiration stood out in great beads upon his forehead now that the duke had departed something seemed to have fallen from their faces they looked at one another as the ghosts of their real selves might have looked forrest stumbled toward the sideboard cecil was already there  the brandy he muttered quick     chapter xv   bareheaded jeanne walked upon the yellow sands close to the softly breaking waves inland stretched the marshes with their patches of vivid green their clouds of faintly blue wild lavender their sinuous creeks stealing into the bosom of the land she climbed on to a grassy knoll warm with the suns heat and threw herself down upon the turf she turned her back upon the hall and looked steadily seawards across the waste of sands and pastureland to where sky and sea met here at least was peace she drew a long breath of relief cast aside the book which she had never dreamed of reading and lay full length in the grass with her eyes upturned to where a lark was singing his way down from the blue sky  andrew came before long speeding his way out of the village harbour in his little catboat she watched him cross the sandy bar of the inlet and run his boat presently upon the beach below where she sat then she shook out her skirts and made room for him by her side  really mr andrew she said resting her chin upon her hands and looking up at him with her full dark eyes you are becoming almost gallant until now when i have been weary and have wished to talk to you i have had almost to come and fetch you today it is you who come to me that is a good sign  it is true he admitted i have kept my telescope fixed upon the sands here for more than an hour i wanted to see you  you have something to tell me about last night she asked gravely  no he answered i did not come here to talk about that  did you know she asked who your lodger really was  yes he said i guessed i will be frank with you miss jeanne if you will allow me i do not like your stepmother and i do not like major forrest but i think that the duke is going altogether too far when he suspects them of having anything to do with the disappearance of his brother  she drew a little sigh of relief  oh i am glad to hear you say that she declared it is all so horrible i could not sleep last night for thinking about it  lord ronald will probably turn up in a day or two andrew said gravely we will not talk any more about him  she settled herself a little more comfortably and smoothed out her skirts then she looked up at him with faintly parted lips  what shall we talk about mr andrew she said softly  about ourselves he answered or rather about you it seems to me that we both stand a little outside the game of life as your friends up there understand it  he waved his large brown hand in the direction of the hall  you are a child fresh from boardingschool too young to understand too young to know where to look for your friends or discriminate against your enemies i am a rough sort of fellow also outside their lives from necessity from every reason which the brain of man could evolve sometimes we outsiders see more than is intended is the princess of strurm really your stepmother  of course she is jeanne answered she was married to my father when i was quite a little girl and she has visited me at the convent where i was at school all my life and when i left last year it was she who came for me why do you ask so strange a question  because he said i should consider her about the worst possible guardian that a child like you could have tell me what is it that goes on all day up at the hall thereor rather what was it that did go on before engleton went awayeating and drinking cards and god knows what sort of foolishness nothing else nothing worth doing not a thing said worth listening to its a rotten life for a child like you they tell me youre an heiress are you  she smoothed her crumpled skirts and looked steadily at the tip of her brown shoe  one of the greatest in europe she answered no one knows how rich i am you see all the money was left to me when i was six years old and it is so strictly tied up that no one has had power to touch a single penny until i am of age that is why it has gone on increasing and increasing  and when are you of age he asked  next year she answered  by that time i imagine andrew continued your stepmother will have sold you to some brokendown hangeron of hers havent you any other relations miss jeanne  she laughed softly  you are a ridiculous person she said i am very fond of my stepmother i think that she is a very clever woman  bah he exclaimed in disgust a clever woman she may be but a good woman no i am sure of that you may judge a person by the company they keep neither she or this man forrest are fit associates for a child of your age  she laughed softly  they dont do me any harm she said mr de la borne and lord ronald have asked me to marry them of course but then every young man does that when he knows who i am my stepmother has promised me at least that i shall not be bothered by any of them just yet i am going to be presented next season we are going to have a house in town and i am going to choose a husband of my own  it was andrew now who looked long and steadily out seawards she watched him covertly from under her heavily lidded eyes  mr andrew she said softly i wish very much  then she stopped short and he looked at her a little abruptly  what is it that you wish he asked  i wish that you did not wear such strange clothes and that you did not talk the dialect of these fishermen and that you had more money then you too might come and see me might you not when we have that house in london  he laughed boisterously  i fancy i see myself in london paying calls he declared give me my catboat and fishing line id rather sail down the home creek with a northeast gale in my teeth than walk down piccadilly in patent boots  she sighed  i am afraid she admitted that as a town acquaintance you are hopeless  i am afraid so he answered looking steadily seawards we country people have strong prejudices you see it seems to us that all the sin and all the unhappiness and all the decadence and all the things that mar the beauty of the world come from the cities and from life in the cities no wonder that we want to keep away it isnt that we think ourselves better than the other folk it is simply that we have realized pleasures greater than we could find in paved streets and under smokestained skies we know what it is to smell the salt wind to hear it whistling in the cords and the sails of our boats to feel the warmth of the sun to listen to the song of the birds to watch the colouring of gods land here i suppose we have the thing in our bloods we cant leave it we hear the call of the other things sometimes but as soon as we obey we are restless and unhappy it is only an affair of time and generally a very short time one cannot fight against nature  no she answered softly one cannot fight against nature but there are children of the cities children of the life artificial as well as children of nature look at me  he turned toward her quickly  look at me she commanded and he obeyed  he saw her pale skin which the touch of the sun seemed to have no power to burn or coarsen the clear wonderful eyes the delicate eyebrows the masses of dark hair the scarlet lips he saw her white throat swelling underneath her muslin blouse the daintiness of her gown airy and simple yet fresh from a paris workshop the stockings and shoes exquisite but strangely out of place with their high heels buried in the sand  how do i know she demanded that i am not one of the children of the cities that i was not fashioned and made for the gaslit life to eat unreal food at unreal hours and feed my brain upon the unreal epigrams of the men whom you would call decadents two days here a weekvery well in a month i might be bored who shall guarantee me against it  no one he answered and yet there is something in your blood which calls for the truth which hates the shams which knows real beauty why dont you try and cultivate it in your heart you know where the true things lie consider every one with great wealth can make or mar many lives you enter the world almost as a divinity your wealth is reckoned as a quality what you do will be right what you condemn will be wrong it is a very important thing for others as well as yourself that you should see a clear way through life  a moments intense dejection seized upon her the tears stood in her eyes as she looked away from him  who is there to show it me she asked who is there to help me find it  not those friends whom you have left to play bridge in a room with drawn curtains at this hour of the day he answered not your stepmother or any of her sort try and realize this even the weakest of us is not dependent upon others for support there is only one sure guide trust yourself be faithful to the best part of yourself you know what is good and what is ugly dont be coerced dont be led into the morass  she looked at him and laughed gaily her mood had changed once more with chameleonlike swiftness  it is all very well for you she declared you are six foot four and you look as though you could hew your way through life with a cudgel one could fancy you a don quixote amongst the shams knocking them over like ninepins and moving aside neither to the right nor to the left but what is a poor weak girl to do she wants some one mr andrew to wield the cudgel for her  it was several seconds before he turned his head then he found that although her lips were laughing her eyes were longing and serious she sprang suddenly to her feet and leaned towards him  this is the most delightful nonsense she whispered please  she was in his arms for a moment her lips had clung to his then she was away flying along the sands at a pace which seemed to him miraculous swinging her hat in her hands and humming the maddening refrain of some french song which it seemed to him was always upon her lips and which had haunted him for days he hesitated uncertain whether to follow ashamed of himself ashamed of the passion which was burning in his blood and while he hesitated she passed out of sight turning only once to wave her hand as she crossed the line of grassgrown hillocks which shut him out from her view     chapter xvi   tomorrow the princess said softly we shall have been here a fortnight  cecil de la borne came and sat by her side upon the sofa  i am afraid he said that leaving out everything else you have been terribly bored  i have been nothing of the sort she answered of course the last week has been a strain but we are not going to talk any more about that you prepared us for semibarbarism and instead you have made perfect sybarites of us i can assure you that though in one way to go will be a release in another i shall be very sorry  and i he said in a low tone shall always be sorry  he let his hand fall upon hers and looked into her eyes the princess stifled a yawn this country style of lovemaking was a thing which she had outgrown many years ago  you will find other distractions very soon she said and besides the world is a small place we shall see something of you i suppose always by the by you have not been particularly attentive to my stepdaughter during the last few days have you  she gives me very little chance he answered in a slightly aggrieved tone  she is very young the princess said too young i suppose to take things seriously i do not think that she will marry very early  cecil bent over his companion till his head almost touched hers  dear lady he said i am afraid that i am not very interested in your stepdaughter while you are here  absurd she murmured i am nearly twice your age  if you were he answered so much the better but you are not do you know i think that you have been rather unkind to me i have scarcely seen you alone since you have been here  she laughed softly and took up her little dog into her arm as though to use him for a shield  my dear cecil she said earnestly please dont make love to me i like you so much and i should hate to feel that you were boring me every man with whom i am alone for ten minutes thinks it his duty to say foolish things to me and i can assure you that i am past it all a few years ago it was different today there are only three things in the world i care formy little spaniel here bridge and money  his face darkened a little  you did not talk like this in london he reminded her  perhaps not she admitted perhaps even now it is only a mood with me i can only speak as i feel for the moment there are times when i feel differently but not now  perhaps he said jealously there are also other people with whom you feel differently  perhaps she admitted calmly  when i came into the room the other day he said forrest was holding your hand  major forrest she said has been very much upset he needed a little consolation he has some other engagements and he ought to have left before now but as you know we are all prisoners i wonder how long it will last  i cannot tell cecil answered gloomily forrest knows more about it than i do what does he say to you  he thinks the princess said slowly that we may be able to leave in a few days now  then while you do stay cecil begged be a little kinder to me  she withdrew her hand from her dog and patted his for a moment  you foolish boy she said of course i will be a little kinder to you if you like but i warn you that i shall only be a disappointment boys of your age always expect so much and i have so little to give  why do you say that he asked  she shrugged her shoulders  because it is the truth she answered you must not expect anything more from me than the husk of things believe me i am not a poseuse i really mean it  you may change your mind he said  i may she answered i have no convictions and my enemies would add no principles if any one could make me feel the things which i have forgotten how to feel i myself am perfectly willing but dont hope too much from that and do theres a dear boy go and stop my maid i can see her on her way down the drive there she has some telegrams i gave her and i want to send another  cecil hurried out and the princess moving to the window beckoned to forrest who was lounging in a wicker chair with a cigarette in his mouth  nigel she said how much longer  forrest looked despondently at his cigarette  i cannot tell he answered perhaps one day perhaps a week perhaps  no the princess interrupted i do not wish to hear that eventuality  you know that the duke is still about forrest said gloomily i saw him this morning there has been a fellow tooa detective of courseenquiring about the car and who was able to drive it  but that the princess interrupted is all in our favour you were seen to bring it back up the drive about ten oclock in the morning  forrest nodded  dont lets talk about it he said where is jeanne do you know  the princess pointed toward the lawn to where cecil and jeanne were just starting a game of croquet forrest watched them for a few minutes meditatively  ena he said dropping his voice a little what are you going to do with that child i have never quite understood your plans you promised to talk to me about it while we were down here  i know the princess answered only this other affair has driven everything out of our minds what i should like to do she continued is to marry her before she comes of age if i can find any one willing to pay the price  the price he repeated doubtfully  the princess nodded  supposing she continued that her fortune amounted to nearly four hundred thousand pounds i think that twentyfive thousand pounds would be a very moderate sum for any one to pay for a wife with such a dowry  have you any one in your mind he asked  the princess nodded  i have a friend in paris who is making some cautious inquiries she answered i am expecting to hear from her in the course of a few days  so far he remarked you have made nothing out of your guardianship except a living allowance  she nodded  and a ridiculously small one she remarked all that i have had is two thousand a year i need not tell you my dear nigel that that does not go very far when it has to provide dresses and servants and a home for both of us jeanne is content and never grumbles or her lawyers might ask some very inconvenient questions  supposing he asked that she wont have anything to do with this man when you have found one who is willing to pay  until she is of age the princess answered she is mine to do what i like with body and soul the french law is stricter than the english in this respect you know there may be a little trouble of course but i shall know how to manage her  she has likes and dislikes of her own he remarked and fairly positive ones i believe if she had her own way she would spend all her time with this fisherman here  the princess smoothed the lace upon her gown and gazed reflectively at the turquoises upon her white fingers  jeannes father she remarked was bourgeois and her mother had little family race tells of course i have never attempted to influence her when there is a great struggle ahead it is as well to let her have her own way in small things hush she is coming i suppose the croquet has been a failure  jeanne came across to them swinging her mallet in her hand  will some one she begged take our too kind host away from me he follows me everywhere and i am bored i have played croquet with him but he is not satisfied if i try to read he comes and sits by my side and talks nonsense if i say i am going for a walk he wants to come with me i am tired of it  the princess looked at her stepdaughter critically jeanne was dressed in white with a great red rose stuck through her waistband she was paler even than usual her eyes were dark and luminous and the curve of her scarlet lips suggested readily enough the weariness of which she spoke  the princess shrugged her shoulders and gathered up her skirts  do what you like my dear she said i will tell cecil to leave you alone but remember that he is our host you must really be civil to him  she strolled across the lawn to where cecil was still knocking the croquet balls about jeanne sank into her place and forrest looked at her for a few moments attentively  you are a strange child he said at last  she glanced towards him as though she found his speech an impertinence then she looked away across the oldfashioned strangely arranged garden with its irregular patches of many coloured flowers its windswept shrubs its flagstaff rising from the grassy knoll at the seaward extremity she watched the seagulls wheeling in from the sea and followed the line of smoke of a distant steamer she seemed to find all these things more interesting than conversation  you do not like me he remarked quietly you have never liked me  i have liked very few of my stepmothers friends she answered any more than i like the life which i have been compelled to lead since i left school  you would prefer to be back there perhaps he remarked a little sarcastically  i should she answered it was prison of a sort but one was at least free to choose ones friends  if he suggested you could make up your mind that i was a person at any rate to be tolerated i think that i could make things easier for you your stepmother is always inclined to follow my advice and i could perhaps get her to take you to quieter places where you could lead any sort of life you liked  thank you she answered before very long i shall be my own mistress until then i must make the best of things if you wish to do something for me you can answer a question  ask it then he begged at once if i can i shall be only too glad  you can tell me something which since the other night she said has been worrying me a good deal you can tell me who it was that drove lord ronald to the station the morning he went away i thought that he sent his chauffeur away two days ago and that there was no one here who could drive the car  forrest was momentarily taken aback he answered however with scarcely any noticeable hesitation  i did he answered i didnt make much of a job of it and the car has been scarcely fit to use since but i managed it somehow or rather we did between us he came and knocked me up about five oclock and begged me to come and try  she looked at him with peculiar steadfastness there was nothing in her eyes or her expression to suggest belief or disbelief in his words  but i have heard you say so often she remarked that you knew absolutely nothing about the mechanism of a car and that you would not drive one for anything in the world  he nodded  i am not proud of my skill he answered but i did try at homburg once there was nothing else to do and i had some idea of buying a small car for touring in the black forest if you doubt my words you can ask any of the servants they saw me bring the car up the avenue later in the morning  it was being dragged up she reminded him the engine was not going  he looked a little startled  it had only just gone wrong he said i had brought it all the way from lynn  she rose to her feet  thank you for answering my question she said i am going for a walk now  he leaned quite close to her  alone he asked suggestively  she swept away without even looking at him he shrugged his shoulders as he resumed his seat  i am not sure he said reflectively as he lit a cigarette that ena will find that young woman so easy to deal with as she imagines     chapter xvii   andrew looked up from his gardening startled by the sudden peal of thunder absorbed in his task he had not noticed the gathering storm the sky was black with clouds riven even while he looked with a vivid flash of forked lightning the ground beneath his feet seemed almost to shake beneath that second peal of thunder in the stillness that followed he heard the cry of a woman in distress he threw down his spade and raced to the other side of the garden about twenty yards from the shore jeanne in a small boat was rowing toward the island she was pulling at the great oars with feeble strokes and making no headway against the current which was sweeping down the tidal way there was no time for hesitation andrew threw off his coat and wading into the water reached her just in time he clambered into the boat and took the oars from her trembling fingers he was not a moment too soon for the long tidal waves were rushing in now before the storm he bent to his task and drove the boat safely on to the beach then he stood up dripping and handed her out  my dear young lady he said a little brusquely and forgetting for the moment his norfolk dialect what on earth are you about in that little boat all by yourself  she was still frightened and she looked at him a little piteously  please dont be angry with me she said i wanted to come here and see you toto ask your advice the boat was lying there and it looked such a very short distance across and directly i had started the big waves began to come in and i was frightened  the storm broke upon them another peal of thunder was followed by a downpour of rain he caught hold of her hand  run as hard as you can he said  they reached the cottage breathless he ushered her into his little sittingroom  has your friend gone she asked  yes he answered he went last night  i am glad she declared i wanted to see you alone you said that he was lodging here did you not  andrew nodded  yes he said but he only stayed for a few days  you have an extra room here then she asked  certainly he answered wondering a little at the drift of her questions  will you let it to me please she asked i am looking for lodgings and i should like to stay for a little time here  he looked at her in amazement  my dear young lady he exclaimed you are joking  i am perfectly serious she answered i will tell you all about it if you like  but your stepmother he protested she would never come to such a place besides you are mr de la bornes guests  i do not wish to stay there any longer she said i do not wish to stay with my stepmother any longer something has happened which i cannot altogether explain to you but which makes me feel that i want to get away from them all i have enough money and i am sure i should not be much trouble please take me mr andrew  he suddenly realized what a child she was her dark eyes were raised wistfully to his her oval face was a little flushed by her recent exertions she wore a very short skirt and her hair hung about her shoulders in a tangled mass her little foreign mannerisms half inciting half provocative were forgotten his heart was full of pity for her  my dear child he said you are not serious you cannot possibly be serious your stepmother is your guardian and she certainly would not allow you to run away from her like this besides i have not even a maidservant it would be absolutely impossible for you to stay here  her eyes filled with tears she dropped her arms with a weary little gesture  but i should love it so much she said here i could rest and forget all the things which worry me in this new life here i could watch the sea come in i could sit down on the beach there and listen to the larks singing on the marshes oh it would be such a restso peaceful mr andrew is it quite impossible  he played his part well enough laughing at her goodhumouredly  it is more than impossible he said if you stayed here for any time at all your stepmother would come and fetch you back and i should get into terrible disgrace mr de la borne would probably turn me out of my house he added as an afterthought  she sat down and looked out of the window in despair the storm was still raging the skies were black and the windowpane streaming with raindrops she shivered a little  if i could help you in any other way he continued after a moments pause i should be very glad to try  she turned upon him quickly  how can you help me or any one she demanded unless you can take me away from these people listen until a few months ago i had scarcely seen my stepmother she fetched me away from the convent took me to paris for some clothes and since then i have done nothing but go to parties and houses where the people seem all to have fine names but behave horribly i know that i am rich they told me that before i left the convent so that i might be a little prepared but is that any reason why every man old and young should say foolish things to me and pretend that they have fallen in love when i know all the time that it is my fortune they are thinking of and my stepmother speaks of marrying me as though i were a piece of merchandise to be disposed of to the highest bidder i do not like her friends i do not like the way they live i have never liked major forrest last night your lodger and another man came to the hall they asked questions about lord ronald they asked questions and they were told lies i am sure of it it got on my nerves i thought i should shriek major forrest said that it was he who drove lord ronald into lynn thirtyfive miles away at six oclock in the morning i am sure that he could not have driven the car a hundred yards  good god andrew muttered  i am sure of it jeanne continued two days before lord ronald disappeared he wanted the car to take us over to sandringham and he could not find the chauffeur it seems that he was down at the publichouse at the village and he came back intoxicated lord ronald was angry and he sent the man away the car was there in the coachhouse and there was no one who could drive it  but andrew protested major forrest was seen returning in the car  he was pulled up the avenue in it jeanne answered how he got the car there i dont know but i do not believe that it had ever been any further  why do you not believe that andrew asked  she leaned towards him  because she said i was up early the car was there at eight oclock alone just outside the gates there were the marks where it had come down from the house but there were no marks on the other side i am sure that it had been no further i felt the engine and it was cold i do not believe that it had been started at all  andrew was looking very serious  then he said if lord ronald was not taken to lynn that morning what do you suppose has become of him  i do not know she cried i am afraid i dare not stay there they all look at one another and leave off talking when i come into the room unexpectedly they all seem as though some trouble were hanging over them i am afraid to be there mr andrew  andrew was very serious indeed now  i will go up to the hall at once he said and i will see mr de la borne i have some influence with him and i will get to the bottom of the whole matter i will take you back and i will make inquiries at once  she settled down in his easy chair her dark eyes were full of pleading  but mr andrew she said i do not want to go back to the hall i am afraid of them all and i am afraid of my stepmother more than any of them why may i not stay here i will be very good and i will give you no trouble at all  my child he said firmly you are talking nonsense i am only a village fisherman but you could not possibly stay in my house here i have not even a housekeeper  that she declared calmly is an excellent reason why i should stop i will be your housekeeper come and sit here by me and let us talk about it  he walked instead to the window he did not choose at that moment that she should see his face  you do not wish to have me she cried  he turned round she slid out of her chair and came over to his side  i can only tell you he said gravely that it is impossible for you to stay here and that i must take you home at once  she took his arm and looked up into his face  at once mr andrew she asked timidly  as soon as the storm goes down he answered glancing uneasily towards the clock listen please miss  jeanne she whispered  miss jeanne then he said there are some things which you do not yet understand very well because you have been brought up differently to most english girls i have some influence with mr de la borne and i shall do what i can for you up at the house but it is very certain that you must not think of leaving your stepmother unless you have some other relative who is willing to take you a child of your age cannot live alone it is unheard of  she sighed and turned away  very well mr andrew she said if you do not wish to be troubled with me i will go back i am ready when you are  andrew looked once more out of the window  we cannot cross just yet he said the tide is coming in very fast and even here there is a big sea  it is magnificent she answered stealing back to his side i only wish that we were outside  you could not stand up he answered listen  the thunder of the incoming waves seemed to fill the room even while they stood there a little shower of pebbles and spray were dashed against the windows andrew looked anxiously across the estuary and tapped the barometer by his side  i am afraid he said that you are going to be late for dinner tonight you are a bona fide prisoner here for an hour or more at least  i am so glad she answered  there was a knock at the door a man entered with a teatray he was in plain clothes and was obviously a servant jeanne looked at him in surprise  has mr berners left his servant here she asked  for a day or two andrew answered hastily he may come back you see and he went away in a great hurry martin bring another teacup and make the tea please  the man set down the tray and bowed  very good sir he answered  jeannie watched him disappear perplexed was it because he was so perfectly trained a servant that he addressed the man at her side with the same respect that he would have shown to his own master  i may stay for tea may i she asked that is something at any rate i am going to look round at your things you dont mind do you  certainly not he answered that big fish on the wall was caught within fifty yards of this island those seabirds too were all shot from here  what strange little creatures she murmured you seem to find quite a lot of time to read and do other things beside fish mr andrew she remarked as she looked over his bookcases you puzzle me very much sometimes i had no idea she added looking at him hesitatingly that people who have to work as you have to for a living understood and read books like this  ah well he answered i had perhaps a little more education than some of them  the servant returned with some more things upon a tray jeanne sat down with a little laugh in front of the teapot she was very much afraid of saying more than was polite and she felt that she was amongst utterly strange surroundings yet it seemed to her a most extraordinary thing that a fisherman in a country village should possess a silver teapot and old worcester china and should be waited upon by a man servant even though he were the man servant of a lodger     chapter xviii   the storm died away with the coming of evening but a great sea still broke upon the island beach and floated up the estuary andrew stood outside his door and looked across toward the mainland with a perplexed frown it was barely a hundred yards crossing but it was certain that no boat could live for half the distance jeanne who had recovered her spirits stood by his side and smiled as she saw the white crested waves come rolling up  it is beautiful this she declared do you not love to feel the spray on your cheeks mr andrew and how salt it smells and fresh  that is all very well andrew answered but i am wondering how we are going to get over to the other side there  i do not think she answered that it will be possible for a long long time you will have to take me as a lodger whether you want to or not i would not trust myself in a boat even with you upon a sea like that  it will be high tide in half an hour andrew said and the sea will go down fast enough then  it may not she answered hopefully i rather believe that there is another storm blowing up  there will be no dinner for you he warned her  that i can endure cheerfully she declared i am sick of dinners i hate them they come much too soon and one has always the same things to eat i am quite sure that i shall dine quite nicely with you mr andrew  he glanced at his watch and looked out seaward it was even as she had said there were indications of another storm even while they stood there the large raindrops fell  we had better go in andrew said it is going to rain again  she clapped her hands and danced lightly back into the house she subsided into his easy chair and clasped her hands over her head  come and stand there on the hearthrug she demanded and tell me storiesstories of fishing adventures and storms and things that have happened to yourself never mind how ordinary they may seem i want to hear them remember that everything is new to me everything is interesting he accepted the inevitable at last and they talked until the twilight filled the room it was strange how much and yet how little she knew the fascination of her worldly ignorance was a thing which grew continually upon him suddenly she burst into a little peal of laughter  i was wondering she remarked whether they are waiting dinner for me i can just imagine how frightened they all are  i had forgotten all about them andrew confessed wait a moment  he left the room and walked out on to the beach the sea was still dashing its spray high over the roof of the little cottage the stones outside were wet to within a few feet of his door he looked across toward the mainland far away he fancied that he could see men carrying lanterns like willothewisps in that part of the marshes near the hall he retraced his steps to the sittingroom  i am afraid he said that it will not be possible to take you back tonight the sea is still too rough for my boat and shows no sign of going down  she clapped her hands  i am very glad she declared frankly i would very much rather stay here than go back shall we go and see what there is for dinner i can cook quite well i learnt at the convent but i have never had a chance to really try what i can do  he smiled  well he said you can do exactly what you like with the contents of my larder but so far as i am concerned i must go  go she repeated wonderingly if i cannot leave the island surely you cannot  yes he answered there is another way i am going to swim over to the mainland and let them know at the hall where you are  she was suddenly serious serious as well as disappointed  you must not she declared it is too dangerous i will not have you try it you must stay here with me i am not used to being left alone i should be very lonely indeed you must please not think of going  miss jeanne he said quietly there are many things which you do not know and you must let me tell you this that it is not possible for me to keep you here as my guest until tomorrow you cannot leave the island so i am going to i can assure you that it is nothing whatever of a swim and i shall get to the other side quite easily then i am going down to the village to get some dry clothes and i shall go up to the hall and talk to your stepmother  if you make me go back she declared i shall run away the first time i have an opportunity and if you will not have me i dare say i can find some one else who has a room to let who will  i am not your keeper he answered but please dont do anything rash until i tell you what your stepmother says  it is you who are rash she declared i do not think that i can let you go i am afraid and the water looks so cruel tonight  he laughed as he stepped outside  i am going round to leave some orders with mr berners servant he said and after that i am going you must ring for anything you want and the man will show you your room if you want to lie down i dare say though that some one will come from the hall presently the sea will be calmer in a few hours time  she walked with him to the edge of the beach when he drew off his coat and turned up his sleeves she trembled with anxiety  oh i am afraid she muttered i dont like your going in i dont like your doing this i am sorry that i ever came  he laughed a little scornfully and plunged in she watched his head appear and disappear her heart beating fast all the time once she lost sight of it altogether and screamed almost immediately he came up to the surface again and turning round waved his hand to her  i am all right he sang out going strong its quite easy  a few minutes later she saw him wading and directly afterwards he stood upon the sands opposite to her he waved his hand she put her fingers to her lips and threw him a kiss he pretended not to notice and started off toward the village and her low laugh came floating to him in a momentary lull of the wind  halfway across the marshes he changed his course clambered up a high bank on to the road and turned toward the hall barer than ever the great gaunt building seemed to stand out against the sky line but from every window lights were flashing and the windows of the diningroom seemed to reflect a perfect blaze of light andrew made his way to the back entrance and entering unobserved made his way up to his own room        dinner was over and the little party of three were settling down to their coffee and cigarettes when the princess maid came down and whispered in her mistress ear the princess turned to her host perplexed  has any one seen anything of jeanne she inquired reynolds has just told me that she has not returned at all  i thought you said that she was lying down with a headache cecil interposed eagerly  i thought so myself the princess answered early this afternoon she told me that she had no sleep last night that she had a very bad headache and that she was going to bed as a matter of fact she went out almost at once and has not returned cecil was already on his way to the door  we will send out into the village at once he said and some one must go on the marshes there are plenty of places there where it would have been absolutely unsafe for her in such a storm as we have had ring the bell forrest will you  andrew stepped in and closed the door behind him  it is not necessary he said i can tell you all about miss le mesurier     chapter xix   there was a moments breathless silence as andrew stood there looking in upon the little group then he left his position at the door and came up to the table round which they were seated  madam he said to the princess your daughter is safe she came down to the island this afternoon and was unable to return owing to the storm  the princess gave a little sigh of relief  foolish child she said but where is she now mr andrew  she is still at the island andrew answered it was impossible for her to leave so i came here to tell you of her whereabouts  it was extremely thoughtful of you the princess said graciously  if miss le mesurier was unable to leave the island how was it that you came major forrest asked looking at andrew through his eyeglass as though he were some sort of natural curiosity  i swam over andrew answered it was a very short distance  it was about this time that they all noticed the fact that andrew was wearing clothes of an altogether different fashion to the fishermans garb in which they had seen him previously the princess looked at him perplexed cecil felt instinctively that the event which he had most dreaded was about to happen  and you came up here purposely to relieve our minds mr andrew the princess said really it is most kind of you i wish that there were some way  she hesitated a slight note of question in her tone expressed also by her upraised eyebrows  i had a further reason for coming andrew said slowly i am very sorry indeed to seem inhospitable or discourteous but there is a certain matter which must be cleared up and at once i refer to the disappearance of lord ronald  there was an instants dead silence then forrest with white face leaned across the table  who the devil are you he asked  i am andrew de la borne andrew answered the owner of these poor estates which i am very well content to leave for the greater part of the time in my brothers care only that he is young and is liable to make mistakes he has made one sir i fear in offering you the hospitality of the red hall  forrest rose slowly to his feet the princess held out her hand as though to beg him not to speak she turned towards andrew  i do not understand sir she said why you have chosen to masquerade under another name and why you come now to insult your brothers guests in such a manner is what he says true cecil she added turning towards him is this man your brother  yes cecil answered sullenly he tells the truth it is just like him to make such a thundering idiot of himself  i beg your pardon andrew answered it is not i cecil who desire to come here and say these things to any guest of yours it is you who are sheltering under this roof one man at least to whom you should never have offered your hospitality the duke of westerham who has been my guest for the last few days told me all that one needs to know about you sir and your career  forrest asked no more questions he turned to cecil  mr de la borne he said i have understood that you were my host and i appeal to you is this person indeed your elder brother  yes cecil answered  you know what this means forrest continued speaking to cecil i cannot remain in this house any longer i could only accept hospitality from those who have at least learned to comport themselves as gentlemen  andrew smiled  i will not grudge you sir he said any reasonable excuse for leaving this house as quickly as may be but before you go i insist upon knowing what has become of lord ronald  cecil turned towards his brother angrily  i am sick of hearing about engleton he declared i tell you that he left here andrew on wednesday morning and caught the 95 train to london or at any rate to peterboro whether he went north south east or west is no concern of ours we only know that he promised to come back and has not come  there is more to be learnt then andrew answered how did he get to lynn station that morning  in the motor car cecil answered  who drove it andrew asked  major forrest cecil answered  it is a lie andrew declared the car never went a hundred yards beyond the gates i know that for a fact  again there was silence the princess intervened  mr andrew she begani beg your pardon mr de la bornesupposing lord ronald did wish to keep his departure and the manner of it a great secret why should it trouble you you dont suppose i presume that there has been a fight or anything of that sort  i only know andrew answered that the brother of one of my dearest friends has disappeared from this house after spending several days in the company of a man of bad reputation that is quite enough for me i am determined to get to the bottom of the matter  it is a very little matter after all the princess said calmly perhaps  she hesitated and looked at the two other men  perhaps she continued slowly it would be as well to tell you the truth  if you do not madam andrew answered it is more than probable that i shall speedily elicit it  both forrest and cecil seemed stricken speechless and before they could recover themselves the princess had commenced her story talking with easy and convincing fluency  lord ronald she said did leave here at the time you and the duke have been told and major forrest did try to drive him in the motor to lynn station when he found that that was impossible that they could not get the engine to go lord ronald left his luggage here and walked to wells that is the last we have heard of him he asked that his luggage should be sent to his rooms in london and we sent it off the next day he left here on good terms with everybody but he told us distinctly that the business on which he was summoned away was of a very unpleasant nature i think that some one was trying to blackmail him now you can make what inquiries you like but i am very certain of one thing that anything you may discover is more likely to bring discredit upon lord ronald himself than anybody else  madam andrew said your story of course i am bound to accept as the truth but i must tell you frankly that i shall pass it on to the duke who will take up his inquiries from the point you name if he finds that the facts do not correspond with what you have told me i fear that the consequences will be disagreeable for all of you  of what on earth do you suspect us major forrest asked sharply do you think that we have made away with engleton why should we we may be the adventurers you delicately suggest but at least we should have an object in our crimes engleton had not a tenpound note of ready money with him i know that for a fact because i lent him some money to pay his chauffeurs wages when he sent him away  you are perhaps holding some of his ious andrew asked  i certainly am forrest answered and the sooner i hear from him the better if you are really the owner of this house i shall leave tomorrow morning  andrew bowed coldly  that he said would certainly seem to be your best course on the contrary he added i am not altogether sure that i am justified in letting you go  the princess frowned at him indignantly  you talk nonsense my dear mr andrew or mr andrew de la borne she said if you tried to retain major forrest on such a cock and bull pretext you would be probably very soon sorry for it besides you have no power to do anything of the sort  madam andrew answered i am a magistrate and i could sign a warrant on the spot i do not however feel justified in going to such lengths i feel sure that if major forrest is wanted we shall be able to find him  of course you will the princess intervened calmly men like major forrest do not run away just because some one chooses to make a ridiculous charge against them if only i could get jeanne i would leave myself tonight  my dear princess cecil said i hope that you do not mean it my brother has said more than he means i am sure  i have said less andrew replied i have the very best reasons for believing that major forrest has lied his way into whatever friendship he may have had with lord ronald and my brother  forrest moved toward the door  mr de la borne he said to cecil you will forgive me if i decline to remain here to be insulted by your brother  the princess followed him from the room cecil and andrew were alone  dn you andrew the former said turning upon him whitefaced and with a sort of petulant anger why do you come here and spoil things like this  andrew stood upon the hearthrug and looked at his brother black and forbidding  cecil he said my life has been spoilt by paying for your excesses ever since i came of age i have been hampered all the time by paying your debts and providing you with money i even let you pose here as the master of the red hall because it pleased you i have had enough of it if you run up any more debts you must pay them yourself i am master here and i intend to remain so  cecil was suddenly pale  do you mean he asked that you intend to remain here now  andrew hesitated  your guests are leaving he said why not  but they may not go until tomorrow or the next day cecil said i cannot turn them out  andrew stood for a moment looking thoughtfully at the door  they cannot stay more than a day he said if major forrest is really their friend in any case i shall not return until they are gone  cecils face cleared a little but he was still perplexed  they had just promised he said to stay another week  if you wish to entertain the princess and miss le mesurier andrew said and they are willing to stop after what has passed i have nothing of course to say against it but the man forrest i will not have here if ever cheat and coward were written in a mans face your friend carries the marks in his  he has won nothing to speak of from me here cecil declared  you are probably too small game andrew answered how about engleton did he lose  i am not sure cecil answered not very much if anything  the princess came rustling back she held her little spaniel up to her cheek and she affected not to notice the somewhat strained attitude of the two men she went at once to andrew  mr de la borne she said i think that you have been very unjust and very rude to major forrest who is an old friend of mine i am sure that you have been misled and i am sure that some day you will ask his pardon  andrew bowed slightly and looked her straight in the face  princess he said may i ask how long you have known the gentleman who has just left us  for a very great many years she answered why  are you sure of your own knowledge andrew asked that he is really a person of good repute and against whom there have been no scandalous reports  i do not listen to gossip the princess answered major forrest goes everywhere in london and i have seen nothing in his deportment at any time to induce me to withdraw my friendship  i fancy then andrew said that some day you will find you have been a little deceived  what about lord ronald the princess asked perhaps mr de la borne you think that we are all a little company of adventurers this is such a likely spot for our operations isnt it  lord ronald andrew said is the brother of my old friend and he is of course above suspicion but lord ronald appears to have left you somewhat abruptly i might almost say mysteriously  he was here for some time the princess said and he is coming back  in the meantime andrew continued he appears to have vanished from the face of the earth  the princess turned away carelessly  that she said is scarcely our affair i have not the slightest doubt but that he will turn up again  if it should turn out that i am mistaken andrew said stiffly i should be glad to ask your pardons but from my present information i can only say i do not care to extend the hospitality of my house to major forrest nor do i consider him a fit associate madam for you and your stepdaughter  may i ask the princess inquired who major forrests traducers have been  my information andrew answered comes from the duke of westerham i have every reason to believe that the case against him has been understated  the duke cecil declared is a pigheaded old fool  andrew shrugged his shoulders  i have always found him a man of remarkably keen judgment he said  what are you going to do about jeanne the princess asked changing the subject abruptly  i should suggest andrew answered that you have a maid pack a bag and prepare to go with me over to the island early in the morning there is no chance to cross before then as the tide would be high  but how nervous she will be there all alone the princess exclaimed  my servant is there andrew answered and also an old woman who cooks for me they will i am sure do everything they can to make her comfortable i shall go myself and bring her back here as soon as it is daylight  we are giving you a great deal of trouble i am afraid mr de la borne the princess said stiffly tomorrow as soon as my maid can pack we will return to london  andrew bowed as he turned to leave the room  i trust he said that you will not let my presence interfere with your plans i shall remain on the island myself tomorrow after i have brought your daughter back     chapter xx   jeanne awoke the next morning to find herself between lavender scented sheets in a small iron bedstead with a soft seawind blowing in through the halfopen window her maid was ready to wait upon her and her bath was of salt water fresh from the sea she descended to find andrew at work in the garden the sun already high in the heavens and the sea as blue and placid as though the storm of the night before were a thing long past and forgotten  i am never going away she declared as they sat at breakfast i take your rooms monsieur andrew i will import as many chaperons as you please but i will not leave this island  i am afraid he answered smiling that there are other people who would have something to say about that your stepmother is already anxious i have promised that you shall be back at the hall by ten oclock  the gaiety suddenly faded from her face her lips which had been curved in laughter quivered  you mean that she faltered  most assuredly he answered i have no place for lodgers here as a matter of fact if you knew the truth you would admit that your staying here is quite impossible  well she said i should like to know the truth suppose you tell it me  i must confess then andrew answered that i am somewhat of a fraud berners was my friend not my lodger and i am andrew de la borne cecils elder brother  she looked at him for several moments steadily  i think that you might have told me was all she said  he shrugged his shoulders  why he asked a little brusquely i am not of your world or your stepmothers when cecil told me that he had invited some of his fashionable friends down here to stay i begged him to leave me out of it i chose to retire here and i preferred not to see any of you mine are country ways miss le mesurier i am at heart what i pretended to be fisherman countryman yokel call me what you will the other side of life cecils side doesnt appeal to me a bit i felt that it would be more comfortable for you people and for me if i kept out of the way  you class me with them she remarked quietly a little ruthlessly i think you forget that as yet i have not chosen my way in life  that is true he answered but how can you help but choose what every one of those who call themselves your friends regards as inevitable you must dance in many ballrooms and make your bow before the great ones of the earth it is a part of the penalty that you must pay for your name and riches all that i can wish you is that you lose as little of yourself as possible in the days that lie before you  i thank you she answered quietly you will let me know when you are ready to take me back  have i offended you he asked as they rose from the table i am clumsy i know and the words do not come readily to my mouth but after all you must understand  yes she said sadly i do understand  they went down to the beach and he helped her into the boat her maid sat by her side and he rowed them across with a few powerful strokes  storm and sunshine he remarked follow one another here as swiftly as in any corner of the world yesterday we had wind and thunder and rain today look the sky is cloudless the birds are singing everywhere upon the marshes the waves can do no more than ripple in upon the sands will you walk across the marshes miss jeanne or will you come to the village and wait while i send for a carriage  we will walk she answered it may be for the last time  the maid fell behind andrew and his companion who seemed smaller and slimmer than ever by his side started on their tortuous way here and there turning to the right and to the left to follow the course of some tidal stream or avoid the swampy places the faint odour of wild lavender was mingled with the brackish scent of the sea the ground was soft and spongy beneath their feet and a breeze as soft as a caress blew in their faces up before them always gaunt and bare surrounded by its belts of weatherstricken trees stood the red hall andrew looked toward it gloomily  do you wonder he asked that a man is sometimes depressed who is born the heir to a house like that and to fortunes very similar  are you poor she asked him i thought perhaps you were as your brother tried to make love to me  he frowned impatiently at her words  for heavens sake child he said dont be so cynical dont fancy that every kind word that is spoken to you is spoken for your wealth there are sycophants enough in the world heaven knows but there are men there as well give a few the credit of being honest try and remember that you are  he looked at her and away again toward the sea  that you are he repeated young enough and attractive enough to win kind words for your own sake  then she whispered leaning towards him i do not think that i am very fortunate  why not he asked  because she answered one person who might say kind things to me and whom my money would never influence a little bit in the world does not say them  are you sure he asked that you believe that there is any one in the world who would be content to take you without a penny  she shook her head  not that she said sadly i am not what you call conceited enough for that but i would like to believe that i might have a kind word or two on my own account  she tried hard to see his face but he kept it steadfastly turned away she sighed only a few yards behind the maid was walking  mr andrew she said it was you whom i meant wont you say something nice to me for my own sake  they were nearing the hall now and it seemed natural enough that he should hold her hand for a minute in his  i will tell you he said quietly that your coming has been a pleasure and your going will be a pain and i will tell you that you have left an empty place that no one else can fill you have made what our people here call the witch music upon the marshes for me so that i shall never walk here again as long as i live without hearing it and thinking of you  is that all she whispered  he pretended not to hear her  i am nearly double your age he said and i have lived an idle perhaps a worthless life i have done no harm my talents if i have any have certainly been buried if i had met you out in the world your world well i might have taught myself to forget  he broke off abruptly in his sentence cecil stood before them suddenly emerged from the handgate leading into the hall gardens at last he exclaimed taking jeanne by the hands the princess is distracted we have all been distracted how could you make us so unhappy  she drew her hands away coldly  i fancy that my stepmother she said will have survived my absence i was caught in a storm i expect that your brother has already told you about it  he looked from one to the other  so you have told her andrew he said simply  andrew nodded the three walked up toward the house in somewhat constrained silence she was trying her hardest to make andrew look at her and he was trying his hardest to resist the princess came out to them the morning was warm and she was wearing a white wrapper her toilette was not wholly completed but she was sufficiently picturesque  my dear jeanne she cried you have nearly sent us mad with anxiety how could you wander off like that  jeanne stood a little apart she avoided the princess hands she stood upon the soft turf with her hands clasped her cheeks very pale her eyes bright with some inward excitement  do you wish me to answer that question she said  the princess stared  what do you mean my child she exclaimed  you ask me jeanne said why i went wandering off into the marshes i will tell you it is because i am unhappy it is because i do not like the life into which you have brought me nor the people with whom we live i do not like late hours supper parties and dinner parties dances where half the people are bourgeois and where all the men make stupid love to me i do not like the shops the vulgar shop people fashionable clothes and fashionable promenading i am tired of it already if i am rich why may i not buy the right to live as i choose  the princess rarely allowed herself to show surprise at this moment however she was completely overcome  what is it you want then child she demanded  i should like jeanne answered to buy mr de la bornes house upon the island and live there with just a couple of maids and my books i should like some friends of course but i should like to find them for myself amongst the country people people whom i could trust and believe in not people whose clothes and manners and speech are all hammered out into a type and whose real self is so deeply buried that you cannot tell whether they are honest or rogues that is what i should like stepmother and if you wish to earn my gratitude that is how you will let me live  the princess stared at the child as though she were a lunatic  jeanne she exclaimed weakly what has become of you  nothing jeanne answered only you asked me a question and i felt an irresistible desire to answer you truthfully it would have come sooner or later  andrew turned slowly toward the girl who stood looking at her stepmother with flushed cheeks and quivering lips  miss le mesurier he said on one condition i will sell you the island but on only one  and that is she asked  the princess recovered herself just in time and sailed in between them  mr de la borne she said my daughter is too young for such conversations for two years she is under my complete guidance she must obey me just as though she were ten years older and married and i her husband the law has given me absolute control over her you understand that yourself dont you jeanne  yes jeanne answered quietly i understand  go indoors please the princess said i have something to say to mr de la borne  and i too jeanne said let me stay and say it i will not be five minutes  the princess pointed toward the door  i will not have it she said coldly cecil take my daughter indoors i insist upon it  she turned away unwillingly the princess took andrew by the arm and led him to a more distant seat  now if you please my dear mr andrew she said will you tell me what it is that you have done to my foolish little girl     chapter xxi   the princess arranged her skirts so that they drooped gracefully and turned upon her companion with one of those slow mysterious smiles which many people described but none could imitate  mr de la borne she said i can talk to you as i could not talk to your brother because you are an older and a wiser man you may not have seen much of the world but you are at any rate not a young idiot like cecil will you listen to me please  it seems to me andrew answered drily that i am already doing so  i am not going to ask you she continued whether you are in love with my little girl or not because the whole thing is too ridiculous i have no doubt that she has some sort of a fancy for you it is evident that she has i want you to remember that she is fresh from school that as yet she has not entered life and that a few months ago she did not know a man from a gatepost  an admirable simile andrew murmured  what i want you to understand is the princess continued that as yet she cannot possibly be in a position to make up her mind as to her future she has seen nothing of the world and what she has seen has been the least favourable side she has a perfectly enormous fortune so ridiculously tied up that although i am never out of debt and always borrowing money i cannot touch a penny of it not even with her help very soon she will be of age and the amount of her fortune will be known i can assure you that it will be a surprise to every one  andrew bowed his head indifferently  very possibly he answered and yet madam if your daughter has the wisdom to see that the matter of her wealth is after all but a trifle amongst the conditions which make for happiness why should you deny her the benefits of that wisdom  my dear friend she continued earnestly for this reasonbecause jeanne today is too young to choose for herself she has not got over that sickly sentimental age when a girl makes a hero of anything unusual in the shape of a man and finds a sort of unwholesome satisfaction in making sacrifices for his sake it may be that jeanne may after all look to what you call the simple life for happiness well if she does that after a year or so well and good but she shall not do so with my consent without indeed my downright opposition until she has had an opportunity of testing both sides of weighing the matter thoroughly from every point of view do you not agree with me mr de la borne  you speak reasonably madam he assented  jeanne she continued has perhaps charmed you a little she is after all just now a child of nature she is something of an artist too beautiful places and sights and sounds appeal to her  she is ready with her imperfect experience to believe that there is nothing greater or better worth cultivating in life but i want you to consider the effects of heredity jeanne comes from restless brilliant people her mother was a leader of society a pleasureloving clever unscrupulous woman her father was a financier and a diplomat manysided versatile but with as complex a disposition as any man i ever met jeanne will ripen as the years go on something of her mother something of her father will appear it is my place knowing these things to see that she does not make a fatal mistake all that i say to you mr de la borne is to let her go to give her her chance to let her see with both eyes before she does anything irremediable i think that i may almost appeal to you as a reasonable man and a gentleman to help me in this  andrew de la borne looked out through the wizened branches of his stunted trees to the whiteflecked sea rolling in below the princess was right he knew that she was right those other thoughts were little short of madness jeanne was no coquette at heart but she was a child she had great responsibilities she was turned into the world with a heavy burden upon her shoulders it was not he or any man who could help her she must fight her own battle win or lose her own happiness a few years time might see her the wife of a great statesman or a great soldier proud and happy to feel herself the means by which the man she loved might climb one step higher upon the great ladder of fame how like a childs dream these few days upon the marshes talking to one who was no more than a lookeron at the great things of life must seem he could imagine her thinking of them with a shiver as she remembered her escape the princess was right she was very right indeed he rose to his feet  madam he said i have not pretended to misunderstand you i think that you have spoken wisely your stepdaughter must solve for herself the great riddle it is not for any one of us to handicap her in her choice while she is yet a child  you are going mr de la borne she asked  he pointed to a brownsailed fishingboat passing slowly down from the village toward the sea  that is one of my boats he said i shall signal to her from the island to call for me i need a change and she is going out into the north sea for five weeks fishing  the princess held out her hand and andrew took it in his  you are a man she said i wish there were more of your sort in the world where i live  the princess stood for a moment on the edge of the lawn watching andrews tall figure as he strode across the marsh toward the village never once did he look back or hesitate on his swift vigorous way then she sighed a little and turned away toward the house after all this was a man although he was so far removed from the type she knew and understood  cecil was walking restlessly up and down the hall when she entered he drew her eagerly into the library  look here he said forrest declares that he is going he is upstairs now packing his things  your brother the princess answered scarcely left him much alternative  thats all very well cecil answered but if he goes i go i am not going to be left here alone  the princess looked at him and the colour came into his cheeks it is never well for a man when he sees such a look upon a womans face  it isnt that im afraid cecil declared i can stand any ordinary danger but i am not going to be left shut up here alone with the whole responsibility upon me i couldnt do it it wouldnt be fair to ask me  there is no fresh news i suppose the princess asked  none cecil answered gloomily if only we could see our way to the end of it i shouldnt mind  the princess was thoughtful for a few moments  well she said i dont know after all if forrest need go just yet your brother has made up his mind to go fishing for several weeks i think that he is going to start today  do you mean it cecil exclaimed incredulously  the princess nodded  he has been philandering with jeanne she said and his magnificent conscience is taking him out into the north sea  cecils features relaxed after all though he played at maturity he was little more than a boy  fancy old andrew he exclaimed gone on a child like miss jeanne too well anyhow that makes it all right about forrest staying doesnt it  he shall stop the princess answered slowly jeanne and i will stay too until monday perhaps by that time  by that time cecil repeated something may have happened     book ii  chapter i   his grace the duke of westerham stepped forward from the hearthrug in the middle of which he had been standing and held out both his hands his lips were parted in a smile and there was a twinkle in his eyes  my dear andrew he exclaimed it is delightful to see you you seem to bring the salt of the north sea into our frowsy city  andrew grasped his friends hands  i have been fishing with some of my men for three weeks he said off the dogger bank the salt does cling to one you know and i suppose i am as black as a nigger  the duke sighed a little  my dear andrew he said you make one wonder whether it is worth while to count for anything at all in the world you represent the triumph of physical fitness you could break me or a dozen like me in your hands you know what the faddists of the moment say they declare that brains and genius have had their daythat the greatest man in the world nowadays is the strongest  andrew smiled as he settled down in the armchair which his friend had wheeled towards him  you do not believe in your own doctrines he remarked you would not part with a tenth part of your brains for all my muscle  the duke paused to think  it is not only the muscle he said it is this appearance of splendid physical perfection you have but to show yourself in a london drawingroom and you will establish a cult do you want to be worshipped friend andrewto wear a laurel crown and have beautiful ladies kneeling at your feet  chuck it andrew remarked good humouredly i didnt come here to be chaffed i came here on a serious mission  the duke nodded  it must indeed have been serious he said for you to have had your hair cut and your beard trimmed and to have attired yourself in the garments of civilization you are the last man whom i should have expected to have seen in a coat which might have been cut by poole if it wasnt and wearing patent boots  jolly uncomfortable they are andrew remarked looking at them however i didnt want to be turned away from your doors and i still have a few friends in town whom i darent disgrace honestly berners i came up to ask you something  the duke was sympathetic but silent  well he remarked encouragingly  the fact is andrew continued i wonder whether you could help me to get something to do we have decided to let the red hall cecil and i the rents have gone down to nothing and altogether things are pretty bad with us i dont know that im good for anything i dont see to tell you the truth exactly what place there is in the world that i could fill nevertheless i want to do something i love the villagers life but after all there are other things to be considered i dont want to become quite a clod  the duke produced a cigar box passed it to andrew and deliberately lighted a cigar himself  friend andrew he said you have set me a puzzle you have set me a good many since i used to run errands for you at eton but i think that this is the toughest  andrew nodded  youll think your way through it if any one can he remarked i dont expect anything of course that would enable me to afford cigars like this but id be glad to find some work to do and id be glad to be paid something for it  the duke was silent for a moment he looked down at his cigar and then suddenly up again  has that young idiot of a brother of yours been making a fool of himself he asked  cecil is never altogether out of trouble andrew answered drily he seems to have taken bridge up with rather unfortunate results and there were some other debts which had to be paid but we neednt talk about those the point is that were jolly well hard up for a year or two hes got to work and so have i if it wasnt for looking after him i should go to canada tomorrow  dd young idiot the duke muttered hes spent his own money and yours too i suppose never mind the moneys gone  it isnt only the money andrew interrupted the fact is im not altogether satisfied as i told you before with living just for sport im not a prejudiced person i know that there are greater things in the world and i dont want to lose sight of them altogether we de la bornes have contributed poets and soldiers and sailors and statesmen to the history of our country for many generations i dont want to go down to posterity as altogether a drone of course im too late for anything really worth doing i know that just as well as you can tell me at the same time i want to do something and i would rather not go abroad at any rate to stay can you suggest anything to me i know its jolly difficult but you were always one of those sort of fellows who seem to see round the corner  do you want a permanent job the duke asked or would a temporary one fit you up for a time  a temporary one would be all right if it was in my line andrew answered  weve got to send three delegates to a convention to be held at the hague in a fortnights time for the revision of the international fishing laws the duke remarked could you take that on  i should think so andrew answered ive been out with the men from our part of the world since i was a child and i know pretty well all that there is to be known on our side about it what is the convention about  there are at least a dozen points to be considered the duke answered ill send you the papers to any address you like tomorrow theyre at my office now in downing street look em through and see whether you think you could take it on i have two men already appointed but they are both lawyers and i wanted some one who knew more about the practical side of it  i should think andrew remarked that this is my job down to the ground whats the fee  the fees all right the duke answered you wont grumble about that i promise you youll get a lump sum and so much a day but the whole thing of course will be over in a fortnight what to do with you after that i cant for the moment think  we may hit upon something andrew said cheerfully what are you doing for lunch will you come round to the travellers with me its the only london club ive kept going but i dare say we can get something fit to eat there  im jolly sure of it the duke answered but while youre in london youre going to do your lunching with me well go to the athenaeum and show these sicklylooking scholars and bishops what a man should look like its almost time for luncheon isnt it  past andrew answered it was halfpast twelve when i got here  then we will leave at once the duke declared i have nothing to do this morning fortunately you dont care about driving i know well walk it isnt half a mile  they turned into the street together  by the by the duke asked what has become of your brothers friends i mean the little party that we broke into so unceremoniously  the princess and miss le mesurier are i believe in london andrew answered i was very surprised to hear this morning that forrest was still down at the red hall with cecil by the by ronald has turned up again of course  the duke hesitated for so long that andrew turned towards him and noticed for the first time the anxious lines in his face  since the day he left the red hall the duke said ronald has neither been seen nor heard from i forgot that you had been outside civilization for nearly a month although i have tried hard i have not been able to keep the affair altogether out of the papers  andrew was thunderstruck  good god he exclaimed why berners this is one of the strangest things i ever heard of what are you doing about it  i am employing detectives the duke answered i do not see what else i could do they have been down to the red hall in fact i believe one of them is still in the vicinity your brothers story as to his departure seems to be quite in order although no one at the railway station is able to remember his travelling by that train they seem to remember the car however which is practically the same thing and several people saw major forrest bringing it back early in the morning  did any one andrew asked slowly see lord ronald in the car on his way to the station  not a soul the duke answered  andrew was honestly perplexed jeannes statement that she had seen forrest leaving the red hall with the car empty except for himself he had never regarded seriously even now he could only conclude that she had been mistaken  have any large cheques been presented against your brothers account he asked  the duke shook his head  not one he answered  have the detectives any clue at all  not the ghost of one the duke answered ronald had a few harmless little entanglements but absolutely nothing that could have proved of any anxiety to him he had several engagements during the last ten days which i know that he meant to keep something must have happened to him god knows when or where but here we are at the club andrew i see that you have no umbrella so i need not repeat the old joke about the bishops  what a selfish fellow i am andrew remarked as they seated themselves at a small table in the luncheon room here have i been bothering you about my affairs and all the time you have had this thing on your mind berners i want you to tell me something  go ahead the duke answered  have you any idea in your head that ronald has come to any harm at the red hall  the duke shook his head  no he answered decidedly frankly if he had been there with forrest alone that would have been my first idea but with your brother there and the princess it is impossible to suspect anything even if one knew what to suspect the only possible clue as to his disappearance which is connected in any way with the red hall is that i understand he was paying attentions to miss le mesurier which she was disinclined to accept  andrew nodded  i think he said that is probable  on the other hand the duke continued ronald isnt in the least the sort of man to make away with himself or hide because a girl whom he could not have known very well refused to marry him  have you seen anything of the princess in town andrew asked a little irrelevantly  i met her with her stepdaughter at hereford house last night the duke answered the princess was looking as brilliant as ever but the little girl was pale and bored she had a dozen men around her and not a smile for one of them dull little thing i should think  andrew said nothing he was looking out of the window upon pall mall but his eyes saw a little sandy hillock with blades of sprouting grass behind the lavenderstreaked marsh in front the yellow sands and the rippling sea the sun seemed to warm his cheeks the salt wind blew in his face westerham wondered for a moment what his friend saw in the grey flagged street to bring that faint reminiscent smile to his lips  a messenger from the hall outside came in and respectfully addressed the duke  your grace is wanted upon the telephone he announced  the duke excused himself he was absent only for a few minutes and when he returned and took his place he leaned over towards andrew  my message was from the detective he said he wants to see me in fact he is coming round here directly     chapter ii   cecil came face to face with his brother in the room where refreshments were being dispensed by solemnlooking footmen and trim parlourmaids he stared at him for a moment in surprise  what on earth are you doing here andrew he asked  exactly what i was wondering myself andrew answered setting down his empty glass i met bellamy smith this afternoon in bond street and he asked me to dine without saying anything about this sort of show afterwards by the by cecil he added what are you doing in town i thought you said that you were not coming up until the late autumn  no more i am for any length of time cecil answered i am up for the day back tomorrow there were one or two things i wanted and it was easier to come up and see about them than to write  is forrest still with you andrew asked  cecil hesitated and his brother had an unpleasant conviction that for a moment he was uncertain whether to tell the truth or no  yes cecil answered he is still there i know you dont like him andrew but he really isnt a bad sort and hes quite a sportsman  does he play cards with you andrew asked  never even suggested it cecil declared eagerly fact is were out shooting all day duck shooting or fishing or motoring and we go to bed soon after dinner  you cant come to much harm at that andrew admitted by the by do you know that engleton has never turned up  i have heard so cecil admitted i am not so surprised  why not andrew asked  cecil raised his eyebrows in a superior manner  well he said i know he was very sick about his brother looking too closely into his concerns he has a little affair on just now that he wants to keep to himself and i think that that is the reason he went off so quietly  his brother is very upset about it andrew remarked  oh the duke was always a heavy old stick cecil answered i see youve been doing your duty tonight he added making a determined effort to change the conversation  andrew nodded  do i look so hot he asked i am not used to these close rooms or dancing either unfortunately they seem short of men and mrs bellamy smith had me set  cecil grinned  thats the worst of dining before a dance he remarked youre pretty well cornered before the crowd comes upon my word old chap he added looking his brother up and down with an air of kindly patronage you dont turn out half badly country tailor still eh  mind your own business you young jackanapes andrew answered do you think that no one can wear town clothes except yourself  cecil laughed after all considering everything andrew was a goodnatured fellow  by the by he said do you know who is here this evening  andrew demolished another sandwich  every one i should think he answered i never saw such a crowd in my life  the princess and jeanne are here cecil said i dont suppose we shall either of us get near them people are getting to know about jeannes little dot and they are fairly mobbed everywhere  andrew stood for a moment quite still his first emotion was one of dismay and cecil noticing it laughed at him  you can go ahead with your little flirtation he remarked i had quite forgotten that you neednt consider me i havent a chance with miss jeanne shes too cranky a young person for me i like something with a little more go in it  cecil drifted away and andrew glanced at his card there were two dances for which he was still engaged and he made his way slowly back to the ballroom there was a slight block at the entrance and he had to stand aside to let several couples pass out one of the last of these was jeanne on the arm of young bellamy smith andrew stood quite still looking at her he saw her start for a moment as she recognized him and her eyes swept him over with a half incredulous half startled expression she drew a little breath and then andrew saw her suddenly and instinctively stiffen she looked him in the face and bowed very slightly without the vestige of a smile  how do you do mr de la borne she said as she passed on without taking the slightest notice of the hand which forgetting where he was he had half extended towards her  andrew went on into the ballroom found his partner and danced with her as soon as he could he made his adieux and hurried off to the cloakroom his coat was already upon his arm when cecil discovered him  what are you bolting off for old man he asked  ive had enough andrew answered i cant stand the atmosphere and i hate dancing as you know see you tomorrow cecil i want to have a talk with you i am going away for a few weeks  right oh cecil answered but you cant go just yet mademoiselle le mesurier sent me for you she wants to speak to you at once  andrew hesitated  do you mean this cecil he asked  of course i do cecil answered i havent been rushing about looking into every corner of the place for nothing come along ill take you to where she is  andrew handed back his coat and hat to the attendant and followed cecil into the ballroom in a passage leading to the billiardroom where several chairs had been arranged for sitting out jeanne was ensconced with two men leaning over her she waved them away when she saw who it was coming without a smile or the vestige of one she motioned to andrew to take the vacant seat by her side  i have executed your commission miss le mesurier cecil said bowing before her i will claim my reward when we meet again  he sauntered away leaving them alone jeanne turned at once towards her companion  i am sorry she said if my sending for you was in any way an annoyance i understand of course you have made it quite clear to me that our little friendship or whatever you may choose to call it is at an end but i do insist upon knowing what it was that you and my stepmother were discussing for nearly half an hour in the gardens of the red hall the truth mind you and i should owe one another that  we talked of you he answered what other subject can you possibly imagine your stepmother and i could have in common  that is a good start she answered now tell me the rest  i am not sure he answered that i feel inclined to do that  she leaned forward and looked at him unwillingly he turned his head to meet her gaze  you must tell me please she said i insist upon knowing  your stepmother he said was perfectly reasonable and very candid she reminded me that you were a great heiress and that as yet you had seen nothing of the world i do not know why she thought it necessary to point this out to me except that perhaps she thought that in some mad moment i might have conceived the idea that you  that i she repeated softly as he hesitated  he set his teeth hard and frowned  you know what i mean he said coldly your stepmother is a clever woman and a woman of the world she takes into account all contingencies never mind how improbable they might be she was afraid that i might think things were possible between us which after all must always remain outside serious consideration she wanted to warn me that was all it was kindness but i am sure that it was unnecessary  you are not very lucid she murmured it is because i am a great heiress then that you go off fishing for three weeks without saying goodbye that you leave our next meeting to happen by chance in the last place i should have expected to see you what do you think of me mr andrew do you imagine that i am of my stepmothers world or ever could be have the hours we have spent together taught you nothing different  you are a child he answered evasively you do not know as yet to what world you will belong it is as your stepmother said to me with your fortune you may marry into one of the great families of europe you might almost take a part in the worlds history it is not for such as myself to dream of interfering with a destiny such as yours may be  for that reason she remarked leaning a little towards him you went fishing in a dirty little boat with those common sailors for three weeks for that reason you bow to me when you meet me as though i were an acquaintance whom you barely remembered for that reason i suppose you were hurrying away when your brother found you  it was the inevitable thing to do he answered you may think today one thing but it is for others who are older and wiser than you to remember that you are only a child and that you have not realized yet the place you fill in the world if it pleases you to know it let me tell you that i am very glad indeed that you came to salthouse you have made me think more seriously you have made me understand that after all the passing life is short that idle days and physical pleasures do not make up the life which is worthiest i am going to try other things for the inspiration which bids me seek them i have to thank you  she touched his great brown hand with the delicate tips of her fingers  dear mr andrew she said you are very big and strong and obstinate you will have your own way however i may plead go then and strike your great blows upon the anvil of life you say that i am passing the threshold that as yet i am ignorant very well i will make my way in with the throng i will look about me and see what this thing life is and how much more it may mean to me because i chance to be the possessor of many illearned millions before very long we will meet again and compare notes only i warn you mr andrew that if any change comes it comes to you i am one of the outsiders who has looked into life and who knows very well what is there even from across the borders  he rose at once to stay there was worse torture than to go  so it shall be he said we will each take our draught of experience and we will meet again and speak of the flavour of it only remember that whatever may be your lot hold fast to those simple things which we have spoken of together and the darkest days of all can never come  she gave him her hand and flashed a look at him which he was not likely to forget  so she said simply i shall remember     chapter iii   the princess was enjoying a few minutes of wellearned repose she had lunched with jeanne at ranelagh where they had been the guests of a lady who certainly had the right to call herself one of the leaders of society the newspapers and the princess confidences to a few of her friends had done all that was really necessary jeanne was accepted and the princess passed in her wake through those innermost portals which at one time had come perilously near being closed upon her she was lying on a sofa in a white negligee gown jeanne had just brought in a pile of letters mostly invitations the princess glanced them through and smiled as she tossed them on one side  how these people amuse one she exclaimed eighteen months ago i was in london alone and not a soul came near me today because i am the guardian of a young lady whom the world believes to be a great heiress people tumble over one another with their invitations and their courtesies  jeanne looked up  why do you say believes to be she asked quickly i am a great heiress am i not  the princess smiled a slow enigmatic smile which might have meant anything but which to jeanne meant nothing at all  my dear child she said of course you are the papers have said so society has believed them if i were to go out and declare right and left that you had nothing but a beggarly twenty thousand pounds or so i should not find a soul to believe me every one would believe that i was trying to scare them off to keep you for myself or some one of my own choice really it is a very odd world  jeanne was looking a little pensive her stepmother sometimes completely puzzled her  who are the trustees of my money she asked a little abruptly  the princess raised her eyebrows  bless the child she exclaimed what do you know about trustees  when i am of age jeanne said calmly which will happen sometime or other i suppose it will interest me to know exactly how much money i have and how it is invested  the princess looked a little startled  my dear jeanne she exclaimed pray dont talk like that until after you are married your money is being very well looked after what i should like you to understand is this you are going to meet tonight at dinner the man whom i intend you to marry  jeanne raised her eyebrows  i had some idea she murmured of choosing a husband for myself  impossible the princess declared you have had no experience and you are far too important a person to be allowed to think of such a thing tonight at dinner you will meet the count de brensault he is a belgian of excellent family quite rich and very much attracted by you i consider him entirely suitable and i have advised him to speak to you seriously  thank you jeanne said but i dont like belgians and i do not mean to marry one  the princess laughed a little unpleasantly  my dear child she said you may make a fuss about it but eventually you will have to marry whom i say you must remember that you are french not english and that i am your guardian if you want to choose for yourself you will have to wait three or four years before the law allows you to do so  then i will wait three or four years jeanne answered quietly i have no idea of marrying the count de brensault  the princess raised herself a little on her couch  child she said you would try any ones patience only a month or so ago you told me that you were quite indifferent as to whom you might marry you were content to allow me to select some one suitable  a few months jeanne answered are sometimes a very long time my views have changed since then  you mean the princess said that you have met some one whom you wish to marry  perhaps so jeanne answered at any rate i will not marry the count de brensault  the princess face had darkened  i do not wish to quarrel with you jeanne she said but i think that you will whom else is it that you are thinking of is it our island fisherman who has taken your fancy  does that matter jeanne answered calmly is it not sufficient if i say that i will not marry the count de brensault  no it is not quite sufficient the princess remarked coldly you will either marry the man whom i have chosen or give me some definite and clear reason for your refusal  one very definite and clear reason jeanne remarked is that i do not like the count de brensault i think that he is a noisy forward and offensive young man  his income is nearly fifty thousand a year the princess remarked so he must be forgiven a few eccentricities of manner  his income jeanne said scarcely matters does it if my money is ever to do anything for me it should at least enable me to choose a husband for myself  thats where you girls always make such absurd mistakes the princess remarked you get an idea or a liking into your mind and you hold on to it like wax you forget that the times may change new people may come the old order of things may pass altogether away suppose for instance you were to lose your money  i should not be sorry jeanne answered calmly i should at least be sure that i was not any longer an article of merchandise i could lead my own life and marry whom i pleased  the princess laughed scornfully  men do not take to themselves penniless brides nowadays she remarked  some men jeanne began  the princess interrupted her  bah she said you are thinking of your island fisherman again i see by the papers that he has gone away he is very wise he may be a very excellent person but the whole world could not hold a less suitable husband for you  jeanne smiled  well she said we shall see i certainly do not think that he will ever ask me to marry him he is one of those whom my gold does not seem to attract  he is clumsy the princess remarked a word of encouragement would have brought him to your feet  if i had thought so jeanne remarked i would have spoken it  the princess looked across at her stepdaughter searchingly  tell me the truth jeanne she said have you been idiot enough to really care for this man  that jeanne answered is a subject which i cannot discuss with any one not even you  it is all very well the princess answered but whatever happens i must see that you do not make an idiot of yourself it is very important indeed for more reasons than you know of  jeanne looked up  such as she asked  the princess hesitated there were two evils before her it was not possible to escape from both she found herself weighing the chances of each of them their nearness to disaster  well she said great fortunes even like yours are not above the chances of the moneymarkets your fortune or a great part of it might go what would happen to you then you would be a pauper  jeanne smiled  i can see nothing terrifying in that she answered but at the same time i do not think that a fortune such as mine is a very fluctuating affair  you are right of course the princess said you will be one of the richest young women in the country there is nothing to prevent it it is a good thing that you have me to look after you  jeanne leaned a little forward in her chair and looked steadfastly at her stepmother  i suppose she said that you are right you know the world at any rate and you are clever but often you puzzle me why at first did you want me to marry major forrest  the princess face seemed suddenly to harden  i never wished you to she said coldly however we will not talk about that for certain reasons i think that it would be well for you to be married before you actually come of age that is why i have invited the count de brensault here tonight  jeannes dark eyes were fixed curiously upon the princess  sometimes she said i do not altogether understand you why should there be all this nervous haste about my marriage do you know that it would trouble me a great deal more only that i have absolutely made up my mind that nothing will induce me to marry any one whom i do not really care for  the princess raised her head and for a moment the woman and the girl looked at one another it was almost a duelthe princess intense almost threatening regard and jeannes set face and steadfast eyes  my father left me all this money jeanne said that i might be happy not miserable i am quite determined that i will not ruin my life before it has commenced i do not wish to marry at all for several years i think that you have brought me into what you call society a good deal too soon i would rather study for a little time and try and learn what the best things are that one may get out of life i am afraid from your point of view that i am going to be a failure i do not care particularly about dances or the people we have met at them i think that in another few weeks i shall be as bored as the most fashionable person in london  a servant knocked at the door announcing major forrest jeanne rose to her feet and passed out by another door the princess made no attempt to stop her     chapter iv   the princess looked up with illconcealed eagerness as forrest entered  well she asked have you any news  forrest shook his head  none he answered i am up for the day only cecil will not let me stay any longer he was here himself the day before yesterday we take it by turns to come away  and there is nothing to tell me the princess asked no change of any sort  none forrest answered it is no good attempting to persuade ourselves that there is any  what are you up for then she asked  he laughed hardly  i am like a diver he answered who has to come to the surface every now and then for fresh air life down at salthouse is very nearly the acme of stagnation our only excitement day by day is the dangerand the hope  is cecil getting braver the princess asked  i think that he is a little forrest answered  the princess nodded  we met him at the bellamy smiths she said it was quite a reunion andrew was there and the duke  forrests face darkened  meddling fool he muttered do you know that there are two detectives now in salthouse they come and go and ask all manner of questions one of them pretends that he believes engleton was drowned and walks always on the beach and hires boatmen to explore the creeks the other sits in the inn and bribes the servants with drinks to talk but dont lets talk about this any longer how is jeanne  we are going the princess said quietly to have trouble with that child  why forrest asked  she is developing a conscience the princess remarked where she got it from heaven knows it wasnt from her father i can answer for that  anything else forrest asked  it is a curious thing the princess replied but ever since those few days down at that tumbledown old place of cecil de la bornes she seems to have developed in a remarkable manner i dont know how much nonsense she talked with that fisherman of hers but some of it at any rate seems to have stuck i am sure she added with a little sigh that we are going to have trouble  forrest smiled grimly  so far as im concerned he remarked the trouble has arrived ive a good mind to chuck it altogether  the princess looked up worn though her face was she possessed one feature her eyes which still entitled her to be called a beautiful woman she looked at forrest steadily and he felt himself growing uncomfortable before the contempt of her steady regard  i wonder how it is she said pensively that all men are more or less cowards you shield yourselves by speaking of an attack of nerves it is nothing more nor less than cowardice  i believe you are right forrest assented im not the man i was  you are not the princess agreed it is well for you that you have had me to look after you or you would have gone to pieces altogether you talk of giving up cards and retiring to the continent my dear man what do you propose to live on  he did not answer he had bullied this woman for a good many years now he felt that the tables were being turned upon him  what has become of the de la borne money she asked i never thought that you would get it but he paid up every cent didnt he  forrest nodded  he did he admitted or rather his brother did for him i lost four hundred at goodwood and there were some of my creditors i simply had to give a little to or they would have pulled me up altogether you talk about nerves ena but hang it all its enough to give anyone the hum to lead the sort of life ive had to lead for the last few years im nothing more nor less than a common adventurer  whatever you are the princess answered steadily you are too old to change your life or the manner of it one can start again afresh on the other side of forty but at fifty the thing is hopeless fortunately you have me  you he repeated bitterly you mean that i can dip into your purse for pocketmoney when you happen to have any i have done too much of it you forget that there is one way into a new world at any rate  the princess smiled  my dear nigel she said it is a way which you will never take dont think i mean to be unkind when i say that you have not the courage however we will not talk about that i sent for you to tell you that de brensault is really in earnest about jeanne he is dining here tonight i will get some other people and we will have bridge de brensault is conceited and a bad player and what is most important of all he can afford to lose  forrest began to look a little less gloomy  you were fortunate he remarked to get hold of de brensault there are not many of his sort about i am afraid though that he will not make much of an impression upon jeanne  the princess face hardened  if jeanne is going to be obstinate she said she must suffer for it de brensault is just the man i have been looking for he wants a young wife and although he is rich he is greedy he is the sort of person i can talk to in fact i have already given him a hint  forrest nodded understandingly  but ena he said if he really does shell out wont you be sailing rather close to the wind  she shrugged her shoulders  i am not afraid she said i know de brensault and his sort if he feels that he has been duped he will keep it to himself he is too vain a man to allow the world to know it poor jeanne i am afraid i am very much afraid that he will take it out of her  i do not quite see forrest said reflectively how you are going to make jeanne marry any one especially in this country  jeanne is french not english the princess remarked and she is not of age a mother has considerable authority legally as i dare say you are aware we may not be able to manage it in england but i think i can guarantee that if de brensault doesnt disappoint us the wedding will take place  forrest helped himself to a cigarette from an open box by his side  i think he said that if it comes off we ought to go to the states for a year or so they dont know us so well there and those people are the easiest duped of any in the world  the princess nodded  i have thought of that she remarked there are only one or two little things against it however we will see you had better go now i have some callers coming and must make myself respectable  she gave him her hands and he raised them to his lips her eyes followed him as he turned away and left the room for a few moments she was thoughtful then she shrugged her shoulders  well she said all things must come to an end i suppose  she rang the bell and sent for jeanne it was ten minutes however before she appeared  what have you been doing the princess asked with a frown  finishing some letters jeanne answered calmly did you want me particularly  to whom were you writing the princess demanded  to monsieur laplanche for one person jeanne answered calmly  the princess raised her eyebrows  and what had you she asked to say to monsieur laplanche  i have written to ask him a few particulars concerning my fortune jeanne answered  such as the princess inquired steadily  i want to know jeanne said at what age it becomes my own and how much it amounts to it seems to me that i have a right to know these things and as you will not tell me i have written to monsieur laplanche  the princess held out her hand  give me the letter she said  jeanne made no motion to obey  do you object to my writing she asked  i object the princess said to your writing anybody on any subject without my permission and so far as regards the information you have asked for from monsieur laplanche i will tell you all that you want to know  i prefer jeanne said steadily to hear it from monsieur laplanche himself there are times when you say things which i do not understand i have quite made up my mind that i will have things made plain to me by my trustee  the princess was outwardly calm but her eyes were like steel  you are a foolish child she said i am your guardian you have nothing whatever to do with your trustees they exist to help me not you everything that you wish to know you must learn from me it is not until you are of age that any measure of control passes from me give me that letter  jeanne hesitated for a moment then she turned toward the door  no she said i am going to post it  the princess rose from her chair and crossing the room locked the door  jeanne she said come here  the girl hesitated in the end she obeyed the princess reached out her hand and struck her on the cheek  give me that letter she commanded  jeanne shrank back the suddenness of the blow its indignity and these new relations which it seemed designed to indicate bewildered her she stood passive while the princess took the letter from her fingers and tore it into pieces then she unlocked the door  go to your room jeanne she ordered  jeanne heard the sound of people ascending the stairs and this time she did not hesitate the princess drew a little breath and looked at the fragments of the letter in the grate it was victory of a sort but she realized very well that the ultimate issue was more doubtful than ever in her room jeanne would have time for reflection if she chose she might easily decide upon the one step which would be irretrievable     chapter v   the count de brensault was a small man with a large pale face there were puffy little bags under his eyes from which the colour had departed his hair though skilfully arranged was very thin at the top and his figure had the lumpiness of the man who has never known any sort of athletic training he looked a dozen years older than his age which was in reality thirtyfive and for the last ten years he had been a constant though cautious devotee of every form of dissipation jeanne who sat by his side at dinnertime found herself looking at him more than once in a sort of fascinated wonder was it really possible that any one could believe her capable of marrying such a creature there were eight people at dinner in none of whom she was in the least interested the count de brensault talked a good deal and very loudly he spoke of his horses and his dogs and his motor cars but he omitted to say that he had ceased to ride his horses and that he never drove his motor car jeanne listened to him in quiet contempt and the princess fidgetted in her chair the man ought to know that this was not the way to impress a child fresh from boardingschool  you seem jeanne remarked after listening to him almost in silence for a long time to give most of your time to sports do you play polo  he shook his head  i am too heavy he said and the game it is a little dangerous  do you hunt she asked  no he admitted in belgium we do not hunt  do you race with your motor cars  i entered one he answered for the prix des ardennes it was the third my driver he was not very clever  you did not drive it yourself then she asked  he laughed in a superior manner  i do not wish he said to have a broken neck there are so many things in life which i still find very pleasant  he smiled at her in a knowing manner and jeanne looked away to hide her disgust  your interest in sport she remarked seems to be a sort of secondhand one does it not  i do not know that he answered i do not know quite what you mean at ostend last year i won the great sweepstakes  for shooting pigeons she asked  so he admitted with content  she smiled  i see that i must beg your pardon she said have you ever done any big game shooting  he shook his head  i do not like to travel very much he answered i do not like the cooking and i think that my tastes are what you would call very civilized  the princess intervened she felt that it was necessary at any cost to do so  the count she told jeanne has just been elected a member of the fourinhand club here if we are very nice to him he will take us out in his coach  as soon de brensault interposed hastily as i have found another team not quite so what you call spirited my black horses are very beautiful but i do not like to drive them they pull very hard and they always try to run away  the princess sighed the man after all was really a little hopeless she saw clearly that it was useless to try and impress jeanne the affair must take its course afterwards in the drawingroom the count came and sat by jeannes side  always he declared in england it is bridge one dines with ones friends and one would like to talk for a little time and it is bridge it must be very dull for you little girls who are not old enough to play there is no one left to talk to you  jeanne smiled  perhaps she said i am an exception there are very few people whom i care to have talk to me  she looked him in the eyes but he was unfortunately a very spoilt young man and he only stroked the waxed tip of a scanty moustache  i am very glad to hear you say so mademoiselle he said that makes it the more pleasant that your excellent mother gives me one quarter of an hours respite from bridge that we may have a little conversation have you ever been in my country miss le mesurier  i have only travelled through it jeanne answered but i am afraid that you did not understand what i meant just now i said that there were very few people with whom i cared to talk you are not one of those few monsieur le comte  he looked at her with a halfopen mouth his eyes were suddenly like beads  i do not understand he said  i am afraid jeanne answered with a sigh that you are very unintelligent what i meant to say was that i do not like to sit here and talk with you it wearies me because you do not say anything that interests me and i should very much rather read my book  the count de brensault was nonplussed he looked at jeanne and he looked vaguely across the room at the princess as though wondering whether he ought to appeal to her  have i offended you he asked perhaps i have said something that you do not like i am sorry  no it is not that at all jeanne answered sweetly it is simply that i do not like you you must not mind if i tell you the truth you see i have only just come from boardingschool and there we were always taught to be quite truthful  de brensault stared at her again this was the most extraordinary young woman whom he had ever met in his life had not the princess only an hour ago told him that although he might find her a little difficult at first she was nevertheless prepared to receive his advances he had imagined himself dazzling her a little with his title and possessions gracefully throwing the handkerchief at her feet and giving her that slight share in his life and affection which his somewhat continental ideas of domesticity suggested had she really meant to be rude to him or was she nervous he looked at her once more still with that unintelligent stare jeanne was perfectly composed with her pale cheeks and large serious eyes she was obviously speaking the truth then as he looked the expression in his eyes changed she was gradually becoming desirable not only on account of her youth and dowrythere were other things he felt a sudden desire to kiss those very shapely somewhat full lips which had just told him so calmly that their owner disliked him already he was telling himself in his mind that some day when she was his altogether for a plaything or what he chose to make of her he would remind her of this evening  i am sorry he said that you do not like me but that is because you are not used to men presently you will know me better and then i am sure it will be different as for you he continued looking at her in a manner which he felt should certainly awaken some different feeling in her inexperienced heart i admire you very much indeed i have seen you only once or twice but i have thought of you much some day i hope that we shall be very much better friends  he leaned a little toward her and jeanne calmly removed herself a little further away she turned her head now to look at him as she sat upright upon the sofa very slim and graceful in her white gown  i do not think so she said i do not care about being friendly with people whom i dislike and i am beginning to dislike you very much indeed because you will not go away when i ask you  he rose to his feet a little offended  very well he said i will go and talk to your stepmother who wants me to play bridge but very soon i shall come back and before long i think that i am going to make you like me very much  he crossed the room and jeannes eyes followed his awkward gait with a sudden flash of quiet amusement she watched him talk to her stepmother and she saw the princess face darken as a matter of fact de brensault felt that he had some just cause for complaint  dear princess he said you did not tell me that she was so very farouche so very shy indeed i speak to her quite kindly and she tells me that she does not like me and that she wished me to go away  the princess looked across the room towards jeanne who was calmly reading and apparently oblivious of everything that was passing  my dear count she said tapping his hand with her fan she is very very serious she would like to have been a nun but of course we would not hear of it i think that she was a little afraid of you you looked at her very boldly you know and she is not used to the glances of men at her age perhapsyou understand  the count was not quite sure that he did understand he had a most unpleasant recollection of the firmness and decision with which jeanne had announced her views with regard to him but he looked towards her again and the look was fatal jeanne was certainly a most desirable young person quite apart from her dowry  it may be as you say princess he said i must leave her to you for a little time you must talk to her she is quite pretty he added with an involuntary note of condescension in his tone i am very pleased with her in fact i am quite attracted  you will remember the princess said dropping her voice a little that before anything definite is said you and i must have a little conversation  de brensault twirled his moustache he looked up at the princess as though trying to fathom the meaning of her words  certainly he answered slowly i have not forgotten what you said of course her dot is very large is it not  it is very large indeed the princess answered and there are a great many young men who would be very grateful to me indeed if i were willing even to listen to them  de brensault nodded  very well he said we will have that little talk whenever you like  the princess nodded  i suppose she said we must play bridge now they are waiting for us  de brensault looked behind to where jeanne was still sitting reading her head was resting upon a sofa pillow deep orange coloured against which the purity of her complexion the delicate lines of her eyebrows the shapeliness of her exquisite mouth were all more than ever manifest she read with interest and without turning her head away from the pages of the book which she held in long slender fingers de brensault sighed as he turned away  certainly he said we will go and play bridge but i will tell you what it is my dear princess i think i am very near falling in love with your little stepdaughter     chapter vi   forrest crossed the room and waited his opportunity until the princess was alone  let me take you somewhere he said i want to talk to you  she laid her fingers upon his arm and they walked slowly away from the crowded part of the ballroom  so you are up again she remarked looking at him curiously does that mean  it means nothing worse luck he answered except that i have twentyfour hours leave i am off back again at eight oclock tomorrow morning tell me about this de brensault affair how is it going on  well enough on his side she answered the amusing part of it is that the more jeanne snubs him the keener he gets he sends roses and chocolates every day and positively haunts the house i never was so tired of any one  make him your soninlaw quickly he said grimly youll see little enough of him then  im not sure the princess said reflectively whether it is quite wise to hurry jeanne so much  wise or not forrest said it must be done even supposing the other affair comes out all right london is getting impossible for me i dont know whos at the bottom of it but people have stopped sending me invitations and even at my pothouse of a club the men seem to have as little to say to me as possible some ones at work spreading reports of some sort or another i am not over sensitive but the things becoming an impossibility  do you suppose she asked quietly that it is the engleton affair  he nodded  people are saying all sorts of things he answered id go abroad tomorrow and leave de la borne to look out for himself but i havent even the money to pay my railway fare  the princess shrugged her shoulders expressively  oh im not begging he continued i know youre pretty well in the same box  that the princess remarked scarcely expresses it i am a great deal worse off than you because i have a houseful of unpaid servants and a mob of tradespeople who are just beginning to clamour i see that you are looking at my necklace she continued i can assure you that i have not a single real stone left everything i possess that isnt in pawn is of paste  then dont you see ena he said that this thing really must be hurried forward de brensault is ready enough isnt he  quite she answered  and he understands the position  i think so the princess answered i have given him to understand it pretty clearly  then have a clear business talk with him forrest said and then have it out with jeanne you could all go abroad together and they could be married at the embassy say at paris  jeanne is the only difficulty the princess said it would suit me better for upon my word i dont know where i could get credit for her trousseau  it isnt any use waiting forrest said i have watched them together and i am sure of it de brensault isnt one of those fellows who improve upon acquaintance look there they are nothing very loverlike about that is there  de brensault and jeanne were crossing the room together only the very tips of her fingers rested upon his coatsleeve and there was a marked aloofness about her walk and the carriage of her head he was saying something to her to which she seemed to be paying the scantiest of attention her head was thrown back and in her eyes was a great weariness suddenly just as they reached the entrance they saw her whole expression change a wave of colour flooded her cheeks her eyes were suddenly filled with life they saw her lips part her hands were outstretched to greet the man who crossing the room had stopped at her summons both the princess and forrest frowned when they saw who it was it was andrew de la borne  that infernal fisherman forrest muttered i saw in the paper that he had returned this afternoon from the hague  the princess made an involuntary movement forward but forrest checked her  you can do no good he said wait and see what happens  what did happen was very simple and for the count de brensault a little humiliating jeanne passed her arm through the newcomers and with the curtest of nods to her late companion disappeared through an open doorway the belgian stood looking after them twirling his moustache with shaking fingers his face was paler even than usual and he was shaking with anger  leave him alone for a few minutes forrest said to the princess you will do no good at all by speaking to him just now ena it is absolutely necessary that you make jeanne understand the state of affairs  i think the princess said thoughtfully that it will be best to take her away from london lately i have noticed a development in jeanne which i do not altogether understand she has begun to think for herself most unpleasantly she plays at being a child with de brensault but that is simply because it is the easiest way to repulse him  meanwhile jeanne whose face was transfigured and whose whole manner was changed was sitting with her companion in the quietest corner they could find  it is delightful to see you again she said frankly i do not think that any one ever felt so lonely as i do  he smiled  i can assure you that i find it delightful to be back again he said although i have enjoyed my work very much by the by who introduced you to the man whom you were with when i found you  my stepmother she answered he is the man by the by whom i am told i am to marry  andrew looked as he felt for a moment shocked  i am sorry to hear that he said quietly  you need not be afraid she answered i am not of age and i was brought up in a country where ones guardians have a good deal of authority but nothing in the world would ever induce me to marry a creature like that  his face cleared somewhat  i am very surprised he said that your stepmother should have thought of it he is an unfit companion for any selfrespecting woman  i do not understand jeanne said quietly why they are so anxious that i should marry quickly but i know that my stepmother thinks of nothing else in connection with me look they are coming through the conservatories let us go out by the other door  they came face to face with a tall gravelooking man who wore an order around his neck andrew stopped suddenly  i should like he said to jeanne to introduce you to my friend you have met him before down at the red hall and on the island but that scarcely counts westerham this is miss le mesurier you remember that you saw her at salthouse  the duke shook hands with the girl looking at her attentively his manner was kind but his eyes seemed to be questioning her all the time  i am very glad to know you miss le mesurier he said my friend andrew here has spoken of you to me  they remained talking together for some minutes until in fact forrest and the princess who were in pursuit of them appeared the princess looked curiously at the duke and forrest frowned heavily when he recognized him there was a moments almost embarrassed silence then andrew did what seemed to him to be the reasonable thing  princess he said will you allow me to present my friend the duke of westerham the duke was staying with me a few weeks ago as you know and at that time he had a particular reason for not wishing his whereabouts to be known  the duke bowed over the princess hand which was offered him at once and without hesitation but his greeting to forrest was markedly cold forrest had evidently lost his nerve he seemed tonguetied and he was very pale it was the princess alone who saved the situation from becoming an exceedingly embarrassing one  i have heard of you very often duke she said your brother lord ronald took us down to norfolk you know by the by have you heard from him yet  not yet madam the duke said but i can assure you that it is only a matter of time before i shall discover his whereabouts i wonder whether your ward will do me the honour of giving me this dance he added turning to her i am afraid i am not a very skilful performer but perhaps she will have a little consideration for one who is willing to do his best  he led jeanne away from them and andrew after a moments stereotyped conversation also departed the princess and forrest were alone  this is getting worse and worse forrest muttered he is suspicious i am sure that he is they say that young engleton was his favourite brother and that he is determined  hush the princess said there are too many people about to talk of these things i wonder why the duke took jeanne off  an excuse for getting away from us forrest said did you see the way he looked at me ena i cannot hang on like this any longer i must have a few thousand pounds and get away  the princess nodded  we will go and talk to de brensault she said i should think he would be just in the frame of mind to consent to anything  the duke who was well acquainted with the house in which they were led jeanne into a small retiring room and found her an easy chair  my dear young lady he said i hope you will not be disappointed but i have not danced for ten years i brought you here because i wanted to say something to you  jeanne looked up at him a little surprised  something to me she repeated  he bowed  andrew de la borne is one of my oldest and best friends he said and what i am going to say to you is a little for his sake although i am sure that if i knew you better i should say it also for your own you must not be annoyed or offended because i am old enough to be your father and what i say i say altogether for your own good they tell me that you are a young lady with a great fortune and you know that nowadays half the evil that is done in the world is done for the sake of money frankly without wishing to say a word against your stepmother i consider that for a young girl you are placed in a very difficult and dangerous position the man forrestmind you must not be offended if he should be a friend of yoursbut i am bound to tell you that i believe him to be an unscrupulous adventurer and i am afraid that your stepmother is very much under his influence you have no other relatives or friends in this country and i hear that a man named de brensault is a suitor for your hand  i shall never marry him jeanne said firmly i think that he is detestable  i am glad to hear you say so the duke continued because he is not a man whom i would allow any young lady for whom i had any shade of respect or affection to become acquainted with now the fact that your stepmother deliberately encourages him makes me fear that you may find yourself at any moment in a very difficult position i do not wish to say anything against your friends or your stepmother i hope you will believe that but nowadays people who are poor themselves but who know the value and the use of money are tempted to do things for the sake of it which are utterly unworthy and wrong i want you to understand that if any time you should need a friend it will give me very great happiness indeed to be of any service to you i can i am a bachelor it is true but i am old enough to be your father and i can bring you into touch at once with friends more suitable for you and your station will you come to me or send for me if you find yourself in any sort of trouble  she said very little but she looked at him for a moment with her wonderful eyes very soft with unshed tears  you are very very kind she said i have been very unhappy and i have felt very lonely it will make everything seem quite different to know there is some one to whom i may come for advice ifif  i know dear the duke interrupted rising and holding out his arm i know quite well what you mean all i can say is dont be afraid to come or to send and dont let any one bully you into throwing away your life upon a scoundrel like de brensault i am going to give you back to andrew now he is a good fellowone of the best i only wish  the duke broke off short after all he remembered he had no right to complete his sentence andrew he felt was no more of a marrying man than he himself and he was the last person in the world to ever think of marrying a great heiress they found him waiting about outside  i must relinquish my charge the duke said smiling you will not forget miss le mesurier  i am never likely to she answered gratefully     chapter vii   the count de brensault had seldom been in a worse temper that jeanne should have flouted him was not in itself so terrible because he had quite made up his mind that sooner or later he would take a cowards revenge for the slights he had been made to endure at her hands but that he should have been flouted in the presence of a whole roomful of people that he should have been deliberately left for another man was a different matter altogether his first impulse when jeanne left him was to walk out of the house and have nothing more to say to the princess or jeanne herself the world was full of girls perfectly willing to tumble into his arms and mothers only too anxious to push them there why should he put himself in this position for jeanne great heiress though she might be but somehow or other after he had tossed off two glasses of champagne at the buffet he realized that his fancy for her was a real thing and one from which he could not so readily escape if she had wished to deliberately attract him she could scarcely have chosen means more calculated to attain that end than by this avowed indifference even dislike he sat by himself in a small smokingroom and thought of herher slim girlish perfection of figure and bearing her perfect complexion her beautiful eyes her scarlet lips all these things came into his mind as he sat there until he felt his cheeks flush with the desire to succeed and his eyes grow bright at the thought of the time when he should hold her in his arms and take what revenge he chose for these slights no he would not let her go he determined dignified or undignified he would pursue her to the end only he must have an understanding with the princess something definite must be done he would not run the risk again of being made a laughingstock before all his friends forrest found him in exactly the mood most suitable for his purpose  come and talk to the princess he said she has something to say to you  de brensault rose somewhat heavily to his feet  and i he said i too have something to say to her we will take a glass of champagne together my friend forrest and then we will seek the princess  forrest nodded  by all means he said to tell you the truth i need it  de brensault looked at him curiously  you are very pale my friend he said you look as though things were not going too well with you  i have been annoyed forrest answered there is a man here whom i dislike and it made me angry to see him with miss jeanne i think myself that the time has come when something definite must be done as regards that child she is too young to be allowed to run loose like this and a great deal too inexperienced  i agree with you de brensault said solemnly we will drink that glass of wine together and we will go and talk to the princess  they found the princess where forrest had left her she motioned to de brensault to sit by her side and forrest left them  my dear count the princess said tonight has proved to me that it is quite time jeanne had some one to look after her let me ask you are you perfectly serious in your suit  absolutely de brensault answered eagerly i myself would like the matter settled i propose to you for her hand  the princess bowed her head thoughtfully  now my dear count she said i am going to talk to you as a woman of the world you know that my husband in leaving his fortune entirely to jeanne treated me very badly you may know this or you may not know it but the fact remains that i am a very poor woman  de brensault nodded sympathetically he guessed pretty well what was coming  if i the princess continued assist you to gain my stepdaughter jeanne for your wife and the control of all her fortune it is only fair she continued that i should be recompensed in some way for the allowance which i have been receiving as her guardian and which will then come to an end i do not ask for anything impossible or unreasonable i want you to give me twenty thousand pounds the day that you marry jeanne it is about one years income for her rentes a mere trifle to you of course  twenty thousand pounds de brensault repeated reflectively  the princess nodded she was sorry that she had not asked thirty thousand  i am not a mercenary woman she said if i were not almost a pauper i would accept nothing as it is i think you will call my proposal a very fair one  the exact amount of mademoiselle jeannes dot he remarked has never been discussed between us  the figures are altogether beyond me the princess said to tell you the truth i have never had the heart to go into them i have always thought it terribly unfair that my husband should have left me nothing but an annuity and this great fortune to the child however as you are both rich it seems to me that settlements will not be necessary on your honeymoon you can go and see her trustees in paris and you yourself will of course then take over the management of her fortune  de brensault looked thoughtful for a moment or two  perhaps he said it would be better if i had a business interview with her trustees before the ceremony  just as you like the princess answered carelessly monsieur laplanche is in cairo just now but he will be back in paris in a few weeks time perhaps you would rather delay everything until then  no de brensault said after a moments hesitation i would like to delay nothing i would like to marry mademoiselle jeanne at once if it can be arranged  to tell you the truth the princess said i think it would be much the best way out of a very difficult situation i am finding jeanne very difficult to manage and i am quite sure that she will be happier and better off married i am proposing if you are willing to exercise my authority absolutely if she shows the slightest reluctance to accept you i propose that we all go over to paris i shall know how to arrange things there  de brensault smiled the prospect of winning jeanne at any cost became more and more attractive to him the princess who was looking at him through half closed eyes saw that he was perfectly safe  and now my dear count she said i am going to ask you a favour i am doing for you something for which you ought to be grateful to me all your life for a mere trifle which will not recompense me in the least for what i am giving up i am finding you one of the most desirable brides in europe i want you to help me a little  what is it that i can do he asked  let me have five thousand pounds on account of what you are going to give me tomorrow morning she said coolly  de brensault hesitated he was prepared to pay for what he wanted but five thousand pounds was nevertheless a great deal of money  i would not ask you the princess continued if i were not really hard up i have been gambling a foolish thing to do and i do not want to sell my securities because i know that very soon they will pay me over and over again will you do this for me remember i am giving you my word that jeanne is to be yours  make it three thousand de brensault said slowly three thousand pounds i will send you a cheque for tomorrow morning  the princess nodded  as you will she said i think if i were you though i should make it five however i shall leave it for you to do what you can now will you take me out into the ballroom i am going to look for jeanne  they found her at supper with the duke and andrew and a very great lady a connection of the dukes who was one of those few who had refused to accept the princess the princess swept up to the little party and laid her hand upon jeannes shoulder  i do not want to hurry you dear she said but when you have finished supper i should be glad to go we have to go on to dorchester house you know  jeanne sighed she had been enjoying herself very much indeed  i am ready now she said standing up but must we go to dorchester house i would so much rather go straight home i have not had such a good time since i have been in london  the duke offered her his arm ignoring altogether count de brensault who was standing by  at least he said you will permit me to see you to your carriage  the princess smiled graciously it was bad enough to be ignored as she certainly was to some extent but on the other hand it was good for de brensault to see jeanne held in such esteem she took his arm and they followed down the room the duke was bending down and talking earnestly to jeanne this surprised the princess  i wonder she remarked more to herself than to her companion what he is saying  de brensault shrugged his shoulders  i do not care he said we will keep to our bargain you and i in a few days it will be my arm that she shall take and nobody elses perhaps i shall be a little jealous who can say in a little time she will not mind  remember the duke was saying as he drew jeannes hand through his arm that i was very much in earnest in what i said to you just now i have seen a good deal of the world and you nothing at all and i cannot help believing that the time when you may need some ones help is a good deal nearer than you yourself imagine  i wonder she asked a little timidly why you are so kind to me  i accept you upon trust the duke said for the sake of my friend andrew i know that he lives out of the world and has not much experience in judging others but i do believe that when he has made up his mind about anybody he is generally right frankly from what i have heard and a little that i know i am afraid that i should have been suspicious about even a child like you because of your associates but because i believe in you i am all the more sure that very soon you are going to find yourself in trouble it is agreed remember that when that time comes you will remember that i am your friend  i will remember she murmured i am not likely to forget except for you and mr de la borne no one has been really kind to me since i left school they all say foolish things and try to make me like them because i am a great heiress but one understands how much that is worth  the duke looked at her and seemed half inclined to say something whatever it may have been however he thought better of it he contented himself with taking her hand in his and shaking it warmly  good night he said little miss jeanne and remember no 51 grosvenor square if i am not there i have a very nice old housekeeper who will look after you until i turn up  no 51 she repeated softly no i shall not forget     chapter viii   the princess and jeanne drove homewards in a silence which remained unbroken until the last few minutes the events of the evening had been somewhat perplexing to the former she scarcely understood even now why a great personage like the duke of westerham had shown such interest in her charge  tell me jeanne she asked at last why is the duke of westerham so friendly with your fisherman  jeanne raised her eyebrows slightly  my fisherman as you call him she answered is after all andrew de la borne they were at school together  that is all very well the princess answered but i cannot see what possible sympathy there can be between them now their stations in life are altogether different you talked with the duke for some time jeanne  he was very kind to me jeanne answered  did he give you any idea the princess asked as to why he was staying down at salthouse with mr andrew  none at all jeanne answered  you know very well the princess continued of what i am thinking did he speak to you at all of major forrest  not a word jeanne answered  of his brother then  he did not mention his name jeanne declared  he asked you no questions at all about anything which may have happened at the red hall  jeanne shook her head  certainly not  you do not think then the princess persisted that it was for the sake of gaining information about his brother that he talked with you so much  why should i think so jeanne asked he scarcely mentioned any of your names even he talked to me simply out of kindness and i think because he knew that mr andrew and i were friends  the princess smiled  you seem she remarked to have made quite a conquest i congratulate you the duke has not the reputation of being an easy man to get on with  the carriage pulled up before their house in berkeley square and the princess did not pursue the subject but as jeanne left her for the night her stepmother called her back  tomorrow morning she said i should be glad if you would come to my room at twelve oclock i have something to say to you  jeanne slept well that night for the first time she felt that she had lost the feeling of friendlessness which for the last few weeks had constantly oppressed her andrew de la borne was back in london and the duke who seemed to have some sort of understanding as to the troubles which were likely to beset her had gone out of his way to offer her his help she felt now that she would not have to fight her stepmothers influence unaided yet when she sought her room at twelve oclock the next morning she had very little idea of the sort of fight which she might indeed have to make  the princess had already spent an hour at her toilette her hair was carefully arranged and her face massaged she received her stepdaughter with some show of affection and bade her sit close to her  jeanne she said you are now nearly twenty years old for many reasons i wish to see you married the count de brensault formally proposed for you last night he is coming at three oclock this afternoon for his answer  jeanne sat upright in her chair her stepmother noticed a new air of determination in the poise of her head and the firm lines of her mouth  the count might have spared himself the trouble she said he knows very well what my answer will be i think that you know too it is no most emphatically and decidedly i will not marry the count de brensault  before you express yourself so irrevocably the princess said calmly i should like you to understand that it is my wish that you accept his offer  in all ordinary matters jeanne answered i am prepared to obey you in this no i think that i have the right to choose my husband for myself or at any rate to approve of whomever you may select ido not approve of the count de brensault i do not care for him and i never could care for him and i will not marry him  the princess said nothing for several moments then she moved toward the door which led into her sleeping chamber where her maid was still busy and turned the key in the lock  jeanne she said when she returned i think it is time that you were told something which i am afraid will be a shock to you this great fortune of yours of which you have heard so much and which has been so much talked about is a myth  what do you mean jeanne asked looking at her stepmother with startled eyes  exactly what i say the princess continued your father made huge gifts to his relatives during the last few years of his life and he left enormous sums in charity to you he left the remainder of his estate which all the world believed to amount to at least a million pounds but when things came to be realized all his securities seemed to have depreciated the legacies were paid in cash the depreciation of his fortune all fell upon you when everything had been paid there was something like twentyfive thousand pounds left more than half of that has gone in your education and in an allowance to myself since i have had the charge of you there is a little left in the hands of monsieur laplanche but very little indeed what there is we owe for your dresses the rent of this house and other things  you mean jeanne interrupted bewildered that i have no money at all  practically none the princess answered now you can see why it is so important that you should marry a rich man  jeanne was bewildered it was hard to grasp these things which her stepmother was telling her  if this be true she said how is it that every one speaks of me as being a great heiress  the princess glanced at her with a contemptuous smile  you do not suppose she said that i have found it necessary to take the whole world into my confidence  you mean jeanne said that people dont know that i am not a great heiress  certainly not the princess replied or we should scarcely be here  the count de brensault jeanne asked  he does not know of course the princess answered he is a rich man he can afford quite well to marry a girl without a dot  jeannes head fell slowly between her hands the suddenness of this blow had staggered her it was not the loss of her fortune so much which affected her as the other contingencies with which she was surrounded she tried to think and the more she thought the more involved it all seemed she looked up at last  if my fortune is really gone she said why do you let people talk about it and write about me in the papers as though i were still so rich  the princess shrugged her shoulders  for your own sake she answered it is necessary to find you a husband is it not and nowadays one does not find them easily when there is no dot  jeanne felt her cheeks burning  i am to be married then she said slowly by some one who thinks i have a great deal of money and who afterwards will be able to turn round and reproach me for having deceived him  the princess laughed  afterwards she said the man will not be too anxious to let the world know that he has been made a fool of if you play your cards properly the afterwards will come out all right  jeanne rose slowly to her feet  i do not think she said that you have quite understood me i should like you to know that nothing would ever induce me to marry any one unless they knew the truth i will not go on accepting invitations and visiting peoples houses many of whom have only asked me because they think that i am very rich every one must know the truth at once  and how may i ask do you propose to live the princess asked quietly  if there is nothing left at all of my money jeanne said i will work if it is the worst which comes i will go back to the convent and teach the children  the princess laughed softly  jeanne she said you are talking like a positive idiot it is because you have had no time to think this thing out remember that after all you are not sailing under any false colours you are your fathers daughter and you are also his heiress if the newspapers and gossip have exaggerated the amount of his fortune that is not your affair be reasonable little girl she added letting her hand fall upon jeannes dont give us all away like this remember that i have made sacrifices for your sake i owe more money than i can pay for your dresses for the carriage for the house here nothing but your marriage will put us straight again you must make up your mind to this the count de brensault is so much in love with you that he will ask no questions you must marry him  jeanne drew herself away from her stepmothers touch  nothing she said would induce me to marry the count de brensault not even if he knew that i am penniless if we cannot afford to live in this house or to keep carriages let us go away at once and take rooms somewhere i do not wish to live under false pretences  the princess was very pale but her eyes were hard and steely  child she said dont be a fool dont make me angry or i may say and do things for which i should be sorry it is no fault of mine that you are not a great heiress i have done the next best thing for you i have made people believe that you are be reasonable and all will be well yet if you are going to play the quixote it will be ruin for all of us i cannot think how a child like you got such ideas remember that i am many years older and wiser than you you should leave it to me to do what is best  jeanne shook her head  i cannot she said simply i am sorry to disappoint you but i shall tell every one i meet that i have no money and i will not marry the count de brensault  the princess grasped her by the wrist  you will not obey me child she said  i will obey you in everything reasonable jeanne said  very well then the princess answered go to your room at once  jeanne turned and walked toward the door on the threshold however she paused there were many times she remembered when her stepmother had been kind to her she looked around at the princess sitting with her head resting upon her clasped hands  i am very sorry jeanne said timidly that i cannot do what you wish it is not honest cannot you see that it is not honest  the princess turned slowly round  honest she repeated scornfully who is there in our world who can afford to be honest you are behaving like a baby jeanne i only hope that before long you may come to your senses will you obey me if i tell you not to leave your room until i send for you  jeanne hesitated  yes she said i will obey you in that  then go there and wait the princess said i must think what to do     chapter ix   the count de brensault called in berkeley square at three oclock precisely that afternoon but it was the princess who received him and the princess was alone  well he asked a little eagerly mademoiselle jeanne is more reasonable eh you have good news  the princess motioned him to a seat  i think she said we had forgotten how young jeanne really is the idea of getting married to any one seems to terrify her after all why should we wonder at it the school where she was brought up was a very very strict one and this plunge into life has been a little sudden  you think then de brensault asked eagerly that it is not i personally whom she objects to so much  certainly not the princess answered it is simply you as the man whom it is proposed that she should marry that she dislikes i have been talking to her for a long time this afternoon frankly i do not know which would be bestto give up the idea of anything of the sort for some time or toto  to what de brensault demanded as the princess hesitated  to take extreme measures the princess answered slowly mind i would not consider such a thing for a moment if i were not fully convinced that jeanne when she is a little older would be perfectly satisfied with what we have done on the other hand one hesitates naturally to worry the child  she will not see me de brensault asked it is possible that i might be able to persuade her  you would do more harm than good the princess answered decidedly she is terrified just now at the idea she is in her room shaking like a schoolgirl who is going to be punished really i dont know why i should have been plagued with such a charge there are so many things i want to do and i have to stay here to look after jeanne because she is too foolish to be trusted with any one else i want to go to america and a very dear friend of mine has invited me to go with her and some delightful people on a yachting cruise around the world  then why not use those measures you spoke of de brensault said eagerly i shall make jeanne a very good husband i assure you i shall promise you that in a fortnights time she will be only too delighted with her lot  the princess looked at him thoughtfully  i wonder she said whether i could trust you  trust me of course you could dear princess de brensault exclaimed eagerly i will be kind to her i promise you be sensible she would feel this way with any one you yourself have said so there can be no more suitable marriage for her than with me let us call it arranged tell me what it is that you propose perhaps i may be able to help  jeanne is of course not of age the princess said thoughtfully and she is entirely under my control in england people are rather foolish about these things but abroad they understand the situation better  why not in belgium de brensault exclaimed we might go to a little town i know of very near to my estates everything could be arranged there very easily i am quite wellknown and no questions would be asked  the princess nodded thoughtfully  that might do she admitted  why not start at once de brensault suggested there is nothing to be gained by waiting we might even leave tomorrow  the princess shook her head  you are too impetuous my dear count she said  but what is there to wait for he demanded  i must see my lawyers first she answered slowly and before i leave london i must pay some bills  the count drew a cheque book from his pocket  i will keep my word he said i will pay you on account the amount we spoke of  the princess opened her escritoire briskly  there is a pen and ink there she said and blotting paper really your cheque will be a godsend to me i seem to have had nothing but expenses lately and jeannes guardians are as mean as they can be they grumble even at allowing me five thousand a year  de brensault twirled his moustache as he seated himself at the table  five thousand a year he muttered it is not a bad allowance for a young girl who is not yet of age  the princess shrugged her shoulders  my dear count she said you do not know what our expenses are jeanne is extravagant so am i extravagant it is all very well for her but for me it is another matter i shall be a poor woman when i have resigned my charge  de brensault handed the cheque across  you will not find me he said ungrateful and now my dear lady let us talk about jeanne do you think that you could persuade her to leave london so suddenly  i am going upstairs now the princess said to have a little talk with her dine with me here tonight quite quietly and i will tell you what fortune i have had  de brensault went away on the whole fairly content with his visit the princess endorsed his cheque and with a sigh of relief enclosed it in an envelope rang for a maid and ordered her carriage then she went upstairs to jeanne whom she found busy writing at her desk she hesitated for a moment and then went and stood with her hand resting upon the girls shoulder  jeanne she said i think that we have both been a little hasty  jeanne looked up in surprise her stepmothers tone was altered it was no longer cold and dictatorial there was in it even a note of appeal jeanne wondered to find herself so unmoved  i am sorry she said if i have said anything unbecoming you see she continued after a moments pause the subject which we were talking about did not seem to me to leave much room for discussion  there is no harm in discussing anything the princess said throwing herself into a wicker chair by the side of jeannes table i am afraid that all that i said must have sounded very cruel and abrupt you see i have had this thing on my mind for so long it has been a trouble to me jeanne  jeanne raised her large eyes and looked steadily at her stepmother she felt almost ashamed of her coldness and lack of sympathy the princess was certainly looking worn and worried  i am sorry jeanne said stiffly i cannot imagine how you could have supported life for a day under such conditions  her stepmother sighed  that she said is because you have had so little experience of life and you do not understand its practical necessities children like you seem to think that the commonplace necessaries of life drop into our laps as a matter of course or that they are a sort of gift from heaven to the deserving as a matter of fact the princess continued nothing of the sort happens life is often a very cruel and a very difficult thing we are given tastes and no means to gratify them how could i for instance face life as a lodginghouse keeper or at best as a sort of companion to some illtempered old harridan who would probably only employ me to have some one to bully you yourself jeanne are fond of luxuries  it was a new reflection to jeanne she became suddenly thoughtful  i have noticed your tastes the princess continued you would be miserable in anything but silk stockings wouldnt you and your ideas of lingerie are quite in accord with the ideas of the modern young woman of wealth you fill your rooms with flowers you buy expensive books she added taking up for a moment a volume of de ronsard bound in green vellum with uncut edges your tastes in eating and drinking too she continued are a little on the sybaritic side have you realized what it will mean to give all these things upto wear coarse clothes to eat coarse food to get your books from a cheap library and look at other peoples flowers  jeanne frowned the idea was certainly not pleasing  it will be bad for you the princess continued and it will be very much worse for me because i have been used to these things all my life you may think me very brutal at having tried to help you toward the only means of escape for either of us but i think dear you scarcely realize the alternative it is not only what you condemn yourself to remember that you inflict the same punishment on me  it is not i who do anything jeanne said it is you who have brought this upon both of us all this money that has been spent upon luxuries it was absurd if i was not rich i did not need them i think that it was more than absurd it was cruel  the princess produced a few inches of lacebordered cambric a glance at jeannes face showed her that the child had developed a new side to her character there was something pitiless about the straightened mouth and the cold questioning eyes  jeanne the princess said you are a fool some day you will understand how great a one i only trust that it may not be too late the count de brensault may not be everything that is to be desired in a husband but the world is full of more attractive people who would be glad to become your slaves you will live mostly abroad and let me assure you that marriage there is the road to liberty you have it in your power to save yourself and me from poverty make a little sacrifice jeanne if indeed it is a sacrifice later on you will be glad of it if you persist in this unreasonable attitude i really do not know what will become of us  jeanne turned her head but she did not respond in the least to the princess softened tone there was a note of finality about her words too she spoke as one who had weighed this matter and made up her mind  if there was no other man in the world she said or no other way of avoiding starvation i would not marry the count de brensault  the princess rose slowly to her feet  very well she said that ends the matter of course i hope you will always remember that it is you who are responsible for anything that may happen now you had better she continued leave off writing letters which will certainly never be posted and get your clothes together we shall go abroad at the latest tomorrow afternoon  abroad jeanne repeated  yes the princess answered i suppose you have sense enough to see that we cannot stay on here for you to make your interesting confessions i should probably have some of these tradespeople trying to put me in prison  i will tell saunders at once jeanne said i am quite ready to do anything you think best  the princess laughed hardly  you will have to manage without saunders she answered paupers like us cant afford maids i am going to discharge every one this afternoon have your boxes packed please tonight your dinner will be sent up to you  the princess left the room and jeanne heard the key turn in the lock     chapter x   jeannes packing was after all a very small matter she ignored the cupboards full of gowns nor did she open one of the drawers of her wardrobe she simply filled her dressingcase with a few necessaries and hid it under the table at eight oclock one of the servants brought her dinner on a tray jeanne saw with relief that it was one of the younger parlour maids and not the princess own maid  mary jeanne said taking a gold bracelet from her wrist and holding it out to her i am going to give you this bracelet if you will do just a very simple thing for me  the girl looked at jeanne and looked at the bracelet she was too amazed for speech  i want you jeanne said when you go out to leave the door unlocked that is all it will not make any difference to you so far as your position here is concerned because your mistress is sending you all away in a few days  the girl looked at the bracelet and did not hesitate for a moment  i would do it for you without anything miss jeanne she said the bracelet is too good for me  jeanne laughed and pushed it across the table to her  run along she said if you want to do something else open the back door for me i am coming downstairs  the girl looked a little perplexed the bracelet which she was holding still engrossed most of her thoughts  you are not doing anything rash miss jeanne i hope she asked timidly  jeanne shook her head  what i am doing is not rash at all she said softly it is necessary  five minutes later jeanne walked unnoticed down the back stairs of the house and out into the street she turned into piccadilly and entered a bus  where to miss the man asked as he came for his fare  i do not know jeanne said i will tell you presently  the man stared at her and passed on jeanne had spoken the truth she had no idea where she was going her one idea was to get away from every one whom she knew or who had known her as the princess ward and a great heiress she sat in a corner of the bus and she watched the stream of people pass by even there she shrank from any face or figure which seemed to her familiar she almost forgot that she too had been a victim of her stepmothers deception she remembered only that she had been the principal figure in it and that to the whole world she must seem an object for derision and contempt it was not her fault that she had played a false part in life but nevertheless she had played it and it was not likely that many would believe her innocent the thought of appealing to the duke or to andrew de la borne for help made her cheeks burn with shame in any ordinary trouble she would have gone to them this however was something too humiliating too impossible she felt that it was a blow which she could ask no one to share  the omnibus rolled on eastwards and reached liverpool street a sudden overwhelming impulse decided jeanne as to her destination she remembered that peculiar sense of freedom that first escape from her cramped surroundings which had come to her walking upon the marshes of salthouse she would go there again if it was only for a day or two find rooms somewhere in the village and write to monsieur laplanche from there visitors she knew were not uncommon in the little seaside village and she would easily be able to keep out of the way of cecil if he were still there the idea seemed to her like an inspiration she went up to the ticketoffice and asked for a ticket for salthouse the man stared at her  never heard of the place miss he said its not on our line  it is near wells on the east coast she said now i think of it i remember one has to drive from wells can i have a ticket to there  he glanced at the clock  the train goes in ten minutes miss he said  jeanne travelled first because she had never thought of travelling any other way she sat in the corner of an empty carriage looking steadily out of the window and seeing nothing but the fragments of her little life now that she was detached from it she seemed to realize how little real pleasure she had found in the life which the princess had insisted upon dragging her into she remembered how every man whom she had met addressed her with the same empressement how their eyes seemed to have followed her about almost covetously how the girls had openly envied her how the court of the men had been so monotonous and so unreal she drew a little breath almost of relief when she was used to the idea she might even be glad that this great fortune had taken to itself wings and flitted away she was no longer the heiress of untold wealth she was simply a girl standing on the threshold of life and looking forward to the happiness which at that age seems almost a natural heritage  the sense of freedom grew on her next morning as she walked once more upon the marshes listened to the larks now in full song and felt the touch of the salt wind upon her cheeks she had found rooms very easily and no one had seemed to treat her coming as anything but a matter of course one old fisherman of whom she asked questions told her many queer stories about the red hall and its occupants  as restless young men as them two as is there now he admitted mr cecil and his friend i never did see fust one of them one day goes to london back he comes on the next day and away goes the other why they dont go both together the lord only knows but that is so for a fact miss and you can take it from me every week of gods year one of them goes to london and directly he comes back the other goes  and mr andrew de la borne she asked has he gone back there yet  he have not the man answered but i doubt hell be back again one day fore long sure he need be theyre beginning to talk about the shuttered windows at the red hall  the girl turned and looked toward the house bleak and desolatelooking enough now that the few encircling trees were shorn of their leaves  i shouldnt care to live there all the year round she remarked  ive heerd others say the same thing he answered and yet in salthouse village were moderate well satisfied with life its them as have too much he continued who rush about trying to make more a simple life and a simple lot is whats best in this world  things were livelier up there jeanne remarked seating herself on the edge of his boat when the smugglers used to bring in their goods  the old man smiled  why thats so lady he admitted lord when i was a boy i mind some great doings one night there was a great fight i mind it now fifteen of the kings men were lying hidden close to the cove there and it looked for all the world as though the boats which were being rowed ashore must fall right into their hands they were watching from the hall though and the squires new alarm was set going it were a cry like a siren rising and falling like the boats heerd it and turned back but three of the squires men were set on and a rare fight there was that night there was broken heads to be mended and no mistake mat knowles here the father of him who keeps the public now he right forgot to shut his inn and there it was open two hours past the lawful time and all were drinking as though it were a great day of rejoicing instead of being one of sorrow for the de la bornes i mind you were here a few weeks ago miss you know the two mr de la bornes  yes jeanne admitted i know them slightly  mr andrew he be one of the best the man declared but mr cecil we none of us can understand him nor his friends what he is doing up there now with this man whats staying with him theres none can tell maybe they gamble at cards maybe they just sit and look at one another but tis a strange sort of life anyhow  i think it is a very interesting place to live in jeanne said what became of the siren which warned the smugglers  theres no one here as can tell that miss the man answered there are them as have fancied on windy nights as theyve heerd it but fancy it have been in my opinion five and twenty years have gone since ive heerd it mysen and theres few as better ears  mr andrew de la borne is not here now is he she asked  the fisherman shook his head  mr andrew he said is mortal afraid of strangers and such like and theres photographers and newspaper men round in these parts just now by reason of the disappearance of this young lord that you heerd tell on some say he was drowned and i have heerd folk whisper about a duel with the gentleman as is with mr cecil now anyway it was here that he disappeared from and though ive not seen it in print ive heerd as his brother is offering a reward of a thousand pounds to any as might find him its a power of money that miss  it is a great deal of money jeanne admitted i wonder if lord ronald was worth it     chapter xi   the two men sat opposite to one another separated only by the small round table upon which the dessert which had followed their dinner was still standing even forrests imperturbable face showed signs of the anxiety through which he had passed the change in cecil however was far more noticeable there were lines under his eyes and a flush upon his cheeks as though he had been drinking heavily the details of his toilette usually so immaculate were uncared for he was carelessly dressed and his hair no longer shone with frequent brushings he looked like a person passing through the rapid stages of deterioration  forrest he said i cannot stand it any longer this place is sending me mad i think that the best thing we can do is to chuck it  do you forrest answered drily that may be all very well for you a countryman with enough to live on and the whole world before you as for me i couldnt face it i have passed middle age and my life runs in certain grooves it must run in them now until the end i cannot break away i would not if i could existence would simply be intolerable for me if that young fool were ever allowed to tell his story  we cannot keep him for ever cecil answered gloomily we cannot play the jailer here all our lives besides there is always the danger of being found out there are two detectives in the place already and i am fairly certain that if they have been in the house while we have been out  there is nothing for them to discover here forrest answered i should keep the doors open let them search if they want to  that is all very well cecil answered but if these fellows hang about the place sooner or later they will hear some of the stories these villagers are only too anxious to tell  forrest nodded  there he said i am not disinclined to agree with you hasnt it ever struck you de la borne he continued after a moments slight hesitation that there is only one logical way out of this  no cecil answered eagerly what way what do you mean  forrest filled his glass to the brim with wine before he answered then he passed the decanter back to cecil  we are not children you and i he said why should we let a boy like engleton play with us why do we not let him have the issue before him in black and white we say to him nowsign this paper pledge your word of honour and you may go he declines he declines because the alternative of staying where he is is endurable i propose that we substitute another alternative drink your wine de la borne this is a chill house of yours and one loses courage here drink your wine and think of what i have said  cecil set down his glass empty  well he said what other alternative do you propose  cant you see forrest answered we cannot keep engleton shut up for ever i grant you that that is impossible but if he declines to behave like a reasonable person we can threaten him with an alternative which i do not think he would have the courage to face  you mean cecil gasped  i mean forrest answered what your grandfather would have told him or your great grandfather in half a dozen words weeks ago at full tide there is sea enough to drown a dozen such as he within a few yards of where he lies why should we keep him carefully and safe knowing that the moment he steps back into life you and i are doomed men  cecil drew a little breath and lifted his hand to his forehead he was surprised to find it wet all the time he was gazing at forrest with fascinated eyes  look here he said in a hoarse whisper we mustnt talk like this engleton will turn round in a day or two people would think if they heard us that we were planning a murder  in a womans decalogue forrest said there is no sin save the sin of being found out why not in ours no one ever had such a chance of getting rid of a dangerous enemy the whole thing is in our hands we could never be found out never even questioned if by one chance in a thousand his body is ever recovered what more natural men have been drowned before on the marshes here many a time  go on cecil said you have thought this out tell me exactly what you propose  i propose forrest answered that we narrow the issues and that we put them before him in plain english nowtonightwhile the courage is still with us it must be silence or death i tell you frankly how it is with me i would as soon press a pistol to my forehead and pull the trigger as have this boy go back into the world and tell his story for you too it would be ruin  cecil sank back into his chair and looked with wideopen but unseeing eyes across the table through the wall beyond he saw his future damned by that one unpardonable accusation he saw himself sent out into the world penniless an outcast from all the things in life which made existence tolerable he knew very well that andrew would never forgive there was no mercy to be hoped for from him there was nothing to be looked for anywhere save disaster absolute and entire he looked across at forrest and something in his companions face sent a cold shiver through his veins  we might go and see what he says he faltered i havent been there since the morning have you  no forrest answered solitude is good for him let us go now together  without another word they rose from the table cecil led the way into the library where he rang for a servant  set out the cardtable here he ordered and bring in the whisky and soda after that we do not wish to be disturbed you understand  certainly sir the man answered  they waited until the things were brought afterwards they locked the door cecil went to a drawer and took out a couple of electric torches one of which he handed to forrest then he went to the wall and after a few minutes groping found the spring the door swung open and a rush of unwholesome air streamed into the room they made their way silently along the passage until at last they reached the sunken chamber cecil took a key from his pocket and opened the door        engleton was in evil straits but there was no sign of yielding in his face as he looked up he was seated before a small table upon which a common lamp was burning his clothes hung about him loosely his face was haggard a short unbecoming beard disfigured his face he wore no collar or necktie and his general appearance was altogether dishevelled forrest looked at him critically  my dear engleton he began  what the devil do you want with me at this time of night engleton interrupted have you come down to see how i amuse myself during the long evenings perhaps you would like to come and play cutthroat ill play you for what stakes you like and thank you for coming if youll leave the door open and let me breathe a little better air  it is your own fault that you are here cecil de la borne declared it is all your cursed obstinacy listen i tell you once more that what you saw or fancied you saw was a mistake forget it give your word of honour to forget it never to allude to it at any time in your life and you can walk out of here a free man  engleton nodded  i have no doubt of it he answered the worst of it is that nothing in the world would induce me to forego the pleasure i promise myself before very long too of giving to the whole world the story of your infamy i am not tractable tonight you had better go away both of you i am more likely to fight  forrest sat down on the edge of a chest  engleton he said dont be a fool it can do you no particular good to ruin cecil here and myself just because you happen to be suspicious let that drop tell us that you have decided to let it drop and the world can take you into its arms again  i refuse engleton answered i refuse once and for always i tell you that i have made up my mind to see you punished for this how i get out i dont care but i shall get out and when i do you two will be laid by the heels  we came here tonight forrest said slowly prepared to compromise with you  there is no compromise engleton answered fiercely there is nothing which you could offer which could repay me for the horror of the nights you have left me to shiver here in this dd vault dont flatter yourself that i shall ever forget it i stay on because i cannot escape but i would sooner stay here for ever than beg for mercy from either of you  upon my word forrest declared our friend is quite a hero  i am hero enough at any rate engleton answered to refuse to bargain with you get out both of you before i lose my temper  forrest came a little further into the room the thunder of the sea seemed almost above their heads the little lamp on the table by engletons side gave little more than a weird unnatural light around the circle in which he sat  that isnt quite all that we came to say forrest remarked coldly to tell you the truth we have had enough of playing jailer  i can assure you engleton answered that i have had equally enough of being your prisoner  we are agreed then forrest continued smoothly you will probably be relieved when i tell you that we have decided to end it  engleton rose to his feet  so much the better he said you might keep me here till doomsday and the end would be the same  we do not propose forrest continued to keep you here till doomsday or anything like it what we have come to say to you is thisthat if you still refuse to give your promisei need not say more than thatwe are going to set you free  do you mean that literally engleton asked  perhaps not altogether as you would wish to understand it forrest admitted we shall give you a chance at high tide to swim for your life  engleton shrunk a little back after all his nerves were a little shattered  out there he asked pointing to the seaward end of the passage  forrest nodded  it will be a chance for you he said  engleton looked at them for a moment dumbfounded  it will be murder he said slowly  forrest shrugged his shoulders  you may call it so if you like he answered personally i should not be inclined to agree with you you will be alive when you go into the sea if you cannot swim the fault is not ours  and when may i ask engleton continued do you propose to put into operation your amiable plan  just whensoever we please you dd obstinate young puppy forrest cried suddenly losing his nerve curse your silent tongue and your venomous face you think you can get the better of us do you well you are mistaken youll tell no stories from amongst the seaweed  engleton nodded  i shall take particular good care he said to avoid the seaweed  enough forrest declared listen here is the issue we are tired of negative things tonight you sign the paper and give us your word of honour to keep silent or before morning when the tide is full you go into the sea  i warn you engleton said that i can swim  i will guarantee forrest answered suavely that by the time you reach the water you will have forgotten how     chapter xii   the days that followed were strange ones for jeanne every morning at sunrise or before she would steal out of the little cottage where she was staying and make her way along the top of one of the high dyke banks to the sea often she saw the sun rise from some lonely spot amongst the sandbanks or the marshes heard the awakening of the birds and saw the first glimpses of morning life steal into evidence upon the grey chill wilderness at such times she saw few people the house where she was staying was apart from the village and near the head of one of the creeks and there were times when she would leave it and return without having seen a single human being she knew from cautious inquiries made from her landladys daughter that cecil and major forrest were still at the red hall and for that reason during the daytime she seldom left the cottage sitting out in the oldfashioned garden or walking a little way in the fields at the back for the future she made no plans she was quite content to feel that for the present she had escaped from an intolerable situation  the woman from whom jeanne had taken the rooms a mrs caynsard she had seen only once or twice she was waited upon most of the time by an exceedingly diminutive maid servant very shy at first but very talkative afterwards in broad norfolk dialect when she had grown a little accustomed to this very unusual lodger now and then kate caynsard the only daughter of the house appeared but for the most time she was away sailing a fishing boat or looking after the little farm to jeanne she represented a type wholly strange but altogether interesting she was little over twenty years of age but she was strong and finely built she had the black hair and dark brown eyes which here and there amongst the villagers of the east coast remind one of the immigration of worsted spinners and silk weavers from flanders and the north of france many centuries ago she was very handsome but exceedingly shy when jeanne as she had done more than once tried to talk to her her abrupt replies gave little opening for conversation one morning however when jeanne having returned from a long tramp across the sand dunes was sitting in the little orchard at the back of the house she saw her landladys daughter come slowly out to her from the house jeanne put down her book  good morning miss caynsard she said  good morning miss the girl answered awkwardly you have had a long walk  jeanne nodded  i went so far she said that i had to race the tide home or i should have had to wade through the home creek  kate nodded  the tide do come sometimes she said at a most awful pace i have been out after whelks myself and had to walk home with the sea all round me and nothing but a ribbon of dry land one needs to know the ways about on this wilderness  one learns them by watching jeanne remarked i suppose you have lived here all your life  all my life the girl answered and my father and grandfather before me tis a queer country but them as is born and bred here seldom leaves it sometimes they try they go to the next village inland or to some town or to foreign parts but sooner or later if they live they come back  jeanne nodded sympathetically  it is a wonderful country she said when i saw it first it seemed to me that it was depressing now i love it  and i the girl remarked with a sudden passion in her tone i hate it  jeanne looked at her surprised  it sounds so strange to hear you say that she remarked i should have thought that any one who had lived here always would have loved it every day i am here i seem to discover new beauties a new effect of colouring a new undertone of the sea or to hear the cry of some new bird  it is beautiful sometimes the girl answered i love it when the creeks are full and the april sun is shining and the spring seems to draw all manner of living things and colours from the marsh and the pasturage lands i love it when the sea changes its colour as the clouds pass over the sun and the wind blows from the west the place is well enough then but there are times when it is nothing but a great wilderness of mud and the grey mists come blowing in and one is cold here cold to the bone then i hate the place worse than ever  have you ever tried to go away for a time jeanne asked  i went once to london the girl said turning her head a little away i should have stayed there i think if things had turned out as i had expected but they didnt and my father died suddenly so i came home to take care of the farm  jeanne nodded sympathetically she was beginning to wonder why this girl had come out from the house with the obvious intention of speaking to her she stood by her side not exactly awkward but still not wholly at her ease her hands clasped behind her straight back her black eyebrows drawn together in a little uneasy frown her coarse brown skirt was not long enough to conceal her wonderfully shaped ankles sun and wind had done little more than slightly tan her clear complexion she had somehow the appearance of a girl of some other nation there was something stronger more forceful more brilliant about her than her position seemed to warrant  there is a question miss she said at last abruptly i should like to ask you i should have asked you when you first came if i had been in when you came to look at the rooms  what is it jeanne asked quietly  ive a good eye for faces kate said and i seldom forget one werent you the young lady who was staying up at the red hall a few weeks ago  jeanne nodded  yes she said i was staying there it was because i liked the place so much and because i was so much happier here than in london that i came back  there was a moments silence jeanne looked up and found kates magnificent eyes fixed steadfastly upon her face  is it for no other reason miss she asked that you have come back  for none other in the world jeanne answered i was unhappy in london and i wanted to get somewhere where i should be quite unknown that is why i came here  you didnt come back kate asked to see more of mr de la borne then  the simple directness of the question seemed to rob it of its impertinence jeanne laughed goodhumouredly  i can assure you that i did not she answered to tell you the truth and i hope that you will be kind and remember that i do not wish any one to know this the reason why i only go out so early in the morning or late at night is because i do not wish to see any one from the red hall i do not wish them to know that i am here  they do gossip in a small place like this most amazing the girl said slowly when you and the other lady came down from london to stay up yonder they did say that you were a great heiress and that mr de la borne was counting on marrying you and buying back all the lands that have slipped away from the de la bornes back to burnham market and wells township  jeanne shrugged her shoulders  i cannot help she said what people say every one has spoken of me always as being very rich and a good many men have wanted to marry me to spend my money that is why i came down here if you want to know miss caynsard i came to escape from a man whom my stepmother was determined that i should marry and whom i hated  the girl looked at her wonderingly  it is a strange manner of living she said when a girl is not to choose her own man  in any case jeanne said smiling if i had but one or two to choose from in the world i should never choose mr de la borne  the girl was gloomily silent she was looking up towards the red hall her lips a little parted her face dark her brows lowering  tis a family she said slowly that have come down wellnigh to their last acre they hold on to the hall but little else folk say that for four hundred years or more the de la bornes have heard the sea thunder from within them walls tis perhaps as some writer has said in a book ive found lately that the old families of the country when once their menkind cease to be soldiers or fighters in the world do decay and become rotten it is so with the de la bornes or rather with one of them  mr andrew jeanne remarked timidly  mr andrew the girl interrupted is a great gentleman but he is never one of those who would stop the rot in a decaying race he is a great strong man is mr andrew and deceit and littleness are things he knows nothing of i wish he were here today  the girls face wore a troubled expression jeanne began to suspect that she had not as yet come to the real object of this interview  why do you wish that mr andrew were here jeanne asked what could he do for you that mr cecil could not  a strange look filled the girls eyes  i think she said that i would not go to mr cecil whatever might betide but there is a matter  she hesitated again jeanne looked at her thoughtfully  you have something on your mind i think miss caynsard she said can i help you do you wish to tell me about it  the girl seemed to have made up her mind she was standing quite close to jeanne now and she spoke without hesitation  you remember the young lord she said of whom there has been so much in the papers lately he was staying at the red hall when you were and is supposed to have left for london early one morning and disappeared  lord ronald engleton jeanne said yes i know all about that of course  sometimes kate said slowly i have had strange thoughts about him mr cecil and the other man major forrest they call him are still at the hall and the servants say that they do little but drink and swear at one another i wonder sometimes why they are there and why mr andrew stays away  jeanne leaned a little forward in her chair something in the others words had interested her  there is something she said behind in your thoughts what is it  the girl was silent for a moment  tonight she said if you have the courage to come with me i will show you what i mean     chapter xiii   i am afraid jeanne declared that i cannot go on i have not the eyes of a cat i cannot see one step before me  her companion laughed softly as she turned round  i forgot she said you are town bred to us the darkness is nothing do not be afraid i know the way every inch of it give me your hand  but i cannot see at all jeanne declared how far is this place  less than a mile kate answered trust to me i will see that nothing happens to you hold my hand tightly like that now come  jeanne reluctantly trusted herself to her companions guidance they made their way down the rough road which led from the home of the caynsards half cottage half farmhouse to the lane at the bottom there was no moon and though the wind was blowing hard the sky seemed everywhere covered with black clouds when kate opened the wooden gate which led on to the marshes jeanne stopped short  i am not going any farther she declared even you i am sure could not find your way on the marshes tonight didnt you hear what the fisherman said too that it was a flood tide many of the paths are under water i will not go any farther kate if there is anything you have to tell me say it now  she felt a hand suddenly tighten upon her arm a hand which was like a vice  you must come with me kate said as to the other things do not be foolish on these marshes i am like a cat in a dark room i could feel my way across every inch of them on the blackest night that ever was i know how high the tide is i measured it but half an hour since by treadwells pole you come with me miss youll not miss your way by a foot i promise you that  even then jeanne was reluctant they were on the top of the grassgrown dyke now and below she could dimly see the dark swelling water lapping against the gravel bottom  but you do not understand she declared i do not even know where to put my feet i can see nothing and the wind is enough to blow us over the sides listen listen how it comes booming across the sand dunes it is not safe here i tell you that i must go back  her companion only laughed a little wildly  there will be no going back tonight she said you must come with me set your feet down boldly if you are afraid take this  she handed her a small electric torch  its one of those newfangled things for making light in the darkness she remarked its no use to me for if i could not see i could feel for us who live here tis but an instinct to find our way in darkness or in light across the land where we were born but if you are nervous press the knob and you will see  jeanne took the torch with a little sigh of relief  go on she said i dont mind so much now i have this  nevertheless as they moved along she found it sufficiently alarming the top of the bank was but a few feet wide the west wind which came roaring down across the great open spaces with nothing to check or divide its strength was sometimes strong enough to blow them off their balance on either side of the dyke was the water black and silent here and there the torch light showed them a fishingsmack or a catboat high and dry a few hours ago now floating on the bosom of the full tide they came to a stile and jeannes courage once more failed her  i cannot climb over this she said i shall fall directly i lift up my feet  kate turned round with a little laugh of contempt jeanne felt herself suddenly lifted in a pair of strong arms before she knew where she was she was on the other side breathless she followed her guide who came to a full stop a few yards farther on  turn on your light kate ordered look down on the left there should be a punt there  jeanne turned on the torch a great flatbottomed boat shapeless and unwieldy was just below kate stepped lightly down the steep bank and with one foot on the side of the punt held out her hand to jeanne  come she said step carefully  but what are we going to do jeanne asked you are not going in that  why not kate laughed it is a few strokes only we are going to cross to the ridges  jeanne followed her somehow or other she found it hard to disobey her guide none the less she was afraid she stepped tremblingly down into the punt and sat upon the broad wet seat kate without a moments hesitation took up the great pole and began pushing her way across the creek the tide was almost at its height but even then the current was so strong that they went across almost sideways and jeanne heard her companions breath grow shorter and shorter as with powerful strokes she did her best to guide and propel the clumsy craft  we are going out toward the sea jeanne faltered it is getting wider and wider  she flashed her torch across the dark waters they could not see the bank which they had left or the ridges to which they were making  dont be afraid kate answered after all you know we can only die once and life isnt worth making such a tremendous fuss over  i do not want to die jeanne objected and i do not like this at all  kate laughed contemptuously  sit still she said and you are as safe as though you were in your own armchair no current that ever ran could upset this clumsy raft the only reason i am working so hard is that i do not want to be carried down past the ridges if we get too low down we shall have to walk across the black mud  jeanne kept silence listening only to the swirl of the water struck by the pole and to the quick breathing of her companion once she asked whether she could not help  there is no need kate answered shine your torch on the left we are nearly across  almost as she spoke they struck the sandy bottom jeanne fell into the bottom of the boat kate with a little laugh sprang ashore and held out her hand  come she said we have crossed the worst part now  where are we going jeanne asked a little relieved as she felt her feet land on the sodden turf  towards the hall kate answered give me your hand if you like or use your torch the way is simple enough but we must twist and turn tonight it has been a flood tide and there are great pools left here and there pools that you have never seen before  but how do you know jeanne asked in amazement i can see nothing  her guide laughed contemptuously  i can see and i can feel she said it is an instinct with me to walk dryfooted here to the right nowso  stand still for a moment jeanne pleaded the wind takes my breath  you have too many clothes on kate said contemptuously one should not wear skirts and petticoats and laces here  if you would leave my clothes alone and tell me where you are going jeanne declared a little tartly it would be more reasonable  the girl laughed she thrust her arm through her companions and drew her on  dont be angry she said it is quite easy now to find our way there is room for us to walk like this can you hear what i say to you  i can hear jeanne answered raising her voice but it is getting more difficult all the time is that the sea  yes kate answered cant you feel the spray on your cheeks the wind is blowing it high up above the beach let me go first again there is an inlet here be careful  they came to a full stop before a dark arm of salt water they skirted the side and crossed round to the other side  be careful now kate said this way  they turned inland in a few minutes her guide stopped short  turn on your torch she said there ought to be a wall close here  jeanne did as she was bid and gave a little stifled cry  why we are close to the red hall she said kate nodded  a little way farther up there is a gate she said we are going in there  you are not going to the house jeanne asked in terror  no kate answered i am not going there follow me and dont talk more than you can help the wind is going down  but it is the middle of the night jeanne said no one will be astir  one cannot tell kate answered slowly it is in my mind that there have been strange doings here and i know well that there is a man who watches this place by day and by night he has discovered nothing but it is because he has not known where to look  what do you mean jeanne asked hoarsely  wait her companion said  they passed through the wooden gate they were now in a little weedy plantation of undersized trees the ground was full of rabbit holes and jeanne stumbled more than once  how much farther she asked we are getting toward the house  not yet kate answered there are the gardens first but we are not going there wait a moment  she felt for one of the trees and passed her hand carefully round its trunk then she took a few steps forward and stopped short  wait she said  she lay flat down upon the grass and was silent for several minutes then she whispered to jeanne  dont turn on your torch she said lie down here by my side put your ear to the ground and tell me whether you can hear anything  jeanne obeyed her breathlessly at first she could hear nothing her own heart was beating fast and the boughs of the trees above them were creaking and groaning in the wind presently however she gave a little cry from somewhere underground it seemed to her that she could hear a faint hammering  what is it she asked  kate sat up  there is no animal she said which makes a noise like that it is somewhere there underground it seems to me that it is some one who is trying to get out  some one underground jeanne repeated  kate leaned over and whispered in her ear  there is a passage underneath here she said which goes from the hall to the cliffs and a room or rather a vault  i know jeanne declared suddenly mr de la borne showed it to us it was the way the smugglers used to bring their goods up to the cellars of the red hall  we are just above the room here kate said slowly and i fancy that there is some one there  a sudden light broke in upon jeanne  you think that it is lord engleton she declared  why not kate answered listen again with your ear close to the ground last night i was almost sure that i heard him call for help  jeanne did as she was told and her face grew white as death distinctly between the strokes she heard the sound of a man moaning     chapter xiv   once more the two men sat over the remnants of their evening meal this time the deterioration in their own appearance seemed to have spread itself to their surroundings the table was illlaid there were no flowers an empty bottle of wine and several decanters remained where they had been set there was every indication that however little the two might have eaten they had been drinking heavily yet they were both pale cecils face even was ghastly and the hand which played nervously with the tablecloth shook all the time  forrest he said abruptly it is a mistake to clear out all the servants like this not only have we had to eat a filthy dinner but its enough to make people suspicious eh dont you think so dont you think afterwards that they may wonder why we did it  no forrest answered with something that was almost like a snarl no i dont shut up and dont be such an infernal young fool we couldnt have town servants spying and whispering about the place i caught that london butler of yours hanging around the library this afternoon as though he were looking for something they were a dd careless lot anyhow with no mistress or housekeeper to look after them and theyre better gone who is there left exactly now  theres a kitchenmaid who cooked this wretched mess cecil answered and another under her from the village who seems half an idiot there is no one else except pawles a man who comes in from the stables to do the rough work and pump the water up for the bath we are practically alone in the house  thank heaven its our last night forrest answered  you really mean then cecil asked in a hoarse whisper to finish this now  i mean that we are going to forrest answered you know im half afraid of you sometimes youre such a rotten coward if ever i thought you looked as though you were going back on me id get even with you mind that  dont talk like a fool cecil answered what we do we do together of course only my nerves arent strong you know i cant bear the thought of the end of it  whatever happens to him forrest said hes asking for it he has an easy chance to get back to his friends it is brutal obstinacy if he makes us end it differently youre only a boy but ive lived a good many years and i tell you that if you dont look out for yourself and make yourself safe there are always plenty of people especially those who call themselves your friends who are ready and waiting to kick you down into hell i am going to have something more to drink nothing seems to make any difference to me tonight i cant even get excited although we must have drunk a bottle of wine each well have some brandy here goes  he filled a wineglass and passed the bottle to cecil  youre about in the same state he remarked looking at him keenly why the devil is it that when one doesnt require it wine will go to the head too quickly and when one wants to use it to borrow a little courage and a little forgetfulness the stuff goes down like water drink cecil a wineglass of it drink it off like this  forrest drained his wineglass and set it down then he rose to his feet his cheeks were still colourless but there was an added glitter in his eyes  come young man he said you have only to fancy that you are one of your own ancestors i fancy those darklooking ruffians who scowl down on us from the walls there would not have thought so much of flinging an enemy into the sea it is a wise man who wrote that selfpreservation was the first law of nature come cecil remember that it is the first law of nature that we are obeying ring the bell first and see that there are no servants about the place  cecil obeyed ringing the bell once or twice no one came they stepped out into the hall the emptiness of the house seemed almost apparent there was not a sound anywhere  the servants wing is right over the stables a long way off cecil remarked they could never hear a bell there that rang from any of the livingrooms  forrest nodded  so much the better he said come along to the library i have everything ready there  they crossed the hall and entered the room to which forrest pointed their footsteps seemed to awake echoes upon the stone floor the hall too was all unlit save for the lamp which forrest was carrying cecil peered nervously about into the shadows  its a ghostly house this of yours forrest said grumblingly as they closed the door behind them i shall be thankful to get back to my rooms in town and walk down piccadilly once more whats that outside  the wind cecil answered i thought it was going to be a rough night  the window had been left open at the top and the roar of the wind across the open places came into the room like muffled thunder the lamp which forrest carried was blown out and the two men were left in darkness  shut the window for heavens sake man forrest ordered sharply here  he took an electric torch from his pocket and both men drew a little breath of relief as the light flashed out cecil climbed on to a chair and closed the window forrest glanced at the clock  its quite late enough he said it should be high tide in a quarter of an hour and the sea in that little cove of yours is twenty feet deep come along and work this door  have you got everything cecil asked nervously  i have the chloroform forrest answered touching a small bottle in his waistcoat pocket we dont need anything else he hasnt the strength of a rabbit and you and i can carry him down the passage if he struggles theres no one to hear him  cecil pushed his way against the panels and opened the clumsy door they groped their way down the passage  faugh forrest exclaimed what smells cecil he added i suppose half the village know about this place dont they  they know that it has been here always cecil answered but they most of them think that it is blocked up now we did try to andrew and i but the masonry gave way these lumps on the floor are the remains of our work keep your torch down youll fall over them  forrest stopped short curiously enough it was he now who seemed the more terrified the wind and the thunder of the sea together seemed to reach them through the walls of earth in a strange monotonous roar sometimes shriller as the wind triumphed sometimes deep and low so that the very ground beneath their feet vibrated as the sea came thundering up into the cove cecil who was more used to such noises heard them unmoved  if my people had left me such a dogs hole as this forrest declared viciously id have buried them in it and blown it up to the skies its only fit for ghosts  the very weakening of the other man seemed for the moment to give cecil added courage he laughed hoarsely  there are worse things to fear he muttered than this hold hard forrest here is the door ill undo the padlock you stand by in case he makes a rush  but there was no rush about engleton he was lying on his back stretched on a rough mattress at the farther end of the room moaning slightly the two men exchanged quick glances  we are not going to have much trouble forrest muttered what a beastly atmosphere no wonder hes knocked up  cecil however looked about suspiciously  dont you notice he whispered that we can hear the wind much plainer here than in the passage i believe i can feel a current of fresh air too i wonder if hes been trying to cut his way through to the airhole its only a few feet up  he flashed his light upon the wall near where engleton was lying then he turned significantly to forrest  see he said he has cut steps in the wall and tried to make an opening above he must have guessed where the ventilating pipe was i wonder what he did it with  they crossed the room the man on the couch opened his eyes and looked at them dully  so youve been improving the shining hour eh forrest remarked pointing to the rough steps we shall have to find what you did it with hidden under the mattress i suppose  he stooped down and engleton flew at his throat with all the fury of a wild cat forrest was taken aback for a moment but the effort was only a brief one engletons strength seemed to pass away even before he had concluded his attack he sank back and collapsed upon the floor at a touch  you brutes he muttered  cecil lifted the mattress there was a large flat stone sharpedged and coated with mud lying underneath  i thought so he whispered jove hes gone a long way with it too he muttered looking upward another foot or so and he would have been outside i wonder the place didnt collapse  engleton dragged himself a little way back he remained upon the floor but there was support for his back now against the wall  well he said what is it this evening  the end forrest answered shortly  engleton did not flinch of the three men although his physical condition was the worst he seemed the most at his ease  the end he remarked well i dont believe it i dont believe you have either of you the pluck to go through life with the fear of the rope round your neck every minute but if i am indeed a condemned man i ought to have my privileges give me a cigarette one of you for gods sake  forrest took out his gold case and threw him a couple of cigarettes then he struck a match and passed it over  smoke by all means he said listen in five minutes we are going to throw you from the seaward end of this place down into the cove or creek or whatever they call it it is high tide and the sea there is twenty feet deep as for swimming you evidently havent the strength of a cat and there is no breathing man could swim against the current far enough to reach any place where he could climb out but to avoid even that risk we are going to give you a little chloroform first it will make things easier for you and we shall not be distressed by your shrieks  an amiable programme engleton muttered i am quite ready for it  then i dont think we need waste words forrest said slowly you have made up your mind i suppose that you do not care about life remember that it is not we who are your executioners you have an easy choice  if you mean engleton said will i purchase my liberty by letting you two blackguards off free for this and for your dirty cardsharping i say no i will take my chances of life to the last second afterwards i shall know that i am revenged men dont go happily through life with the little black devil sitting on their shoulders  well take our risk forrest said thickly you have chosen then this is your last chance  absolutely engleton answered  forrest took out the phial from his pocket and held his handkerchief on the palm of his hand  open the door will you cecil he said so that we can carry him out  cecil opened it and came slowly back to where forrest was counting the drops which fell from the bottle on to his handkerchief then he suddenly came to a standstill forrest too paused in his task and looked up he gave a nervous start and the bottle fell from his fingers  what in gods name was that he asked  it came to them faintly down the long passage but it was nevertheless alarming enough the hoarse clanging of a bell pulled by impetuous fingers cecil and forrest stared at one another for a moment with dilated eyes  cant you speak you dd young fool forrest asked what bell is that  it is the frontdoor bell of the red hall cecil answered in a voice which he scarcely recognized as his own there it goes again  they stood perfectly silent and listened to it listened until its echoes died away     chapter xv   for the fourth time the bell rang the two men had now retraced their steps cecil who had been standing in the hall within a few feet of the closed door started away as though he had received some sort of shock forrest who was lurking back in the shadows cursed him for a timid fool  open the door man he whispered dont stand fumbling there remember you are angry at being disturbed send them away whoever they are look sharp they are going to ring again cant you hear that beastly bellwire quivering  cecil set his teeth turned the huge key and pulled back the heavy door he gave a little gasp of astonishment it was a woman who stood there he held out his electric torch and stepped back with a sharp exclamation  kate he cried what on earth are you doing here at this hour what do you mean by ringing the bell like that  the girl stepped into the hall  close the door she said the wind will blow the pictures off the walls and i can scarcely hear you speak  cecil obeyed at once  light a lamp she said it is not fair that you should have all the light i want to see your face too  but kate cecil interrupted why did you come like this why did you not  she interrupted  never mind she answered sternly perhaps i did not come to see you at all light the lamp there is something i have to say to you  forrest stepped forward from the obscurity and struck a match the girl showed no signs of fear at his coming as the lamp grew brighter she looked at him steadfastly  so this is the reason we are waked up in the middle of the night forrest remarked with a smile which somehow or other seemed to lose its suggestiveness a little affair of this sort eh mr cecil why dont you teach the young lady a simpler way of summoning you than by that infernal bell  still kate did not reply she was standing with her back to the oak table in the centre of the hall and the men who were both watching her covertly were conscious of a certain significance in her attitude her black hair was tossed all over her face from its tangled web her eyes seemed to gleam with a steady inimical gaze her dress of dark red stuff was splashed in places with the salt water and her feet were soaking with her left hand she clasped the table her right seemed hidden in the folds of her skirt  what do you want kate cecil asked at last what do you mean by coming here like this if you want to see me you know how without arousing the whole household at this time of night  you are not fool enough kate said calmly to imagine that i came tonight to listen to your lies i came to know whom it is that you are keeping hidden away in the smugglers room  neither man answered they looked at one another and cecils face grew once more as pale as death  what do you mean he exclaimed what rubbish is this you are talking kate he added in a sharper tone there is no one there that i know of  you lie she answered calmly you lie as you always do whenever it answers your purpose only an hour ago i lay upon the turf in the plantation there and i heard a man moaning down in the storeroom now tell me the truth cecil de la borne i do not wish to bring any harm upon you although god knows you deserve it but if you do not bring me the man whom you have down there and set him free before my eyes at once ill bring half the village up to the mound there and dig him out  forrest stepped forward his manner was suave and his tone was smooth but there was a dangerous glitter in his eyes  this is rather absurd cecil he said i do not know whom this young lady is but i feel sure that she will listen to reason there is no one down in the smugglers storeroom if she heard anything it was probably the rabbits  lies kate answered calmly you are another of the breed i can see it in your face i would not trust the word of either of you  forrest shrugged his shoulders he glanced towards cecil with a slight uplifting of the eyebrows  your friend my dear cecil he remarked is like most of her sex a trifle unreasonable however since she says that she will believe no evidence save the evidence of her eyes show her the smugglers room it would be a quaint excursion to take at this time of night but i will go with you for the sake of the proprieties he added with a little laugh  cecil looked at him for a moment steadily and then turned away there was fear now upon his face a new fear what was this thing which forrest could propose  she can come if she insists he said slowly but the place has not been opened for a long time the air is bad it really is not fit for any human being  the girl faced them both without shrinking  perhaps you think that i should be afraid she answered perhaps you think that when i am there it would be very easy to dispose of me so that i shall ask no more inconvenient questions never mind i am not afraid i will go with you  cecil shrugged his shoulders as he led the way across the hall  there is nothing to fear he said except the bad air and the ghosts of smugglers if you are superstitious enough to fear them only when you are perfectly satisfied and you are convinced that your errand here has been fruitless perhaps i may have something to say  the girls lips parted curiously enough there was a note almost of real merriment in the laugh which followed  i am not very brave my dear cecil she said but i am not afraid of you i think that one does not fear the things that one understands too well and you i do understand too well much too well  they reached the empty gunroom cecil threw open the hidden door  will you go first or last he said to the girl choose your own place  the girl laughed  the door seemed to open easily she remarked considering that it has not been used for so long  never mind about that cecil said sharply are you coming with us  i am coming kate answered composedly and i will walk last  as you please cecil answered come forrest you may as well see this thing through with me  as they stumbled along the narrow way cecil whispered in forrests ear  what are we going to do with her  god knows forrest answered do you suppose that any one knows where she is who is she  one of the village girls cecil answered an old sweetheart of mine they are strange people and have few friends i doubt whether any one knows that she is out tonight  forrest passed on  if we are going to put our necks into the halter he muttered a little extra trouble wont hurt us  they paused before the door the girl was looking at the padlock  a new padlock i see she remarked listen  they all listened and now there was no doubt about it from inside the room they could hear the sound of a man half singing half moaning  are those rabbits the girl asked leaning forward so that her eyes seemed to gleam like live coal through the darkness cecil you are being made a fool of by this man i dont wish you any harm do the right thing now and ill stick by you let this man free whoever he is dont listen to what he tells you she added pointing toward forrest  cecil hesitated forrest who was watching him closely could not tell whether that hesitation was genuine or only a feint  it was only a joke this kate he muttered it was a joke which we have carried a little too far yes you shall help me if you will i have had enough of it go inside and see for yourself who is there  cecil threw open the door and kate stepped boldly inside forrest entered last and remained near the threshold engleton started to his feet when he saw a third person  we have brought you a visitor forrest cried out you have complained of being lonely you will not be lonely any longer  kate turned toward him  what do you mean she said we are going to leave here together that man and myself within the next few minutes  you lie forrest answered fiercely you have thrust yourself into a matter which does not concern you and you are going to take the consequences  and what might they be kate asked slowly  they rest with him forrest answered pointing toward engleton there is a man there who was our friend until a few days ago he dared to accuse us of cheating at cards and if we let him go he will ruin us both we are doing what any reasonable men must do we are seeking to preserve ourselves we have kept him here a prisoner but he could have gained his freedom on any day by simply promising to hold his peace he has declined and the time has come when we can leave him no more tonight if he is obstinate we are going to throw him into the sea  and what about me kate asked  you are going with him forrest answered if he is obstinate fool enough to chuck your life away and his he must do it only he had better remember this he added looking across at engleton it will mean two lives now and not one  engleton rose to his feet slowly  who is she he asked pointing to the girl  i am kate caynsard one of the village people here she answered i heard you working tonight from outside you heard me shout back  he nodded  yes he said i know  i will tell the truth the girl continued i was fool enough once to come here to meet that manshe pointed to de la bornethat is all over but one night i was restless and i came wandering through the plantation here it was then i saw from the other end that the place had been altered and it struck me to listen there where the airshaft is i heard voices and the next day they were all talking about the disappearance of lord ronald engleton you i suppose she added are lord ronald  i believe i was he answered with a little catch in his throat god knows who i am now i give it up de la borne if you are going to send the girl after me i give it up ill sign anything you like only let me out of the dd place  a flash of triumph lit up forrests face but it lasted only for a second kate had suddenly turned upon them and was standing with her back to the wall the hand which had been hidden in the folds of her dress so long was suddenly outstretched there was a roar which rang through the place like the rattle of artillery the smell of gunpowder and a little cloud of smoke through it they could see her face her lips parted in a smile the wild disorder of her hair her seastained gown her splendid pose all seemed to make her the central figure of the little tableau  i have five more barrels she said i fired that one to let you know that i was in earnest now if you do not let us go free and without conditions it will be you who will stay here instead of us only you will stay here for ever     chapter xvi   the smoke cleared slowly away engleton had risen to his feet the light of a new hope blazing in his eyes forrest and cecil de la borne stood close together near the door which still stood ajar the girl who stood with her back to the wall saw their involuntary movement towards it and her voice rang out sharp and clear  if you try it on i shoot she exclaimed you know what that means cecil a pistol isnt a plaything with me  cecil looked no more toward the door he came instead a little farther into the room  my dear kate he said we are willing to admit forrest and i that we are beaten you can do exactly what you like with us except leave us here our little joke with engleton is at an end perhaps we carried it too far if so we must face the penalty take him away if you like personally i do not find this place attractive  kate lowered her revolver and turned to engleton  come over to my side she said we are going to leave this place  engleton staggered towards her he had always been thin but he seemed to have lost more flesh in the last few days  for gods sake lets get out he said if i dont breathe some fresh air soon it will be the end of me  in any order you please cecil de la borne said smiling the only condition i make is that before you leave the place altogether kate i have a few minutes conversation with you you can hold your pistol to my temple if you like while i talk but there are a few things i must say  afterwards then she answered we are going first out of the place we shall turn seawards and wait for you when you have come out you will hand us your electric torches and go on in front  you are quite a strategist forrest remarked grimly do as she says cecil the sooner we are out of this the better  kate passed her hand through engletons arm  come along she said lean on me if you are not feeling well do not be afraid they will not dare to touch us  engleton laughed weakly but with the remains of the contempt with which he had always treated his jailers  afraid of them he exclaimed contemptuously i fancy the boot has been on the other leg who you are my dear young lady i do not know but upon my word you are the most welcome companion a man ever had  the pair moved toward the doorway neither forrest nor cecil de la borne made any effort to prevent their passing out kate turned a little to the right and then stood with the revolver clasped in her hand  please come out now she said you will give your electric torch to him  she indicated engleton who stretched out his hand cecil and forrest obeyed her command to the letter engleton held the torch and they all four made their way along the noisome passage forrest turned his head once cautiously toward his companions but cecil shook his head  wait he whispered softly  the thunder of the sea grew less and less distinct before them shone a faint glimmer of light soon they reached the three steps which led up into the gunroom cecil and forrest climbed up kate and engleton followed cecil carefully closed the door behind them  you see he remarked we are reconciled to our defeat let us sit down for a moment and talk  open the window and give me some brandy engleton said  kate felt him suddenly grow heavy upon her arm  bring a chair quick she ordered he is going to faint  she bent over him alarmed at the sudden change in his face her attention for one moment was relaxed then she felt her wrist seized in a grip of iron the revolver which she was still holding fell to the ground and cecil calmly picked it up and thrust it into his pocket  you have played the game very well kate he said now i think it is our turn  she looked at him indignantly but without any trace of fear  you brute she exclaimed cant you see that he has fainted do you want him to die here  not in the least cecil answered here forrest you take care of this he added passing the revolver over to him ill look after engleton  he led him to an easychair close to the window he opened it a few inches and a current of strong fresh air came sweeping in then he poured some brandy into a glass and gave it to kate  let him sip this he said keep his head back thats right we will call a truce for a few moments i am going to talk with my friend  he turned away and kate with a sudden movement sprang toward the fireplace and pulled the bell cecil looked around and smiled contemptuously  it is well thought of he remarked but unfortunately there is not a servant in the house go on ringing it if you like all that it can awake are the echoes  kate dropped the rope and turned back towards engleton the colour was coming slowly back to his cheeks with an effort he kept from altogether losing consciousness  i am not going to faint he said in a low tone i will not tell me they have the pistol  yes kate answered but dont be afraid i am not going back there again nor shall they take you  he pressed her hand  you are a plucky girl he muttered stick to me now and ill never forget it ive held out so long that im dd if i let them off their punishment now  cecil came slowly across the room  feeling better engleton he asked  engleton turned his head  yes he answered i am well enough what of it  wed better have an understanding cecil said  have it then and be dd to you engleton answered you wont get me alive down into that place again if you are going to try try  come cecil said there is no need to talk like that why not pass your word to treat this little matter as a joke its the simplest way go up to your room change your clothes and shave have a drink with us and take the morning train to town its not worth while risking your life for the sake of a little bit of revenge on us for having gone too far i admit that we were wrong in keeping you here you terrified us forrest has more enemies than friends and i am unknown in london if you went to the club with your story people would believe it we shouldnt have a chance that is why we were afraid to let you go back forget the last few days and cry quits  ill see you dd first engleton answered  cecils face changed a little  well he said i have made you a fair offer if you refuse i shall leave it to my friend forrest to deal with you you may not find him so easy as i have been  kate stepped for a moment forward and laid her hand on cecils shoulder  mr de la borne she said we dont want to have anything to say to your friend we trust him less than you open the door and let us out  where are you going to cecil asked engleton is not fit to walk anywhere  i am going to take him back home with me kate answered oh i can get him there all right i am not afraid of that he will have plenty of strength to walk away from this place  it is impossible my dear kate cecil answered take my advice leave him to us we will deal with him reasonably enough kate listen  he passed his arm through hers and drew her a little on one side  kate he said im afraid i havent behaved exactly well to you i got up in london amongst a lot of people who seemed to look at things so differently and there were distractions and im afraid that i forgot some of my promises but i have never forgotten you why do you take the part of that miserable creature over there he is just a young simpleton who because he was half drunk dared to accuse us of cheating we were obliged to keep him shut up until he took it back leave him to us he shall come to no harm i give you my word and i will never forget it  kate looked at him a little curiously  will you keep your promise she asked curiously  cecil hesitated but only for a minute  yes he said i will even do that  she withdrew her arm firmly but without haste  is that all you have to say she asked  i offer you my promise he answered isnt that worth something  something she answered not much i want no more to do with you mr cecil de la borne dont think you can make terms with me for you cant i only hope that you get punished for what you have done  cecil raised his hand as though about to strike her  you little cat he exclaimed well see the thing through then you are prisoners here just as much as though you were in the vault  forrest who had spoken very little came suddenly forward  we have talked too much he said and wasted too much time let us have the issue before us in black and white engleton are you well enough to understand what i say  perfectly engleton answered go on  will you sign a retraction of your charges against us and pledge your word of honour never to repeat them or to make any complaint formal or otherwise as to your detention here  im dd if i will engleton answered  consider what your refusal means first forrest said open the passage door cecil  cecil pushed it back and a little breath of the noxious odour stole into the room  you either make us that promise engleton he said or as sure as im standing here well drag you both down that passage right to the end and throw you into the sea  and hang for it afterwards engleton said with a sneer  not we forrest declared the currents down there are strange ones and it would be many weeks before your bodies were recovered your character in london is pretty well known and kate here has been seen often enough on her way up to the hall people will soon put two and two together there are a dozen places in the spinney where one could slip off into the sea besides we shall have a little evidence to offer oh there is nothing for us to fear i can assure you now then i can see its no use arguing with you any longer  one moment kate said what about the young lady i left outside  cecil turned upon her swiftly  dont tell lies kate he said its a poor sort of tale that  at any rate its no lie kate answered when i came to your front door i left the young lady who was staying here only a few weeks ago miss le mesurier you called her sitting in the barn waiting  cecil laughed scornfully  did she drop from the clouds he asked  she has been staying at the farm kate answered for days i brought her with me tonight because i thought that she might know something about lord ronalds disappearance she is there waiting if i do not return by daylight she will go to the police  i think forrest remarked ironically that we will risk the young lady outside your story my dear is ingenious but scarcely plausible if you are ready cecil  the four of them were suddenly stupefied into a dead silence their eyes were riveted upon the door which led to the underground passage cecils face was almost grotesque with the terrible writing of fear distinctly they could all hear footsteps stumbling along the uneven way forrest was first to recover the power of speech he called out to cecil from the other end of the room  shut the door shut it i say  cecil took a quick step forward before he could reach the door however the girl had thrown her arms round his waist  you shall not close it she cried  who is it coming cecil cried panting  god knows she answered they say the ghosts walk here  he strove to loosen himself from her grasp but he was powerless nevertheless he got a little nearer to the door forrest came swiftly across the room engleton struck at him with a chair but the blow was harmless  stand aside cecil forrest said ill close it  im hanged if you will was the sudden reply  andrew de la borne stepped out of the darkness and stood upright blinking and looking around in amazement     chapter xvii   jeanne was sitting in the garden of the caynsard farm the excitement of the last twentyfour hours had left her languid for once she lay and watched with idle almost with indifferent eyes the great stretch of marshes riven with the incoming sea she saw the fishing boats that a few hours ago were dead inert things upon a bed of mud come gliding up the tortuous waterways on the horizon was the sea bank with its long line of poles and the wires connecting the coastguard stations they stood like silent sentinels clean and distinct against the empty background jeanne sighed as she watched and the thoughts came crowding into her head it was a restful country this a country of timeworn mouldering grey churches and of immemorial landmarks a country where everything seemed fixed and restful everything except the sea a wave of self pity swept over her after all she had lived a very little time to know so much unhappiness worse than all this morning she was filled with apprehensions she feared something she scarcely knew what or from what direction it might come the song of the larks brought her no comfort the familiar and beautiful places upon which she looked pleased her no more she was glad when kate caynsard came out of the house and moved slowly towards her  kate too showed some of the signs of the recent excitement there were black lines under her wonderful eyes and she walked hesitatingly without any of the firm splendid grace which made her movements a delight to watch jeanne was afraid at first that she was going to turn away and called to her  kate she exclaimed i want you come here and talk to me  kate threw herself on to the ground by jeannes side  all the talking in the world she murmured will not change the things that happened last night they will not even smooth away the evil memories  jeanne was silent there was a thought in her head which had been there twisting and biting its way in her brain through the silent hours of the night and again in her waking moments she looked down towards her companion stretched at her feet  kate she said how did mr andrew get the message that brought him to the red hall last night  i sent it kate answered i sent him word that there were things going on at the red hall which i could not understand i told him that i thought it would be well if he came  you knew his address jeanne asked a little coldly  yes kate answered  you have written him before perhaps jeanne asked  yes the girl answered absently  there was a short silence each of the two seemed occupied in her own thoughts when jeanne spoke again her manner was changed the other girl noticed it without being conscious of the reason  what has happened this morning do you know jeanne asked  they are all at the red hall still kate answered major forrest tried to leave this morning but mr andrew would not let him he will not let either of them go away until lord ronald is well enough to say what shall be done  i wonder jeanne said what would have happened if mr andrew had not arrived last night  god knows kate answered he is a wily brute the man forrest how was it that you she added found mr andrew  i waited on the mound in the plantation jeanne said with my ear to the ground and presently i heard a pistol shot and then a scuffle and afterwards silence i was frightened and i made my way to the road and hurried along toward the village then i saw a cart and i stopped it and inside was mr andrew on his way from wells i told him something of what was happening and he put me in the cart and sent me back then he went on to the red hall  kate nodded slowly  i am glad that i sent for him she said i am afraid that last night there would have been bloodshed if he had not come when he was there there was not one who dared speak or move any more except as he directed he is very strong and he was made i think to command men  jeannes lips quivered for a moment her eyes were fixed upon the distant figure motionless now upon the raised sandbanks kate had turned her head toward the red hall and was looking at one of the windows there as though her eyes would pierce the distance  tell me jeanne asked i have seen you once with mr de la borne he is a great friend of yours  he was the girl at her feet whispered  jeanne found herself shaking she stooped down  what do you mean she whispered  kate looked up from the ground she raised herself a little for a moment her eyes flashed  i mean she said that before you came he was more than a friend it was you who drove his thoughts of me away you with your great fortune and your childish foreign ways oh i talk like a fool i know she said springing up but i am not a fool i do not hate you i have never tried to do you any harm it is not your fault it is what one calls fate once she cried we caynsards lived along the coast there in a house greater than the red hall and our lands were richer generation after generation of us have been pushed by fortune downwards and downwards the men lose lands and money and the women disgrace themselves or creep into some corner to die with a broken heart i talk to you as one of the villagers here i know very well that i speak the dialect of the peasants and that my words are illchosen how can i help it we are all paupers every one of us that is why sometimes i feel that i cannot breathe that is why i do mad things and people believe that i am indeed out of my mind  she sprang to her feet jeanne tried to detain her  let me talk to you for a little time kate she begged you are none of the things you fancy and i am very sure that mr de la borne does not care for me or for my fortune stay just for a minute  but kate was already gone jeanne could see her speeding down to the harbour and a few minutes later gliding down the creek in her little catboat  the count de brensault was angry and he had not sufficient dignity to hide it the princess in whose boudoir he was regarded him from her sofa as one might look at some strange animal  my dear count she said it is not reasonable that you should be angry with me is it my fault that i am plagued with a stepdaughter of so extraordinary a temperament she will return directly or we shall find her i am sure of it the wedding can be arranged then as speedily as you wish i give her to you i consent to your marriage what could woman do more  that is all very well the count said all very well indeed but i do not understand how it is that a young lady could disappear from her home like this and that her guardian should know nothing about it where could she have gone to you say that she had very little money why should she go who was unkind to her  all that i did the princess answered was to tell her that she must marry you  the count twirled his moustache  is it likely he demanded that that should drive her away from her home the idea of marriage it may terrify these young misses at the first thought but in their hearts they are very very glad ah he added softly i have had some experience i am not a boy  the princess looked at him whatever her thoughts may have been her face remained inscrutable  no the count continued drawing his chair a little nearer to the princess couch and leaning towards her i do not believe that it was the fear of marriage which drove little jeanne to disappear  then what do you believe my dear count the princess asked  his eyes seemed to narrow  perhaps he said significantly you may have thought that with her great fortune and seeing me a little foolish for her that you had not driven quite a good enough bargain eh  you insulting beast the princess remarked  the count grinned he was in no way annoyed  ah he said i am a man whom it is not easy to deceive i have seen very much of the world and i know the ways of women a woman who wants money my dear princess is very very clever and not too honest  your experiences count the princess said may be interesting but i do not see how they concern me  but they might concern you the count said if i were to speak plainly if for instance i were to double that little amount we spoke of  do you mean to insinuate the princess remarked that i know where jeanne is now that it is i who have put her out of the way for a little time in order to make a better bargain with you  the count bowed his head  a very clever scheme he declared a very clever scheme indeed  the princess drew a little breath then she looked at the count and suddenly laughed after all it was not worth while to be angry with such a creature besides if jeanne should turn up she might as well have the extra money  you give me credit i fear she said for being a cleverer woman than i am but as a matter of curiosity supposing i am able to hand you over jeanne very shortly would you agree to double the little amount we have spoken of  i will double it the count declared solemnly you see when i wish for a thing i am generous i can only hope he added with a peculiar smile miss jeanne may soon make her reappearance there was a knock at the door the princess looked up frowning her maid put her head cautiously in  i am sorry to disturb you madam against your orders she said but miss jeanne has just arrived     chapter xviii   the count opened his mouth it was his way of expressing supreme astonishment the princess sat bolt upright on her couch and gazed at jeanne with wideopen and dilated eyes curiously enough it was the count who first recovered himself  is it a game this he asked softly you press the button and the little girl appears that means that i increase the stakes and the prize pops up  the princess rose to her feet she crossed the room to meet jeanne with outstretched arms  shut up you fool she said to the count in passing jeanne my child she added is it really you  jeanne accepted the proffered embrace without enthusiasm she recognized the count however with a little wave of colour  yes she said quietly i have come back i am sorry i went away it was a mistake a great mistake  you have driven us nearly wild with anxiety the princess declared where have you been to  yes the count echoed fixing his eyes upon her where have you been to  jeanne behaved with a composure which astonished them both she calmly unbuttoned her gloves and seated herself in the easychair  i have been to salthouse she said  what back to the red hall the princess exclaimed  jeanne shook her head  no she said i have been in rooms at a farmhouse there caynsards farm i went away because i did not like the life here and because my stepmother she continued turning toward the count seemed determined that i should marry you i thought that i would go away into the country somewhere where i could think quietly i went to salthouse because it was the only place i knew  you are the maddest child the princess exclaimed  jeanne smiled a little wearily  if i have been mad she said i have come to my senses again  the count leaned toward her eagerly  i trust he said that that means that you are ready now to obey your stepmother and to make me very very happy  jeanne looked at him deliberately  it depends she said upon circumstances  tell me what they are quickly the count declared i am impatient i cannot bear that you keep me waiting let me know of my happiness  the princess was suddenly uneasy there was one weak point in her schemes a weakness of her own creating ever since she had told jeanne the truth about her lack of fortune she had felt that it was a mistake suppose she should be idiot enough to give the thing away the princess felt her heart beat fast at the mere supposition there was something about jeannes delicate oval face her straight mouth and level eyebrows which somehow suggested that gift which to the princess was so incomprehensible in her sex the gift of honesty suppose jeanne were to tell the count the truth  first of all then jeanne said i must ask you whether my stepmother has told the truth about myself and my fortune  the princess knew then that the game was up she sank back upon the sofa and at that moment she would have declared that there was nothing in the world more terrible than an ungrateful and inconsiderate child  the truth the count remarked a little puzzled i know only what the world knows that you are the daughter of carl le mesurier and that he left you the residue of one of the greatest fortunes in europe  jeanne drew a letter from her pocket  the princess she remarked must have forgotten to tell you this great fortune that all the world has spoken of and that seems to have made me so famous has been all the time something of a myth it has existed only in the imaginations of my kind friends a few days ago my stepmother here told me of this i wrote at once to monsieur laplanche my trustee she would not let me send the letter when i was at salthouse however i wrote again and this time i had a reply it is here there is a statement she continued which covers many pages and which shows exactly how my fathers fortune was exaggerated how securities have dwindled and how my stepmothers insisting upon a very large allowance during my schooldays has eaten up so much of the residue there is left to me it appears a sum of fourteen thousand pounds that is a very small fortune is it not she asked calmly  the count was gazing at her as one might gaze upon a tragedy  it is not a fortune he exclaimed it is not even a dot it is nothing at all a years income a trifle  nevertheless jeanne said calmly it is all that i possess you see she continued i have come back to my stepmother to tell her that if i am bound by law to do as she wishes until i am of age i will be dutiful and marry the man whom she chooses for me but i wish to tell you two things quite frankly the first you have just heard the second is that i do not care for you in the least that in fact i rather dislike you  the princess buried her head in her hands she was not anxious to look at any one just then or to be looked at the count rose to his feet there were drops of perspiration upon his forehead he was distracted  is this true madam he asked of the princess  it is true she admitted  he leaned towards her  what about my three thousand pounds he whispered who will pay me back that it is cheating that money has been gained by what you call false pretences there is punishment for that eh  the princess dabbed at her eyes with a little morsel of lace handkerchief  one must live she murmured it was not i who talked about jeannes fortune it was all the world who said how rich she was why should i contradict them i wanted a place once more in the only society in europe which counts english society there was only one way and i took it so long as people believed jeanne to be the heiress of a great fortune i was made welcome wherever i chose to go that is the truth my dear count  it is all very well the count answered but the money i have advanced you  you took your own risk the princess answered coldly i was not to know that you were expecting to repay yourself out of jeannes fortune it is not too late you are not married to her  no the count said slowly i am not married to her  the princess watched him from the corners of her eyes he was evidently very much distracted he walked up and down the room every now and then he glanced at jeanne jeanne was very pale but she wore a hat with a small green quill which he had once admired certainly she had an air she was distinguished there was something vaguely provocative about her a charm which he could not help but feel he stopped short in the middle of his perambulations it was the moment of his life he felt himself a hero  madam he said addressing the princess i have been badly treated there is no one who would not admit that i have been deceiveda man less kind than i might say robbed no matter i forget it all i forget my disappointment i forget that this young lady whom you offer me for a wife has a dot so pitifully small that it counts for nothing i take her i accept her jeanne he added moving towards her you hear it is because i love you so very very much  jeanne shrank back in her chair  you mean she cried that you are willing to take me now that you know everything now that you know i have so little money you mean that you want to marry me still  the count assented graciously never in the course of his whole life had he admired himself so much  i forget everything he declared with a little wave of the hand except that i love you and that you are the one woman in the world whom i wish to make the comtesse de brensault mademoiselle permits me  he stooped and raised her cold hand to his lips jeanne looked at him with the fascinated despair of some stricken animal the princess rose to her feet it was wonderful thisa triumph beyond all thought  jeanne my child she said you are the most fortunate girl i know to have inspired a devotion so great count she added you are wonderful you deserve all the happiness which i am sure will come to you  the count looked as though he were perfectly convinced of it all the same he whispered in her ear a moment later  you must pay me back that three thousand pounds     chapter xix   for the princess it was a day full of excitements the count had only just reluctantly withdrawn and jeanne had gone to her room under the plea of fatigue when forrest was shown in she started at the look in his drawn face  nigel she exclaimed hastily is everything all right  he threw himself into a chair  everything he answered is all wrong everything is over  the princess saw then that he had aged during the last few days that this man whose care of himself had kept him comparatively youthful looking notwithstanding the daily routine of an unwholesome life was showing signs at last of breaking down there were lines about his eyes little baggy places underneath he dragged his feet across the carpet as though he were tired the princess pushed up an easychair and went herself to the sideboard  give me a little brandy he said or rather a good deal of brandy i need it  the princess felt her own hand shake she brought him a tumbler and sat down by his side  you had to kill him she asked in a whisper is it that  forrest set down his glassempty  no he answered we were going to when a mad woman who lives there got into the place and found us out we had them safe the two of them when the worst thing happened which could have befallen us andrew de la borne broke in upon us  the princess listened with set face  go on she said what happened  the game was up so far as we were concerned he answered cecil crumpled up before his brother and gave the whole show away there was nothing left for me to do but to wait and hear what they had to say before i decided whether or no to make my graceful exit from the stage  go on she commanded what happened exactly  we were kept there he continued until this morning waiting until engleton was well enough to make up his mind what to do the end is simple enough considering that but for that girls intervention engleton would have been in the sea by now and he knows it i suppose it might have been worse i have signed a paper undertaking to leave england within fortyeight hours and never to show myself in this country again further i am not to play cards at any time with any englishman  is that all the princess asked  yes forrest answered i suppose you would say that they have let me off lightly i wish i could feel so if ever a man was sick of those dirty disreputable foreign places where one holds on to life and respectability only with the tips of ones fingernails i am i think i shall chuck it ena i am tired of those foreign crowds suspicious semidisreputable theres something wrong with every one of them even the few decent ones you know very well speak to you because you are in a foreign country and would cut you in pall mall  it isnt so bad as that the princess said calmly there are some of the places worth living in you must live a quieter life spend less and find distractions you used to be so fond of shooting and golf  he laughed hardly  how am i to live he demanded away from the cardtables what do you suppose my income is a blank it is worse than a blank for i owe bills which i shall never pay how am i going to live from day to day unless i go on the same infernal treadmill i am an adventurer i know he went on but what is one to do who has the tastes and education of a gentleman and not even money enough to buy a farm and work with ones hands for a living  the princess moved to the window and back again  i too nigel she said have had shocks jeanne has come back she has been at salthouse all the time  it was probably she then who sent for de la borne forrest said wearily  perhaps so the princess assented but listen to this it will surprise you she came back and she told de brensault in this room only a short while ago that her supposed fortune was a myth de brensault took it like a lamb he wants to marry her still  forrest looked up in amazement  and will he he asked  oh i do not know the princess answered nigel i am sick of life myself there are times when everything you have been trying for seems not worth while when even ones fundamental ideas come tottering down just now i feel as though every stone in the foundation of what has seemed to me to mean life is rotten and insecure i am tired of it shall i tell you what i feel like doing  yes he answered  i have a little house in silesia where i am still a great lady halfadozen servants perhaps farms which bring in a trifle of money i think i will go and live there i think i will get up in the mornings as jeanne does and try to love my mountains and go about amongst my people and try to spell life with different letters come with me nigel there is shooting and fishing there and horses wild enough for even you to find pleasure in riding we have tried many things in life let us make one last throw and try the land of arcady  he looked at her at first in amazement afterwards some change seemed to come into his face called there perhaps by what he saw in hers  ena he said you mean it  absolutely she answered fortunately we are both free and we can set our peasants an absolutely respectable example you shall be farmer and i will be housewife nigel it is an inspiration  he bent over her fingers  i wonder he murmured if there is good enough left in me to make it worth your while  late that afternoon another caller thundered at the door of the house in berkeley square the duke of westerham desired to see miss le mesurier the butler was respectful but doubtful miss le mesurier had just arrived from a journey and was lying down the duke however was insistent he waited twenty minutes in a small back morningroom and presently jeanne came in to him  he held out his hands  little girl he said you know what you promised i am afraid that you have forgotten  she smiled pitifully  no she said i have not forgotten i went away alone because i had to go because i wanted to be quite alone and quite quiet now i have come home and there is no one who can help me at all  rubbish he answered there was never trouble in the world where a friend couldnt help what is it now  she shook her head  i cannot tell you she said only i am going to marry the count de brensault  im hanged if you are the duke declared vigorously look here miss jeanne this is your stepmothers doing i know all about it dont you believe that in this country you are obliged to marry any one whom you dont want to  but i do want to jeanne answered or rather i dont mind whom i do marry or whether i marry any one or no one  the duke was grave  i thought he said that my friend andrew had a chance  her face was suddenly burning  mr andrew she said does not want me i mean that it is impossible oh if you please she added bursting into tears wont you let me alone i am going to marry the count de brensault i have quite made up my mind perhaps you have not heard that it is all a mistake about my having a great fortune the count de brensault is very kind and he is going to marry me although i have no money  the duke stared at her for several moments then he rang the bell  will you tell your mistress he said to the servant that the duke of westerham would be exceedingly obliged if she would spare him five minutes here and now  the man bowed and withdrew the princess came almost at once  madam the duke said i trust that you will forgive my sending for you but i am very much interested in the happiness of our little friend miss jeanne here she tells me that she is going to marry the count de brensault that she has lost her fortune and she is evidently very unhappy will you forgive me if i ask you whether this marriage is being forced upon her  the princess hesitated  no she said it is not that jeanne told him of her loss of fortune she told him too without any prompting from me that she would marry him if he still wished it that is all that i know  the duke bowed he moved a few steps across towards the princess  princess he said will you make a friend will you let me take your little girl to my sisters for say one week you shall have her back then and you shall do as you will with her  willingly the princess answered i am only anxious that she should be happy  the duke marvelled then at the sincerity in her tone nevertheless for fear she should change her mind he hurried jeanne out of the house into his brougham     chapter xx   so this the duke said is your wonderful land  is there anything like it in the world jeanne asked as she stood bareheaded on the grassbanked dyke with her face turned seaward  above their heads the larks were singing to their right stretched the marshes and pasture land as yet untouched by the sea glorious with streaks of colour fragrant with the perfume of wild lavender and mosses to their left through the opening in the sandbanks came streaming the full tide rushing up into the land making silver waterways of muddy places bringing with it all the salt and freshness and joy of the sea over their heads the seagulls cried far away a heron lifted its head from a tuft of weeds and sent his strange call travelling across the level distance  oh it is beautiful to be here again jeanne said even though it hurts she added in a lower tone it is beautiful  a little boat came darting down the shallows kate caynsard stood up and waved her hand jeanne waved back a sudden flush of colour stained her cheeks her first impulse seemed to be to turn away she conquered it however and beckoned to the girl who ran her boat close to them  my last sail the girl cried as she stepped to land i am saying goodbye to all these wonderful places miss le mesurier she added tomorrow we are going to sail for canada  jeanne looked at her in amazement  you are going to canada she asked  the girl too was surprised  have you not heard she said i thought perhaps that mr andrew might have told you cecil and i are sailing tomorrow directly after we are married he has bought a farm out there  jeanne felt for a moment that the beautiful world was spinning round her she clutched at the dukes arm  you are going to canada with cecil she exclaimed  of course kate answered a little shyly i thought in fact i know that i told you about him wont you wish me joy she added holding out her hand a little timidly  jeanne grasped it to the girls surprise jeannes eyes were full of tears  oh i am so foolish she declared i have been so mad i thought you said mr de la borne  hang it all the duke exclaimed i believe you thought that she meant our friend andrew dont you know that all the world here half the time calls cecil mr de la borne and andrew mr andrew  kate looked behind her and touched the duke on the sleeve  wouldnt you like sir she asked a little timidly to come for a sail with me  the duke saw what she saw and notwithstanding his years and his weight he clambered into the little boat jeanne turned round and walked slowly towards the man who came so swiftly along the dyke it was a dream she felt that it must be a dream  andrew with his gun over his shoulder his rough tweed clothes splashed with black mud gazed at her as though she were an apparition then he saw something in her face which told him so much that he forgot the little catboat barely out of sight he forgot the little redroofed village barely a mile away he forgot the lone figures of the shrimpers standing like sentinels far away in the salt pools he took jeanne into his arms and he felt her lips melt upon his  the duke was right then he murmured a moment later as he stood back for a moment his face transformed with the new thing that had come into his life  dear man jeanne murmured  they watched the boat gliding away in the distance  i believe he declared that they went away on purpose  she laughed as they scrambled down on to the marsh and turned toward the place where he had first met her  i believe they did she answered
