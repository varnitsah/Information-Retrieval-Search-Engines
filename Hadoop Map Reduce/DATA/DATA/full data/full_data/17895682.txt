sight of the money rattles me everything rattles me  the moment i cross the threshold of a bank and attempt to transact business there i become an irresponsible idiot  i knew this beforehand but my salary had been raised to fifty dollars a month and i felt that the bank was the only place for it  so i shambled in and looked timidly round at the clerks i had an idea that a person about to open an account must needs consult the manager  i went up to a wicket marked accountant the accountant was a tall cool devil the very sight of him rattled me my voice was sepulchral  can i see the manager i said and added solemnly alone i dont know why i said alone  certainly said the accountant and fetched him  the manager was a grave calm man i held my fiftysix dollars clutched in a crumpled ball in my pocket  are you the manager i said god knows i didnt doubt it  yes he said  can i see you i asked alone i didnt want to say alone again but without it the thing seemed selfevident  the manager looked at me in some alarm he felt that i had an awful secret to reveal  come in here he said and led the way to a private room he turned the key in the lock  we are safe from interruption here he said sit down  we both sat down and looked at each other i found no voice to speak  you are one of pinkertons men i presume he said  he had gathered from my mysterious manner that i was a detective i knew what he was thinking and it made me worse  no not from pinkertons i said seeming to imply that i came from a rival agency  to tell the truth i went on as if i had been prompted to lie about it i am not a detective at all i have come to open an account i intend to keep all my money in this bank  the manager looked relieved but still serious he concluded now that i was a son of baron rothschild or a young gould  a large account i suppose he said  fairly large i whispered i propose to deposit fiftysix dollars now and fifty dollars a month regularly  the manager got up and opened the door he called to the accountant  mr montgomery he said unkindly loud this gentleman is opening an account he will deposit fiftysix dollars good morning  i rose  a big iron door stood open at the side of the room  good morning i said and stepped into the safe  come out said the manager coldly and showed me the other way  i went up to the accountants wicket and poked the ball of money at him with a quick convulsive movement as if i were doing a conjuring trick  my face was ghastly pale  here i said deposit it the tone of the words seemed to mean let us do this painful thing while the fit is on us  he took the money and gave it to another clerk  he made me write the sum on a slip and sign my name in a book i no longer knew what i was doing the bank swam before my eyes  is it deposited i asked in a hollow vibrating voice  it is said the accountant  then i want to draw a cheque  my idea was to draw out six dollars of it for present use someone gave me a chequebook through a wicket and someone else began telling me how to write it out the people in the bank had the impression that i was an invalid millionaire i wrote something on the cheque and thrust it in at the clerk he looked at it  what are you drawing it all out again he asked in surprise then i realized that i had written fiftysix instead of six i was too far gone to reason now i had a feeling that it was impossible to explain the thing all the clerks had stopped writing to look at me  reckless with misery i made a plunge  yes the whole thing  you withdraw your money from the bank  every cent of it  are you not going to deposit any more said the clerk astonished  never  an idiot hope struck me that they might think something had insulted me while i was writing the cheque and that i had changed my mind i made a wretched attempt to look like a man with a fearfully quick temper  the clerk prepared to pay the money  how will you have it he said  what  how will you have it  ohi caught his meaning and answered without even trying to thinkin fifties  he gave me a fiftydollar bill  and the six he asked dryly  in sixes i said  he gave it me and i rushed out  as the big door swung behind me i caught the echo of a roar of laughter that went up to the ceiling of the bank since then i bank no more i keep my money in cash in my trousers pocket and my savings in silver dollars in a sock     lord oxheads secret  a romance in one chapter  it was finished ruin had come lord oxhead sat gazing fixedly at the library fire without the wind soughed or sogged around the turrets of oxhead towers the seat of the oxhead family but the old earl heeded not the sogging of the wind around his seat he was too absorbed  before him lay a pile of blue papers with printed headings from time to time he turned them over in his hands and replaced them on the table with a groan to the earl they meant ruinabsolute irretrievable ruin and with it the loss of his stately home that had been the pride of the oxheads for generations more than thatthe world would now know the awful secret of his life  the earl bowed his head in the bitterness of his sorrow for he came of a proud stock about him hung the portraits of his ancestors here on the right an oxhead who had broken his lance at crecy or immediately before it there mcwhinnie oxhead who had ridden madly from the stricken field of flodden to bring to the affrighted burghers of edinburgh all the tidings that he had been able to gather in passing the battlefield next him hung the dark half spanish face of sir amyas oxhead of elizabethan days whose pinnace was the first to dash to plymouth with the news that the english fleet as nearly as could be judged from a reasonable distance seemed about to grapple with the spanish armada below this the two cavalier brothers giles and everard oxhead who had sat in the oak with charles ii then to the right again the portrait of sir ponsonby oxhead who had fought with wellington in spain and been dismissed for it  immediately before the earl as he sat was the family escutcheon emblazoned above the mantelpiece a child might read the simplicity of its proud significancean ox rampant quartered in a field of gules with a pike dexter and a dog intermittent in a plain parallelogram right centre with the motto hic haec hoc hujus hujus hujus                   fatherthe girls voice rang clear through the half light of the wainscoted library gwendoline oxhead had thrown herself about the earls neck the girl was radiant with happiness gwendoline was a beautiful girl of thirtythree typically english in the freshness of her girlish innocence she wore one of those charming walking suits of brown holland so fashionable among the aristocracy of england while a rough leather belt encircled her waist in a single sweep she bore herself with that sweet simplicity which was her greatest charm she was probably more simple than any girl of her age for miles around gwendoline was the pride of her fathers heart for he saw reflected in her the qualities of his race  father she said a blush mantling her fair face i am so happy oh so happy edwin has asked me to be his wife and we have plighted our trothat least if you consent for i will never marry without my fathers warrant she added raising her head proudly i am too much of an oxhead for that  then as she gazed into the old earls stricken face the girls mood changed at once father she cried father are you ill what is it shall i ring as she spoke gwendoline reached for the heavy bellrope that hung beside the wall but the earl fearful that her frenzied efforts might actually make it ring checked her hand i am indeed deeply troubled said lord oxhead but of that anon tell me first what is this news you bring i hope gwendoline that your choice has been worthy of an oxhead and that he to whom you have plighted your troth will be worthy to bear our motto with his own and raising his eyes to the escutcheon before him the earl murmured half unconsciously hic haec hoc hujus hujus hujus breathing perhaps a prayer as many of his ancestors had done before him that he might never forget it  father continued gwendoline half timidly edwin is an american  you surprise me indeed answered lord oxhead and yet he continued turning to his daughter with the courtly grace that marked the nobleman of the old school why should we not respect and admire the americans surely there have been great names among them indeed our ancestor sir amyas oxhead was i think married to pocahontasat least if not actually marriedthe earl hesitated a moment  at least they loved one another said gwendoline simply  precisely said the earl with relief they loved one another yes exactly then as if musing to himself yes there have been great americans bolivar was an american the two washingtonsgeorge and bookerare both americans there have been others too though for the moment i do not recall their names but tell me gwendoline this edwin of yourswhere is his family seat  it is at oshkosh wisconsin father  ah say you so rejoined the earl with rising interest oshkosh is indeed a grand old name the oshkosh are a russian family an ivan oshkosh came to england with peter the great and married my ancestress their descendant in the second degree once removed mixtup oshkosh fought at the burning of moscow and later at the sack of salamanca and the treaty of adrianople and wisconsin too the old nobleman went on his features kindling with animation for he had a passion for heraldry genealogy chronology and commercial geography the wisconsins or better i think the guisconsins are of old blood a guisconsin followed henry i to jerusalem and rescued my ancestor hardup oxhead from the saracens another guisconsin  nay father said gwendoline gently interrupting wisconsin is not edwins own name that is i believe the name of his estate my lovers name is edwin einstein  einstein repeated the earl dubiouslyan indian name perhaps yet the indians are many of them of excellent family an ancestor of mine  father said gwendoline again interrupting here is a portrait of edwin judge for yourself if he be noble with this she placed in her fathers hand an american tintype tinted in pink and brown the picture represented a typical specimen of american manhood of that anglosemitic type so often seen in persons of mixed english and jewish extraction the figure was well over five feet two inches in height and broad in proportion the graceful sloping shoulders harmonized with the slender and wellpoised waist and with a hand pliant and yet prehensile the pallor of the features was relieved by a drooping black moustache  such was edwin einstein to whom gwendolines heart if not her hand was already affianced their love had been so simple and yet so strange it seemed to gwendoline that it was but a thing of yesterday and yet in reality they had met three weeks ago love had drawn them irresistibly together to edwin the fair english girl with her old name and wide estates possessed a charm that he scarcely dared confess to himself he determined to woo her to gwendoline there was that in edwins bearing the rich jewels that he wore the vast fortune that rumour ascribed to him that appealed to something romantic and chivalrous in her nature she loved to hear him speak of stocks and bonds corners and margins and his fathers colossal business it all seemed so noble and so far above the sordid lives of the people about her edwin too loved to hear the girl talk of her fathers estates of the diamondhilted sword that the saladin had given or had lent to her ancestor hundreds of years ago her description of her father the old earl touched something romantic in edwins generous heart he was never tired of asking how old he was was he robust did a shock a sudden shock affect him much and so on then had come the evening that gwendoline loved to live over and over again in her mind when edwin had asked her in his straightforward manly way whethersubject to certain written stipulations to be considered latershe would be his wife and she putting her hand confidingly in his hand answered simply thatsubject to the consent of her father and pending always the necessary legal formalities and inquiriesshe would  it had all seemed like a dream and now edwin einstein had come in person to ask her hand from the earl her father indeed he was at this moment in the outer hall testing the gold leaf in the pictureframes with his penknife while waiting for his affianced to break the fateful news to lord oxhead  gwendoline summoned her courage for a great effort papa she said there is one other thing that it is fair to tell you edwins father is in business  the earl started from his seat in blank amazement in business he repeated the father of the suitor of the daughter of an oxhead in business my daughter the stepdaughter of the grandfather of my grandson are you mad girl it is too much too much  but father pleaded the beautiful girl in anguish hear me it is edwins fathersarcophagus einstein seniornot edwin himself edwin does nothing he has never earned a penny he is quite unable to support himself you have only to see him to believe it indeed dear father he is just like us he is here now in this house waiting to see you if it were not for his great wealth  girl said the earl sternly i care not for the mans riches how much has he  fifteen million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars answered gwendoline lord oxhead leaned his head against the mantelpiece his mind was in a whirl he was trying to calculate the yearly interest on fifteen and a quarter million dollars at four and a half per cent reduced to pounds shillings and pence it was bootless his brain trained by long years of high living and plain thinking had become too subtle too refined an instrument for arithmetic                   at this moment the door opened and edwin einstein stood before the earl gwendoline never forgot what happened through her life the picture of it haunted herher lover upright at the door his fine frank gaze fixed inquiringly on the diamond pin in her fathers necktie and he her father raising from the mantelpiece a face of agonized amazement  you you he gasped for a moment he stood to his full height swaying and groping in the air then fell prostrate his full length upon the floor the lovers rushed to his aid edwin tore open his neckcloth and plucked aside his diamond pin to give him air but it was too late earl oxhead had breathed his last life had fled the earl was extinct that is to say he was dead  the reason of his death was never known had the sight of edwin killed him it might have the old family doctor hurriedly summoned declared his utter ignorance this too was likely edwin himself could explain nothing but it was observed that after the earls death and his marriage with gwendoline he was a changed man he dressed better talked much better english  the wedding itself was quiet almost sad at gwendolines request there was no wedding breakfast no bridesmaids and no reception while edwin respecting his brides bereavement insisted that there should be no best man no flowers no presents and no honeymoon  thus lord oxheads secret died with him it was probably too complicated to be interesting anyway     boardinghouse geometry  definitions and axioms  all boardinghouses are the same boardinghouse  boarders in the same boardinghouse and on the same flat are equal to one another  a single room is that which has no parts and no magnitude  the landlady of a boardinghouse is a parallelogramthat is an oblong angular figure which cannot be described but which is equal to anything  a wrangle is the disinclination of two boarders to each other that meet together but are not in the same line  all the other rooms being taken a single room is said to be a double room   postulates and propositions  a pie may be produced any number of times  the landlady can be reduced to her lowest terms by a series of propositions  a bee line may be made from any boardinghouse to any other boardinghouse  the clothes of a boardinghouse bed though produced ever so far both ways will not meet  any two meals at a boardinghouse are together less than two square meals  if from the opposite ends of a boardinghouse a line be drawn passing through all the rooms in turn then the stovepipe which warms the boarders will lie within that line  on the same bill and on the same side of it there should not be two charges for the same thing  if there be two boarders on the same flat and the amount of side of the one be equal to the amount of side of the other each to each and the wrangle between one boarder and the landlady be equal to the wrangle between the landlady and the other then shall the weekly bills of the two boarders be equal also each to each  for if not let one bill be the greater  then the other bill is less than it might have beenwhich is absurd     the awful fate of melpomenus jones  some peoplenot you nor i because we are so awfully selfpossessedbut some people find great difficulty in saying goodbye when making a call or spending the evening as the moment draws near when the visitor feels that he is fairly entitled to go away he rises and says abruptly well i think i then the people say oh must you go now surely its early yet and a pitiful struggle ensues  i think the saddest case of this kind of thing that i ever knew was that of my poor friend melpomenus jones a curatesuch a dear young man and only twentythree he simply couldnt get away from people he was too modest to tell a lie and too religious to wish to appear rude now it happened that he went to call on some friends of his on the very first afternoon of his summer vacation the next six weeks were entirely his ownabsolutely nothing to do he chatted awhile drank two cups of tea then braced himself for the effort and said suddenly  well i think i  but the lady of the house said oh no mr jones cant you really stay a little longer  jones was always truthful oh yes he said of course iercan stay  then please dont go  he stayed he drank eleven cups of tea night was falling he rose again  well now he said shyly i think i really  you must go said the lady politely i thought perhaps you could have stayed to dinner  oh well so i could you know jones said if  then please stay im sure my husband will be delighted  all right he said feebly ill stay and he sank back into his chair just full of tea and miserable  papa came home they had dinner all through the meal jones sat planning to leave at eightthirty all the family wondered whether mr jones was stupid and sulky or only stupid  after dinner mamma undertook to draw him out and showed him photographs she showed him all the family museum several gross of themphotos of papas uncle and his wife and mammas brother and his little boy an awfully interesting photo of papas uncles friend in his bengal uniform an awfully welltaken photo of papas grandfathers partners dog and an awfully wicked one of papa as the devil for a fancydress ball at eightthirty jones had examined seventyone photographs there were about sixtynine more that he hadnt jones rose  i must say good night now he pleaded  say good night they said why its only halfpast eight have you anything to do  nothing he admitted and muttered something about staying six weeks and then laughed miserably  just then it turned out that the favourite child of the family such a dear little romp had hidden mr joness hat so papa said that he must stay and invited him to a pipe and a chat papa had the pipe and gave jones the chat and still he stayed every moment he meant to take the plunge but couldnt then papa began to get very tired of jones and fidgeted and finally said with jocular irony that jones had better stay all night they could give him a shakedown jones mistook his meaning and thanked him with tears in his eyes and papa put jones to bed in the spare room and cursed him heartily  after breakfast next day papa went off to his work in the city and left jones playing with the baby brokenhearted his nerve was utterly gone he was meaning to leave all day but the thing had got on his mind and he simply couldnt when papa came home in the evening he was surprised and chagrined to find jones still there he thought to jockey him out with a jest and said he thought hed have to charge him for his board he he the unhappy young man stared wildly for a moment then wrung papas hand paid him a months board in advance and broke down and sobbed like a child  in the days that followed he was moody and unapproachable he lived of course entirely in the drawingroom and the lack of air and exercise began to tell sadly on his health he passed his time in drinking tea and looking at the photographs he would stand for hours gazing at the photographs of papas uncles friend in his bengal uniformtalking to it sometimes swearing bitterly at it his mind was visibly failing  at length the crash came they carried him upstairs in a raging delirium of fever the illness that followed was terrible he recognized no one not even papas uncles friend in his bengal uniform at times he would start up from his bed and shriek well i think i and then fall back upon the pillow with a horrible laugh then again he would leap up and cry another cup of tea and more photographs more photographs har har  at length after a month of agony on the last day of his vacation he passed away they say that when the last moment came he sat up in bed with a beautiful smile of confidence playing upon his face and said wellthe angels are calling me im afraid i really must go now good afternoon  and the rushing of his spirit from its prisonhouse was as rapid as a hunted cat passing over a garden fence     a christmas letter  in answer to a young lady who has sent an invitation to be present at a childrens party  madamoiselle  allow me very gratefully but firmly to refuse your kind invitation you doubtless mean well but your ideas are unhappily mistaken  let us understand one another once and for all i cannot at my mature age participate in the sports of children with such abandon as i could wish i entertain and have always entertained the sincerest regard for such games as hunttheslipper and blindmans buff but i have now reached a time of life when to have my eyes blindfolded and to have a powerful boy of ten hit me in the back with a hobbyhorse and ask me to guess who hit me provokes me to a fit of retaliation which could only culminate in reckless criminality nor can i cover my shoulders with a drawingroom rug and crawl round on my hands and knees under the pretence that i am a bear without a sense of personal insufficiency which is painful to me  neither can i look on with a complacent eye at the sad spectacle of your young clerical friend the reverend mr uttermost farthing abandoning himself to such gambols and appearing in the role of life and soul of the evening such a degradation of his holy calling grieves me and i cannot but suspect him of ulterior motives  you inform me that your maiden aunt intends to help you to entertain the party i have not as you know the honour of your aunts acquaintance yet i think i may with reason surmise that she will organize gamesguessing gamesin which she will ask me to name a river in asia beginning with a z on my failure to do so she will put a hot plate down my neck as a forfeit and the children will clap their hands these games my dear young friend involve the use of a more adaptable intellect than mine and i cannot consent to be a party to them  may i say in conclusion that i do not consider a fivecent penwiper from the top branch of a xmas tree any adequate compensation for the kind of evening you propose     i have the honour       to subscribe myself          your obedient servant     how to make a million dollars  i mix a good deal with the millionaires i like them i like their faces i like the way they live i like the things they eat the more we mix together the better i like the things we mix  especially i like the way they dress their grey check trousers their white check waistcoats their heavy gold chains and the signetrings that they sign their cheques with my they look nice get six or seven of them sitting together in the club and its a treat to see them and if they get the least dust on them men come and brush it off yes and are glad to id like to take some of the dust off them myself  even more than what they eat i like their intellectual grasp it is wonderful just watch them read they simply read all the time go into the club at any hour and youll see three or four of them at it and the things they can read youd think that a man whod been driving hard in the office from eleven oclock until three with only an hour and a half for lunch would be too fagged not a bit these men can sit down after office hours and read the sketch and the police gazette and the pink un and understand the jokes just as well as i can  what i love to do is to walk up and down among them and catch the little scraps of conversation the other day i heard one lean forward and say well i offered him a million and a half and said i wouldnt give a cent more he could either take it or leave it i just longed to break in and say what what a million and a half oh say that again offer it to me to either take it or leave it do try me once i know i can or here make it a plain million and lets call it done  not that these men are careless over money no sir dont think it of course they dont take much account of big money a hundred thousand dollars at a shot or anything of that sort but little money youve no idea till you know them how anxious they get about a cent or half a cent or less  why two of them came into the club the other night just frantic with delight they said wheat had risen and theyd cleaned up four cents each in less than half an hour they bought a dinner for sixteen on the strength of it i dont understand it ive often made twice as much as that writing for the papers and never felt like boasting about it  one night i heard one man say well lets call up new york and offer them a quarter of a cent great heavens imagine paying the cost of calling up new york nearly five million people late at night and offering them a quarter of a cent and yetdid new york get mad no they took it of course its high finance i dont pretend to understand it i tried after that to call up chicago and offer it a cent and a half and to call up hamilton ontario and offer it half a dollar and the operator only thought i was crazy  all this shows of course that ive been studying how the millionaires do it i have for years i thought it might be helpful to young men just beginning to work and anxious to stop  you know many a man realizes late in life that if when he was a boy he had known what he knows now instead of being what he is he might be what he wont but how few boys stop to think that if they knew what they dont know instead of being what they will be they wouldnt be these are awful thoughts  at any rate ive been gathering hints on how it is they do it  one thing im sure about if a young man wants to make a million dollars hes got to be mighty careful about his diet and his living this may seem hard but success is only achieved with pains  there is no use in a young man who hopes to make a million dollars thinking hes entitled to get up at 730 eat force and poached eggs drink cold water at lunch and go to bed at 10 pm you cant do it ive seen too many millionaires for that if you want to be a millionaire you mustnt get up till ten in the morning they never do they darent it would be as much as their business is worth if they were seen on the street at halfpast nine  and the old idea of abstemiousness is all wrong to be a millionaire you need champagne lots of it and all the time that and scotch whisky and soda you have to sit up nearly all night and drink buckets of it this is what clears the brain for business next day ive seen some of these men with their brains so clear in the morning that their faces look positively boiled  to live like this requires of course resolution but you can buy that by the pint  therefore my dear young man if you want to get moved on from your present status in business change your life when your landlady brings your bacon and eggs for breakfast throw them out of window to the dog and tell her to bring you some chilled asparagus and a pint of moselle then telephone to your employer that youll be down about eleven oclock you will get moved on yes very quickly  just how the millionaires make the money is a difficult question but one way is this strike the town with five cents in your pocket they nearly all do this theyve told me again and again men with millions and millions that the first time they struck town they had only five cents that seems to have given them their start of course its not easy to do ive tried it several times i nearly did it once i borrowed five cents carried it away out of town and then turned and came back at the town with an awful rush if i hadnt struck a beer saloon in the suburbs and spent the five cents i might have been rich today  another good plan is to start something something on a huge scale something nobody ever thought of for instance one man i know told me that once he was down in mexico without a cent hed lost his five in striking central america and he noticed that they had no power plants so he started some and made a mint of money another man that i know was once stranded in new york absolutely without a nickel well it occurred to him that what was needed were buildings ten stories higher than any that had been put up so he built two and sold them right away ever so many millionaires begin in some such simple way as that  there is of course a much easier way than any of these i almost hate to tell this because i want to do it myself  i learned of it just by chance one night at the club there is one old man there extremely rich with one of the best faces of the lot just like a hyena i never used to know how he had got so rich so one evening i asked one of the millionaires how old bloggs had made all his money  how he made it he answered with a sneer why he made it by taking it out of widows and orphans  widows and orphans i thought what an excellent idea but who would have suspected that they had it  and how i asked pretty cautiously did he go at it to get it out of them  why the man answered he just ground them under his heels that was how  now isnt that simple ive thought of that conversation often since and i mean to try it if i can get hold of them ill grind them quick enough but how to get them most of the widows i know look pretty solid for that sort of thing and as for orphans it must take an awful lot of them meantime i am waiting and if i ever get a large bunch of orphans all together ill stamp on them and see  i find too on inquiry that you can also grind it out of clergymen they say they grind nicely but perhaps orphans are easier     how to live to be 200  twenty years ago i knew a man called jiggins who had the health habit  he used to take a cold plunge every morning he said it opened his pores after it he took a hot sponge he said it closed the pores he got so that he could open and shut his pores at will  jiggins used to stand and breathe at an open window for half an hour before dressing he said it expanded his lungs he might of course have had it done in a shoestore with a boot stretcher but after all it cost him nothing this way and what is half an hour  after he had got his undershirt on jiggins used to hitch himself up like a dog in harness and do sandow exercises he did them forwards backwards and hindside up  he could have got a job as a dog anywhere he spent all his time at this kind of thing in his spare time at the office he used to lie on his stomach on the floor and see if he could lift himself up with his knuckles if he could then he tried some other way until he found one that he couldnt do then he would spend the rest of his lunch hour on his stomach perfectly happy  in the evenings in his room he used to lift iron bars cannonballs heave dumbbells and haul himself up to the ceiling with his teeth you could hear the thumps half a mile he liked it  he spent half the night slinging himself around his room he said it made his brain clear when he got his brain perfectly clear he went to bed and slept as soon as he woke he began clearing it again  jiggins is dead he was of course a pioneer but the fact that he dumbbelled himself to death at an early age does not prevent a whole generation of young men from following in his path  they are ridden by the health mania  they make themselves a nuisance  they get up at impossible hours they go out in silly little suits and run marathon heats before breakfast they chase around barefoot to get the dew on their feet they hunt for ozone they bother about pepsin they wont eat meat because it has too much nitrogen they wont eat fruit because it hasnt any they prefer albumen and starch and nitrogen to huckleberry pie and doughnuts they wont drink water out of a tap they wont eat sardines out of a can they wont use oysters out of a pail they wont drink milk out of a glass they are afraid of alcohol in any shape yes sir afraid cowards  and after all their fuss they presently incur some simple oldfashioned illness and die like anybody else  now people of this sort have no chance to attain any great age they are on the wrong track  listen do you want to live to be really old to enjoy a grand green exuberant boastful old age and to make yourself a nuisance to your whole neighbourhood with your reminiscences  then cut out all this nonsense cut it out get up in the morning at a sensible hour the time to get up is when you have to not before if your office opens at eleven get up at tenthirty take your chance on ozone there isnt any such thing anyway or if there is you can buy a thermos bottle full for five cents and put it on a shelf in your cupboard if your work begins at seven in the morning get up at ten minutes to but dont be liar enough to say that you like it it isnt exhilarating and you know it  also drop all that coldbath business you never did it when you were a boy dont be a fool now if you must take a bath you dont really need to take it warm the pleasure of getting out of a cold bed and creeping into a hot bath beats a cold plunge to death in any case stop gassing about your tub and your shower as if you were the only man who ever washed  so much for that point  next take the question of germs and bacilli dont be scared of them thats all thats the whole thing and if you once get on to that you never need to worry again  if you see a bacilli walk right up to it and look it in the eye if one flies into your room strike at it with your hat or with a towel hit it as hard as you can between the neck and the thorax it will soon get sick of that  but as a matter of fact a bacilli is perfectly quiet and harmless if you are not afraid of it speak to it call out to it to lie down it will understand i had a bacilli once called fido that would come and lie at my feet while i was working i never knew a more affectionate companion and when it was run over by an automobile i buried it in the garden with genuine sorrow  i admit this is an exaggeration i dont really remember its name it may have been robert  understand that it is only a fad of modern medicine to say that cholera and typhoid and diphtheria are caused by bacilli and germs nonsense cholera is caused by a frightful pain in the stomach and diphtheria is caused by trying to cure a sore throat  now take the question of food  eat what you want eat lots of it yes eat too much of it eat till you can just stagger across the room with it and prop it up against a sofa cushion eat everything that you like until you cant eat any more the only test is can you pay for it if you cant pay for it dont eat it and listendont worry as to whether your food contains starch or albumen or gluten or nitrogen if you are a damn fool enough to want these things go and buy them and eat all you want of them go to a laundry and get a bag of starch and eat your fill of it eat it and take a good long drink of glue after it and a spoonful of portland cement that will gluten you good and solid  if you like nitrogen go and get a druggist to give you a canful of it at the soda counter and let you sip it with a straw only dont think that you can mix all these things up with your food there isnt any nitrogen or phosphorus or albumen in ordinary things to eat in any decent household all that sort of stuff is washed out in the kitchen sink before the food is put on the table  and just one word about fresh air and exercise dont bother with either of them get your room full of good air then shut up the windows and keep it it will keep for years anyway dont keep using your lungs all the time let them rest as for exercise if you have to take it take it and put up with it but as long as you have the price of a hack and can hire other people to play baseball for you and run races and do gymnastics when you sit in the shade and smoke and watch themgreat heavens what more do you want     how to avoid getting married  some years ago when i was the editor of a correspondence column i used to receive heartbroken letters from young men asking for advice and sympathy they found themselves the object of marked attentions from girls which they scarcely knew how to deal with they did not wish to give pain or to seem indifferent to a love which they felt was as ardent as it was disinterested and yet they felt that they could not bestow their hands where their hearts had not spoken they wrote to me fully and frankly and as one soul might write to another for relief i accepted their confidences as under the pledge of a secrecy never divulging their disclosures beyond the circulation of my newspapers or giving any hint of their identity other than printing their names and addresses and their letters in full but i may perhaps without dishonour reproduce one of these letters and my answer to it inasmuch as the date is now months ago and the softening hand of time has woven its roseshow shall i put itthe mellow haze of reminiscences haswhat i mean is that the young man has gone back to work and is all right again  here then is a letter from a young man whose name i must not reveal but whom i will designate as d f and whose address i must not divulge but will simply indicate as q street west  dear mr leacock  for some time past i have been the recipient of very marked attentions from a young lady she has been calling at the house almost every evening and has taken me out in her motor and invited me to concerts and the theatre on these latter occasions i have insisted on her taking my father with me and have tried as far as possible to prevent her saying anything to me which would be unfit for father to hear but my position has become a very difficult one i do not think it right to accept her presents when i cannot feel that my heart is hers yesterday she sent to my house a beautiful bouquet of american beauty roses addressed to me and a magnificent bunch of timothy hay for father i do not know what to say would it be right for father to keep all this valuable hay i have confided fully in father and we have discussed the question of presents he thinks that there are some that we can keep with propriety and others that a sense of delicacy forbids us to retain he himself is going to sort out the presents into the two classes he thinks that as far as he can see the hay is in class b meantime i write to you as i understand that miss laura jean libby and miss beatrix fairfax are on their vacation and in any case a friend of mine who follows their writings closely tells me that they are always full  i enclose a dollar because i do not think it right to ask you to give all your valuable time and your best thought without giving you back what it is worth  on receipt of this i wrote back at once a private and confidential letter which i printed in the following edition of the paper  my dear dear boy  your letter has touched me as soon as i opened it and saw the green and blue tint of the dollar bill which you had so daintily and prettily folded within the pages of your sweet letter i knew that the note was from someone that i could learn to love if our correspondence were to continue as it had begun i took the dollar from your letter and kissed and fondled it a dozen times dear unknown boy i shall always keep that dollar no matter how much i may need it or how many necessaries yes absolute necessities of life i may be wanting i shall always keep that dollar do you understand dear i shall keep it i shall not spend it as far as the use of it goes it will be just as if you had not sent it even if you were to send me another dollar i should still keep the first one so that no matter how many you sent the recollection of one first friendship would not be contaminated with mercenary considerations when i say dollar darling of course an express order or a postal note or even stamps would be all the same but in that case do not address me in care of this office as i should not like to think of your pretty little letters lying round where others might handle them  but now i must stop chatting about myself for i know that you cannot be interested in a simple old fogey such as i am let me talk to you about your letter and about the difficult question it raises for all marriageable young men  in the first place let me tell you how glad i am that you confide in your father whatever happens go at once to your father put your arms about his neck and have a good cry together and you are right too about presents it needs a wiser head than my poor perplexed boy to deal with them take them to your father to be sorted or if you feel that you must not overtax his love address them to me in your own pretty hand  and now let us talk dear as one heart to another remember always that if a girl is to have your heart she must be worthy of you when you look at your own bright innocent face in the mirror resolve that you will give your hand to no girl who is not just as innocent as you are and no brighter than yourself so that you must first find out how innocent she is ask her quietly and franklyremember dear that the days of false modesty are passing awaywhether she has ever been in jail if she has not and if you have not then you know that you are dealing with a dear confiding girl who will make you a life mate then you must know too that her mind is worthy of your own so many men today are led astray by the merely superficial graces and attractions of girls who in reality possess no mental equipment at all many a man is bitterly disillusioned after marriage when he realises that his wife cannot solve a quadratic equation and that he is compelled to spend all his days with a woman who does not know that x squared plus 2xy plus y squared is the same thing or i think nearly the same thing as x plus y squared  nor should the simple domestic virtues be neglected if a girl desires to woo you before allowing her to press her suit ask her if she knows how to press yours if she can let her woo if not tell her to whoa but i see i have written quite as much as i need for this column wont you write again just as before dear boy  stephen leacock     how to be a doctor  certainly the progress of science is a wonderful thing one cant help feeling proud of it i must admit that i do whenever i get talking to anyonethat is to anyone who knows even less about it than i doabout the marvellous development of electricity for instance i feel as if i had been personally responsible for it as for the linotype and the aeroplane and the vacuum housecleaner well i am not sure that i didnt invent them myself i believe that all generoushearted men feel just the same way about it  however that is not the point i am intending to discuss what i want to speak about is the progress of medicine there if you like is something wonderful any lover of humanity or of either sex of it who looks back on the achievements of medical science must feel his heart glow and his right ventricle expand with the pericardiac stimulus of a permissible pride  just think of it a hundred years ago there were no bacilli no ptomaine poisoning no diphtheria and no appendicitis rabies was but little known and only imperfectly developed all of these we owe to medical science even such things as psoriasis and parotitis and trypanosomiasis which are now household names were known only to the few and were quite beyond the reach of the great mass of the people  or consider the advance of the science on its practical side a hundred years ago it used to be supposed that fever could be cured by the letting of blood now we know positively that it cannot even seventy years ago it was thought that fever was curable by the administration of sedative drugs now we know that it isnt for the matter of that as recently as thirty years ago doctors thought that they could heal a fever by means of low diet and the application of ice now they are absolutely certain that they cannot this instance shows the steady progress made in the treatment of fever but there has been the same cheering advance all along the line take rheumatism a few generations ago people with rheumatism used to have to carry round potatoes in their pockets as a means of cure now the doctors allow them to carry absolutely anything they like they may go round with their pockets full of watermelons if they wish to it makes no difference or take the treatment of epilepsy it used to be supposed that the first thing to do in sudden attacks of this kind was to unfasten the patients collar and let him breathe at present on the contrary many doctors consider it better to button up the patients collar and let him choke  in only one respect has there been a decided lack of progress in the domain of medicine that is in the time it takes to become a qualified practitioner in the good old days a man was turned out thoroughly equipped after putting in two winter sessions at a college and spending his summers in running logs for a sawmill some of the students were turned out even sooner nowadays it takes anywhere from five to eight years to become a doctor of course one is willing to grant that our young men are growing stupider and lazier every year this fact will be corroborated at once by any man over fifty years of age but even when this is said it seems odd that a man should study eight years now to learn what he used to acquire in eight months  however let that go the point i want to develop is that the modern doctors business is an extremely simple one which could be acquired in about two weeks this is the way it is done  the patient enters the consultingroom doctor he says i have a bad pain where is it here stand up says the doctor and put your arms up above your head then the doctor goes behind the patient and strikes him a powerful blow in the back do you feel that he says i do says the patient then the doctor turns suddenly and lets him have a left hook under the heart can you feel that he says viciously as the patient falls over on the sofa in a heap get up says the doctor and counts ten the patient rises the doctor looks him over very carefully without speaking and then suddenly fetches him a blow in the stomach that doubles him up speechless the doctor walks over to the window and reads the morning paper for a while presently he turns and begins to mutter more to himself than the patient hum he says theres a slight anaesthesia of the tympanum is that so says the patient in an agony of fear what can i do about it doctor well says the doctor i want you to keep very quiet youll have to go to bed and stay there and keep quiet in reality of course the doctor hasnt the least idea what is wrong with the man but he does know that if he will go to bed and keep quiet awfully quiet hell either get quietly well again or else die a quiet death meantime if the doctor calls every morning and thumps and beats him he can keep the patient submissive and perhaps force him to confess what is wrong with him  what about diet doctor says the patient completely cowed  the answer to this question varies very much it depends on how the doctor is feeling and whether it is long since he had a meal himself if it is late in the morning and the doctor is ravenously hungry he says oh eat plenty dont be afraid of it eat meat vegetables starch glue cement anything you like but if the doctor has just had lunch and if his breathing is shortcircuited with huckleberrypie he says very firmly no i dont want you to eat anything at all absolutely not a bite it wont hurt you a little selfdenial in the matter of eating is the best thing in the world  and what about drinking again the doctors answer varies he may say oh yes you might drink a glass of lager now and then or if you prefer it a gin and soda or a whisky and apollinaris and i think before going to bed id take a hot scotch with a couple of lumps of white sugar and bit of lemonpeel in it and a good grating of nutmeg on the top the doctor says this with real feeling and his eye glistens with the pure love of his profession but if on the other hand the doctor has spent the night before at a little gathering of medical friends he is very apt to forbid the patient to touch alcohol in any shape and to dismiss the subject with great severity  of course this treatment in and of itself would appear too transparent and would fail to inspire the patient with a proper confidence but nowadays this element is supplied by the work of the analytical laboratory whatever is wrong with the patient the doctor insists on snipping off parts and pieces and extracts of him and sending them mysteriously away to be analysed he cuts off a lock of the patients hair marks it mr smiths hair october 1910 then he clips off the lower part of the ear and wraps it in paper and labels it part of mr smiths ear october 1910 then he looks the patient up and down with the scissors in his hand and if he sees any likely part of him he clips it off and wraps it up now this oddly enough is the very thing that fills the patient up with that sense of personal importance which is worth paying for yes says the bandaged patient later in the day to a group of friends much impressed the doctor thinks there may be a slight anaesthesia of the prognosis but hes sent my ear to new york and my appendix to baltimore and a lock of my hair to the editors of all the medical journals and meantime i am to keep very quiet and not exert myself beyond drinking a hot scotch with lemon and nutmeg every halfhour with that he sinks back faintly on his cushions luxuriously happy  and yet isnt it funny  you and i and the rest of useven if we know all thisas soon as we have a pain within us rush for a doctor as fast as a hack can take us yes personally i even prefer an ambulance with a bell on it its more soothing     the new food  i see from the current columns of the daily press that professor plumb of the university of chicago has just invented a highly concentrated form of food all the essential nutritive elements are put together in the form of pellets each of which contains from one to two hundred times as much nourishment as an ounce of an ordinary article of diet these pellets diluted with water will form all that is necessary to support life the professor looks forward confidently to revolutionizing the present food system  now this kind of thing may be all very well in its way but it is going to have its drawbacks as well in the bright future anticipated by professor plumb we can easily imagine such incidents as the following  the smiling family were gathered round the hospitable board the table was plenteously laid with a soupplate in front of each beaming child a bucket of hot water before the radiant mother and at the head of the board the christmas dinner of the happy home warmly covered by a thimble and resting on a poker chip the expectant whispers of the little ones were hushed as the father rising from his chair lifted the thimble and disclosed a small pill of concentrated nourishment on the chip before him christmas turkey cranberry sauce plum pudding mince pieit was all there all jammed into that little pill and only waiting to expand then the father with deep reverence and a devout eye alternating between the pill and heaven lifted his voice in a benediction  at this moment there was an agonized cry from the mother  oh henry quick baby has snatched the pill it was too true dear little gustavus adolphus the goldenhaired baby boy had grabbed the whole christmas dinner off the poker chip and bolted it three hundred and fifty pounds of concentrated nourishment passed down the oesophagus of the unthinking child  clap him on the back cried the distracted mother give him water  the idea was fatal the water striking the pill caused it to expand there was a dull rumbling sound and then with an awful bang gustavus adolphus exploded into fragments  and when they gathered the little corpse together the baby lips were parted in a lingering smile that could only be worn by a child who had eaten thirteen christmas dinners     a new pathology  it has long been vaguely understood that the condition of a mans clothes has a certain effect upon the health of both body and mind the wellknown proverb clothes make the man has its origin in a general recognition of the powerful influence of the habiliments in their reaction upon the wearer the same truth may be observed in the facts of everyday life on the one hand we remark the bold carriage and mental vigour of a man attired in a new suit of clothes on the other hand we note the melancholy features of him who is conscious of a posterior patch or the haunted face of one suffering from internal loss of buttons but while common observation thus gives us a certain familiarity with a few leading facts regarding the ailments and influence of clothes no attempt has as yet been made to reduce our knowledge to a systematic form at the same time the writer feels that a valuable addition might be made to the science of medicine in this direction the numerous diseases which are caused by this fatal influence should receive a scientific analysis and their treatment be included among the principles of the healing art the diseases of the clothes may roughly be divided into medical cases and surgical cases while these again fall into classes according to the particular garment through which the sufferer is attacked     medical cases  probably no article of apparel is so liable to a diseased condition as the trousers it may be well therefore to treat first those maladies to which they are subject  i contractio pantalunae or shortening of the legs of the trousers an extremely painful malady most frequently found in the growing youth the first symptom is the appearance of a yawning space lacuna above the boots accompanied by an acute sense of humiliation and a morbid anticipation of mockery the application of treacle to the boots although commonly recommended may rightly be condemned as too drastic a remedy the use of boots reaching to the knee to be removed only at night will afford immediate relief in connection with contractio is often found  ii inflatio genu or bagging of the knees of the trousers a disease whose symptoms are similar to those above the patient shows an aversion to the standing posture and in acute cases if the patient be compelled to stand the head is bent and the eye fixed with painful rigidity upon the projecting blade formed at the knee of the trousers  in both of the above diseases anything that can be done to free the mind of the patient from a morbid sense of his infirmity will do much to improve the general tone of the system  iii oases or patches are liable to break out anywhere on the trousers and range in degree of gravity from those of a trifling nature to those of a fatal character the most distressing cases are those where the patch assumes a different colour from that of the trousers dissimilitas coloris in this instance the mind of the patient is found to be in a sadly aberrated condition a speedy improvement may however be effected by cheerful society books flowers and above all by a complete change  iv the overcoat is attacked by no serious disorders except  phosphorescentia or glistening a malady which indeed may often be observed to affect the whole system it is caused by decay of tissue from old age and is generally aggravated by repeated brushing a peculiar feature of the complaint is the lack of veracity on the part of the patient in reference to the cause of his uneasiness another invariable symptom is his aversion to outdoor exercise under various pretexts which it is the duty of his medical adviser firmly to combat he will avoid even a gentle walk in the streets  v of the waistcoat science recognizes but one disease  porriggia an affliction caused by repeated spilling of porridge it is generally harmless chiefly owing to the mental indifference of the patient it can be successfully treated by repeated fomentations of benzine  vi mortificatio tilis or greenness of the hat is a disease often found in connection with phosphorescentia mentioned above and characterized by the same aversion to outdoor life  vii sterilitas or loss of fur is another disease of the hat especially prevalent in winter it is not accurately known whether this is caused by a falling out of the fur or by a cessation of growth in all diseases of the hat the mind of the patient is greatly depressed and his countenance stamped with the deepest gloom he is particularly sensitive in regard to questions as to the previous history of the hat  want of space precludes the mention of minor diseases such as  viii odditus soccorum or oddness of the socks a thing in itself trifling but of an alarming nature if met in combination with contractio pantalunae cases are found where the patient possibly on the public platform or at a social gathering is seized with a consciousness of the malady so suddenly as to render medical assistance futile     surgical cases  it is impossible to mention more than a few of the most typical cases of diseases of this sort  i explosio or loss of buttons is the commonest malady demanding surgical treatment it consists of a succession of minor fractures possibly internal which at first excite no alarm a vague sense of uneasiness is presently felt which often leads the patient to seek relief in the string habita habit which if unduly indulged in may assume the proportions of a ruling passion the use of sealingwax while admirable as a temporary remedy for explosio should never be allowed to gain a permanent hold upon the system there is no doubt that a persistent indulgence in the string habit or the constant use of sealingwax will result in  ii fractura suspendorum or snapping of the braces which amounts to a general collapse of the system the patient is usually seized with a severe attack of explosio followed by a sudden sinking feeling and sense of loss a sound constitution may rally from the shock but a system undermined by the string habit invariably succumbs  iii sectura pantalunae or ripping of the trousers is generally caused by sitting upon warm beeswax or leaning against a hook in the case of the very young it is not unfrequently accompanied by a distressing suppuration of the shirt this however is not remarked in adults the malady is rather mental than bodily the mind of the patient being racked by a keen sense of indignity and a feeling of unworthiness the only treatment is immediate isolation with a careful stitching of the affected part  in conclusion it may be stated that at the first symptom of disease the patient should not hesitate to put himself in the hands of a professional tailor in so brief a compass as the present article the discussion has of necessity been rather suggestive than exhaustive much yet remains to be done and the subject opens wide to the inquiring eye the writer will however feel amply satisfied if this brief outline may help to direct the attention of medical men to what is yet an unexplored field     the poet answered  dear sir  in answer to your repeated questions and requests which have appeared for some years past in the columns of the rural press i beg to submit the following solutions of your chief difficulties  topic iyou frequently ask where are the friends of your childhood and urge that they shall be brought back to you as far as i am able to learn those of your friends who are not in jail are still right there in your native village you point out that they were wont to share your gambols if so you are certainly entitled to have theirs now  topic iiyou have taken occasion to say     give me not silk nor rich attire     nor gold nor jewels rare  but my dear fellow this is preposterous why these are the very things i had bought for you if you wont take any of these i shall have to give you factory cotton and cordwood  topic iiiyou also ask how fares my love across the sea intermediate i presume she would hardly travel steerage  topic ivwhy was i born why should i breathe here i quite agree with you i dont think you ought to breathe  topic vyou demand that i shall show you the man whose soul is dead and then mark him i am awfully sorry the man was around here all day yesterday and if i had only known i could easily have marked him so that we could pick him out again  topic vii notice that you frequently say oh for the sky of your native land oh for it by all means if you wish but remember that you already owe for a great deal  topic viion more than one occasion you wish to be informed what boots it that you idly dream nothing boots it at presenta fact sir which ought to afford you the highest gratification     the force of statistics  they were sitting on a seat of the car immediately in front of me i was consequently able to hear all that they were saying they were evidently strangers who had dropped into a conversation they both had the air of men who considered themselves profoundly interesting as minds it was plain that each laboured under the impression that he was a ripe thinker  one had just been reading a book which lay in his lap  ive been reading some very interesting statistics he was saying to the other thinker  ah statistics said the other wonderful things sir statistics very fond of them myself  i find for instance the first man went on that a drop of water is filled with littlewith littlei forget just what you call themlittleerthings every cubic inch containingercontaininglet me see  say a million said the other thinker encouragingly  yes a million or possibly a billionbut at any rate ever so many of them  is it possible said the other but really you know there are wonderful things in the world now coaltake coal  very good said his friend let us take coal settling back in his seat with the air of an intellect about to feed itself  do you know that every ton of coal burnt in an engine will drag a train of cars as long asi forget the exact length but say a train of cars of such and such a length and weighing say so muchfromfromhum for the moment the exact distance escapes medrag it from  from here to the moon suggested the other  ah very likely yes from here to the moon wonderful isnt it  but the most stupendous calculation of all sir is in regard to the distance from the earth to the sun positively sir a cannonballerfired at the sun  fired at the sun nodded the other approvingly as if he had often seen it done  and travelling at the rate ofof  of three cents a mile hinted the listener  no no you misunderstand mebut travelling at a fearful rate simply fearful sir would take a hundred millionno a hundred billionin short would take a scandalously long time in getting there  at this point i could stand no more i interruptedprovided it were fired from philadelphia i said and passed into the smokingcar     men who have shaved me  a barber is by nature and inclination a sport he can tell you at what exact hour the ball game of the day is to begin can foretell its issue without losing a stroke of the razor and can explain the points of inferiority of all the players as compared with better men that he has personally seen elsewhere with the nicety of a professional he can do all this and then stuff the customers mouth with a soapbrush and leave him while he goes to the other end of the shop to make a side bet with one of the other barbers on the outcome of the autumn handicap in the barbershops they knew the result of the jeffriesjohnson prizefight long before it happened it is on information of this kind that they make their living the performance of shaving is only incidental to it their real vocation in life is imparting information to the barber the outside world is made up of customers who are to be thrown into chairs strapped manacled gagged with soap and then given such necessary information on the athletic events of the moment as will carry them through the business hours of the day without open disgrace  as soon as the barber has properly filled up the customer with information of this sort he rapidly removes his whiskers as a sign that the man is now fit to talk to and lets him out of the chair  the public has grown to understand the situation every reasonable business man is willing to sit and wait half an hour for a shave which he could give himself in three minutes because he knows that if he goes down town without understanding exactly why chicago lost two games straight he will appear an ignoramus  at times of course the barber prefers to test his customer with a question or two he gets him pinned in the chair with his head well back covers the customers face with soap and then planting his knee on his chest and holding his hand firmly across the customers mouth to prevent all utterance and to force him to swallow the soap he asks well what did you think of the detroitst louis game yesterday this is not really meant for a question at all it is only equivalent to saying now you poor fool ill bet you dont know anything about the great events of your country at all there is a gurgle in the customers throat as if he were trying to answer and his eyes are seen to move sideways but the barber merely thrusts the soapbrush into each eye and if any motion still persists he breathes gin and peppermint over the face till all sign of life is extinct then he talks the game over in detail with the barber at the next chair each leaning across an inanimate thing extended under steaming towels that was once a man  to know all these things barbers have to be highly educated it is true that some of the greatest barbers that have ever lived have begun as uneducated illiterate men and by sheer energy and indomitable industry have forced their way to the front but these are exceptions to succeed nowadays it is practically necessary to be a college graduate as the courses at harvard and yale have been found too superficial there are now established regular barbers colleges where a bright young man can learn as much in three weeks as he would be likely to know after three years at harvard the courses at these colleges cover such things as 1 physiology including hair and its destruction the origin and growth of whiskers soap in its relation to eyesight 2 chemistry including lectures on florida water and how to make it out of sardine oil 3 practical anatomy including the scalp and how to lift it the ears and how to remove them and as the major course for advanced students the veins of the face and how to open and close them at will by the use of alum  the education of the customer is as i have said the chief part of the barbers vocation but it must be remembered that the incidental function of removing his whiskers in order to mark him as a wellinformed man is also of importance and demands long practice and great natural aptitude in the barbers shops of modern cities shaving has been brought to a high degree of perfection a good barber is not content to remove the whiskers of his client directly and immediately he prefers to cook him first he does this by immersing the head in hot water and covering the victims face with steaming towels until he has him boiled to a nice pink from time to time the barber removes the towels and looks at the face to see if it is yet boiled pink enough for his satisfaction if it is not he replaces the towels again and jams them down firmly with his hand until the cooking is finished the final result however amply justifies this trouble and the wellboiled customer only needs the addition of a few vegetables on the side to present an extremely appetizing appearance  during the process of the shave it is customary for the barber to apply the particular kind of mental torture known as the third degree this is done by terrorizing the patient as to the very evident and proximate loss of all his hair and whiskers which the barber is enabled by his experience to foretell your hair he says very sadly and sympathetically is all falling out better let me give you a shampoo no let me singe your hair to close up the follicles no let me plug up the ends of your hair with sealingwax its the only thing that will save it for you no let me rub an egg on your scalp no let me squirt a lemon on your eyebrows no  the barber sees that he is dealing with a man of determination and he warms to his task he bends low and whispers into the prostrate ear youve got a good many grey hairs coming in better let me give you an application of hairocene only cost you half a dollar no your face he whispers again with a soft caressing voice is all covered with wrinkles better let me rub some of this rejuvenator into the face  this process is continued until one of two things happens either the customer is obdurate and staggers to his feet at last and gropes his way out of the shop with the knowledge that he is a wrinkled prematurely senile man whose wicked life is stamped upon his face and whose unstopped hairends and failing follicles menace him with the certainty of complete baldness within twentyfour hoursor else as in nearly all instances he succumbs in the latter case immediately on his saying yes there is a shout of exultation from the barber a roar of steaming water and within a moment two barbers have grabbed him by the feet and thrown him under the tap and in spite of his struggles are giving him the hydromagnetic treatment when he emerges from their hands he steps out of the shop looking as if he had been varnished  but even the application of the hydromagnetic and the rejuvenator do not by any means exhaust the resources of the uptodate barber he prefers to perform on the customer a whole variety of subsidiary services not directly connected with shaving but carried on during the process of the shave  in a good uptodate shop while one man is shaving the customer others black his boots brush his clothes darn his socks point his nails enamel his teeth polish his eyes and alter the shape of any of his joints which they think unsightly during this operation they often stand seven or eight deep round a customer fighting for a chance to get at him  all of these remarks apply to barbershops in the city and not to country places in the country there is only one barber and one customer at a time the thing assumes the aspect of a straightout roughandtumble catchascatchcan fight with a few spectators sitting round the shop to see fair play in the city they can shave a man without removing any of his clothes but in the country where the customer insists on getting the full value for his money they remove the collar and necktie the coat and the waistcoat and for a really good shave and haircut the customer is stripped to the waist the barber can then take a rush at him from the other side of the room and drive the clippers up the full length of the spine so as to come at the heavier hair on the back of the head with the impact of a lawnmower driven into long grass     getting the thread of it  have you ever had a man try to explain to you what happened in a book as far as he has read it is a most instructive thing sinclair the man who shares my rooms with me made such an attempt the other night i had come in cold and tired from a walk and found him full of excitement with a bulky magazine in one hand and a papercutter gripped in the other  say heres a grand story he burst out as soon as i came in its great most fascinating thing i ever read wait till i read you some of it ill just tell you what has happened up to where i amyoull easily catch the thread of itand then well finish it together  i wasnt feeling in a very responsive mood but i saw no way to stop him so i merely said all right throw me your thread ill catch it  well sinclair began with great animation this count gets this letter  hold on i interrupted what count gets what letter  oh the count its about you know he gets this letter from this porphirio  from which porphirio  why porphirio sent the letter dont you see he sent it sinclair exclaimed a little impatientlysent it through demonio and told him to watch for him with him and kill him when he got him  oh see here i broke in who is to meet who and who is to get stabbed  theyre going to stab demonio  and who brought the letter  demonio  well now demonio must be a clam what did he bring it for  oh but he dont know whats in it thats just the slick part of it and sinclair began to snigger to himself at the thought of it you see this carlo carlotti the condottiere  stop right there i said whats a condottiere  its a sort of brigand he you understand was in league with this fra fraliccolo  a suspicion flashed across my mind look here i said firmly if the scene of this story is laid in the highlands i refuse to listen to it call it off  no no sinclair answered quickly thats all right its laid in italytime of pius the something he

but how does he get him to do that i asked  oh the dog has demonio pretty well under his thumb so he makes demonio scheme round till he gets old pioergets him under his thumb and then of course pio

esterolla  say he fools himself doesnt he whos this last girl  lucia oh shes great sinclair said shes one of those southern natures you know full oferfull of  full of fun i suggested  oh hang it all

sinclair said of course there are more still that i can tell you about if  oh never mind i said ill work along with those theyre a pretty representative crowd then porphirio is under pios thumb and pio is under demonios thumb and the dog is crafty and lucia is full of something all the time oh ive got a mighty clear idea of it i concluded bitterly  oh youve got it sinclair said i knew youd like it now well go on ill just finish to the bottom of my page and then ill go on aloud  he ran his eyes rapidly over the lines till he came to the bottom of the page then he cut the leaves and turned over i saw his eye rest on the halfdozen lines that confronted him on the next page with an expression of utter consternation  well i will be cursed he said at length  whats the matter i said gently with a great joy at my heart  this infernal things a serial he gasped as he pointed at the words to be continued and thats all there is in this number     telling his faults  oh do mr sapling said the beautiful girl at the summer hotel do let me read the palm of your hand i can tell you all your faults  mr sapling gave an inarticulate gurgle and a roseate flush swept over his countenance as he surrendered his palm to the grasp of the fair enchantress  oh youre just full of faults just full of them mr sapling she cried  mr sapling looked it  to begin with said the beautiful girl slowly and reflectingly you are dreadfully cynical you hardly believe in anything at all and youve utterly no faith in us poor women  the feeble smile that had hitherto kindled the features of mr sapling into a ray of chastened imbecility was distorted in an effort at cynicism  then your next fault is that you are too determined much too determined when once you have set your will on any object you crush every obstacle under your feet  mr sapling looked meekly down at his tennis shoes but began to feel calmer more lifted up perhaps he had been all these things without knowing it  then you are cold and sarcastic  mr sapling attempted to look cold and sarcastic he succeeded in a rude leer  and youre horribly worldweary you care for nothing you have drained philosophy to the dregs and scoff at everything  mr saplings inner feeling was that from now on he would simply scoff and scoff and scoff  your only redeeming quality is that you are generous you have tried to kill even this but cannot yes concluded the beautiful girl those are your faults generous still but cold cynical and relentless good night mr sapling  and resisting all entreaties the beautiful girl passed from the verandah of the hotel and vanished  and when later in the evening the brother of the beautiful girl borrowed mr saplings tennis racket and his bicycle for a fortnight and the father of the beautiful girl got sapling to endorse his note for a couple of hundreds and her uncle zephas borrowed his bedroom candle and used his razor to cut up a plug of tobacco mr sapling felt proud to be acquainted with the family     winter pastimes  it is in the depth of winter when the intense cold renders it desirable to stay at home that the really pleasant family is wont to serve invitations upon a few friends to spend a quiet evening  it is at these gatherings that that gay thing the indoor winter game becomes rampant it is there that the old euchre deck and the staring domino become fair and beautiful things that the rattle of the loto counter rejoices the heart that the old riddle feels the sap stirring in its limbs again and the amusing spilikin completes the mental ruin of the jaded guest then does the jolly maiden aunt propound the query what is the difference between an elephant and a silk hat or declare that her first is a vowel her second a preposition and her third an archipelago it is to crown such a quiet evening and to give the finishing stroke to those of the visitors who have not escaped early with a fierce purpose of getting at the saloons before they have time to close that the indoor game or family reservoir of fun is dragged from its long sleep it is spread out upon the table its paper of directions is unfolded its cards its counters its pointers and its markers are distributed around the table and the visitor forces a look of reckless pleasure upon his face then the few simple directions are read aloud by the jolly aunt instructing each player to challenge the player holding the golden letter corresponding to the digit next in order to name a dead author beginning with x failing which the player must declare himself in fault and pay the forfeit of handing over to the jolly aunt his gold watch and all his money or having a hot plate put down his neck  with a view to bringing some relief to the guests at entertainments of this kind i have endeavoured to construct one or two little winter pastimes of a novel character they are quite inexpensive and as they need no background of higher arithmetic or ancient history they are within reach of the humblest intellect here is one of them it is called indoor football or football without a ball  in this game any number of players from fifteen to thirty seat themselves in a heap on any one player usually the player next to the dealer they then challenge him to get up while one player stands with a stopwatch in his hand and counts forty seconds should the first player fail to rise before forty seconds are counted the player with the watch declares him suffocated this is called a down and counts one the player who was the down is then leant against the wall his wind is supposed to be squeezed out the player called the referee then blows a whistle and the players select another player and score a down off him while the player is supposed to be down all the rest must remain seated as before and not rise from him until the referee by counting forty and blowing his whistle announces that in his opinion the other player is stifled he is then leant against the wall beside the first player when the whistle again blows the player nearest the referee strikes him behind the right ear this is a touch and counts two  it is impossible of course to give all the rules in detail i might add however that while it counts two to strike the referee to kick him counts three to break his arm or leg counts four and to kill him outright is called grand slam and counts one game  here is another little thing that i have worked out which is superior to parlour games in that it combines their intense excitement with sound outofdoor exercise  it is easily comprehended and can be played by any number of players old and young it requires no other apparatus than a trolley car of the ordinary type a mile or two of track and a few thousand volts of electricity it is called     the suburban trolley car    a holiday game for old and young  the chief part in the game is taken by two players who station themselves one at each end of the car and who adopt some distinctive costumes to indicate that they are it the other players occupy the body of the car or take up their position at intervals along the track  the object of each player should be to enter the car as stealthily as possible in such a way as to escape the notice of the players in distinctive dress should he fail to do this he must pay the philopena or forfeit of these there are two philopena no 1 the payment of five cents and philopena no 2 being thrown off the car by the neck each player may elect which philopena he will pay any player who escapes paying the philopena scores one  the players who are in the car may elect to adopt a standing attitude or to seat themselves but no player may seat himself in the lap of another without the second players consent the object of those who elect to remain standing is to place their feet upon the toes of those who sit when they do this they score the object of those who elect to sit is to elude the feet of the standing players much merriment is thus occasioned  the player in distinctive costume at the front of the car controls a crank by means of which he is enabled to bring the car to a sudden stop or to cause it to plunge violently forward his aim in so doing is to cause all the standing players to fall over backward every time he does this he scores for this purpose he is generally in collusion with the other player in distinctive costume whose business it is to let him know by a series of bells and signals when the players are not looking and can be easily thrown down a sharp fall of this sort gives rise to no end of banter and goodnatured drollery directed against the two players who are it  should a player who is thus thrown backward save himself from falling by sitting down in the lap of a female player he scores one any player who scores in this manner is entitled to remain seated while he may count six after which he must remove himself or pay philopena no 2  should the player who controls the crank perceive a player upon the street desirous of joining in the game by entering the car his object should be primo to run over him and kill him secundo to kill him by any other means in his power tertio to let him into the car but to exact the usual philopena  should a player in thus attempting to get on the car from without become entangled in the machinery the player controlling the crank shouts huff and the car is supposed to pass over him all within the car score one  a fine spice of the ludicrous may be added to the game by each player pretending that he has a destination or stoppingplace where he would wish to alight it now becomes the aim of the two players who are it to carry him past his point a player who is thus carried beyond his imaginary stoppingplace must feign a violent passion and imitate angry gesticulations he may in addition feign a great age or a painful infirmity which will be found to occasion the most convulsive fun for the other players in the game  these are the main outlines of this most amusing pastime many other agreeable features may of course be readily introduced by persons of humour and imagination     number fiftysix  what i narrate was told me one winters evening by my friend ahyen in the little room behind his laundry ahyen is a quiet little celestial with a grave and thoughtful face and that melancholy contemplative disposition so often noticed in his countrymen between myself and ahyen there exists a friendship of some years standing and we spend many a long evening in the dimly lighted room behind his shop smoking a dreamy pipe together and plunged in silent meditation i am chiefly attracted to my friend by the highly imaginative cast of his mind which is i believe a trait of the eastern character and which enables him to forget to a great extent the sordid cares of his calling in an inner life of his own creation of the keen analytical side of his mind i was in entire ignorance until the evening of which i write  the room where we sat was small and dingy with but little furniture except our chairs and the little table at which we filled and arranged our pipes and was lighted only by a tallow candle there were a few pictures on the walls for the most part rude prints cut from the columns of the daily press and pasted up to hide the bareness of the room only one picture was in any way noticeable a portrait admirably executed in pen and ink the face was that of a young man a very beautiful face but one of infinite sadness i had long been aware although i know not how that ahyen had met with a great sorrow and had in some way connected the fact with this portrait i had always refrained however from asking him about it and it was not until the evening in question that i knew its history  we had been smoking in silence for some time when ahyen spoke my friend is a man of culture and wide reading and his english is consequently perfect in its construction his speech is of course marked by the lingering liquid accent of his country which i will not attempt to reproduce  i see he said that you have been examining the portrait of my unhappy friend fiftysix i have never yet told you of my bereavement but as tonight is the anniversary of his death i would fain speak of him for a while  ahyen paused i lighted my pipe afresh and nodded to him to show that i was listening  i do not know he went on at what precise time fiftysix came into my life i could indeed find it out by examining my books but i have never troubled to do so naturally i took no more interest in him at first than in any other of my customersless perhaps since he never in the course of our connection brought his clothes to me himself but always sent them by a boy when i presently perceived that he was becoming one of my regular customers i allotted to him his number fiftysix and began to speculate as to who and what he was before long i had reached several conclusions in regard to my unknown client the quality of his linen showed me that if not rich he was at any rate fairly well off i could see that he was a young man of regular christian life who went out into society to a certain extent this i could tell from his sending the same number of articles to the laundry from his washing always coming on saturday night and from the fact that he wore a dress shirt about once a week in disposition he was a modest unassuming fellow for his collars were only two inches high  i stared at ahyen in some amazement the recent publications of a favourite novelist had rendered me familiar with this process of analytical reasoning but i was prepared for no such revelations from my eastern friend  when i first knew him ahyen went on fiftysix was a student at the university this of course i did not know for some time i inferred it however in the course of time from his absence from town during the four summer months and from the fact that during the time of the university examinations the cuffs of his shirts came to me covered with dates formulas and propositions in geometry i followed him with no little interest through his university career during the four years which it lasted i washed for him every week my regular connection with him and the insight which my observation gave me into the lovable character of the man deepened my first esteem into a profound affection and i became most anxious for his success i helped him at each succeeding examination as far as lay in my power by starching his shirts halfway to the elbow so as to leave him as much room as possible for annotations my anxiety during the strain of his final examination i will not attempt to describe that fiftysix was undergoing the great crisis of his academic career i could infer from the state of his handkerchiefs which in apparent unconsciousness he used as penwipers during the final test his conduct throughout the examination bore witness to the moral development which had taken place in his character during his career as an undergraduate for the notes upon his cuffs which had been so copious at his earlier examinations were limited now to a few hints and these upon topics so intricate as to defy an ordinary memory it was with a thrill of joy that i at last received in his laundry bundle one saturday early in june a ruffled dress shirt the bosom of which was thickly spattered with the spillings of the winecup and realized that fiftysix had banqueted as a bachelor of arts  in the following winter the habit of wiping his pen upon his handkerchief which i had remarked during his final examination became chronic with him and i knew that he had entered upon the study of law he worked hard during that year and dress shirts almost disappeared from his weekly bundle it was in the following winter the second year of his legal studies that the tragedy of his life began i became aware that a change had come over his laundry from one or at most two a week his dress shirts rose to four and silk handkerchiefs began to replace his linen ones it dawned upon me that fiftysix was abandoning the rigorous tenor of his student life and was going into society i presently perceived something more fiftysix was in love it was soon impossible to doubt it he was wearing seven shirts a week linen handkerchiefs disappeared from his laundry his collars rose from two inches to two and a quarter and finally to two and a half i have in my possession one of his laundry lists of that period a glance at it will show the scrupulous care which he bestowed upon his person well do i remember the dawning hopes of those days alternating with the gloomiest despair each saturday i opened his bundle with a trembling eagerness to catch the first signs of a return of his love i helped my friend in every way that i could his shirts and collars were masterpieces of my art though my hand often shook with agitation as i applied the starch she was a brave noble girl that i knew her influence was elevating the whole nature of fiftysix until now he had had in his possession a certain number of detached cuffs and false shirtfronts these he discarded nowat first the false shirtfronts scorning the very idea of fraud and after a time in his enthusiasm abandoning even the cuffs i cannot look back upon those bright happy days of courtship without a sigh  the happiness of fiftysix seemed to enter into and fill my whole life i lived but from saturday to saturday the appearance of false shirtfronts would cast me to the lowest depths of despair their absence raised me to a pinnacle of hope it was not till winter softened into spring that fiftysix nerved himself to learn his fate one saturday he sent me a new white waistcoat a garment which had hitherto been shunned by his modest nature to prepare for his use i bestowed upon it all the resources of my art i read his purpose in it on the saturday following it was returned to me and with tears of joy i marked where a warm little hand had rested fondly on the right shoulder and knew that fiftysix was the accepted lover of his sweetheart  ahyen paused and sat for some time silent his pipe had sputtered out and lay cold in the hollow of his hand his eye was fixed upon the wall where the light and shadows shifted in the dull flickering of the candle at last he spoke again  i will not dwell upon the happy days that ensueddays of gaudy summer neckties and white waistcoats of spotless shirts and lofty collars worn but a single day by the fastidious lover our happiness seemed complete and i asked no more from fate alas it was not destined to continue when the bright days of summer were fading into autumn i was grieved to notice an occasional quarrelonly four shirts instead of seven or the reappearance of the abandoned cuffs and shirtfronts reconciliations followed with tears of penitence upon the shoulder of the white waistcoat and the seven shirts came back but the quarrels grew more frequent and there came at times stormy scenes of passionate emotion that left a track of broken buttons down the waistcoat the shirts went slowly down to three then fell to two and the collars of my unhappy friend subsided to an inch and threequarters in vain i lavished my utmost care upon fiftysix it seemed to my tortured mind that the gloss upon his shirts and collars would have melted a heart of stone alas my every effort at reconciliation seemed to fail an awful month passed the false fronts and detached cuffs were all back again the unhappy lover seemed to glory in their perfidy at last one gloomy evening i found on opening his bundle that he had bought a stock of celluloids and my heart told me that she had abandoned him for ever of what my poor friend suffered at this time i can give you no idea suffice it to say that he passed from celluloid to a blue flannel shirt and from blue to grey the sight of a red cotton handkerchief in his wash at length warned me that his disappointed love had unhinged his mind and i feared the worst then came an agonizing interval of three weeks during which he sent me nothing and after that came the last parcel that i ever received from him an enormous bundle that seemed to contain all his effects in this to my horror i discovered one shirt the breast of which was stained a deep crimson with his blood and pierced by a ragged hole that showed where a bullet had singed through into his heart  a fortnight before i remembered having heard the street boys crying the news of an appalling suicide and i know now that it must have been he after the first shock of my grief had passed i sought to keep him in my memory by drawing the portrait which hangs beside you i have some skill in the art and i feel assured that i have caught the expression of his face the picture is of course an ideal one for as you know i never saw fiftysix  the bell on the door of the outer shop tinkled at the entrance of a customer ahyen rose with that air of quiet resignation that habitually marked his demeanour and remained for some time in the shop when he returned he seemed in no mood to continue speaking of his lost friend i left him soon after and walked sorrowfully home to my lodgings on my way i mused much upon my little eastern friend and the sympathetic grasp of his imagination but a burden lay heavy on my heartsomething i would fain have told him but which i could not bear to mention i could not find it in my heart to shatter the airy castle of his fancy for my life has been secluded and lonely and i have known no love like that of my ideal friend yet i have a haunting recollection of a certain huge bundle of washing that i sent to him about a year ago i had been absent from town for three weeks and my laundry was much larger than usual in consequence and if i mistake not there was in the bundle a tattered shirt that had been grievously stained by the breaking of a bottle of red ink in my portmanteau and burnt in one place where an ash fell from my cigar as i made up the bundle of all this i cannot feel absolutely certain yet i know at least that until a year ago when i transferred my custom to a more modern establishment my laundry number with ahyen was fiftysix     aristocratic education  house of lords jan 25 1920the house of lords commenced today in committee the consideration of clause no 52000 of the education bill dealing with the teaching of geometry in the schools  the leader of the government in presenting the clause urged upon their lordships the need of conciliation the bill he said had now been before their lordships for sixteen years the government had made every concession they had accepted all the amendments of their lordships on the opposite side in regard to the original provisions of the bill they had consented also to insert in the bill a detailed programme of studies of which the present clause enunciating the fifth proposition of euclid was a part he would therefore ask their lordships to accept the clause drafted as follows  the angles at the base of an isosceles triangle are equal and if the equal sides of the triangle are produced the exterior angles will also be equal  he would hasten to add that the government had no intention of producing the sides contingencies might arise to render such a course necessary but in that case their lordships would receive an early intimation of the fact  the archbishop of canterbury spoke against the clause he considered it in its present form too secular he should wish to amend the clause so as to make it read  the angles at the base of an isosceles triangle are in every christian community equal and if the sides be produced by a member of a christian congregation the exterior angles will be equal  he was aware he continued that the angles at the base of an isosceles triangle are extremely equal but he must remind the government that the church had been aware of this for several years past he was willing also to admit that the opposite sides and ends of a parallelogram are equal but he thought that such admission should be coupled with a distinct recognition of the existence of a supreme being  the leader of the government accepted his graces amendment with pleasure he considered it the brightest amendment his grace had made that week the government he said was aware of the intimate relation in which his grace stood to the bottom end of a parallelogram and was prepared to respect it  lord halifax rose to offer a further amendment he thought the present case was one in which the fourfifths clause ought to apply he should wish it stated that the angles are equal for two days every week except in the case of schools where fourfifths of the parents are conscientiously opposed to the use of the isosceles triangle  the leader of the government thought the amendment a singularly pleasing one he accepted it and would like it understood that the words isosceles triangle were not meant in any offensive sense  lord rosebery spoke at some length he considered the clause unfair to scotland where the high state of morality rendered education unnecessary unless an amendment in this sense was accepted it might be necessary to reconsider the act of union of 1707  the leader of the government said that lord roseberys amendment was the best he had heard yet the government accepted it at once they were willing to make every concession they would if need be reconsider the norman conquest  the duke of devonshire took exception to the part of the clause relating to the production of the sides he did not think the country was prepared for it it was unfair to the producer he would like the clause altered to read if the sides be produced in the home market  the leader of the government accepted with pleasure his graces amendment he considered it quite sensible he would now as it was near the hour of rising present the clause in its revised form he hoped however that their lordships would find time to think out some further amendments for the evening sitting  the clause was then read  his grace of canterbury then moved that the house in all humility adjourn for dinner     the conjurers revenge  now ladies and gentlemen said the conjurer having shown you that the cloth is absolutely empty i will proceed to take from it a bowl of goldfish presto  all around the hall people were saying oh how wonderful how does he do it  but the quick man on the front seat said in a big whisper to the people near him hehadituphissleeve  then the people nodded brightly at the quick man and said oh of course and everybody whispered round the hall hehadituphissleeve  my next trick said the conjurer is the famous hindostanee rings you will notice that the rings are apparently separate at a blow they all join clang clang clangpresto  there was a general buzz of stupefaction till the quick man was heard to whisper hemusthavehadanotherlot uphissleeve  again everybody nodded and whispered theringswere uphissleeve  the brow of the conjurer was clouded with a gathering frown  i will now he continued show you a most amusing trick by which i am enabled to take any number of eggs from a hat will some gentleman kindly lend me his hat ah thank youpresto  he extracted seventeen eggs and for thirtyfive seconds the audience began to think that he was wonderful then the quick man whispered along the front bench hehasa henuphissleeve and all the people whispered it on hehasalotofhensuphissleeve  the egg trick was ruined  it went on like that all through it transpired from the whispers of the quick man that the conjurer must have concealed up his sleeve in addition to the rings hens and fish several packs of cards a loaf of bread a dolls cradle a live guineapig a fiftycent piece and a rockingchair  the reputation of the conjurer was rapidly sinking below zero at the close of the evening he rallied for a final effort  ladies and gentlemen he said i will present to you in conclusion the famous japanese trick recently invented by the natives of tipperary will you sir he continued turning toward the quick man will you kindly hand me your gold watch  it was passed to him  have i your permission to put it into this mortar and pound it to pieces he asked savagely  the quick man nodded and smiled  the conjurer threw the watch into the mortar and grasped a sledge hammer from the table there was a sound of violent smashing hesslippedituphissleeve whispered the quick man  now sir continued the conjurer will you allow me to take your handkerchief and punch holes in it thank you you see ladies and gentlemen there is no deception the holes are visible to the eye  the face of the quick man beamed this time the real mystery of the thing fascinated him  and now sir will you kindly pass me your silk hat and allow me to dance on it thank you  the conjurer made a few rapid passes with his feet and exhibited the hat crushed beyond recognition  and will you now sir take off your celluloid collar and permit me to burn it in the candle thank you sir and will you allow me to smash your spectacles for you with my hammer thank you  by this time the features of the quick man were assuming a puzzled expression this thing beats me he whispered i dont see through it a bit  there was a great hush upon the audience then the conjurer drew himself up to his full height and with a withering look at the quick man he concluded  ladies and gentlemen you will observe that i have with this gentlemans permission broken his watch burnt his collar smashed his spectacles and danced on his hat if he will give me the further permission to paint green stripes on his overcoat or to tie his suspenders in a knot i shall be delighted to entertain you if not the performance is at an end  and amid a glorious burst of music from the orchestra the curtain fell and the audience dispersed convinced that there are some tricks at any rate that are not done up the conjurers sleeve     hints to travellers  the following hints and observations have occurred to me during a recent trip across the continent they are written in no spirit of complaint against existing railroad methods but merely in the hope that they may prove useful to those who travel like myself in a spirit of meek observant ignorance  1 sleeping in a pullman car presents some difficulties to the novice care should be taken to allay all sense of danger the frequent whistling of the engine during the night is apt to be a source of alarm find out therefore before travelling the meaning of the various whistles one means station two railroad crossing and so on five whistles short and rapid mean sudden danger when you hear whistles in the night sit up smartly in your bunk and count them should they reach five draw on your trousers over your pyjamas and leave the train instantly as a further precaution against accident sleep with the feet towards the engine if you prefer to have the feet crushed or with the head towards the engine if you think it best to have the head crushed in making this decision try to be as unselfish as possible if indifferent sleep crosswise with the head hanging over into the aisle  2 i have devoted some thought to the proper method of changing trains the system which i have observed to be the most popular with travellers of my own class is something as follows suppose that you have been told on leaving new york that you are to change at kansas city the evening before approaching kansas city stop the conductor in the aisle of the car you can do this best by putting out your foot and tripping him and say politely do i change at kansas city he says yes very good dont believe him on going into the diningcar for supper take a negro aside and put it to him as a personal matter between a white man and a black whether he thinks you ought to change at kansas city dont be satisfied with this in the course of the evening pass through the entire train from time to time and say to people casually oh can you tell me if i change at kansas city ask the conductor about it a few more times in the evening a repetition of the question will ensure pleasant relations with him before falling asleep watch for his passage and ask him through the curtains of your berth oh by the way did you say i changed at kansas city if he refuses to stop hook him by the neck with your walkingstick and draw him gently to your bedside in the morning when the train stops and a man calls kansas city all change approach the conductor again and say is this kansas city dont be discouraged at his answer pick yourself up and go to the other end of the car and say to the brakesman do you know sir if this is kansas city dont be too easily convinced remember that both brakesman and conductor may be in collusion to deceive you look around therefore for the name of the station on the signboard having found it alight and ask the first man you see if this is kansas city he will answer why where in blank are your blank eyes cant you see it there plain as blank when you hear language of this sort ask no more you are now in kansas and this is kansas city  3 i have observed that it is now the practice of the conductors to stick bits of paper in the hats of the passengers they do this i believe to mark which ones they like best the device is pretty and adds much to the scenic appearance of the car but i notice with pain that the system is fraught with much trouble for the conductors the task of crushing two or three passengers together in order to reach over them and stick a ticket into the chinks of a silk skull cap is embarrassing for a conductor of refined feelings it would be simpler if the conductor should carry a small hammer and a packet of shingle nails and nail the paidup passenger to the back of the seat or better still let the conductor carry a small pot of paint and a brush and mark the passengers in such a way that he cannot easily mistake them in the case of baldheaded passengers the hats might be politely removed and red crosses painted on the craniums this will indicate that they are bald through passengers might be distinguished by a complete coat of paint in the hands of a man of taste much might be effected by a little grouping of painted passengers and the leisure time of the conductor agreeably occupied  4 i have observed in travelling in the west that the irregularity of railroad accidents is a fruitful cause of complaint the frequent disappointment of the holders of accident policy tickets on western roads is leading to widespread protest certainly the conditions of travel in the west are altering rapidly and accidents can no longer be relied upon this is deeply to be regretted in so much as apart from accidents the tickets may be said to be practically valueless     a manual of education  the few selections below are offered as a specimen page of a little book which i have in course of preparation  every man has somewhere in the back of his head the wreck of a thing which he calls his education my book is intended to embody in concise form these remnants of early instruction  educations are divided into splendid educations thorough classical educations and average educations all very old men have splendid educations all men who apparently know nothing else have thorough classical educations nobody has an average education  an education when it is all written out on foolscap covers nearly ten sheets it takes about six years of severe college training to acquire it even then a man often finds that he somehow hasnt got his education just where he can put his thumb on it when my little book of eight or ten pages has appeared everybody may carry his education in his hip pocket  those who have not had

thing but the moths get into it     hoodoo mcfiggins christmas  this santa claus business is played out its a sneaking underhand method and the sooner its exposed the better  for a parent to get up under cover of the darkness of night and palm off a tencent necktie on a boy who had been expecting a tendollar watch and then say that an angel sent it to him is low undeniably low  i had a good opportunity of observing how the thing worked this christmas in the case of young hoodoo mcfiggin the son and heir of the mcfiggins at whose house i board  hoodoo mcfiggin is a good boya religious boy he had been given to understand that santa claus would bring nothing to his father and mother because grownup people dont get presents from the angels so he saved up all his pocketmoney and bought a box of cigars for his father and a seventyfivecent diamond brooch for his mother his own fortunes he left in the hands of the angels but he prayed he prayed every night for weeks that santa claus would bring him a pair of skates and a puppydog and an airgun and a bicycle and a noahs ark and a sleigh and a drumaltogether about a hundred and fifty dollars worth of stuff  i went into hoodoos room quite early christmas morning i had an idea that the scene would be interesting i woke him up and he sat up in bed his eyes glistening with radiant expectation and began hauling things out of his stocking  the first parcel was bulky it was done up quite loosely and had an odd look generally  ha ha hoodoo cried gleefully as he began undoing it ill bet its the puppydog all wrapped up in paper  and was it the puppydog no by no means it was a pair of nice strong numberfour boots laces and all labelled hoodoo from santa claus and underneath santa claus had written 95 net  the boys jaw fell with delight its boots he said and plunged in his hand again  he began hauling away at another parcel with renewed hope on his face  this time the thing seemed like a little round box hoodoo tore the paper off it with a feverish hand he shook it something rattled inside  its a watch and chain its a watch and chain he shouted then he pulled the lid off  and was it a watch and chain no it was a box of nice brandnew celluloid collars a dozen of them all alike and all his own size  the boy was so pleased that you could see his face crack up with pleasure  he waited a few minutes until his intense joy subsided then he tried again  this time the packet was long and hard it resisted the touch and had a sort of funnel shape  its a toy pistol said the boy trembling with excitement gee i hope there are lots of caps with it ill fire some off now and wake up father  no my poor child you will not wake your father with that it is a useful thing but it needs not caps and it fires no bullets and you cannot wake a sleeping man with a toothbrush yes it was a toothbrusha regular beauty pure bone all through and ticketed with a little paper hoodoo from santa claus  again the expression of intense joy passed over the boys face and the tears of gratitude started from his eyes he wiped them away with his toothbrush and passed on  the next packet was much larger and evidently contained something soft and bulky it had been too long to go into the stocking and was tied outside  i wonder what this is hoodoo mused half afraid to open it then his heart gave a great leap and he forgot all his other presents in the anticipation of this one its the drum he gasped its the drum all wrapped up  drum nothing it was pantsa pair of the nicest little short pantsyellowishbrown short pantswith dear little stripes of colour running across both ways and here again santa claus had written hoodoo from santa claus one fort net  but there was something wrapped up in it oh yes there was a pair of braces wrapped up in it braces with a little steel sliding thing so that you could slide your pants up to your neck if you wanted to  the boy gave a dry sob of satisfaction then he took out his last present its a book he said as he unwrapped it i wonder if it is fairy stories or adventures oh i hope its adventures ill read it all morning  no hoodoo it was not precisely adventures it was a small family bible hoodoo had now seen all his presents and he arose and dressed but he still had the fun of playing with his toys that is always the chief delight of christmas morning  first he played with his toothbrush he got a whole lot of water and brushed all his teeth with it this was huge  then he played with his collars he had no end of fun with them taking them all out one by one and swearing at them and then putting them back and swearing at the whole lot together  the next toy was his pants he had immense fun there putting them on and taking them off again and then trying to guess which side was which by merely looking at them  after that he took his book and read some adventures called genesis till breakfasttime  then he went downstairs and kissed his father and mother his father was smoking a cigar and his mother had her new brooch on hoodoos face was thoughtful and a light seemed to have broken in upon his mind indeed i think it altogether likely that next christmas he will hang on to his own money and take chances on what the angels bring     the life of john smith  the lives of great men occupy a large section of our literature the great man is certainly a wonderful thing he walks across his century and leaves the marks of his feet all over it ripping out the dates on his goloshes as he passes it is impossible to get up a revolution or a new religion or a national awakening of any sort without his turning up putting himself at the head of it and collaring all the gatereceipts for himself even after his death he leaves a long trail of secondrate relations spattered over the front seats of fifty years of history  now the lives of great men are doubtless infinitely interesting but at times i must confess to a sense of reaction and an idea that the ordinary common man is entitled to have his biography written too it is to illustrate this view that i write the life of john smith a man neither good nor great but just the usual everyday homo like you and me and the rest of us  from his earliest childhood john smith was marked out from his comrades by nothing the marvellous precocity of the boy did not astonish his preceptors books were not a passion for him from his youth neither did any old man put his hand on smiths head and say mark his words this boy would some day become a man nor yet was it his fathers wont to gaze on him with a feeling amounting almost to awe by no means all his father did was to wonder whether smith was a darn fool because he couldnt help it or because he thought it smart in other words he was just like you and me and the rest of us  in those athletic sports which were the ornament of the youth of his day smith did not as great men do excel his fellows he couldnt ride worth a darn he couldnt skate worth a darn he couldnt swim worth a darn he couldnt shoot worth a darn he couldnt do anything worth a darn he was just like us  nor did the bold cast of the boys mind offset his physical defects as it invariably does in the biographies on the contrary he was afraid of his father he was afraid of his schoolteacher he was afraid of dogs he was afraid of guns he was afraid of lightning he was afraid of hell he was afraid of girls  in the boys choice of a profession there was not seen that keen longing for a lifework that we find in the celebrities he didnt want to be a lawyer because you have to know law he didnt want to be a doctor because you have to know medicine he didnt want to be a businessman because you have to know business and he didnt want to be a schoolteacher because he had seen too many of them as far as he had any choice it lay between being robinson crusoe and being the prince of wales his father refused him both and put him into a dry goods establishment  such was the childhood of smith at its close there was nothing in his outward appearance to mark the man of genius the casual observer could have seen no genius concealed behind the wide face the massive mouth the long slanting forehead and the tall ear that swept up to the closecropped head certainly he couldnt there wasnt any concealed there  it was shortly after his start in business life that smith was stricken with the first of those distressing attacks to which he afterwards became subject it seized him late one night as he was returning home from a delightful evening of song and praise with a few old school chums its symptoms were a peculiar heaving of the sidewalk a dancing of the street lights and a crafty shifting to and fro of the houses requiring a very nice discrimination in selecting his own there was a strong desire not to drink water throughout the entire attack which showed that the thing was evidently a form of hydrophobia from this time on these painful attacks became chronic with smith they were liable to come on at any time but especially on saturday nights on the first of the month and on thanksgiving day he always had a very severe attack of hydrophobia on christmas eve and after elections it was fearful  there was one incident in smiths career which he did perhaps share with regret he had scarcely reached manhood when he met the most beautiful girl in the world she was different from all other women she had a deeper nature than other people smith realized it at once she could feel and understand things that ordinary people couldnt she could understand him she had a great sense of humour and an exquisite appreciation of a joke he told her the six that he knew one night and she thought them great her mere presence made smith feel as if he had swallowed a sunset the first time that his finger brushed against hers he felt a thrill all through him he presently found that if he took a firm hold of her hand with his he could get a fine thrill and if he sat beside her on a sofa with his head against her ear and his arm about once and a half round her he could get what you might call a firstclass a1 thrill smith became filled with the idea that he would like to have her always near him he suggested an arrangement to her by which she should come and live in the same house with him and take personal charge of his clothes and his meals she was to receive in return her board and washing about seventyfive cents a week in ready money and smith was to be her slave  after smith had been this womans slave for some time baby fingers stole across his life then another set of them and then more and more till the house was full of them the womans mother began to steal across his life too and every time she came smith had hydrophobia frightfully strangely enough there was no little prattler that was taken from his life and became a saddened hallowed memory to him oh no the little smiths were not that kind of prattler the whole nine grew up into tall lank boys with massive mouths and great sweeping ears like their fathers and no talent for anything  the life of smith never seemed to bring him to any of those great turningpoints that occurred in the lives of the great true the passing years brought some change of fortune he was moved up in his drygoods establishment from the ribbon counter to the collar counter from the collar counter to the gents panting counter and from the gents panting to the gents fancy shirting then as he grew aged and inefficient they moved him down again from the gents fancy shirting to the gents panting and so on to the ribbon counter and when he grew quite old they dismissed him and got a boy with a fourinch mouth and sandycoloured hair who did all smith could do for half the money that was john smiths mercantile career it wont stand comparison with mr gladstones but its not unlike your own  smith lived for five years after this his sons kept him they didnt want to but they had to in his old age the brightness of his mind and his fund of anecdote were not the delight of all who dropped in to see him he told seven stories and he knew six jokes the stories were long things all about himself and the jokes were about a commercial traveller and a methodist minister but nobody dropped in to see him anyway so it didnt matter  at sixtyfive smith was taken ill and receiving proper treatment he died there was a tombstone put up over him with a hand pointing northnortheast  but i doubt if he ever got there he was too like us     on collecting things  like most other men i have from time to time been stricken with a desire to make collections of things  it began with postage stamps i had a letter from a friend of mine who had gone out to south africa the letter had a threecornered stamp on it and i thought as soon as i looked at it thats the thing stamp collecting ill devote my life to it  i bought an album with accommodation for the stamps of all nations and began collecting right off for three days the collection made wonderful progress it contained  one cape of good hope stamp  one onecent stamp united states of america  one twocent stamp united states of america  one fivecent stamp united states of america  one tencent stamp united states of america  after that the collection came to a dead stop for a while i used to talk about it rather airily and say i had one or two rather valuable south african stamps but i presently grew tired even of lying about it  collecting coins is a thing that i attempt at intervals every time i am given an old halfpenny or a mexican quarter i get an idea that if a fellow made a point of holding on to rarities of that sort hed soon have quite a valuable collection the first time that i tried it i was full of enthusiasm and before long my collection numbered quite a few articles of vertu the items were as follows  no 1 ancient roman coin time of caligula this one of course was the gem of the whole lot it was given me by a friend and that was what started me collecting  no 2 small copper coin value one cent united states of america apparently modern  no 3 small nickel coin circular united states of america value five cents  no 4 small silver coin value ten cents united states of america  no 5 silver coin circular value twentyfive cents united states of america very beautiful  no 6 large silver coin circular inscription one dollar united states of america very valuable  no 7 ancient british copper coin probably time of caractacus very dim inscription victoria dei gratia regina very valuable  no 8 silver coin evidently french inscription funf mark kaiser wilhelm  no 9 circular silver coin very much defaced part of inscription e pluribus unum probably a russian rouble but quite as likely to be a japanese yen or a shanghai rooster  thats as far as that collection got it lasted through most of the winter and i was getting quite proud of it but i took the coins down town one evening to show to a friend and we spent no 3 no 4 no 5 no 6 and no 7 in buying a little dinner for two after dinner i bought a yens worth of cigars and traded the relic of caligula for as many hot scotches as they cared to advance on it after that i felt reckless and put no 2 and no 8 into a childrens hospital poor box  i tried fossils next i got two in ten years then i quit  a friend of mine once showed me a very fine collection of ancient and curious weapons and for a time i was full of that idea i gathered several interesting specimens such as  no 1 old flintlock musket used by my grandfather he used it on the farm for years as a crowbar  no 2 old rawhide strap used by my father  no 3 ancient indian arrowhead found by myself the very day after i began collecting it resembles a threecornered stone  no 4 ancient indian bow found by myself behind a sawmill on the second day of collecting it resembles a straight stick of elm or oak it is interesting to think that this very weapon may have figured in some fierce scene of savage warfare  no 5 cannibal poniard or straighthandled dagger of the south sea islands it will give the reader almost a thrill of horror to learn that this atrocious weapon which i bought myself on the third day of collecting was actually exposed in a secondhand store as a family carvingknife in gazing at it one cannot refrain from conjuring up the awful scenes it must have witnessed  i kept this collection for quite a long while until in a moment of infatuation i presented it to a young lady as a betrothal present the gift proved too ostentatious and our relations subsequently ceased to be cordial  on the whole i am inclined to recommend the beginner to confine himself to collecting coins at present i am myself making a collection of american bills time of taft preferred a pursuit i find most absorbing     society chatchat  as it should be written  i notice that it is customary for the daily papers to publish a column or so of society gossip they generally head it chitchat or on dit or le boudoir or something of the sort and they keep it pretty full of french terms to give it the proper sort of swing these columns may be very interesting in their way but it always seems to me that they dont get hold of quite the right things to tell us about they are very fond for instance of giving an account of the delightful dance at mrs de smythesat which mrs de smythe looked charming in a gown of old tulle with a stomacher of passementerieor of the dinnerparty at mr alonzo robinsons residence or the smart pink tea given by miss carlotta jones no thats all right but its not the kind of thing we want to get at those are not the events which happen in our neighbours houses that we really want to hear about it is the quiet little family scenes the little traits of homelife thatwell for example take the case of that delightful party at the de smythes i am certain that all those who were present would much prefer a little paragraph like the following which would give them some idea of the homelife of the de smythes on the morning after the party  dejeuner de luxe at the de smythe residence  on wednesday morning last at 715 am a charming little breakfast was served at the home of mr de smythe the dejeuner was given in honour of mr de smythe and his two sons master adolphus and master blinks de smythe who were about to leave for their daily travail at their wholesale bureau de flour et de feed all the gentlemen were very quietly dressed in their habits de work miss melinda de smythe poured out tea the domestique having refuse to get up so early after the partie of the night before the menu was very handsome consisting of eggs and bacon demifroid and icecream the conversation was sustained and lively mr de smythe sustained it and made it lively for his daughter and his garcons in the course of the talk mr de smythe stated that the next time he allowed the young people to turn his maison topsyturvy he would see them in enfer he wished to know if they were aware that some ass of the evening before had broken a pane of coloured glass in the hall that would cost him four dollars did they think he was made of argent if so they never made a bigger mistake in their vie the meal closed with general expressions of goodfeeling a little bird has whispered to us that there will be no more parties at the de smythes pour longtemps  here is another little paragraph that would be of general interest in society  diner de fameel at the boardinghouse de mcfiggin  yesterday evening at half after six a pleasant little diner was given by madame mcfiggin of rock street to her boarders the salle a manger was very prettily decorated with texts and the furniture upholstered with cheveux de horse louis quinze the boarders were all very quietly dressed mrs mcfiggin was daintily attired in some old clinging stuff with a corsage de whalebone underneath the ample board groaned under the bill of fare the boarders groaned also their groaning was very noticeable the piece de resistance was a hunko de boeuf boile flanked with some old clinging stuff the entrees were pate de pumpkin followed by fromage mcfiggin served under glass towards the end of the first course speeches became the order of the day mrs mcfiggin was the first speaker in commencing she expressed her surprise that so few of the gentlemen seemed to care for the hunko de boeuf her own mind she said had hesitated between hunko de boeuf boile and a pair of roast chickens sensation she had finally decided in favour of the hunko de boeuf no sensation she referred at some length to the late mr mcfiggin who had always shown a marked preference for hunko de boeuf several other speakers followed all spoke forcibly and to the point the last to speak was the reverend mr whiner the reverend gentleman in rising said that he confided himself and his fellowboarders to the special interference of providence for what they had eaten he said he hoped that providence would make them truly thankful at the close of the repas several of the boarders expressed their intention of going down the street to a restourong to get quelque chose a manger  here is another example how interesting it would be to get a detailed account of that little affair at the robinsons of which the neighbours only heard indirectly thus  delightful evening at the residence of mr alonzo robinson  yesterday the family of mr alonzo robinson spent a very lively evening at their home on th avenue the occasion was the seventeenth birthday of master alonzo robinson junior it was the original intention of master alonzo robinson to celebrate the day at home and invite a few of les garcons mr robinson senior however having declared that he would be damne first master alonzo spent the evening in visiting the salons of the town which he painted rouge mr robinson senior spent the evening at home in quiet expectation of his sons return he was very becomingly dressed in a pantalon quatre vingt treize and had his whippe de chien laid across his knee madame robinson and the mademoiselles robinson wore black the guest of the evening arrived at a late hour he wore his habits de spri and had about six pouces of eau de vie in him he was evidently full up to his cou for some time after his arrival a very lively time was spent mr robinson having at length broken the whippe de chien the family parted for the night with expressions of cordial goodwill     insurance up to date  a man called on me the other day with the idea of insuring my life now i detest lifeinsurance agents they always argue that i shall some day die which is not so i have been insured a great many times for about a month at a time but have had no luck with it at all  so i made up my mind that i would outwit this man at his own game i let him talk straight ahead and encouraged him all i could until he finally left me with a sheet of questions which i was to answer as an applicant now this was what i was waiting for i had decided that if that company wanted information about me they should have it and have the very best quality i could supply so i spread the sheet of questions before me and drew up a set of answers for them which i hoped would settle for ever all doubts as to my eligibility for insurance  questionwhat is your age answeri cant think  qwhat is your chest measurement anineteen inches  qwhat is your chest expansion ahalf an inch  qwhat is your height asix feet five if erect but less when     i walk on all fours  qis your

habits or tendencies which     might be expected to shorten your life ai am aware i drink i smoke i take morphine and     vaseline i swallow grape seeds and i hate exercise  i thought when i had come to the end of that list that i had made a dead sure thing of it and i posted the paper with a cheque for three months payment feeling pretty confident of having the cheque sent back to me i was a good deal surprised a few days later to receive the following letter from the company  dear sirwe beg to acknowledge your letter of application and cheque for fifteen dollars after a careful comparison of your case with the average modern standard we are pleased to accept you as a firstclass risk     borrowing a match  you might think that borrowing a match upon the street is a simple thing but any man who has ever tried it will assure you that it is not and will be prepared to swear to the truth of my experience of the other evening  i was standing on the corner of the street with a cigar that i wanted to light i had no match i waited till a decent ordinarylooking man came along then i said  excuse me sir but could you oblige me with the loan of a match  a match he said why certainly then he unbuttoned his overcoat and put his hand in the pocket of his waistcoat i know i have one he went on and id almost swear its in the bottom pocketor hold on though i guess it may be in the topjust wait till i put these parcels down on the sidewalk  oh dont trouble i said its really of no consequence  oh its no trouble ill have it in a minute i know there must be one in here somewherehe was digging his fingers into his pockets as he spokebut you see this isnt the waistcoat i generally  i saw that the man was getting excited about it well never mind i protested if that isnt the waistcoat that you generallywhy it doesnt matter  hold on now hold on the man said ive got one of the cursed things in here somewhere i guess it must be in with my watch no its not there either wait till i try my coat if that confounded tailor only knew enough to make a pocket so that a man could get at it  he was getting pretty well worked up now he had thrown down his walkingstick and was plunging at his pockets with his teeth set its that cursed young boy of mine he hissed this comes of his fooling in my pockets by gad perhaps i wont warm him up when i get home say ill bet that its in my hippocket you just hold up the tail of my overcoat a second till i  no no i protested again please dont take all this trouble it really doesnt matter im sure you neednt take off your overcoat and oh pray dont throw away your letters and things in the snow like that and tear out your pockets by the roots please please dont trample over your overcoat and put your feet through the parcels i do hate to hear you swearing at your little boy with that peculiar whine in your voice dontplease dont tear your clothes so savagely  suddenly the man gave a grunt of exultation and drew his hand up from inside the lining of his coat  ive got it he cried here you are then he brought it out under the light  it was a toothpick  yielding to the impulse of the moment i pushed him under the wheels of a trolleycar and ran     a lesson in fiction  suppose that in the opening pages of the modern melodramatic novel you find some such situation as the following in which is depicted the terrific combat between gaspard de vaux the boy lieutenant and hairy hank the chief of the italian banditti  the inequality of the contest was apparent with a mingled yell of rage and contempt his sword brandished above his head and his dirk between his teeth the enormous bandit rushed upon his intrepid opponent de vaux seemed scarce more than a stripling but he stood his ground and faced his hitherto invincible assailant mong dieu cried de smythe he is lost  question on which of the parties to the above contest do you honestly feel inclined to put your money  answer on de vaux hell win hairy hank will force him down to one knee and with a brutal cry of har har will be about to dirk him when de vaux will make a sudden lunge one he had learnt at home out of a book of lunges and  very good you have answered correctly now suppose you find a little later in the book that the killing of hairy hank has compelled de vaux to flee from his native land to the east are you not fearful for his safety in the desert  answer frankly i am not de vaux is all right his name is on the title page and you cant kill him  question listen to this then the sun of ethiopia beat fiercely upon the desert as de vaux mounted upon his faithful elephant pursued his lonely way seated in his lofty hoodoo his eye scoured the waste suddenly a solitary horseman appeared on the horizon then another and another and then six in a few moments a whole crowd of solitary horsemen swooped down upon him there was a fierce shout of allah a rattle of firearms de vaux sank from his hoodoo on to the sands while the affrighted elephant dashed off in all directions the bullet had struck him in the heart  there now what do you think of that isnt de vaux killed now  answer i am sorry de vaux is not dead true the ball had hit him oh yes it had hit him but it had glanced off against a family bible which he carried in his waistcoat in case of illness struck some hymns that he had in his hippocket and glancing off again had flattened itself against de vauxs diary of his life in the desert which was in his knapsack  question but even if this doesnt kill him you must admit that he is near death when he is bitten in the jungle by the deadly dongola  answer thats all right a kindly arab will take de vaux to the sheiks tent  question what will de vaux remind the sheik of  answer too easy of his longlost son who disappeared years ago  question was this son hairy hank  answer of course he was anyone could see that but the sheik never suspects it and heals de vaux he heals him with an herb a thing called a simple an amazingly simple known only to the sheik since using this herb the sheik has used no other  question the sheik will recognize an overcoat that de vaux is wearing and complications will arise in the matter of hairy hank deceased will this result in the death of the boy lieutenant  answer no by this time de vaux has realized that the reader knows he wont die and resolves to quit the desert the thought of his mother keeps recurring to him and of his father too the grey stooping old mandoes he stoop still or has he stopped stooping at times too there comes the thought of another a fairer than his father she whosebut enough de vaux returns to the old homestead in piccadilly  question when de vaux returns to england what will happen  answer this will happen he who left england ten years before a raw boy has returned a sunburnt soldierly man but who is this that advances smilingly to meet him can the mere girl the bright child that shared his hours of play can she have grown into this peerless graceful girl at whose feet half the noble suitors of england are kneeling can this be her he asks himself in amazement  question is it her  answer oh its her all right it is her and it is him and it is them that girl hasnt waited fifty pages for nothing  question you evidently guess that a love affair will ensue between the boy lieutenant and the peerless girl with the broad feet do you imagine however that its course will run smoothly and leave nothing to record  answer not at all i feel certain that the scene of the novel having edged itself around to london the writer will not feel satisfied unless he introduces the following famous scene  stunned by the cruel revelation which he had received unconscious of whither his steps were taking him gaspard de vaux wandered on in the darkness from street to street until he found himself upon london bridge he leaned over the parapet and looked down upon the whirling stream below there was something in the still swift rush of it that seemed to beckon to allure him after all why not what was life now that he should prize it for a moment de vaux paused irresolute  question will he throw himself in  answer well say you dont know gaspard he will pause irresolute up to the limit then with a fierce struggle will recall his courage and hasten from the bridge  question this struggle not to throw oneself in must be dreadfully difficult  answer oh dreadfully most of us are so frail we should jump in at once but gaspard has the knack of it besides he still has some of the sheiks herb he chews it  question what has happened to de vaux anyway is it anything he has eaten  answer no it is nothing that he has eaten its about her the blow has come she has no use for sunburn doesnt care for tan she is going to marry a duke and the boy lieutenant is no longer in it the real trouble is that the modern novelist has got beyond the happymarriage mode of ending he wants tragedy and a blighted life to wind up with  question how will the book conclude  answer oh de vaux will go back to the desert fall upon the sheiks neck and swear to be a second hairy hank to him there will be a final panorama of the desert the sheik and his newly found son at the door of the tent the sun setting behind a pyramid and de vauxs faithful elephant crouched at his feet and gazing up at him with dumb affection     helping the armenians  the financial affairs of the parish church up at doogalville have been getting rather into a tangle in the last six months the people of the church were specially anxious to do something toward the general public subscription of the town on behalf of the unhappy armenians and to that purpose they determined to devote the collections taken up at a series of special evening services to give the right sort of swing to the services and to stimulate generous giving they put a new pipe organ into the church in order to make a preliminary payment on the organ it was decided to raise a mortgage on the parsonage  to pay the interest on the mortgage the choir of the church got up a sacred concert in the town hall  to pay for the town hall the willing workers guild held a social in the sunday school to pay the expenses of the social the rector delivered a public lecture on italy and her past illustrated by a magic lantern to pay for the magic lantern the curate and the ladies of the church got up some amateur theatricals  finally to pay for the costumes for the theatricals the rector felt it his duty to dispense with the curate  so that is where the church stands just at present what they chiefly want to do is to raise enough money to buy a suitable gold watch as a testimonial to the curate after that they hope to be able to do something for the armenians meantime of course the armenians the ones right there in the town are getting very troublesome to begin with there is the armenian who rented the costumes for the theatricals he has to be squared then there is the armenian organ dealer and the armenian who owned the magic lantern they want relief badly  the most urgent case is that of the armenian who holds the mortgage on the parsonage indeed it is generally felt in the congregation when the rector makes his impassioned appeals at the special services on behalf of the suffering cause that it is to this man that he has special reference  in the meanwhile the general public subscription is not getting along very fast but the proprietor of the big saloon further down the street and the man with the short cigar that runs the doogalville midway plaisance have been most liberal in their contributions     a study in still lifethe country hotel  the country hotel stands on the sunny side of main street it has three entrances  there is one in front which leads into the bar there is one at the side called the ladies entrance which leads into the bar from the side there is also the main entrance which leads into the bar through the rotunda  the rotunda is the space between the door of the barroom and the cigarcase  in it is a desk and a book in the book are written down the names of the guests together with marks indicating the direction of the wind and the height of the barometer it is here that the newly arrived guest waits until he has time to open the door leading to the bar  the barroom forms the largest part of the hotel it constitutes the hotel proper to it are attached a series of bedrooms on the floor above many of which contain beds  the walls of the barroom are perforated in all directions with trapdoors through one of these drinks are passed into the back sittingroom through others drinks are passed into the passages drinks are also passed through the floor and through the ceiling drinks once passed never return the proprietor stands in the doorway of the bar he weighs two hundred pounds his face is immovable as putty he is drunk he has been drunk for twelve years it makes no difference to him behind the bar stands the bartender he wears wickersleeves his hair is curled in a hook and his name is charlie  attached to the bar is a pneumatic beerpump by means of which the bartender can flood the bar with beer afterwards he wipes up the beer with a rag by this means he polishes the bar some of the beer that is pumped up spills into glasses and has to be sold  behind the bartender is a mechanism called a cashregister which on being struck a powerful blow rings a bell sticks up a card marked no sale and opens a till from which the bartender distributes money  there is printed a tariff of drinks and prices on the wall  it reads thus    beer             5 cents      whisky          5 cents   whisky and soda       5 cents      beer and soda       5 cents   whisky and beer and soda   5 cents      whisky and eggs      5 cents      beer and eggs       5 cents         champagne       5 cents         cigars         5 cents   cigars extra fine      5 cents  all calculations are made on this basis and are worked out to three places of decimals every seventh drink is on the house and is not followed by a distribution of money  the barroom closes at midnight provided there are enough people in it if there is not a quorum the proprietor waits for a better chance a careful closing of the bar will often catch as many as twentyfive people the bar is not opened again till seven oclock in the morning after that the people may go home there are also nowadays local option hotels these contain only one entrance leading directly into the bar     an experiment with policeman hogan  mr scalper sits writing in the reporters room of the daily eclipse the paper has gone to press and he is alone a wayward talented gentleman this mr scalper and employed by the eclipse as a delineator of character from handwriting any subscriber who forwards a specimen of his handwriting is treated to a prompt analysis of his character from mr scalpers facile pen the literary genius has a little pile of correspondence beside him and is engaged in the practice of his art outside the night is dark and rainy the clock on the city hall marks the hour of two in front of the newspaper office policeman hogan walks drearily up and down his beat the damp misery of hogan is intense a belated gentleman in clerical attire returning home from a bed of sickness gives him a sidelook of timid pity and shivers past hogan follows the retreating figure with his eye then draws forth a notebook and sits down on the steps of the eclipse building to write in the light of the gas lamp gentlemen of nocturnal habits have often wondered what it is that policeman hogan and his brethren write in their little books here are the words that are fashioned by the big fist of the policeman  two oclock all is well there is a light in mr scalpers room above the night is very wet and i am unhappy and cannot sleepmy fourth night of insomnia suspiciouslooking individual just passed alas how melancholy is my life will the dawn never break oh moist moist stone  mr scalper up above is writing too writing with the careless fluency of a man who draws his pay by the column he is delineating with skill and rapidity the reporters room is gloomy and desolate mr scalper is a man of sensitive temperament and the dreariness of his surroundings depresses him he opens the letter of a correspondent examines the handwriting narrowly casts his eye around the room for inspiration and proceeds to delineate  gh you have an unhappy despondent nature your circumstances oppress you and your life is filled with an infinite sadness you feel that you are without hope  mr scalper pauses takes another look around the room and finally lets his eye rest for some time upon a tall black bottle that stands on the shelf of an open cupboard then he goes on  and you have lost all belief in christianity and a future world and human virtue you are very weak against temptation but there is an ugly vein of determination in your character when you make up your mind that you are going to have a thing  here mr scalper stops abruptly pushes back his chair and dashes across the room to the cupboard he takes the black bottle from the shelf applies it to his lips and remains for some time motionless he then returns to finish the delineation of gh with the hurried words  on the whole i recommend you to persevere you are doing very well mr scalpers next proceeding is peculiar he takes from the cupboard a roll of twine about fifty feet in length and attaches one end of it to the neck of the bottle going then to one of the windows he opens it leans out and whistles softly the alert ear of policeman hogan on the pavement below catches the sound and he returns it the bottle is lowered to the end of the string the guardian of the peace applies it to his gullet and for some time the policeman and the man of letters remain attached by a cord of sympathy gentlemen who lead the variegated life of mr scalper find it well to propitiate the arm of the law and attachments of this sort are not uncommon mr scalper hauls up the bottle closes the window and returns to his task the policeman resumes his walk with a glow of internal satisfaction a glance at the city hall clock causes him to enter another note in his book  halfpast two all is better the weather is milder with a feeling of young summer in the air two lights in mr scalpers room nothing has occurred which need be brought to the notice of the roundsman  things are going better upstairs too the delineator opens a second envelope surveys the writing of the correspondent with a critical yet charitable eye and writes with more complacency  william h your writing shows a disposition which though naturally melancholy is capable of a temporary cheerfulness you have known misfortune but have made up your mind to look on the bright side of things if you will allow me to say so you indulge in liquor but are quite moderate in your use of it be assured that no harm ever comes of this moderate use it enlivens the intellect brightens the faculties and stimulates the dormant fancy into a pleasurable activity it is only when carried to excess  at this point the feelings of mr scalper who had been writing very rapidly evidently become too much for him he starts up from his chair rushes two or three times around the room and finally returns to finish the delineation thus it is only when carried to excess that this moderation becomes pernicious  mr scalper succumbs to the train of thought suggested and gives an illustration of how moderation to excess may be avoided after which he lowers the bottle to policeman hogan with a cheery exchange of greetings  the halfhours pass on the delineator is writing busily and feels that he is writing well the characters of his correspondents lie bare to his keen eye and flow from his facile pen from time to time he pauses and appeals to the source of his inspiration his humanity prompts him to extend the inspiration to policeman hogan the minion of the law walks his beat with a feeling of more than tranquillity a solitary chinaman returning home late from his midnight laundry scuttles past the literary instinct has risen strong in hogan from his connection with the man of genius above him and the passage of the lone chinee gives him occasion to write in his book  fourthirty everything is simply great there are four lights in mr scalpers room mild balmy weather with prospects of an earthquake which may be held in check by walking with extreme caution two chinamen have just passedmandarins i presume their walk was unsteady but their faces so benign as to disarm suspicion  up in the office mr scalper has reached the letter of a correspondent which appears to give him particular pleasure for he delineates the character with a beaming smile of satisfaction to the unpractised eye the writing resembles the prim angular hand of an elderly spinster mr scalper however seems to think otherwise for he writes  aunt dorothea you have a merry rollicking nature at times you are seized with a wild tumultuous hilarity to which you give ample vent in shouting and song you are much addicted to profanity and you rightly feel that this is part of your nature and you must not check it the world is a very bright place to you aunt dorothea write to me again soon our minds seem cast in the same mould  mr scalper seems to think that he has not done full justice to the subject he is treating for he proceeds to write a long private letter to aunt dorothea in addition to the printed delineation as he finishes the city hall clock points to five and policeman hogan makes the last entry in his chronicle hogan has seated himself upon the steps of the eclipse building for greater comfort and writes with a slow leisurely fist  the other hand of the clock points north and the second longest points southeast by south i infer that it is five oclock the electric lights in mr scalpers room defy the eye the roundsman has passed and examined my notes of the nights occurrences they are entirely satisfactory and he is pleased with their literary form the earthquake which i apprehended was reduced to a few minor oscillations which cannot reach me where i sit  the lowering of the bottle interrupts policeman hogan the long letter to aunt dorothea has cooled the ardour of mr scalper the generous blush has passed from his mind and he has been trying in vain to restore it to afford hogan a similar opportunity he decides not to haul the bottle up immediately but to leave it in his custody while he delineates a character the writing of this correspondent would seem to the inexperienced eye to be that of a timid little maiden in her teens mr scalper is not to be deceived by appearances he shakes his head mournfully at the letter and writes  little emily you have known great happiness but it has passed despondency has driven you to seek forgetfulness in drink your writing shows the worst phase of the liquor habit i apprehend that you will shortly have delirium tremens poor little emily do not try to break off it is too late  mr scalper is visibly affected by his correspondents unhappy condition his eye becomes moist and he decides to haul up the bottle while there is still time to save policeman hogan from acquiring a taste for liquor he is surprised and alarmed to find the attempt to haul it up ineffectual the minion of the law has fallen into a leaden slumber and the bottle remains tight in his grasp the baffled delineator lets fall the string and returns to finish his task only a few lines are now required to fill the column but mr scalper finds on examining the correspondence that he has exhausted the subjects this however is quite a common occurrence and occasions no dilemma in the mind of the talented gentleman it is his custom in such cases to fill up the space with an imaginary character or two the analysis of which is a task most congenial to his mind he bows his head in thought for a few moments and then writes as follows  policeman h your hand shows great firmness when once set upon a thing you are not easily moved but you have a mean grasping disposition and a tendency to want more than your share you have formed an attachment which you hope will be continued throughout life but your selfishness threatens to sever the bond  having written which mr scalper arranges his manuscript for the printer next day dons his hat and coat and wends his way home in the morning twilight feeling that his pay is earned     the passing of the poet  studies in what may be termed collective psychology are essentially in keeping with the spirit of the present century the examination of the mental tendencies the intellectual habits which we display not as individuals but as members of a race community or crowd is offering a fruitful field of speculation as yet but little exploited one may therefore not without profit pass in review the relation of the poetic instinct to the intellectual development of the present era  not the least noticeable feature in the psychological evolution of our time is the rapid disappearance of poetry the art of writing poetry or perhaps more fairly the habit of writing poetry is passing from us the poet is destined to become extinct  to a reader of trained intellect the initial difficulty at once suggests itself as to what is meant by poetry but it is needless to quibble at a definition of the term it may be designated simply and fairly as the art of expressing a simple truth in a concealed form of words any number of which at intervals greater or less may or may not rhyme  the poet it must be said is as old as civilization the greeks had him with them stamping out his iambics with the sole of his foot the romans too knew himendlessly juggling his syllables together long and short short and long to make hexameters this can now be done by electricity but the romans did not know it  but it is not my present purpose to speak of the poets of an earlier and ruder time for the subject before us it is enough to set our age in comparison with the era that preceded it we have but to contrast ourselves with our early victorian grandfathers to realize the profound revolution that has taken place in public feeling it is only with an effort that the practical common sense of the twentieth century can realize the excessive sentimentality of the earlier generation  in those days poetry stood in high and universal esteem parents read poetry to their children children recited poetry to their parents and he was a dullard indeed who did not at least profess in his hours of idleness to pour spontaneous rhythm from his flowing quill  should one gather statistics of the enormous production of poetry some sixty or seventy years ago they would scarcely appear credible journals and magazines teemed with it editors openly countenanced it even the daily press affected it love sighed in homemade stanzas patriotism rhapsodized on the hustings or cited rolling hexameters to an enraptured legislature even melancholy death courted his everlasting sleep in elegant elegiacs  in that era indeed i know not how polite society was haunted by the obstinate fiction that it was the duty of a man of parts to express himself from time to time in verse any special occasion of expansion or exuberance of depression torsion or introspection was sufficient to call it forth so we have poems of dejection of reflection of deglutition of indigestion  any particular psychological disturbance was enough to provoke an excess of poetry the character and manner of the verse might vary with the predisposing cause a gentleman who had dined too freely might disexpand himself in a short fit of lyric doggerel in which bowl and soul were freely rhymed the mornings indigestion inspired a longdrawn elegiac with bier and tear mortal and portal linked in sonorous sadness the man of politics from time to time grateful to an appreciative country sang back to it ho albion rising from the brine in verse whose intention at least was meritorious  and yet it was but a fiction a purely fictitious obligation selfimposed by a sentimental society in plain truth poetry came no more easily or naturally to the early victorian than to you or me the lover twanged his obdurate harp in vain for hours for the rhymes that would not come and the man of politics hammered at his heavy hexameter long indeed before his albion was finally hoed into shape while the beerbesotted convivialist cudgelled his poor wits cold sober in rhyming the light little bottleditty that should have sprung like aphrodite from the froth of the champagne  i have before me a pathetic witness of this fact it is the notebook once used for the random jottings of a gentleman of the period in it i read fair lydia if my earthly harp this is crossed out and below it appears fair lydia could my earthly harp this again is erased and under it appears fair lydia should my earthly harp this again is struck out with a despairing stroke and amended to read fair lydia did my earthly harp so that finally when the lines appeared in the gentlemans magazine 1845 in their ultimate shapefair edith when with fluent pen etc etcone can realize from what a desperate congelation the fluent pen had been so perseveringly rescued  there can be little doubt of the deleterious effect occasioned both to public and private morals by this deliberate exaltation of mental susceptibility on the part of the early victorian in many cases we can detect the evidences of incipient paresis the undue access of emotion frequently assumed a pathological character the sight of a daisy of a withered leaf or an upturned sod seemed to disturb the poets mental equipoise spring unnerved him the lambs distressed him the flowers made him cry the daffodils made him laugh day dazzled him night frightened him  this exalted mood combined with the mans culpable ignorance of the plainest principles of physical science made him see something out of the ordinary in the flight of a waterfowl or the song of a skylark he complained that he could hear it but not see ita phenomenon too familiar to the scientific observer to occasion any comment  in such a state of mind the most inconsequential inferences were drawn one said that the brightness of the dawna fact easily explained by the diurnal motion of the globeshowed him that his soul was immortal he asserted further that he had at an earlier period of his life trailed bright clouds behind him this was absurd  with the disturbance thus set up in the nervous system were coupled in many instances mental aberrations particularly in regard to pecuniary matters give me not silk nor rich attire pleaded one poet of the period to the british public nor gold nor jewels rare here was an evident hallucination that the writer was to become the recipient of an enormous secret subscription indeed the earnest desire not to be given gold was a recurrent characteristic of the poetic temperament the repugnance to accept even a handful of gold was generally accompanied by a desire for a draught of pure water or a nights rest  it is pleasing to turn from this excessive sentimentality of thought and speech to the practical and concise diction of our time we have learned to express ourselves with equal force but greater simplicity to illustrate this i have gathered from the poets of the earlier generation and from the prose writers of today parallel passages that may be fairly set in contrast here for example is a passage from the poet grey still familiar to scholars     can storied urn or animated bust    back to its mansion call the fleeting breath    can honours voice invoke the silent dust    or flattery soothe the dull cold ear of death  precisely similar in thought though different in form is the more modern presentation found in huxleys physiology  whether after the moment of death the ventricles of the heart can be again set in movement by the artificial stimulus of oxygen is a question to which we must impose a decided negative  how much simpler and yet how far superior to greys elaborate phraseology huxley has here seized the central point of the poets thought and expressed it with the dignity and precision of exact science  i cannot refrain even at the risk of needless iteration from quoting a further example it is taken from the poet burns the original dialect being written in inverted hiccoughs is rather difficult to reproduce it describes the scene attendant upon the return of a cottage labourer to his home on saturday night     the cheerfu supper done wi serious face    they round the ingle form in a circle wide    the sire turns oer wi patriarchal grace    the big ha bible ance his fathers pride    his bonnet revrently is laid aside    his lyart haffets wearing thin an bare    those strains that once did sweet in zion glide    he wales a portion wi judeecious care  now i find almost the same scene described in more apt phraseology in the police news of the dumfries chronicle october 3 1909 thus it appears that the prisoner had returned to his domicile at the usual hour and after partaking of a hearty meal had seated himself on his oaken settle for the ostensible purpose of reading the bible it was while so occupied that his arrest was effected with the trifling exception that burns omits all mention of the arrest for which however the whole tenor of the poem gives ample warrant the two accounts are almost identical  in all that i have thus said i do not wish to be misunderstood believing as i firmly do that the poet is destined to become extinct i am not one of those who would accelerate his extinction the time has not yet come for remedial legislation or the application of the criminal law even in obstinate cases where pronounced delusions in reference to plants animals and natural phenomena are seen to exist it is better that we should do nothing that might occasion a mistaken remorse the inevitable natural evolution which is thus shaping the mould of human thought may safely be left to its own course     selfmade men  they were both what we commonly call successful business menmen with wellfed faces heavy signet rings on fingers like sausages and broad comfortable waistcoats a yard and a half round the equator they were seated opposite each other at a table of a firstclass restaurant and had fallen into conversation while waiting to give their order to the waiter their talk had drifted back to their early days and how each had made his start in life when he first struck new york  i tell you what jones one of them was saying i shall never forget my first few years in this town by george it was pretty uphill work do you know sir when i first struck this place i hadnt more than fifteen cents to my name hadnt a rag except what i stood up in and all the place i had to sleep inyou wont believe it but its a gospel fact just the samewas an empty tar barrel no sir he went on leaning back and closing up his eyes into an expression of infinite experience no sir a fellow accustomed to luxury like you has simply no idea what sleeping out in a tar barrel and all that kind of thing is like  my dear robinson the other man rejoined briskly if you imagine ive had no experience of hardship of that sort you never made a bigger mistake in your life why when i first walked into this town i hadnt a cent sir not a cent and as for lodging all the place i had for months and months was an old piano box up a lane behind a factory talk about hardship i guess i had it pretty rough you take a fellow thats used to a good warm tar barrel and put him into a piano box for a night or two and youll see mighty soon  my dear fellow robinson broke in with some irritation you merely show that you dont know what a tar barrels like why on winter nights when youd be shut in there in your piano box just as snug as you please i used to lie awake shivering with the draught fairly running in at the bunghole at the back  draught sneered the other man with a provoking laugh draught dont talk to me about draughts this box i speak of had a whole darned plank off it right on the north side too i used to sit there studying in the evenings and the snow would blow in a foot deep and yet sir he continued more quietly though i know youll not believe it i dont mind admitting that some of the happiest days of my life were spent in that same old box ah those were good old times bright innocent days i can tell you id wake up there in the mornings and fairly shout with high spirits of course you may not be able to stand that kind of life  not stand it cried robinson fiercely me not stand it by gad im made for it i just wish i had a taste of the old life again for a while and as for innocence well ill bet you you werent onetenth as innocent as i was no nor onefifth nor onethird what a grand old life it was youll swear this is a darned lie and refuse to believe itbut i can remember evenings when id have two or three fellows in and wed sit round and play pedro by a candle half the night  two or three laughed jones why my dear fellow ive known half a dozen of us to sit down to supper in my piano box and have a game of pedro afterwards yes and charades and forfeits and every other darned thing mighty good suppers they were too by jove robinson you fellows round this town who have ruined your digestions with high living have no notion of the zest with which a man can sit down to a few potato peelings or a bit of broken pie crust or  talk about hard food interrupted the other i guess i know all about that manys the time ive breakfasted off a little cold porridge that somebody was going to throw away from a backdoor or that ive gone round to a livery stable and begged a little bran mash that they intended for the pigs ill venture to say ive eaten more hogs food  hogs food shouted robinson striking his fist savagely on the table i tell you hogs food suits me better than  he stopped speaking with a sudden grunt of surprise as the waiter appeared with the question  what may i bring you for dinner gentlemen  dinner said jones after a moment of silence dinner oh anything nothingi never care what i eatgive me a little cold porridge if youve got it or a chunk of salt porkanything you like its all the same to me  the waiter turned with an impassive face to robinson  you can bring me some of that cold porridge too he said with a defiant look at jones yesterdays if you have it and a few potato peelings and a glass of skim milk  there was a pause jones sat back in his chair and looked hard across at robinson for some moments the two men gazed into each others eyes with a stern defiant intensity then robinson turned slowly round in his seat and beckoned to the waiter who was moving off with the muttered order on his lips  here waiter he said with a savage scowl i guess ill change that order a little instead of that cold porridge ill takeum yesa little hot partridge and you might as well bring me an oyster or two on the half shell and a mouthful of soup mockturtle consomme anything and perhaps you might fetch along a dab of fish and a little peck of stilton and a grape or a walnut  the waiter turned to jones  i guess ill take the same he said simply and added and you might bring a quart of champagne at the same time  and nowadays when jones and robinson meet the memory of the tar barrel and the piano box is buried as far out of sight as a home for the blind under a landslide     a model dialogue  in which is shown how the drawingroom juggler may be permanently cured of his card trick  the drawingroom juggler having slyly got hold of the pack of cards at the end of the game of whist says  ever see any card tricks heres rather a good one pick a card  thank you i dont want a card  no

billy who has the bush mania by trade he is a doctor but i do not think that he needs to sleep out of doors in ordinary things his mind appears sound over the tops i of his goldrimmed spectacles as he bends forward to speak to you there gleams nothing but amiability and kindliness like all the rest of us he is or was until he forgot it all an extremely welleducated man  i am aware of no criminal strain in his blood yet billy is in reality hopelessly unbalanced he has the mania of the open woods  worse than that he is haunted with the desire to drag his friends with him into the depths of the bush  whenever we meet he starts to talk about it  not long ago i met him in the club  i wish he said youd let me take you clear away up the gatineau  yes i wish i would i dont think i murmured to myself but i humoured him and said  how do we go billy in a motorcar or by train  no we paddle  and is it upstream all the way  oh yes billy said enthusiastically  and how many days do we paddle all day to get up  six  couldnt we do it in less  yes billy answered feeling that i was entering into the spirit of the thing if we start each morning just before daylight and paddle hard till moonlight we could do it in five days and a half  glorious and are there portages  lots of them  and at each of these do i carry two hundred pounds of stuff up a hill on my back  yes  and will there be a guide a genuine dirtylooking indian guide  yes  and can i sleep next to him  oh yes if you want to  and when we get to the top what is there  well we go over the height of land  oh we do do we and is the height of land all rock and about three hundred yards uphill and do i carry a barrel of flour up it and does it roll down and crush me on the other side look here billy this trip is a great thing but it is too luxurious for me if you will have me paddled up the river in a large iron canoe with an awning carried over the portages in a sedanchair taken across the height of land in a palanquin or a howdah and lowered down the other side in a derrick ill go short of that the thing would be too fattening  billy was discouraged and left me but he has since returned repeatedly to the attack  he offers to take me to the headwaters of the batiscan i am content at the foot  he wants us to go to the sources of the attahwapiscat i dont  he says i ought to see the grand chutes of the kewakasis why should i  i have made billy a counterproposition that we strike through the adirondacks in the train to new york from there portage to atlantic city then to washington carrying our own grub in the diningcar camp there a few days at the willard and then back i to return by train and billy on foot with the outfit  the thing is still unsettled  billy of course is only one of thousands that have got this mania and the autumn is the time when it rages at its worst  every day there move northward trains packed full of lawyers bankers and brokers headed for the bush they are dressed up to look like pirates they wear slouch hats flannel shirts and leather breeches with belts they could afford much better clothes than these but they wont use them i dont know where they get these clothes i think the railroad lends them out they have guns between their knees and big knives at their hips they smoke the worst tobacco they can find and they carry ten gallons of alcohol per man in the baggage car  in the intervals of telling lies to one another they read the railroad pamphlets about hunting this kind of literature is deliberately and fiendishly contrived to infuriate their mania i know all about these pamphlets because i write them i once for instance wrote up from imagination a little place called dog lake at the end of a branch line the place had failed as a settlement and the railroad had decided to turn it into a hunting resort i did the turning i think i did it rather well rechristening the lake and stocking the place with suitable varieties of game the pamphlet ran like this  the limpid waters of lake owatawetness the name according to the old indian legends of the place signifies the mirror of the almighty abound with every known variety of fish near to its surface so close that the angler may reach out his hand and stroke them schools of pike pickerel mackerel doggerel and chickerel jostle one another in the water they rise instantaneously to the bait and swim gratefully ashore holding it in their mouths in the middle depth of the waters of the lake the sardine the lobster the kippered herring the anchovy and other tinned varieties of fish disport themselves with evident gratification while even lower in the pellucid depths the dogfish the hogfish the logfish and the swordfish whirl about in neverending circles  nor is lake owatawetness merely an anglers paradise vast forests of primeval pine slope to the very shores of the lake to which descend great droves of bearsbrown green and bearcolouredwhile as the shades of evening fall the air is loud with the lowing of moose cariboo antelope cantelope muskoxes muskrats and other graminivorous mammalia of the forest these enormous quadrumana generally move off about 1030 pm from which hour until 1145 pm the whole shore is reserved for bison and buffalo  after midnight hunters who so desire it can be chased through the woods for any distance and at any speed they select by jaguars panthers cougars tigers and jackals whose ferocity is reputed to be such that they will tear the breeches off a man with their teeth in their eagerness to sink their fangs in his palpitating flesh hunters attention do not miss such attractions as these  i have seen menquiet reputable wellshaved men reading that pamphlet of mine in the rotundas of hotels with their eyes blazing with excitement i think it is the jaguar attraction that hits them the hardest because i notice them rub themselves sympathetically with their hands while they read  of course you can imagine the effect of this sort of literature on the brains of men fresh from their offices and dressed out as pirates  they just go crazy and stay crazy  just watch them when they get into the bush  notice that welltodo stockbroker crawling about on his stomach in the underbrush with his spectacles shining like giglamps what is he doing he is after a cariboo that isnt there he is stalking it with his stomach of course away down in his heart he knows that the cariboo isnt there and never was but that man read my pamphlet and went crazy he cant help it hes got to stalk something mark him as he crawls along see him crawl through a thimbleberry bush very quietly so that the cariboo wont hear the noise of the prickles going into him then through a bees nest gently and slowly so that the cariboo will not take fright when the bees are stinging him sheer woodcraft yes mark him mark him any way you like go up behind him and paint a blue cross on the seat of his pants as he crawls hell never notice he thinks hes a hunting dog yet this is the man who laughs at his little son of ten for crawling round under the diningroom table with a mat over his shoulders and pretending to be a bear  now see these other men in camp  someone has told themi think i first started the idea in my pamphletthat the thing is to sleep on a pile of hemlock branches i think i told them to listen to the wind sowing you know the word i mean sowing and crooning in the giant pines so there they are upsidedown doubled up on a couch of green spikes that would have killed st sebastian they stare up at the sky with bloodshot restless eyes waiting for the crooning to begin and there isnt a sow in sight  here is another man ragged and with a six days growth of beard frying a piece of bacon on a stick over a little fire now what does he think he is the chef of the waldorf astoria yes he does and whats more he thinks that that miserable bit of bacon cut with a tobacco knife from a chunk of meat that lay six days in the rain is fit to eat whats more hell eat it so will the rest theyre all crazy together  theres another man the lord help him who thinks he has the knack of being a carpenter he is hammering up shelves to a tree till the shelves fall down he thinks he is a wizard yet this is the same man who swore at his wife for asking him to put up a shelf in the back kitchen how the blazes he asked could he nail the damn thing up did she think he was a plumber  after all never mind  provided they are happy up there let them stay  personally i wouldnt mind if they didnt come back and lie about it they get back to the city dead fagged for want of sleep sogged with alcohol bitten brown by the bushflies trampled on by the moose and chased through the brush by bears and skunksand they have the nerve to say that they like it  sometimes i think they do  men are only animals anyway they like to get out into the woods and growl round at night and feel something bite them  only why havent they the imagination to be able to do the same thing with less fuss why not take their coats and collars off in the office and crawl round on the floor and growl at one another it would be just as good     reflections on riding  the writing of this paper has been inspired by a debate recently held at the literary society of my native town on the question resolved that the bicycle is a nobler animal than the horse in order to speak for the negative with proper authority i have spent some weeks in completely addicting myself to the use of the horse i find that the difference between the horse and the bicycle is greater than i had supposed  the horse is entirely covered with hair the bicycle is not entirely covered with hair except the 89 model they are using in idaho  in riding a horse the performer finds that the pedals in which he puts his feet will not allow of a good circular stroke he will observe however that there is a saddle in whichespecially while the horse is trottinghe is expected to seat himself from time to time but it is simpler to ride standing up with the feet in the pedals  there are no handles to a horse but the 1910 model has a string to each side of its face for turning its head when there is anything you want it to see  coasting on a good horse is superb but should be under control i have known a horse to suddenly begin to coast with me about two miles from home coast down the main street of my native town at a terrific rate and finally coast through a plantoon of the salvation army into its livery stable  i cannot honestly deny that it takes a good deal of physical courage to ride a horse this however i have i get it at about forty cents a flask and take it as required  i find that in riding a horse up the long street of a country town it is not well to proceed at a trot it excites unkindly comment it is better to let the horse walk the whole distance this may be made to seem natural by turning half round in the saddle with the hand on the horses back and gazing intently about two miles up the road it then appears that you are the first in of about fourteen men  since learning to ride i have taken to noticing the things that people do on horseback in books some of these i can manage but most of them are entirely beyond me here for instance is a form of equestrian performance that every reader will recognize and for which i have only a despairing admiration  with a hasty gesture of farewell the rider set spurs to his horse and disappeared in a cloud of dust  with a little practice in the matter of adjustment i think i could set spurs to any size of horse but i could never disappear in a cloud of dustat least not with any guarantee of remaining disappeared when the dust cleared away  here however is one that i certainly can do  the bridlerein dropped from lord everards listless hand and with his head bowed upon his bosom he suffered his horse to move at a foots pace up the sombre avenue deep in thought he heeded not the movement of the steed which bore him  that is he looked as if he didnt but in my case lord everard has his eye on the steed pretty closely just the same  this next i am doubtful about  to horse to horse cried the knight and leaped into the saddle  i think i could manage it if it read  to horse cried the knight and snatching a stepladder from the hands of his trusty attendant he rushed into the saddle  as a concluding remark i may mention that my experience of riding has thrown a very interesting sidelight upon a rather puzzling point in history it is recorded of the famous henry the second that he was almost constantly in the saddle and of so restless a disposition that he never sat down even at meals i had hitherto been unable to understand henrys idea about his meals but i think i can appreciate it now     saloonio  a study in shakespearean criticism  they say that young men fresh from college are pretty positive about what they know but from my own experience of life i should say that if you take a comfortable elderly man who hasnt been near a college for about twenty years who has been pretty liberally fed and dined ever since who measures about fifty inches around the circumference and has a complexion like a cranberry by candlelight you will find that there is a degree of absolute certainty about what he thinks he knows that will put any young man to shame i am specially convinced of this from the case of my friend colonel hogshead a portly choleric gentleman who made a fortune in the cattletrade out in wyoming and who in his later days has acquired a chronic idea that the plays of shakespeare are the one subject upon which he is most qualified to speak personally  he came across me the other evening as i was sitting by the fire in the club sittingroom looking over the leaves of the merchant of venice and began to hold forth to me about the book  merchant of venice eh theres a play for you sir theres genius wonderful sir wonderful you take the characters in that play and where will you find anything like them you take antonio take sherlock take saloonio  saloonio colonel i interposed mildly arent you making a mistake theres a bassanio and a salanio in the play but i dont think theres any saloonio is there  for a moment colonel hogsheads eye became misty with doubt but he was not the man to admit himself in error  tut tut young man he said with a frown dont skim through your books in that way no saloonio why of course theres a saloonio  but i tell you colonel i rejoined ive just been reading the play and studying it and i know theres no such character  nonsense sir nonsense said the colonel why he comes in all through dont tell me young man ive read that play myself yes and seen it played too out in wyoming before you were born by fellers sir that could act no saloonio indeed why who is it that is antonios friend all through and wont leave him when bassoonio turns against him who rescues clarissa from sherlock and steals the casket of flesh from the prince of aragon who shouts at the prince of morocco out out you damned candlestick who loads up the jury in the trial scene and fixes the doge no saloonio by gad in my opinion hes the most important character in the play  colonel hogshead i said very firmly there isnt any saloonio and you know it  but the old man had got fairly started on whatever dim recollection had given birth to saloonio the character seemed to grow more and more luminous in the colonels mind and he continued with increasing animation  ill just tell you what saloonio is hes a type shakespeare means him to embody the type of the perfect italian gentleman hes an idea thats what he is hes a symbol hes a unit  meanwhile i had been searching among the leaves of the play look here i said heres the list of the dramatis personae theres no saloonio there  but this didnt dismay the colonel one atom why of course there isnt he said you dont suppose youd find saloonio there thats the whole art of it thats shakespeare thats the whole gist of it hes kept clean out of the personaegives him scope gives him a free hand makes him more of a type than ever oh its a subtle thing sir the dramatic art continued the colonel subsiding into quiet reflection it takes a feller quite a time to get right into shakespeares mind and see what hes at all the time  i began to see that there was no use in arguing any further with the old man i left him with the idea that the lapse of a little time would soften his views on saloonio but i had not reckoned on the way in which old men hang on to a thing colonel hogshead quite took up saloonio from that time on saloonio became the theme of his constant conversation he was never tired of discussing the character of saloonio the wonderful art of the dramatist in creating him saloonios relation to modern life saloonios attitude toward women the ethical significance of saloonio saloonio as compared with hamlet hamlet as compared with saloonioand so on endlessly and the more he looked into saloonio the more he saw in him  saloonio seemed inexhaustible there were new sides to himnew phases at every turn the colonel even read over the play and finding no mention of saloonios name in it he swore that the books were not the same books they had had out in wyoming that the whole part had been cut clean out to suit the book to the infernal public schools saloonios language beingat any rate as the colonel quoted itundoubtedly a trifle free then the colonel took to annotating his book at the side with such remarks as enter saloonio or a tucket sounds enter saloonio on the arm of the prince of morocco when there was no reasonable excuse for bringing saloonio on the stage the colonel swore that he was concealed behind the arras or feasting within with the doge  but he got satisfaction at last he had found that there was nobody in our part of the country who knew how to put a play of shakespeare on the stage and took a trip to new york to see sir henry irving and miss terry do the play the colonel sat and listened all through with his face just beaming with satisfaction and when the curtain fell at the close of irvings grand presentation of the play he stood up in his seat and cheered and yelled to his friends thats it thats him didnt you see that man that came on the stage all the time and sort of put the whole play through though you couldnt understand a word he said well thats him thats saloonio     halfhours with the poets  imr wordsworth and the little cottage girl     i met a little cottage girl    she was eight years old she said    her hair was thick with many a curl    that clustered round her head     wordsworth  this is what really happened  over the dreary downs of his native cumberland the aged laureate was wandering with bowed head and countenance of sorrow  times were bad with the old man  in the south pocket of his trousers as he set his face to the north jingled but a few odd coins and a cheque for st leon water apparently his cup of bitterness was full  in the distance a child moveda child in form yet the deep lines upon her face bespoke a countenance prematurely old  the poet espied pursued and overtook the infant he observed that apparently she drew her breath lightly and felt her life in every limb and that presumably her acquaintance with death was of the most superficial character  i must sit awhile and ponder on that child murmured the poet so he knocked her down with his walkingstick and seating himself upon her he pondered  long he sat thus in thought his heart is heavy sighed the child  at length he drew forth a notebook and pencil and prepared to write upon his knee now then my dear young friend he said addressing the elfin creature i want those lines upon your face are you seven  yes we are seven said the girl sadly and added i know what you want you are going to question me about my afflicted family you are mr wordsworth and you are collecting mortuary statistics for the cottagers edition of the penny encyclopaedia  you are eight years old asked the bard  i suppose so answered she i have been eight years old for years and years  and you know nothing of death of course said the poet cheerfully  how can i answered the child  now then resumed the venerable william let us get to business name your brothers and sisters  let me see began the child wearily there was rube and ike two i cant think of and john and jane  you must not count john and jane interrupted the bard reprovingly theyre dead you know so that doesnt make seven  i wasnt counting them but perhaps i added up wrongly said the child and will you please move your overshoe off my neck  pardon said the old man a nervous trick i have been absorbed indeed the exigency of the metre almost demands my doubling up my feet to continue however which died first  the first to go was little jane said the child  she lay moaning in bed i presume  in bed she moaning lay  what killed her  insomnia answered the girl the gaiety of our cottage life previous to the departure of our elder brothers for conway and the constant fieldsports in which she indulged with john proved too much for a frame never too robust  you express yourself well said the poet now in regard to your unfortunate brother what was the effect upon him in the following winter of the ground being white with snow and your being able to run and slide  my brother john was forced to go answered she we have been at a loss to understand the cause of his death we fear that the dazzling glare of the newly fallen snow acting upon a restless brain may have led him to a fatal attempt to emulate my own feats upon the ice and oh sir the child went on speak gently of poor jane you may rub it into john all you like we always let him slide  very well said the bard and allow me in conclusion one rather delicate question do you ever take your little porringer  oh yes answered the child frankly     quite often after sunset    when all is light and fair    i take my little porringer  i cant quite remember what i do after that but i know that i like it  that is immaterial said wordsworth i can say that you take your little porringer neat or with bitters or in water after every meal as long as i can state that you take a little porringer regularly but never to excess the public is satisfied and now rising from his seat i will not detain you any longer here is sixpenceor stay he added hastily here is a cheque for st leon water your information has been most valuable and i shall work it for all i am wordsworth with these words the aged poet bowed deferentially to the child and sauntered off in the direction of the duke of cumberlands arms with his eyes on the ground as if looking for the meanest flower that blows itself   iihow tennyson killed the may queen  if youre waking call me early call me early mother dear   part i  as soon as the childs malady had declared itself the afflicted parents of the may queen telegraphed to tennyson our child gone crazy on subject of early rising could you come and write some poetry about her  alfred always prompt to fill orders in writing from the country came down on the evening train the old cottager greeted the poet warmly and began at once to speak of the state of his unfortunate daughter  she was took queer in may he said along of a sort of bee that the young folks had she aint been just right since happen you might do summat  with these words he opened the door of an inner room  the girl lay in feverish slumber beside her bed was an alarmclock set for halfpast three connected with the clock was an ingenious arrangement of a falling brick with a string attached to the childs toe  at the entrance of the visitor she started up in bed whoop she yelled i am to be queen of the may mother yee  then perceiving tennyson in the doorway if thats a caller she said tell him to call me early  the shock caused the brick to fall in the subsequent confusion alfred modestly withdrew to the sittingroom  at this rate he chuckled i shall not have long to wait a few weeks of that strain will finish her   part ii  six months had passed  it was now midwinter  and still the girl lived her vitality appeared inexhaustible  she got up earlier and earlier she now rose yesterday afternoon  at intervals she seemed almost sane and spoke in a most pathetic manner of her grave and the probability of the sun shining on it early in the morning and her mother walking on it later in the day at other times her malady would seize her and she would snatch the brick off the string and throw it fiercely at tennyson once in an uncontrollable fit of madness she gave her sister effie a halfshare in her garden tools and an interest in a box of mignonette  the poet stayed doggedly on in the chill of the morning twilight he broke the ice in his waterbasin and cursed the girl but he felt that he had broken the ice and he stayed  on the whole life at the cottage though rugged was not cheerless in the long winter evenings they would gather around a smoking fire of peat while tennyson read aloud the idylls of the king to the rude old cottager not to show his rudeness the old man kept awake by sitting on a tintack this also kept his mind on the right tack the two found that they had much in common especially the old cottager they called each other alfred and hezekiah now   part iii  time moved on and spring came  still the girl baffled the poet  i thought to pass away before she would say with a mocking grin but yet alive i am alfred alive i am  tennyson was fast losing hope  worn out with early rising they engaged a retired pullmancar porter to take up his quarters and being a negro his presence added a touch of colour to their life  the poet also engaged a neighbouring divine at fifty cents an evening to read to the child the best hundred books with explanations the may queen tolerated him and used to like to play with his silver hair but protested that he was prosy  at the end of his resources the poet resolved upon desperate measures  he chose an evening when the cottager and his wife were out at a dinnerparty  at nightfall tennyson and his accomplices entered the girls room  she defended herself savagely with her brick but was overpowered  the negro seated himself upon her chest while the clergyman hastily read a few verses about the comfort of early rising at the last day  as he concluded the poet drove his pen into her eye  last call cried the negro porter triumphantly   iiiold mr longfellow on board the hesperus    it was the schooner hesperus that sailed the wintry sea   and the skipper had taken his little daughter to bear         him companylongfellow  there were but three people in the cabin party of the hesperus old mr longfellow the skipper and the skippers daughter  the skipper was much attached to the child owing to the singular whiteness of her skin and the exceptionally limpid blue of her eyes she had hitherto remained on shore to fill lucrative engagements as albino lady in a circus  this time however her father had taken her with him for company the girl was an endless source of amusement to the skipper and the crew she constantly got up games of pussinthecorner forfeits and dumb crambo with her father and mr longfellow and made scripture puzzles and geographical acrostics for the men  old mr longfellow was taking the voyage to restore his shattered nerves from the first the captain disliked henry he was utterly unused to the sea and was nervous and fidgety in the extreme he complained that at sea his genius had not a sufficient degree of latitude which was unparalleled presumption  on the evening of the storm there had been a little jar between longfellow and the captain at dinner the captain had emptied it several times and was consequently in a reckless quarrelsome humour  i confess i feel somewhat apprehensive said old henry nervously of the state of the weather i have had some conversation about it with an old gentleman on deck who professed to have sailed the spanish main he says you ought to put into yonder port  i have hiccoughed the skipper eyeing the bottle and added with a brutal laugh that he could weather the roughest gale that ever wind did blow a whole gaelic society he said wouldnt fizz on him  draining a final glass of grog he rose from his chair said grace and staggered on deck  all the time the wind blew colder and louder  the billows frothed like yeast it was a yeast wind  the evening wore on  old henry shuffled about the cabin in nervous misery  the skippers daughter sat quietly at the table selecting verses from a biblical clock to amuse the ships bosun who was suffering from toothache  at about ten longfellow went to his bunk requesting the girl to remain up in his cabin  for half an hour all was quiet save the roaring of the winter wind  then the girl heard the old gentleman start up in bed  whats that bell whats that bell he gasped  a minute later he emerged from his cabin wearing a cork jacket and trousers over his pyjamas  sissy he said go up and ask your pop who rang that bell  the obedient child returned  please mr longfellow she said pa says there werent no bell  the old man sank into a chair and remained with his head buried in his hands  say he exclaimed presently someones firing guns and theres a glimmering light somewhere youd better go upstairs again  again the child returned  the crew are guessing at an acrostic and occasionally they get a glimmering of it  meantime the fury of the storm increased  the skipper had the hatches battered down  presently longfellow put his head out of a porthole and called out look here you may not care but the cruel rocks are goring the sides of this boat like the horns of an angry bull  the brutal skipper heaved the log at him a knot in it struck a plank and it glanced off  too frightened to remain below the poet raised one of the hatches by picking out the cotton batting and made his way on deck he crawled to the wheelhouse  the skipper stood lashed to the helm all stiff and stark he bowed stiffly to the poet the lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow on his fixed and glassy eyes the man was hopelessly intoxicated  all the crew had disappeared when the missile thrown by the captain had glanced off into the sea they glanced after it and were lost  at this moment the final crash came  something hit something there was an awful click followed by a peculiar grating sound and in less time than it takes to write it unfortunately the whole wreck was over  as the vessel sank longfellows senses left him when he reopened his eyes he was in his own bed at home and the editor of his local paper was bending over him  you have made a firstrate poem of it mr longfellow he was saying unbending somewhat as he spoke and i am very happy to give you our cheque for a dollar and a quarter for it  your kindness checks my utterance murmured henry feebly very feebly     a b and c  the human element in mathematics  the student of arithmetic who has mastered the first four rules of his art and successfully striven with money sums and fractions finds himself confronted by an unbroken expanse of questions known as problems these are short stories of adventure and industry with the end omitted and though betraying a strong family resemblance are not without a certain element of romance  the characters in the plot of a problem are three people called a b and c the form of the question is generally of this sort  a b and c do a certain piece of work a can do as much work in one hour as b in two or c in four find how long they work at it  or thus  a b and c are employed to dig a ditch a can dig as much in one hour as b can dig in two and b can dig twice as fast as c find how long etc etc  or after this wise  a lays a wager that he can walk faster than b or c a can walk half as fast again as b and c is only an indifferent walker find how far and so forth  the occupations of a b and c are many and varied in the older arithmetics they contented themselves with doing a certain piece of work this statement of the case however was found too sly and mysterious or possibly lacking in romantic charm it became the fashion to define the job more clearly and to set them at walking matches ditchdigging regattas and piling cord wood at times they became commercial and entered into partnership having with their old mystery a certain capital above all they revel in motion when they tire of walkingmatchesa rides on horseback or borrows a bicycle and competes with his weakerminded associates on foot now they race on locomotives now they row or again they become historical and engage stagecoaches or at times they are aquatic and swim if their occupation is actual work they prefer to pump water into cisterns two of which leak through holes in the bottom and one of which is watertight a of course has the good one he also takes the bicycle and the best locomotive and the right of swimming with the current whatever they do they put money on it being all three sports a always wins  in the early chapters of the arithmetic their identity is concealed under the names john william and henry and they wrangle over the division of marbles in algebra they are often called x y z but these are only their christian names and they are really the same people  now to one who has followed the history of these men through countless pages of problems watched them in their leisure hours dallying with cord wood and seen their panting sides heave in the full frenzy of filling a cistern with a leak in it they become something more than mere symbols they appear as creatures of flesh and blood living men with their own passions ambitions and aspirations like the rest of us let us view them in turn a is a fullblooded blustering fellow of energetic temperament hotheaded and strongwilled it is he who proposes everything challenges b to work makes the bets and bends the others to his will he is a man of great physical strength and phenomenal endurance he has been known to walk fortyeight hours at a stretch and to pump ninetysix his life is arduous and full of peril a mistake in the working of a sum may keep him digging a fortnight without sleep a repeating decimal in the answer might kill him  b is a quiet easygoing fellow afraid of a and bullied by him but very gentle and brotherly to little c the weakling he is quite in as power having lost all his money in bets  poor c is an undersized frail man with a plaintive face constant walking digging and pumping has broken his health and ruined his nervous system his joyless life has driven him to drink and smoke more than is good for him and his hand often shakes as he digs ditches he has not the strength to work as the others can in fact as hamlin smith has said a can do more work in one hour than c in four  the first time that ever i saw these men was one evening after a regatta they had all been rowing in it and it had transpired that a could row as much in one hour as b in two or c in four b and c had come in dead fagged and c was coughing badly never mind old fellow i heard b say ill fix you up on the sofa and get you some hot tea just then a came blustering in and shouted i say you fellows hamlin smith has shown me three cisterns in his garden and he says we can pump them until tomorrow night i bet i can beat you both come on you can pump in your rowing things you know your cistern leaks a little i think c i heard b growl that it was a dirty shame and that c was used up now but they went and presently i could tell from the sound of the water that a was pumping four times as fast as c  for years after that i used to see them constantly about town and always busy i never heard of any of them eating or sleeping then owing to a long absence from home i lost sight of them on my return i was surprised to no longer find a b and c at their accustomed tasks on inquiry i heard that work in this line was now done by n m and o and that some people were employing for algebraica jobs four foreigners called alpha beta gamma and delta  now it chanced one day that i stumbled upon old d in the little garden in front of his cottage hoeing in the sun d is an aged labouring man who used occasionally to be called in to help a b and c did i know em sir he answered why i knowed em ever since they was little fellows in brackets master a he were a fine lad sir though i always said give me master b for kindheartednesslike manys the job as weve been on together sir though i never did no racing nor aught of that but just the plain labour as you might say im getting a bit too old and stiff for it nowadays sirjust scratch about in the garden here and grow a bit of a logarithm or raise a common denominator or two but mr euclid he use me still for them propositions he do  from the garrulous old man i learned the melancholy end of my former acquaintances soon after i left town he told me c had been taken ill it seems that a and b had been rowing on the river for a wager and c had been running on the bank and then sat in a draught of course the bank had refused the draught and c was taken ill a and b came home and found c lying helpless in bed a shook him roughly and said get up c were going to pile wood c looked so worn and pitiful that b said look here a i wont stand this he isnt fit to pile wood tonight c smiled feebly and said perhaps i might pile a little if i sat up in bed then b thoroughly alarmed said see here a im going to fetch a doctor hes dying a flared up and answered youve no money to fetch a doctor ill reduce him to his lowest terms b said firmly thatll fetch him cs life might even then have been saved but they made a mistake about the medicine it stood at the head of the bed on a bracket and the nurse accidentally removed it from the bracket without changing the sign after the fatal blunder c seems to have sunk rapidly on the evening of the next day as the shadows deepened in the little room it was clear to all that the end was near i think that even a was affected at the last as he stood with bowed head aimlessly offering to bet with the doctor on cs laboured breathing a whispered c i think im going fast how fast do you think youll go old man murmured a i dont know said c but im going at any ratethe end came soon after that c rallied for a moment and asked for a certain piece of work that he had left downstairs a put it in his arms and he expired as his soul sped heavenward a watched its flight with melancholy admiration b burst into a passionate flood of tears and sobbed put away his little cistern and the rowing clothes he used to wear i feel as if i could hardly ever dig againthe funeral was plain and unostentatious it differed in nothing from the ordinary except that out of deference to sporting men and mathematicians a engaged two hearses both vehicles started at the same time b driving the one which bore the sable parallelopiped containing the last remains of his illfated friend a on the box of the empty hearse generously consented to a handicap of a hundred yards but arrived first at the cemetery by driving four times as fast as b find the distance to the cemetery as the sarcophagus was lowered the grave was surrounded by the broken figures of the first book of euclidit was noticed that after the death of c a became a changed man he lost interest in racing with b and dug but languidly he finally gave up his work and settled down to live on the interest of his betsb never recovered from the shock of cs death his grief preyed upon his intellect and it became deranged he grew moody and spoke only in monosyllables his disease became rapidly aggravated and he presently spoke only in words whose spelling was regular and which presented no difficulty to the beginner realizing his precarious condition he voluntarily submitted to be incarcerated in an asylum where he abjured mathematics and devoted himself to writing the history of the swiss family robinson in words of one
