the broad mahogany counter and exchanged greetings with the tall frockcoated reception clerk who came smiling towards me  i should like a single room on the third floor east about the middle corridor i said can you manage that for me 317 i had last time  he shook his head at once i am very sorry mr courage he said but all the rooms in that corridor are engaged we will give you one on the second floor at the same price  i was about to close with his offer when with a word of excuse he hurried away to intercept some one who was passing through the hall a junior clerk took his place and consulted the plan for a moment doubtfully  there are several rooms exactly in the locality you asked for he remarked which are simply being held over if you would prefer 317 you can have it and i will give 217 to our other client  thank you i answered i should prefer 317 if you can manage it  he scribbled the number upon a ticket and handed it to the porter who stood behind with my dressingcase a page caught up the key and i followed them to the lift in the light of things which happened afterwards i have sometimes wondered what became of the unfortunate junior clerk who gave me room number 317                                       it was six oclock when i arrived at the hotel universal i washed changed my clothes and was shaved in the barbers shop afterwards i spent i think the ordinary countrymans evening about townhaving some regard always to the purpose of my visit i dined at my club went on to the empire with a couple of friends supped at the savoy and after a brief return visit to the club a single game of billiards and a final whisky and soda returned to my hotel contented and sleepy and quite prepared to tumble into bed by some chancethe history of nations as my own did will sometimes turn upon such slight eventsi left my door ajar whilst i sat upon the edge of the bed finishing a cigarette and treeing my boots preparatory to depositing them outside suddenly my attention was arrested by a somewhat curious sound i distinctly heard the swift stealthy footsteps of a man running at full speed along the corridor i leaned forward to listen then without a moments warning they paused outside my door it was hastily pushed open and as hastily closed a man half clothed and panting was standing facing mea strange pitiable object the boots slipped from my fingers i stared at him in blank bewilderment  what the devil i began  he made an anguished appeal to me for silence then i heard other footsteps in the corridor pausing outside my closed door there was a moments silence then a soft muffled knocking i moved towards it only to be met by the intruders frenzied whisper  for gods sake keep quiet  the mans hot breath scorched my cheek his hands gripped my arm with nervous force his hysterical whisper was barely audible although his lips were within a few inches of my ear  keep quiet he muttered and dont open the door  why not i asked  they will kill me he answered simply  i resumed my seat on the side of the bed my sensations were a little confused under ordinary circumstances i should probably have been angry it was impossible however to persevere in such a sentiment towards the abject creature who cowered by my side  yet after all was he abject i looked away from the door and for the second time studied carefully the features of the man who had sought my protection in so extraordinary a manner he was clean shaven his features were good his face under ordinary circumstances might have been described as almost prepossessing just now it was whitened and distorted by fear to such an extent that it gave to his expression a perfectly repulsive cast it was as though he looked beyond death and saw things however dimly more terrible than human understanding can fitly grapple with there were subtleties of horror in his glassy eyes in his drawn and haggard features  nothing perhaps could more completely illustrate the effect his words and appearance had upon me than the fact that i accepted his extraordinary statement without any instinct of disbelief here was i an englishman of sound nerves of average courage and certainly untroubled with any superabundance of imagination domiciled in a perfectly wellknown if somewhat cosmopolitan london hotel and yet willing to believe on the statement of a person whom i had never seen before in my life that within a few yards of me were unseen men bent upon murder  from outside i heard a warning chink of metal and acting upon impulse i stepped forward and slipped the bolt of my door immediately afterwards a key was softly inserted in the lock and turned the door strained against the bolt from some invisible pressure then there came the sound of retreating footsteps we heard the door of the next room opened and closed a moment later the handle of the communicating door was tried i had however bolted it before i commenced to undress  what the mischief are you about i cried angrily cant you leave my room alone  no answer but the panels of the communicating door were bent inwards until it seemed as though they must burst i crossed the room to where my portmanteau stood upon a luggagerack and took from it a small revolver when i stood up with it in my hand the effect upon my visitor was almost magical he caught at my wrist and wrested it from my fingers he grasped it almost lovingly  i can at least die now like a man he muttered thank heaven for this  i sat down again upon the bed i looked at the pillow and the unturned coverlet doubtfully they had obviously not been disturbed i glanced at my watch it was barely two oclock i had not even been to bed i could not possibly be dreaming the door was straining now almost to bursting i began to be annoyed  what the devil are you doing there i called out  again there was no answer but a long crack had appeared on the panel my companion was standing up watching it he grasped the revolver as one accustomed to the use of such things once more i took note of him  i saw now that he was younger than i had imagined and a trifle taller the ghastly pallor which extended even to his lips was unabated but his first paroxysm of fear seemed at any rate to have become lessened he looked now like a man at bay indeed but prepared to fight for his life he had evidently been dressed for the evening for his white tie was still hanging about his neck coat and waistcoat he had left behind in his flight but his black trousers were well and fashionably cut and his socks were of silk with small colored clocks the fingers were white and delicate and his nails well cared for there was one thing more the most noticeable of all perhaps although his face was the face of a young man his hair was as white as snow  look here i said to him cant you give me some explanation as to what all this means you havent been getting yourself into trouble have you  trouble he repeated vaguely with his eyes fixed upon the door  with the police i explained  no these are not the police he answered  i dont mind a row particularly i continued but i like to know something about it what do these people want with you  my life he answered grimly  why  i cannot tell you  a sudden and ridiculously obvious idea struck me for the first time a small electric bell and telephone instrument were by the side of the bed i leaned over and pressed the knob with my finger my companion half glanced towards me and back again instantly towards the door  no use he muttered they will not come  whereupon a thoroughly british sentiment was aroused in me of the liberties which had been taken with my room both by this man and by his pursuers i scarcely thought but that any one should presume to interfere with my rights as an hotel guest angered me i kept my finger on the knob of the bell i summoned chambermaid waiter valet and boots it was all to no effect no one came the telephone remained silent the door was on the point of yielding  i abandoned my useless efforts and turned towards the man whom i was sheltering  how many are there in the next room i asked  two  if i stand by you will you obey me  he hesitated for a moment then he nodded  yes  get behind the bed then and give me the revolver  he parted with it reluctantly i took it into my hand only just in time the door at last had burst away from its hinges with perfect selfpossession i saw one of the two men who had been engaged in its demolition calmly lean it up against the wall the other stared at me as though i had been a ghost     chapter ii  a midnight raid   i could see at once that neither of the two men who confronted me had really believed that the room into which their victim had escaped was already occupied by any other person than the one of whom they were in pursuit their expression of surprise was altogether genuine i myself was perhaps equally taken aback nothing in their appearance suggested in the least the midnight assassin i turned towards the one who had leaned the door up against the wall and addressed him  may i ask to what i am indebted for the pleasure of this unexpected visit i inquired  the man took out a handkerchief and mopped his forehead he was short and stout with a bushy brown beard and eyes which blinked at me in amazement from behind his goldrimmed spectacles he wore a grey tweed travelling suit and brown boots he had exactly the air of a prosperous middleclass tradesman from the provinces  i am afraid sir he said that we have made a mistakein which case we shall owe you a thousand apologies we are in search of a friend whom we certainly believed that we had seen enter your room  now all the time he was talking his eyes were never still every inch of my room that was visible they ransacked his companion too was engaged in the same task there were no traces of my visitor to be seen  you can make your apologies and explanations to the management in the morning i answered grimly pardon me  i held out my arm across the threshold and for the first time looked at the other man who had been on the point of entering he was slight and somewhat sallow with very high forehead and small deepset eyes he was dressed in ordinary evening clothes the details of which however betrayed his status he wore a heavy gold chain a dinner coat and a madeup white tie with the ends tucked in under a roll collar he appeared to be objectionable but far from dangerous  you are still a trifle overanxious respecting the interior of my room i remarked pushing him gently back  he spoke to me for the first time he spoke slowly and formally and his accent struck me as being a little foreign  sir he said you may not be aware that the person of whom we are in search is a dangerous an exceedingly dangerous character if he should be concealed in your room the consequences to yourself might be most serious  thank you i said i am quite capable of taking care of myself  both men were standing as close to me as i was disposed to permit i fancied that they were looking me over as though to make an estimate of the possible amount of resistance i might be able to offer should they be disposed to make a rush the odds if any must have seemed to them somewhat in my favor for i was taller by head and shoulders than either of them and a lifelong devotion to athletics had broadened my shoulders and given me strength beyond the average besides there was the revolver in my right hand which i took occasion now to display the shorter of the two men again addressed me  my dear sir he said softly it is necessary that you should not misapprehend the situation the person of whom we are in search is one whom we are pledged to find we have no quarrel with you why embroil yourself in an affair with which you have no concern  i am not seeking to do so i answered it is you and your friend who are the aggressors you have forced an entrance into my room in a most unwarrantable fashion your missing friend is nothing to me i desire to be left in peace  even as i spoke the words i knew that there was to be no peace for me that night for stealthy though their movements were i saw something glisten in the right hands of both of them the odds now assumed a somewhat different appearance i drew back a pace and stood prepared for what might happen my visàvis in the goldrimmed spectacles addressed me again  sir he said we will not bandy words any longer it is better that we understand one another there is a man hidden in your room whom we mean to have you will understand that we are serious when i tell you that we have engaged every room in this corridor and the wires of your telephone are cut if you will permit us to come in and find him i promise that nothing shall happen in your room that you shall not be compromised in any way if you refuse i must warn you that you will become involved in a matter more serious than you have any idea of  for answer i discharged my revolver twice at the ceiling hoping to arouse some one either guests or servants and fired again at the shoulder of the man whose leap towards me was like the spring of a wildcat both rooms were suddenly plunged into darkness the elder of the two men stepping back for a moment had turned out the electric lights for a short space of time everything was chaos my immediate assailant i flung away from me with ease his companion who tried to rush past me in the darkness i struck with a random blow on the side of the head so that he staggered back with a groan i knew very well that neither of them had passed me and yet i fancied as i paused to take breath for a moment that i heard stealthy footsteps behind in the room which i had been defending i called again for help and groped about on the wall for the electric light switches the footsteps ceased a sudden cry rang out from somewhere behind the bedcurtains a cry so full of horror that i felt the blood run cold in my veins and the sweat break out upon my forehead i sought desperately for the little brass knobs of the switches listening all the while for those footsteps i heard nothing save a low sickening groan which followed upon the cry but i felt a moment later the hot breath of a human being upon my neck i sprang aside barely in time to escape a blow obviously aimed at me with some weapon or other which cut through the air with the soft nervous swish of an elastic lifepreserver i knew that some one who sought my life was within a few feet of me striving to make sure before the second blow was aimed in my stockinged feet i crept along by the wall i could hear no sound of movement anywhere near me and yet i knew quite well that my hidden assailant was close at hand just then i heard at last what i had been listening for so long and so eagerly footsteps and a voice in the corridor outside somebody sprang past me in the darkness and for a second amazement kept me motionless the thing was impossible or i could have sworn that my feet were brushed by the skirts of a womans gown and that a whiff of perfumeit was like the scent of dying violetsfloated past me then the door of my room from which i had withdrawn the bolt was flung suddenly open and almost simultaneously my fingers touched the knob of the electric light fittings the whole place was flooded with light i looked around half dazed but eager to see what had become of my assailants both rooms were empty or apparently so there was no sign or evidence of any other person there save myself on the threshold of my own apartment was standing the night porter  have you let them go by i called out did you see them in the corridor  who sir the porter asked stolidly  two men who forced their way into my roomlook at the door one was short and stout and wore glasses the other was taller and thin they were here a few seconds ago unless they passed you they are in one of the rooms now  the man came inside and looked around him  i cant see any one sir there wasnt a soul about outside  then we had better look for them i exclaimed be careful for they are armed  there was no one in the adjoining room we had searched it thoroughly before i suddenly remembered the visitor who had been the innocent cause of these exciting moments  by jove i exclaimed theres a wounded man by the side of my bed i quite forgot him i was so anxious to catch these blackguards  the porter looked at me with distinct suspicion  a wounded man sir he remarked where  on the other side of the bed i answered its the man all this row was about  i hurried round to where i had left my terrified visitor hiding behind the bedcurtain there was no one there we looked under the bed even in the wardrobes it was obvious when we had finished our search that not a soul was in either of the rooms except our two selves the porter looked at me and i looked at the porter  its a marvellous thing i declared  it is the porter agreed  you can see for yourself that that door has been battered in i remarked pointing to it  the fellow smiled in such a manner that i should have liked to have kicked him  i can see that it has been battered in he said oh yes i can see that  you perhaps dont believe my story i asked calmly  it isnt my place to believe or disbelieve it he answered i certainly didnt meet any one outsidemuch less three people i shall make my report to the manager in the morning sir good night  so i was left alone and extraordinary as it may seem i was asleep in less than half an hour     chapter iii  miss van hoyt   i was awakened at about nine oclock the next morning by a loud and persistent knocking at the door of my room i sat up in bed and shouted  come in  a waiter entered bearing a note which he handed to me on a salver i looked at him around the room which was still in some confusion and down at the note which was clearly addressed to me j hardross courage esq suddenly my eyes fell upon the smashed door and i remembered at once the events of the previous night i tore open the note it was typewritten and brief  the manager presents his compliments to mr hardross courage and would be obliged if he will arrange to vacate his room by midday the manager further regrets that he is unable to offer mr courage any other accommodation  tell the valet to let me have a bath in five minutes i ordered springing out of bed and bring me some tea look sharp  i was in a furious temper the events of the night before strange though they had been left me comparatively unmoved i was filled however with a thoroughly british indignation at the nature of this note my room had been broken into in the middle of the night i had narrowly escaped being myself the victim of a serious and murderous assault and now i was calmly told to leave the hotel i hastened downstairs and into the office  i wish to see the manager as soon as possible i said to one of the reception clerks behind the counter  certainly sir what name he asked drawing a slip of paper towards him  courage i told him mr hardross courage  the mans manner underwent a distinct change  i am sorry sir he said but mr blumentein is engaged is there anything i can do  no i answered him bluntly i want the manager and no one else will do if he cannot see me now i will wait if he does not appear in a reasonable time i shall go direct to scotland yard and lay certain information before the authorities there  the clerk stared at me and then smiled in a tolerant manner he was short and dark and wore glasses his manner was pleasant enough but he had the air of endeavoring to soothe a fractious childwhich annoyed me  i will send a message down to mr blumentein sir he said but he is very busy this morning  he called a boy but after a moments hesitation he left the office himself i lit a cigarette and waited with as much patience as i could command the people who passed in and out interested me very little suddenly however i gave a start and looked up quickly  a woman had entered the receptionroom passing so close to me that her skirts almost brushed my feet she was tall quietly and elegantly dressed and she was followed by a most correct looking maid who carried a tiny japanese spaniel i did not see her face although i knew by her carriage and figure that she must be young that she was a person of importance it was easy to see by the attention which was at once paid her her interest for me however lay in none of these things i had been conscious as she had passed of a whiff of faint very delicate perfumeand with it of a sudden sharp recollection it was a perfume which i had distinguished but once before in my life and that only a few hours ago  she gave her key in at the desk received some letters and turning round passed within a few feet of me perhaps she realized that i was watching her with more than ordinary attention and her eyes fell for a moment carelessly upon mine they were withdrawn at once and she passed on with the slightest of frownsjust sufficient rebuke to the person who had forgotten himself so far as to stare at a woman in a public place the maid too glanced towards me with a slight flash in her large black eyes as though she also resented my impertinence and the little japanese spaniel yawned as he was carried past and showed me a set of dazzling white teeth i was in disgrace all round because i had looked for a second too long into his mistress deep blue eyes and pale proud face nevertheless i presumed even further i changed my position so that i could see her where she stood in the hall talking to her maid  like a man who looks half unwillingly into the land of hidden things knowing very well that his own doom or joy is there if he has the wit to see and the strength to grasp it so did i deliberately falsify the tenets and obligations of my order and standing half in the hall half in the office i stared at the lady and the maid and the spaniel she was younger even than i had thought her and i felt that there was something foreign in her appearance although of what nationality she might be i could not determine her hair was of a shade between brown and golden and as she stood now with her back to me i could see that it was so thick and abundant that her maids art had been barely sufficient to keep it within bounds in the front it was parted in the middle and came rather low down over her forehead now i could see her profilethe rather long neck which the lace scarf about her shoulders seemed to leave a little more than usually bare the soft and yet firm outline of features delicate enough and yet full of character just then her maid said something which seemed to call her attention to me she half turned her head and looked me full in the face her eyes seemed to narrow a little as though she were shortsighted then she very slowly and very deliberately turned her back upon me and continued talking to her maid my cheeks were tanned enough but i felt the color burn as i prepared to move away at that moment the lift stopped just opposite to her and mr blumentein stepped out followed by his dapper little clerk  mr blumentein was a man of less than medium height with grey hair and beard powerfully built and with a sleek wellgroomed appearance hat in hand and with many bows and smiles he addressed a few remarks to the lady who answered him courteously but with obvious condescension then he came on to me and his manner was very different indeed the dapper little clerk who had pointed me out slipped away  mr courage he inquired you wished to speak to me  i handed him the typewritten communication which i had received  i wish for some explanation of this i said  he glanced at it and shrugged his shoulders i cannot permit such proceedings as took place last night in this hotel he said i can find no trace of the two persons whom you described as having broken into your room and i am not at all satisfied with the explanations which have been given  indeed i answered i can assure you that i find the situation equally unsatisfactory i come here in the ordinary way as a casual guest my room is broken into in the middle of the night i myself am assaulted and another man a stranger to me is nearly murdered if any explanations or apologies are due at all i consider that they are due to me  mr blumentein edged a little away  you should consider yourself exceedingly fortunate he declared to be spared the inconvenience of a police inquiry my directors dislike very much any publicity given to brawls of this sort in the hotel or you might find yourself in a somewhat awkward position i have nothing more to say about it  he would have moved away but i stood directly in front of him  it happens that i have i said i am not a thief or an adventurer and my bonafides are easily established i am a magistrate in two counties sir gilbert hardross who is a patron of your restaurant is my cousin and i expect him here to call for me within half an hour i am up in town to play for my county against the mcc at lords i am a person who is perfectly well known and my word as to what happened last night will be readily accepted if you do not alter your tone at once i shall take a cab to scotland yard and insist upon a complete investigation into the affairs of last night  there was no doubt as to the effect of my words upon mr blumentein he was seriously perturbed and wholly unable to conceal it  you can prove what you say mr courage i suppose he remarked hesitatingly  absolutely i answered look in this weeks graphic you will see a photograph of me in the medchestershire cricket team come into my room and i will show you as many letters and papers as you please do you know that gentleman  certainly mr blumentein answered bowing low good morning sir charles  a young man in a flannel suit and straw hat sauntered up to us he nodded condescendingly to the hotel manager and shook hands with me  how are you courage he said im coming down to lords this afternoon to see the match  he passed on mr blumentein was distinctly nervous  will you do me the favor to come down to my room for a moment mr courage he begged i should like to speak to you in private  i followed him down into his office he closed the door and set his hat down upon the desk  i have caused the strictest inquiries to be made and i have been unable to obtain the slightest trace either of the man whom you say took shelter in your room or the two others you spoke of under those circumstances you will understand that your story did not sound very probable  perhaps not i admitted but i dont know what your nightporter could have been about if he really saw nothing of them i can give you a detailed description of all three if you like  one moment mr blumentein said taking up pen and paper now if you please  i described the three men to the best of my ability and mr blumentein took down carefully all that i said  i will have the fullest inquiries made he promised and let you know the result in the meantime i trust that you will consider the letter i wrote you this morning unwritten you will doubtless prefer to leave the hotel after what has happened but another time i trust that we may be honored by your patronage  i hesitated for a moment it was clear that the man wanted to get rid of me for the first time the idea of remaining in the hotel occurred to me  i will consider the matter i answered in the meantime i hope you will have inquiries made at once the man who took refuge in my room was in a terrible state of fright and from what i saw of the other two i am afraid you may find this a more serious affair than you have any idea of by the bye one of the two told me that they had engaged every room in that corridor you may be able to trace him by that  mr blumentein shrugged his shoulders  that statement at any rate was a false one he said all the rooms in the vicinity of yours were occupied by regular customers  now in all probability if mr blumentein had looked  me in the face when he made this last statement i should have left the hotel within half an hour or so for good and the whole episode so far as i was concerned would have been ended but i could not help noticing a somewhat unaccountable nervousness in the mans manner and it flashed into my mind suddenly that he knew a good deal more than he meant to tell me he was keeping something back the more i watched him the more i felt certain of it i determined not to leave the hotel  well i said we will look upon the whole affair last night as a misunderstanding i will keep on my room for tonight at any rate i shall be having some friends to dine in the restaurant  the mans face expressed anything but pleasure  just as you like mr courage he said of course if under the circumstances you preferred to leave us we should quite understand it  i shall stay for tonight at any rate i answered i am only up for a day or two  he walked with me to the door i hesitated for a moment and then asked him the question which had been in my mind for some time  by the bye mr blumentein i said if it is a permissible question may i ask the name of the young lady with whom you were talking in the hall just nowa young lady with a french maid and a japanese spaniel  mr blumentein was perceptibly paler his eyes were full of suspicion almost fear  why do you ask me that he inquired sharply  out of curiosity i am afraid i answered readily i am sorry if i have been indiscreet  the man made an effort to recover his composure i could see though that for some reason my question had disquieted him  the ladys name is miss van hoyt he said slowly i believe that she is of a very wellknown american family she came here with excellent recommendations but beyond her name i really know very little about her nothing more i can do for you mr courage  nothing at all thank you i answered moving towards the door  they have just telephoned down to say that a gentleman has called for yousir gilbert hardross i believe  i nodded and glanced at the clock  thanks i said i must hurry  i will reserve a table for you in the restaurant tonight sir mr blumentein said bowing me out  for three at eight oclock i answered     chapter iv  a match at lords   my cousin gilbert hardross was eight years older than i and of intensely serious proclivities he was i believe a very useful member of the house and absolutely conscientious in the discharge of what he termed his duty to his constituents we drove down together to lords and knowing him to be a person almost entirely devoid of imagination i forbore to make any mention of the events of the previous night one question however i did ask him  what sort of an hotel is the universal supposed to be gilbert rather a queer lot of people staying there i thought  my cousin implied by a gesture that he was not surprised  very cosmopolitan indeed he declared it is patronized chiefly i believe by a certain class of americans and gentlemen of the sporting persuasion the restaurant of course is good and a few notabilities stay there now and then i should have thought the carlton would have suited you better  i changed the subject  how are politics i asked  he looked at me as though in reproach at the levity of my question  you read the papers i suppose he remarked you know for yourself that we are passing through a very critical time never he added since i have been in the house have i known such a period of anxiety  considering that gilbert represented a rural constituency and that his party was not even in office i felt inclined to smile however i took him seriously  same old war scare i suppose i remarked  it has been a scare for a good many years he replied seriously people seem inclined to forget that behind the shadow all the time there is the substance i happen to know that there is a great deal of tension just now at the foreign office  things seem pretty much as they were six months ago i remarked there is no definite cause for alarm is there  no definite cause perhaps that we know of my cousin answered but there is no denying the fact that an extraordinary amount of apprehension exists in the best informed circles as lord kestelen said to me yesterday one seems to feel the thunder in the air  i was thoughtful for a moment perhaps after all i was inclined to envy my cousin my own life was a simple and wholesome one enough but it was far removed indeed from the world of great happenings just then i felt the first premonitions of dissatisfaction  i believe im sorry after all that i didnt go in for a career of some sort i remarked  my cousin looked gratified he accepted my regret as a tribute to his own larger place in the world  in some respects he admitted it is regrettable yet you must remember that you are practically the head of the family i have the title but you have the estates and the money you should find plenty to do  i nodded  naturally that isnt exactly what i meant though here we are and by jove im late  my cousin cared for cricket no more than for any other sports but because he represented medchestershire he made a point of coming to see his county play he took up a prominent position in the pavilion enclosure and requested me to inform the local reporters who had come up from medchester of his presence i changed into my flannels quickly and was just in time to go out into the field with the rest of the team  the mornings cricket was not particularly exciting and i had hard work to keep my thoughts fixed upon the game our bowling was knocked about rather severely but wickets fell with reasonable frequency it was just before luncheon time that the most surprising event of the day happened to me the captain of the mcc who had just made his fifty drove a full pitch hard towards the boundary on the edge of which i was fielding by fast sprinting and a lot of luck i brought off the catch and amidst the applause from the pavilion within a few feet of me i heard my cousins somewhat patronizing congratulations  fine catch jim very fine catch indeed  i glanced round and stood for a moment upon the cinderpath as though turned to stone my cousin who had changed his seat was smiling kindly upon me a few yards away and by his side talking to him was a young lady with goldenbrown hair a french maid dressed in black and a japanese spaniel her eyes met mine without any shadow of recognition she looked upon me from her raised seat as though i were a performer in some comedy being played for her amusement in which she found it hard however to take any real interest i went back to my place in the field without any clear idea of whether i was upon my head or my heels and my fielding for the rest of the time was purely mechanical  in about half an hour the luncheon bell rang i made straight for my cousins seat and to my intense relief saw that neither of them had as yet quitted their places gilbert seemed somewhat surprised to see me  well he remarked you havent done so badly after all five wickets for 120 isnt it you ought to get them out by four oclock  he hesitated i glanced towards his companion and he had no alternative  miss van hoyt he said will you allow me to introduce my cousin mr hardross courage  she bowed a little absently  are you interested in cricket miss van hoyt i asked inanely  not in the least she answered i have a list somewherein my purse i thinkof english institutions which must be studied before one can understand your countrypeople cricket i believe is second on the list your cousin was kind enough to tell me about this match and how to get here  we are staying at the same hotel i think i remarked  very likely she answered i am only in london for a short time is the cricket over for the day now  i hastened to explain the luncheon arrangements she rose at once  then we will go she said turning to her maid and addressing her in french janette we depart  the maid rose with suspicious alacrity the spaniel yawned and looked at me out of the corner of his black eye i believe that he recognized me  dare i ask you to honor us by lunching with my cousin and myself here miss van hoyt i asked eagerly  she smiled very slightly but the curve of her lips was delightful  and see more cricket she asked no i think notmany thanks all the same  i will put you in a hansom my cousin said turning towards her and ignoring me  she looked over her shoulder and nodded the maid looked at me out of her great black eyes as though daring me to follow them and was it my fancy or did that little morsel of canine absurdity really show me its white teeth on purpose anyhow they strolled away and left me there i waited for gilbert  he reappeared in about five minutes with a hateful smirk upon his wellcut but somewhat pasty features i laid my hand upon his arm  where did you meet her gilbert i asked who is she where does she come from how long have you known her  gently my dear fellow he answered calmly i met her at lady tredwells about a fortnight ago i really know very little about her except that she seems a charming young lady  where does she come from i askedwhat country i mean she speaks like a foreigner  oh shes american of course he told mea young american lady of fortune i believe  american i repeated vaguely are you sure  perfectly he answered  any relatives here i asked  none that i know of he admitted  any connection with the stage  certainly not i told you that i met her at lady tredwells  we walked into the luncheon room in silence presently my cousin showed signs of irritation  what the mischief are you so glum about he asked  i looked up  i am not glum i answered i was just thinking that the hotel universal seemed rather a queer place for a young lady with a french maid a japanese spaniel andno chaperon  you are an ass my cousin declared                                       it was not until the evening that gilbert unbent when however he studied the menu of the dinner which i had ordered for his delectation and learned that i had invited his particular friend lord kestelen to meet him he invited me to descend below to the american bar and take a cocktail while we waited for our guest  by the bye jim he remarked slipping his arm through mine i thought that miss van hoyt was particularly inquisitive about you this morning  in what way i asked at once interested  she wanted to know what you didhow you spent your time when i told her that you had no profession that you did nothing except play cricket and polo and hunt and shoot she seemed most unaccountably surprised she appeared almost incredulous when i told her that you seldom came to london and still more seldom went abroad i wonder what she had in her head  i have no idea i answered thoughtfully i suppose it was only ordinary curiosity in america all the men do something  that must be so no doubt my cousin admitted but it didnt sound like it i wonder whether we shall see her this evening  i did not wonder at all it seemed to me that i knew     chapter v  on the terrace   it was not until after my guests had departed and i had almost given up hope that i caught sight of her she was seated at a table in the writingroom and was in the act of sealing a letter she looked up as i entered and after a seconds hesitation bowed coldly i summoned up all my pluck however and approached her  good evening miss van hoyt i said  good evening mr courage she answered proceeding to stamp her envelope  have you been to the theatre i asked  not this evening she replied i have been to a meeting  a meeting i repeated that sounds interesting  i doubt whether you would have found it so she answered dryly  her manner without being absolutely repellent was far from encouraging i found myself in the embarrassing position of having nothing left to say i gave up all attempt at conversational philandering  may i talk to you for a few minutes miss van hoyt i asked  she raised her head and looked at me meditatively her eyes were the color of early violets but they were also very serious and very steady she appeared to be deliberately taking stock of me but i could not flatter myself that there was anything of personal interest in her regard  yes she answered at last for a few minutes not here though go through the drawingroom on to the terrace and wait for me there dont go at once go downstairs and have a drink or something first  i could see her looking through the glass doors and divining her wishes i turned away at once mr blumentein was standing there looking upon us his smile was almost ghastly in its attempted cordiality he took off his hat as i passed and we exchanged some commonplace remark i went downstairs and strolled up and down the minutes passed ridiculously slowly i looked at my watch a dozen times at last i decided that i had waited long enough i ascended the stairs and made my way through the drawingroom on to the terrace the place was deserted but i had scarcely walked to the farther end before i heard the soft trailing of a womans skirt close at hand i looked up eagerly and she stepped out from the drawingroom for a moment she hesitated i remained motionless i could do nothing but look at her she wore a black evening dressnet i think it was with deep flounces of lace her neck and arms were dazzlingly white in the half light her lips were a little parted as she stood and listened her whole expression was natural almost childlike suddenly she dropped the curtain and came swiftly towards me  well she said softly now that i am here what have you to say to me  i was horribly tempted to say things which must have sounded unutterably foolish with an effort i restrained myself i addressed her almost coldly  miss van hoyt i said i want to know whether you are the only woman in this hotel who usesthat perfume  she took out her handkerchief a little whiff of faint fragrance came floating out from its crumpled lace  you recognize it  yes  so much the better she declared let me tell you this at once i have not come here to answer questions i have come to ask them are you content  i am contentso long as you are here i murmured  the man whom you protected last nightwhose life you probably savedon your honor was he a stranger to you  on my honor he was i answered gravely  you have never seen him before  to my knowledgeno  you have never spoken to him before  never  she drew a little sigh  your defence of him then she said was simply accidental  entirely i answered  has he communicated with you since  not in any way i assured her  she drew a little away from me her eyes were still fixed eagerly upon my face  are you inclined to believe in meto believe what i say she asked  absolutely i answered  then listen to me now she said that man never mind his name is one of natures criminals he is a traitor a renegade a malefactor he has sinned against every law he has written his own deathwarrant he deserves to die he will die that is a certain thing he would have been dead before now but for me do you know why i have made them spare his life  no i answered who are they and who is to be his executioner surely if he is all that you say there are laws under whose ban he must have come it is not safe to talk like this of life and death here all those things are arranged nowadays in the courts  she smiled at me scornfully  never mind that she said you speak now of things which you do not understand i want to tell you why i would not let them kill him  well  it is because if he is killed the secret goes with him never mind how he came by it or who he is it is sufficient for you to know that he has it up to now he has resisted even torture you remember the color of his hair it went like that in a night but he held out now he knows that he is going to die and he is seeking for some one to whom he may pass it on  what is this secret then i asked perplexed  dont be absurd she answered if i knew it should i be likely to tell it to you i have an idea of the nature of it of course but that is not enough  butwho is he then i asked how came he to obtain possession of it  now you are asking questions she reminded me believe me you are safer very much safer knowing nothing if i were your friend  she hesitated all the time her eyes were fixed upon me she seemed to be trying to read the thoughts which were passing through my brain  if you were my friend i repeatedwell  i would give you some excellent advice she said slowly  i am ready to take it i declared  on trust  i believe so i answered at least you might give me the chance she sank down upon the settee at the extreme end of the terrace there was little chance here of being overheard as we had a clear view of the only approach  after all she said i do not think that it would be worth while you belong to a class which i do not understandwhich i do not pretend to understand the things which seemed reasonable to me would probably seem banal to you i am sure that it would be useless  but why i persisted you have said so much you must say more i insist  a little wearily she pushed back the masses of hair from her forehead her head rested for a moment upon her fingers her eyes deliberately sought mine  let me warn you she said i am not the sort of woman whom you know anything about the usual things do not attract me i have never been in love with a man i hope that i never shall be and yet i think that i find my way a little further into life than most of my sex  you have other interests i murmured  i have what they are it is not for you to know i am only interested in your sex so far as they are useful to me you if you were a different sort of man might be very useful to me  at least give me the chance i begged  she shook her head  this morning she said it seemed to me that i saw in one moment an epitome of your life i saw every nerve of your body strained i saw you wound up to a great effort it was to catch a ball you succeeded i believe  i laughed a little awkwardly  yes i caught it i remarked success is something after all isnt it  i suppose so she admitted afterwards i spoke to your cousin about you he told me that you lived on your estates that you played games well that you shot birds and rabbits and sent to prison drunken men and poachers but about his life i asked this is his life your cousin answered he has never gone in for a career  i suppose i said slowly that this seems to you a very unambitious sort of existence  existence she answered scornfully it does not seem like existence at all your joys are the joys of a highly trained animal your sorrows and your passions and your disappointmentsthey are at best those of the yokel what has life to do with games and sports these things may have their place and their use but to make them all in all the men whom i have met are not like that  i am sorry i said you see the other things have not come my way  you mean that you have not been out to seek them she declared the pulse of the world beats only for those who care to feel it  let us take it for granted for a moment that you are right i said and that i am a convert i am willing to abjure my sports and my quiet days for a plunge into the greater world who will be my guide which path shall i follow  you are not in earnest she murmured  perhaps i am perhaps not i answered at any rate there have been times when i have found life a tame thing such a feeling came to me two years ago and i went to africa to shoot lions  she leaned towards me  you should hunt men not lions she whispered it is only the animal courage in you which keeps you cool when you face wild beasts it is a different thing when you measure wits and strength with one of your own race  count me a willing listener and go on i said if you can show me the way i am willing to take it  why not she said half to herself you have strength you have courage why shouldnt you come a little way into life  if it is by your side i began passionately  she stopped me with a look  please go away she said firmly you only weary me if it is to gain an opportunity of saying this sort of rubbish that you have induced me to take you seriously i can only say that i am sorry i have wasted a second of my time upon you  the two things are apart i answered i will not allude to the one again my interest in what you have said is genuine i am waiting for your advice  she rose slowly to her feet she looked me in the eyes but there was no shadow of kindness in their expression  if i were a man she saidif i were you i would seek out the person whom you befriendedhe goes by the name of guestand i would learn from himthe secret  where can i find him i asked eagerly he seems to have disappeared entirely  her voice sank to a whisper her breath fanned my cheek so that i felt half mad with the desire to hold her in my arms if only for a moment i think that she must have seen the light flash in my eyes but she ignored it altogether  go to your room she said and wait till a messenger comes to you     chapter vi  mr guest   i had been alone for nearly an hour before there came a cautious tapping at my door i opened it at once and stared at my visitor in surprise it was the man in the grey tweed suit who had broken into my room the night before  you i exclaimed what the mischief are you doing here  if you will permit me to enter he said i shall be glad to explain  he stepped past me into the room i closed the door behind him  what do you want with me i asked  my visitor regarded me thoughtfully through his goldrimmed spectacles i too was taking careful note of him any one more commonplacewith less of the bearing of a conspiratorit would be impossible to imagine his features his clothes his bearing were all ordinary his face had not even the shrewdness of the successful business man his brown beard was carefully trimmed his figure was a little podgy his manner undistinguished i found it hard to associate him in my mind with such things as the woman whom i had left a few moments ago had spoken of  i understand he said that you wish for an interview with your friend mr leslie guest his room happens to be close to mine i shall be pleased to conduct you there  you have seen miss van hoyt then i exclaimed  i have just left her he answered  i stared at him incredulously  do you mean to tell me i said that after last night you have dared to remain in the hotelthat you have a room here  my visitor smiled  but certainly he said you are under some curious apprehension as to the events of last night my friend and i are most harmless individuals we only wanted a little business conversation with mr guest which he was foolish enough to try and avoid that is all arranged now however  is it i answered curtly then i am sorry for mr guest  again my visitor smiledquite a harmless smile it was as of pity for some unaccountably foolish person  you do not seem he remarked if i may be pardoned for saying so a very imaginative person mr courage but you certainly have some strange ideas as to my friend and myself possibly mr guest himself is responsible for them a very excitable person at times  you had better take me to him if that is your errand i said shortly this sort of conversation between you and me is rather a waste of time  certainly he answered will you follow me  we took the lift to the sixth floor traversed an entire corridor and then mounting a short and narrow flight of stairs we arrived at a passage with three or four doors on either side and no exit at the further end we seemed to be entirely cut off from the main portion of the hotel and i noticed that there were no numbers on the doors of the rooms a very tall and powerfullooking man came to the head of the stairs on hearing our footsteps and regarded us suspiciously directly he recognized my companion however he allowed us to pass  a nice quiet part of the hotel this my guide remarked glancing towards me  very i answered dryly  a man might be hidden here very securely he added  i can well believe it i assented  he knocked softly at the third door on the left a womans voice answered him a moment later the door was opened by a nurse in plain hospital dress  good evening nurse my companion said cheerfully this gentleman would like to see mr guest is he awake  the nurse opened the door a little wider which i took for an invitation to enter she closed it softly behind me my guide remained outside  the room was a very small one and furnished after the usual hotel fashion the only light burning was a heavilyshaded electric lamp placed by the bedside the nurse raised it a little and looked down upon the man who lay there motionless  he is asleep she remarked it is time he took his medicine i must wake him  she spoke with a pronounced foreign accent her fair hair and stolid features left me little doubt as to her nationality i was conscious of a strong and instinctive dislike to her from the moment i heard her speak and watched her bending over the bed i think that her face was one of the most unsympathetic which i had ever seen  she poured some medicine into a glass and turned on another electric light her patient woke at once directly he opened his eyes he recognized me with a little start  you he exclaimed you  i sat down on the edge of the bed  you havent forgotten me then i remarked im sorry youre queer nothing serious i hope  he ignored my words he was looking at me all the time as though inclined to doubt the evidence of his senses  who let you comeup here he asked in a whisper  i made inquiries about you and got permission to come up i answered how are you feeling this evening  i dont understand why they let you come he said uneasily stoop down  the nurse came forward with a wineglass  will you take your medicine please she said  presently he answered put it down  she glanced at the clock and held the glass out once more  it is past the time she said  i have had two doses today he answered quite enough i think set it down and go away please i want to talk with this gentleman  talking is not good for you she said without moving better take your medicine and go to sleep  he took the glass from her hand and with a glance at its contents which puzzled me drank it off  now will you go he asked handing back the glass to her  she dragged her chair to the bedside  if you will talk she said stolidly i must watch that you do not excite yourself too much  he glanced meaningly at me  i have private matters to discuss he said  you are not well enough to talk of private matters or anything else important she declared you will excite yourself you will bring on the fever i remain here to watch it is by the doctors orders  she sat down heavily within a few feet of us  you speak french guest asked me  i nodded  fairly well  watch her see whether she seems to understand i want to speak of what she must not hear  she half rose from her chair so far as her features could express anything they expressed disquietude  she does not understand i said go on  she bent over the bedside  you must not talk any more she said it excites you your temperature is rising  he ignored her altogether  listen he said to me why they have let you come here i cannot tell you know that i am in prisonthat i am not likely to leave here alive  i dont think that it is so bad as that i assured him  it is worse i am likely to die without the chance of finishingmy work great things will die with me god knows what will happen  you have a doctor and a hospital nurse i remarked that doesnt look as though they meant you to die  you dont know who i am and you dont know who they are he answered dropping his voice almost to a whisper  i want a month one more month and i might cheat them yet  i dont think that they mean you to die i said they have an idea that you are in possession of some marvellous secret they want to get possession of that first  they persevere he murmured in parisbut never mind they know very well that that secret if i die before i can finish my work dies with me or  the nurse who had left us a few moments before reentered the room she went straight to a chair at the further end of the apartment and took up a book guest looked at me with a puzzled expression  stranger still he said we are allowed to talk  it may be only for a moment i reminded him  or pass it on to a successor who will complete my work he said slowly i fear that i shall not find him the time is too short now  have you no friends i could send for i asked  not one he answered  i looked at him curiously a man does not often confess himself entirely friendless  i need a strong brave man he said slowlyone who is not afraid of death one who has the courage to dare everything in a great cause  a great cause i repeated they are few and far between nowadays  he looked at me steadily  you are an englishman  i laughed  saxon to the backbone i admitted  you would consider it a great cause to save your country from ruin from absolute and complete ruin  my imagination i declared cannot conceive such a situation  a flock of geese once saved an empire he said a childs little finger in the crack of the dam kept a whole city from destruction one man may yet save this pigheaded country of ours from utter disaster it may be youit may be i  you are also an englishman i exclaimed  perhaps he answered shortly never mind what i am think think hard by tomorrow you must decide are you content with your life does it satisfy you you have everything else have you ambition  i am not sure i answered slowly remember that this is all new to me i must think  he raised himself a little in the bed at no time on this occasion had he presented to me the abject appearance of the previous night his cheeks were perfectly colorless and this pallor together with his white hair and the spotless bedlinen gave to his face a somewhat ghastly cast but his dark eyes were bright and piercing his features composed and natural  listen he said they may try to kill me but i have a will too and i say that i will not die till i have found a successor to carry onto the endwhat i have begun mind it is no cowards game it is a walk with death hand in hand all the way  he raised suddenly a warning finger there was a knock at the door the nurse who answered it came to the bedside  the gentleman has stayed long enough she announced he must go now  i rose and held out my hand he held it between his for a moment and his eyes sought mine  you will cometomorrow  i will come i promised tomorrow evening     chapter vii  a tÊteÀtÊte dinner   at about nine oclock the following morning a note was brought to my room addressed to me in a ladys handwriting i tore it open at once it was as i bad expected from miss van hoyt  dear mr courage  i should like to see you for a few minutes at twelve oclock in the readingroom  yours sincerely  adÈle van hoyt  i wrote a reply immediately  dear miss van hoyt  i regret that i am engaged for the day and have to leave the hotel in an hour i shall return about seven oclock could you not dine with me this evening either in the hotel or elsewhere  yours sincerely  j hardross courage  over my breakfast i studied the handwriting of her note it might indeed have served for an index to so much of her character as had become apparent to me the crisp clear formation of the letters the bold curves and angular terminations seemed to denote a personality free from all feminine weaknesses i was reminded at once of the unfaltering gaze of her deep blue eyes of the chill precision of her words and manner i asked myself then why a character so free apparently from all the lovable traits of her sex should have proved so attractive to me i had known other beautiful women i was not untravelled and i had met women in paris and vienna who also possessed the more subtle charms of perfect toilet and manners and were free from the somewhat hopeless obviousness of most of the women of our country there was something beneath all that at the moment i could not tell what it was i simply realized that for the first time a woman stood easily first in my life that my whole outlook upon the world was undermined  just as i was leaving the hotel i saw her maid coming down the hall with a note in her hand i waited and she accosted me  monsieur courage  yes i answered  she gave me the note  there is no reply at present she said dropping her voice almost to a whisper monsieur might open it in his cab  she gave me a glance of warning and i saw that the hall porter and one of his subordinates were somewhat unnecessarily near me then she glided away and i drove off in my cab directly we had started i tore open the envelope and read these few lines  dear mr courage  i will dine with you tonight at the café français at eight oclock please take a table upstairs do not ask for me again or send me any further message until we meet there  yours sincerely  adÈle van hoyt  at lords i was compelled to spend half the day hanging about the pavilion smoking a good many more cigarettes than i was accustomed to and finding the cricket much less interesting than usual my own innings fortunately kept me distracted for a little more than two hours and the effort of it soothed my nerves and did me good all round on my way back to the hotel i determined to forget everything except that i was going to dine alone with the one companion i would have chosen first out of the whole world in that frame of mind i bathed changed my clothes and made my way a little before the appointed time to the café français  i found out my table sent for some more flowers and ordered the wine then i descended to the hall just in time to meet my guest  she wore nothing over her evening dress save a lace scarf which she untwisted as we ascended the stairs for some reason i fancied that she was not very well pleased with me her greeting was certainly cool  is this your favorite restaurant i asked as the headwaiter ushered us to our table  i have no favorite restaurant she answered only tonight i felt in the humor for french cookingand french service  i fancied that there was some meaning in the latter part of her sentence but at that time i did not understand i had ordered the dinner carefully and i was glad to see that although she ate sparingly she showed appreciation wine she scarcely touched  so you have been particularly engaged today was almost her first remark  i was forced to go to lords i reminded her a cricket match lasts three days  three whole days she exclaimed raising her eyebrows  certainly unless it is over before i replied  and you mean to say that you are a prisoner there all that timethat you could not leave if you chose to  i am afraid not i answered cricket is a serious thing in this country you know if you are chosen to play and commence in the match you must go through with it surely you have met with something of the same sort of thing in the football matches in america  i have never been interested in such things she said i suppose that is why i have never realized their importance i am afraid mr courage  well  she lifted her eyes to mine what a colorand what a depth then i knew as though by inspiration how it was that i found myself passing into bondage cold she might seem and selfengrossed it was because the right chord had never been struck some day another light should shine in those wonderful eyes i saw her before me transformed saw color in her still marble cheeks saw her lips drift into a softer curve heard the tremor of passion in her quiet languid tone  do you know that you are staring at me she remarked calmly  i apologized profusely  it is a bad habit of mine i assured her i was lookingbeyond  there was real interest then in her face she leaned a little forward perhaps it was my fancy but i thought that she seemed to regard me differently  how interesting she said do you know i had not given you credit for much imagination you must tell me what you saw  impossible i declared  rubbish she answered nothing is impossible besides i ask it  i do not know you well enough i declared helping myself to an artichoke to be personal  the liberties you take in your thoughts she answered i permit you to render into speech it is the same thing  ones thoughts i answered are too phantasmagorial one cannot collect them into speech  you must try she declared or i shall never never dine with you again nothing is so interesting as to see yourself from anothers point of view  is it understood i asked that i am not held personally responsible for my thoughtsthat if i try to clothe them with words i am held free from offence  she considered for a moment  i suppose so she said yes go on  i drank off my glass of wine and waited until the waiter who had been carving a rouen duckling on a stand by the side of the table had stepped back into the background  very well i said i am thirtythree years old and a bachelor well off and i have never been a stayathome i know something of society in paris in vienna in rome as well as london i have always found women agreeable companions and i have never avoided them the sex as a whole has attracted me from individual members of it i have happened to remain absolutely heartwhole  marvellous she murmured in gentle derision please pass the toast thank you  i have been compelled i said to be egotistical i must now become personal i saw you for the first time in the hall at the universal the morning before yesterday i encountered you the night before under extremely dubious circumstances i spoke to you for the first time yesterday i have met other women as beautiful i have met many others who have been more gracious to me these things do not seem to count you have asked for truth mind and you are going to have it as surely as we are sitting here together i know that from henceforth for me there will bethere could beno other woman in the world  she moved in her chair a little restlessly her eyes avoided mine her eyebrows had contracted a little but i could not see that she was angry  what am i to think of such a declaration as that she asked quietly you are not a wizard you have seen of me what i chose and you have seen nothing which a man should find lovable except my looks  i smiled as i leaned a little forward  dont do me an injustice i begged you have brought me now to the very moment when i forgot myself and prompted your question remember that one has always ones fancy i looked at you tonight and i thought that i saw another womanor rather i thought that i saw the woman that you might be that i would pray to make you the other woman is there i think i only hope that it may be my good fortune to call her into life  her head was bent over her plate she seemed to be listening to the musicor was there something there which she did not wish me to see i could not tell the waiter intervened with another course when she spoke to me again her tone was almost cold but it troubled me very little there was a softness in her eyes which she could not hide  it seems to me she said that we have been very frivolous i agreed to dine with you that we might speak together of this unfortunate person leslie guest you saw him last night  yes i answered i saw him  my tone had become grave and my face overcast she was watching me curiously  well  i am bothered i admitted i dont quite know what i ought to do  explain  it seemed to me i said that the man was neither more nor less than a prisoner there in the hands of those who for some reason or other are his enemies  that she admitted is fairly obvious what of it  well i said the most straightforward thing for me to do i believe would be to go to the nearest policestation and tell them all i know  she laughed softly  what an englishman you are she exclaimed the law or a letter to the times these are your final resources are they not well in this case let me assure you that neither would help you in the least  i am not so sure i answered at any rate i do not see the fun of letting him remain there to be done to death by those mysterious enemies of his  then why not take him away she asked quietly  where to i asked  your own home if you are sufficiently interested in him  do you mean that i asked  i do listen i have no pity for the man who calls himself leslie guest death he has deserved and his fate whomever might intervene is absolutely inevitable but i do not wish him to dieat present  why not  you can imagine i think he has the secret  he does not seem to me i remarked the sort of man likely to part with it  not to me she answered quickly not to those others from us he would guard it with his life with you it is different  i am not sure i said slowly that i wish to become a sharer of such dangerous knowledge  you are afraid she asked coldly  i do not see what i have to gain by it i admitted i am not curious and the possession of it certainly seems to entail some inconvenience if not danger  her lip curled a little she nodded as though she quite understood my point of view  you have said enough she declared i perceive that i was not mistaken you are exactly the sort of man i thought you were from the first it is better for you to return to your cricket and your sports you are at home with them in the great world you would soon be weary and lost call for your bill please and put me in a cab i have a call to make before i return to the hotel  one moment more i begged you have not altogether understood me i have spoken from my own point of view only i have no interest in the salvation of leslie guest beyond an englishmans natural desire to see fair play i have no wish to be burdened with a secret which seems to spell life or death in capital letters but show me where your interest lies and i promise you that i will be zealous enough tell me what to do and i will do it my time and my life are yours do what you will with them can i say more than that  she flashed a wonderful look at me across the tablesuch a look that my heart beat and my pulses flowed to a strange new music her tone was soft almost caressing  you mean this  upon my honor i do i answered  then take leslie guest with you back to your home in the country she said keep him with you keep every one else away from him in less than a week he will tell you his secret  i will do it i answered     chapter viii  in the toils   this the nurse said after a moments somewhat awkward pause is the doctordr kretznow  a tall awkwardly built man wearing heavy glasses turned away from the bedside and looked at me inquiringly  my name is courage doctor i said i am an acquaintance of your patients  the doctor frowned on me as he picked up his hat  i have given no permission he said for my patient to receive visitors  i trust that you dont consider him too ill i answered i was hoping to hear that he was better  he is doing well enough the doctor declared if he is left alone but he added in a lower tone he is a sick mana very sick man  i glanced towards the bedside and was shocked at the deathly pallor of his face his eyes were half closed he had not the air of hearing anything that we said i walked towards the door with the doctor  what is the matter with him doctor i asked  he glanced towards me suspiciously  i was told he said that my patient was without friends here or any one for whom he could send  i have only known him a very short time i answered but i am interested in him if i may be allowed to say so i am perfectly willing to defray any charges  he stopped me impatiently  i am physician to the hotel he said mr blumentein arranges all that with me  then perhaps as i have told you i am interested in him i can trespass so far upon your courtesy as to inquire into the nature of his ailment i said  i am afraid he said that as you are not a medical man i could scarcely make you understand  there wasan accident i think i began  a trifle nothing at all the doctor declared hastily the trouble is with his heart you will excuse me i have many calls to make this evening  perhaps you would kindly give me your address i said dr mumford the heart specialist is an acquaintance of mine you would not object to meet him in consultation  he looked at me for a moment fixedly  it is not at all necessary he declared if mr blumentein is not satisfied with my conduct of the case i will withdraw from it at once otherwise i shall not tolerate any interference  he left me without another word i returned to the bedside as i approached guest deliberately opened one eye and then closed it again i addressed him in french  how are you  about as i am meant to be he answered  the nurse came over to the bedside  it is not well for the gentleman to talk tonight she said the doctor has said that he must be quite quiet  i shall only stay a few minutes i answered and i will be careful not to disturb him  she stood quite still for a moment looking sullenly at us then she turned away and left the room guest raised himself a little in the bed  she has gone to fetch one of myguardians he remarked grimly  i am going to take you away from heredown to my home in the country i said do you think you can stand the journey  whether i can or not makes no difference he answered i shall never be allowed to leave this room alive  the britisher in me was touched  rubbish i answered if you talk like that i shall go to scotland yard at once i tell you frankly i dont like your nurse i dont like your doctor i dont like their shutting you up in this lonely part of the hotel and i cant understand the attitude of mr blumentein at all he must know what he is risking in attempting this sort of thing in london of all places in the world  he interrupted me impatiently  dont talk about scotland yard he said these people are not fools they would have a perfect answer to any charge you might bring  you dont mean that you intend to lie here and be done to death i protested  death for me is a certain thing he answered i have been a doomed man for months there was never a chance for me after i entered the portals of this hotel i knew that but i backed my luck i thought that i might have had time to finish my workto lay the match to the gunpowder  listen i said there is a ladya young lady staying here a miss van hoyt  well  it was her suggestion that i should take you away with me  his eyes seemed to dilate as he stared at me  say that again he murmured  i repeated my words he raised himself a little in the bed  what do you know of her he asked  not much i answered she came to lords cricket ground my cousin was with her we have spoken about you  you know  i know that she is or appears to be one of yourwhat shall i sayenemies  she is willing he repeated for me to go away with you ah  a sudden understanding came into his face  yes he declared hoarsely i think that i understand go back to her say that i consent sheshe is different to those others she playsthe great game hush i go to sleep  he closed his eyes the door opened and the nurse entered followed by a man who bowed gravely to me he was still wearing a grey tweed suit and a red tie his eyes beamed upon me from behind his goldrimmed spectacles  ah he exclaimed softly so you have come to see your friend it is very kind of you i trust that you find him better  i pointed to the nurse  send her away i said i want to talk to you  we will talk with pleasure the newcomer answered but why here we shall disturb our friend come into my room and we will drink a whisky and soda together  thank you no i answered dryly i will drink with you at the bar or in the smokingroom if you likenot in your room  he bowed  an admirable precaution sir he declared we will go to the smokingroom  i glanced towards the bed guest was sleeping or feigning sleep my companions eyes followed mine sympathetically  poor fellow he exclaimed i am afraid that he is very ill  i opened the door and pushed him gently outside  we will go downstairs and have that talk i said  we found a quiet corner in the smokingroom where there was a little recess partitioned off from the rest of the room my companion drew a small cardcase from his pocket  permit me mr courage he said to introduce myself my name is stanley james stanley and i come from liverpool waiter two best scotch whiskies and a large schweppes soda  mr stanley i said i am glad to know a name by which i can call you but this is going to be a straight talk between you and me and i may as well tell you that i do not believe that your name is stanley or that you come from liverpool  ah it is immaterial he declared softly  i want to speak to you i said about the man guest upstairs it seems to me that there is a conspiracy going on against him in this hotel i want you to understand that i am not prepared to stand quietly aside and see him done to death  my companion laughed softly he took off his spectacles and wiped them with a silk handkerchief  a conspiracy he repeated in the hotel universal my dear sir you are letting your indignation run away with you consider for a moment what you are saying the hotel is full of visitors from all parts of england it is one of the largest and best known in london its reputation  oh spare me all this rot i interrupted rudely let me remind you of what happened two nights ago when you broke into my room in search of guest  ah he remarked that no doubt must have seemed an odd proceeding to you but in the first place you must remember we had no idea that the room was occupied we were very anxious to have an explanation with our friend purely a business matter and he had irritated us both by his persistent avoidance of it we have had our little talk now and the matter is over my partner has already left and i am returning to liverpool myself tomorrow or the next day i fear that you were misled by my language and manner on that unfortunate evening i am sorry but i must admit that i was overexcited  very good i said then perhaps as you are so fluent with your explanations you will tell me why mr guest has been removed to a part of the hotel which i am quite sure that no one knows anything about is being attended by a doctor of most unprepossessing appearance and a nurse who treats him as a jailer would  mr stanleys face beamed with goodhumored mirth  you young men he declared are so imaginative mr guest has simply been removed to the part of the hotel which is reserved for sick people no one likes to know that they have anybody next door to them who is seriously ill as for the doctor he is a highly qualified practitioner and visits the hotel every day by arrangement with the manager and the nurse was sent from the nearest nurses home  you think then i continued that if i were to go to scotland yard and tell them all that i know that i should be making a fool of myself  mr stanleys eyes twinkled  why not try it he suggested there is a detective always in attendance on the premises send for him now and let us hear what he says  very well mr stanley i said your explanations all sound very reasonable i am to take it then that if mr guest desired tosay leave the hotel tomorrow no one would make any objection  mr stanley was almost distressed  objection my dear sir mr guest is his own master is he not he pays his own bill and he leaves when he likes at present of course he is not able to but that is simply a matter of health  i am proposing i said to take mr guest away with me into the country tomorrow  mr stanley looked at me steadily there was a subtle change in his face i was watching him closely and i saw the glint of his eyes behind his spectacles i began to think i had been rash to lay my cards upon the table  i am afraid he said gently that you are proposing what would becertain death to mr guestin his present state of health  i am afraid i replied that if i leave him here it will also beto certain death  mr stanley called to the waiter  one small drink more and i must go to bed he said up to a certain point i agree with you i believe that leslie guest is a dying man whether he stays here or goes makes little differencevery little difference indeed to me your health mr courage a farewell drink this i am afraid  i raised my tumbler to my lips and nodded to him then i rose to my feet but almost as i did so i realized what had happened the floor heaved up beneath my feet my knees trembled i felt the perspiration break out upon my forehead through the mist which was gathering in front of my eyes i could see the halfcurious halfderisive glances of the other occupants of the room and opposite mr stanley his eyes blinking at me from behind his spectacles his expression one of grieved concern i leaned over toward him  you dd scoundrel i exclaimed  after that my head fell forward upon my folded arms and i remembered no more     chapter ix  an unexpected visitor   i sat up in bed heavy unrefreshed and with a splitting headache the clock on the mantelpiece was striking three oclock from below i could hear the clatter of vehicles in the courtyard and the distant roar of traffic from the streets beyond slowly i realized that it was three oclock in the afternoon the events of the night before reformed themselves in my mind i rang the bell for the valet and sprang out of bed  why didnt you call me this morning i asked angrily  you gave no orders sir the man answered i have been in the room once or twice but you were sleeping so soundly that i didnt like to disturb you  i began tearing on my clothes  what sort of weather has it been i asked  pouring rain since seven oclock sir the man answered no chance of play at lords sir  thank heaven i exclaimed fervently order me a cup of tea will you andstop a minutetake this note round to miss van hoyt367  he returned in a few minutes with the tea but he brought my note back again  miss van hoyt left the hotel this morning sir he announced  i turned round quickly  she is coming back of course i exclaimed  the chambermaid thought not sir the man declared she has given up her room at any rate they would know for certain down in the office  i finished the rest of my toilet in a hurry and went straight to the reception bureau i fancied that the clerk to whom i addressed myself eyed me queerly  can you tell me if miss van hoyt has left the hotel i asked  she left this morning sir he replied  is there any message for memr courage i asked  he disappeared for a moment but i fancied that his search was only perfunctory  nothing at all for you sir he announced  i concealed my surprise as well as i could  will you send my card up and ascertain if i can see mr leslie guest i asked he is staying somewhere in the south wing  mr leslie guest left just before one oclock sir the clerk answered  left the hotel i repeated why he was in bed yesterday and scarcely able to move  the clerk shrugged his shoulders he had the air of being a little tired of me  he was probably better today he answered at any rate he was well enough to travel  is mr james stanley of liverpool in i asked  mr stanley paid his bill and went away at eight oclock this morning the man answered going back to his ledger  i must see the manager at once i declared firmly  the clerk called a pageboy  take this gentlemans name down to mr blumentein he ordered shortly  i waited for several minutes then the boy returned and beckoned me to follow him  mr blumentein will see you in his office sir he announced will you come this way  it was a very different mr blumentein who looked up now as i was shown into his private room he regarded me with a frown and his manner was indubitably hostile  you wish to speak to me sir he asked curtly  i do i answered there is a good deal going on in your hotel which i do not understand and i may as well tell you that i am determined to get to the bottom of it i was drugged in the public smokingroom last night by a man who called himself stanley acting in collusion with one of the waiters  mr blumentein looked at me superciliously  mr courage he said the events of last night preclude my taking you seriously any more but i should like you to understand that you have proved yourself an extremely troublesome guest here  what do you mean by the events of last night i asked  you were drunk in the smokingroom mr blumentein replied curtly and had to be assisted to your room dont trouble to deny it there are a dozen witnesses if necessary i shall require you to leave the hotel within the next few hours  you know very well that i was nothing of the sort i answered hotly  it is easily proved mr blumentein asserted please understand that i am not prepared to discuss the matter with you  very well i answered let it go at that whilst i was safely put out of the way several of your guests seem to have left will you give me miss van hoyts address  i will not the manager answered  mr leslie guests then  i do not know it he declared  i turned towards the door  very well mr blumentein i said but if you imagine that this matter is going to rest where it is you are very much mistaken i am going straight to a private detectives who is also a friend of mine  then for heavens sake go to him mr blumentein declared irritably we have nothing to conceal here all that we desire is to be left alone by guests whose conduct about the place is discreditable good afternoon mr courage  i returned to my room and had my bag packed then i sat down to think i reviewed the course of events carefully since the night before last try how i could i found it absolutely impossible to arrive at any clear conclusion with regard to them the whole thing was a phantasmagoria the one person in whom i had believed and at whose bidding i was willing to take a hand in this mysterious game had disappeared without a word of explanation or farewell there could be only one reasonable course of action for me to pursue and that was to shrug my shoulders and go my way i had my own life to live and although its limitations might be a little obvious it was yet a reasonable and sane sort of life of adèle i refused resolutely to think i knew very well that i should not be able to forget her on the other hand i was convinced now that she was simply making use of me i would go back home and forget these two days i would reckon them as belonging to some one elses life not mine  i paid my bill left the hotel and caught the five oclock train from st pancras to medchester from there i had a tenmile drive and it was almost dusk when we turned off the main road into the private approach to saxby hallmy old home every yard of the land around half meadowland half park i knew almost by heart every corner and chimney of the long irregular house was familiar to me it all looked very peaceful as we drove up to the front the blue smoke from the chimneys going straight up in a long thin line not a rustle of breeze or movement anywhere perkins my butler came out to the steps to meet me and successfully concealed his surprise at my return two days before i was expected  any news perkins i inquired as he helped me off with my coat  nothing in any way special sir perkins replied the cricket team from romney court were over here yesterday sir for the day  gave em a licking i hope i remarked  we won by thirty runs sir perkins informed me johnson was bowling remarkably well sir he took seven wickets for fifteen  i nodded and was passing on to my study perkins followed me  we got your first telegram early this morning sir he remarked  i stopped short  what telegram i asked  the one telling us to prepare for the gentleman sir perkins explained we had to guess at the train but we sent the brougham in for the twelve oclock and johnson waited weve given him the south room sir and i think that hes quite comfortable  what the devil are you talking about i asked  it was perkins turn to stare which he did for a moment blankly  the gentleman whose arrival you wired about sir he answered mr guest i believe his name is  mr guest is here now i asked  certainly sir in the south room sir he asked to be told directly you arrived sir  i turned abruptly towards the staircase i said not another word to perkins but made my way to the room which he had spoken of i knocked at the door and it was guests voice which bade me enter it was guest himself who in a grey travelling suit which made him look smaller and frailer than ever lay stretched upon the sofa over by the great south windows     chapter x  wortley footethe spy   he sat up at once but he did not attempt to rise his eyes watched me anxiously my surprise seemed to trouble him  i am afraid he began hesitatingly  you need be afraid of nothing i interrupted going over and taking his hand only how on earth did you get here  he looked around before replying the old habits had not deserted him  your friend miss van hoyt arranged it he said the others had another plan but they were no match for her  but how did you come i asked you were not well enough to travel alone  she left me at medchester station he answered your carriage brought me over here and your servants have been most kind butbut before i go to bed tonight there are things which i must say to you we must not sleep under the same roof until we have arrived at an understanding  i looked at him with compassion he had shaved recently and his face besides being altogether colorless seemed very wan and pinched his clothes seemed too big for him his eyes were unnaturally clear and luminous  we will talk later on i said if it is really necessary shall you feel well enough to come down and have dinner with me or would you like something served up here  i should like to come down he answered if you will lend me your man to help me dress  come as you are i said we shall be alone  he smiled a little curiously  i should like to change he declared a few hours of civilization after all i have been through will be rather a welcome experience  very well i told him i will send my man at once there is just another thing which i should like to ask you have you any objection to seeing my doctor  none whatever he answered i think perhaps he added that it would be advisable in case anything should happen while i am here  i laughed cheerfully  come i declared nothing of that sort is going to happen now you are perfectly safe here and this country air is going to do wonders for you  he made no answer in words his expression however plainly showed me what he thought i did not pursue the subject  i will send a man round at once i said turning away we dine at eight  my guest at dinnertime revealed traces of breeding and distinction which i had not previously observed in him he was obviously a man of birth and one who had mixed in the very best society of other capitals save london alone he ate very little but he drank two glasses of my regents chambertin with the air of a critic he declined cigars but he carried my cigarette box off with him into the study and he accepted without hesitation some 47 brandy with his coffee all the time however he had the air of a man with something on his mind and we had scarcely been alone for a minute before he brushed aside the slighter conversation which i was somewhat inclined to foster and plunged into the great subject  mr courage he said i want to speak to you seriously i nodded  why dont you wait for a few days until you have pulled up a little i suggested there is no hurry you are perfectly safe down here  he looked at me as one might look at a child  there is very urgent need for hurry he asserted and apart from that death waits for no man and my feet are very near indeed to the borderland there must be an understanding between us  as you will i answered although i wont admit that you are as ill as you think you are  he smiled faintly  that he said is because you do not know now listen you have to make within the next few minutes a great decision very likely after you have chosen you will curse me all your days it was a freak of fate which brought us together but i must say this you are the sort of man whom i would have chosen if any measure of choice had fallen to my lot and yet he looked around i am almost afraid to speak now that i have seen you in your home now that i have realized something of what your life must be  all the time underneath the flow of his level words there trembled the subnote of a barely controlled emotion the mans eyes were like fire his cigarette had gone out he lit another with restless twitching fingers  words at any rate can do me no harm i said encouragingly go on i should like to hear what you have to say  words he exclaimed bring knowledge and with knowledge comes all the majesty or the despair of life one does not need to be a student of character to know that you are a contented man you are well off you have a beautiful home you are a sportsman your days are wellordered life itself slips easily by for you you have none of the wanderers discontent none of the passionate heart longings of the man who has lifted even the corner of the veil to see what lies beyond if i speak all this may be changed to you why should i do it  his words stirred me the eloquence of real conviction trembled in his tone i felt some answering spark of excitement creep into my own blood  let me hear what you have to say at all events i exclaimed dont take too much for granted mine has been a simple life but there have been seasons when i would have changed it i come of an adventurous race though the times have curbed our spirits it was my grandfather sir hardross courage who was ambassador at paris when napoleon  i know i know he exclaimed your grandfather good and nicholas couragewhat of him  my uncle i answered you have heard of him in teheran  a spot of color burned in his pallid cheeks  i hesitate no longer he cried these were great men but i will show you the way to deeds which shall leave their memory pale listen did you ever hear of wortley foote  the spy i answered of course  he started as though he were stung even to death his cheeks were flushed and then as suddenly livid he seemed to have grown smaller in his chair to be shrinking away as though i had threatened him with a blow  i forgot he muttered i forgot never mind i am wortley foote at least it has been my name for a time  it was my turn to be astonished i looked at him for a moment petrified was this indeed the man who had brought all europe to the verge of war who was held responsible for the greatest international complication of the century years had passed but i remembered well that week of fierce excitement when the clash of arms rang through europe when three great fleets were mobilized and the very earth seemed to reverberate with the footsteps of the gathering millions moving always towards one spot disaster was averted by what seemed then to be a miracle but no one ever doubted but that one man and one man alone was responsible for what might have been the most awful catastrophe of civilized times and it was that man who sat in my study and watched me now with ghastly face and passionately inquiring eyes when he spoke his voice sounded thin and cracked  i had forgotten he said that i was speaking to one of the million to you mine must seem a name to shudder at yet listen to me my life is finished i have lied before now in great causes no man in my position could have avoided it today i speak the truth you must believe me do you hear  yes i answered i hear  death is my bedfellow he continued death is by my side like my own shadow in straits like mine the uses of chicanery are past i come of a family of english gentlemen even as you hardross courage we are of the same order and i speak to you man to man with the dew of death upon my lips you will listen  yes i answered i will listen  you will believe  yes i answered i will believe  he drew a breath of relief a wonderful change lightened his face  diplomacy demanded a victim he said and i never flinched two men knew the truth and they are dead my scheme was a bold one if it had succeeded it would have meant an alliance with germany an absolute incontrovertible alliance and an imperishable peace france and russia would have been powerlessthe balance of strength of accessible strength must always have been with us every german statesman of note was with me the falsehood the vilely egotistic ambition of one man chockfull to the lips with personal jealousy a madman posing as a genius wrecked all my plans my lifes work went for nothing we escaped disaster by a miracle and my name is written in the pages of history as a scheming spyi who narrowly escaped the greatest diplomatic triumph of all ages that is the epitome of my career you believe me  i must i answered  i was reported to have committed suicide he continued nothing was ever farther from my thoughts  i followed an ancient maxim i sought safety in the shadow of the enemy i went to berlin  the man who foiled you i said slowly  you know who it was he interrupted the man who believes that he hears voices from heaven that by the side of his divine wisdom his ministers are fools and children crying for they know not what i may not see it but you most surely will see the pricking of the bubble of his reputation his name may stand for little more than mine when the book of fate is finally closed  he was silent for a moment and glanced towards the sideboard i could see the perspiration standing out in little white beads upon his forehead he had the air of a man utterly exhausted i poured him out a glass of wine and brought it over he drank it slowly and reached out his hand for a cigarette  never mind these things he said more quietly a man in my condition should avoid talking of his enemies i lived for two years quietly in berlin i changed as much of my appearance as illness had left recognizable and during all that time i lived the ordinary life of a german citizen of moderate means without my identity being once suspected i frequented the cafés i made friends with people in official positions at the end of that time i commenced to shape my plans you can imagine of what nature they were you can imagine what it was that i desired i wanted to catch my enemy tripping  i looked across at him a little incredulously this was a strange story which he was telling me and i knew very well from the growing excitement of his manner that its culmination was to come  but how could you in berlin alone hope to accomplish this i asked  i knew the ropes he answered simply and i lived for nothing else i saw him drive amongst his people every day and i bowed with the rest i who could have spat in his face i who carried with me the secret of his miserable perfidy who knew alone why his ministers regarded him as a spoilt and fretful child but i waited gradually i wormed my way a little into the fringe of the german secret service i took them scraps of information but such scraps that they were always hungry for more i posed as a dutch south african they even chaffed me about my hatred for england all the time i progressed until by chance i stumbled across one of the threads which ledto the great secret  there was a discreet knocking at the door we both turned impatiently around a servant was just ushering in our village doctor  dr rust sir he announced     chapter xi  a legacy of danger   i was scarcely aware myself to what an extent my attention had been riveted upon this strange story of my guests until the interruption came the entry of the cheerful little village doctor seemed to dissolve an atmosphere thick with sensation i drew a long breath as i rose to my feet there was a certain measure of relief in the escape from such high tension  glad to see you doctor i said mechanically my friend here mr guest dr rust i added completing the introduction is a little run down i thought that i would like you to have a look at him  the doctor sniffed the air disparagingly as he shook hands  those beastly cigarettes he remarked if you young men would only take to pipes  our insides arent strong enough for your sort of tobacco doctor i answered i will leave you with mr guest for a few minutes you may like to overhaul him a little  i made my way into the gardens and stood for a few minutes looking out across the park it was a still hot evening the scene was perhaps as peaceful a one as a man could conceive the tall elms stood out like painted trees upon a painted sky the only movement in the quiet pastoral landscape was where a little string of farm laborers were trudging homeward across the park with their baskets over their shoulders beyond the land sloped into a pleasant treeencompassed hollow and i could see the redtiled roofs of the cottages and the worn grey spire of the village church there was scarcely a breath of wind everything around me seemed to stand for peace many a night before i had stood here smoking my pipe and drinking it all inabsolutely content with myself my surroundings and my life and tonight i felt with a certain measure of sadness that it could never be the same again a few yards behind me in the room which i had just quitted a man was looking death in the face a man the passionate halftold fragments of whose life had kindled in me a whole world of new desires these two the man and the girl enemies perhaps speaking from the opposite poles of life had made sad havoc with my wellordered days the excitement of his appeal was perhaps more directly potent yet there was something far more subtle far stranger in my thoughts of her she and her maid and her queer blackeyed poodle were creatures of flesh and blood without a doubt yet they had come into my life so strangely and passed into so wonderful a place there that i thought of them with something of the awe which belongs to things having in themselves some element of the mystic if not of the supernatural the blue of her eyes was not more wonderful than the flawless grace of her person and her environment i could compare her only with visions one has read and dreamed about in the unreal worlds of poetry and romance her actual existence as a woman of the moment a possible adventuress certainly a very material and actual person was hard indeed to realize  i moved a little farther away into the gardens the still air was full of the perfume of sweetsmelling flowers of honeysuckle and roses climbing about the maze of arches which sheltered the lower walks tonight their sweetness seemed to mean new things to me the twilight was falling rapidly the shadows were blotting out the landscape out beyond there beyond the boundaries of my walled garden i seemed to be looking into a new and untravelled world i knew very well that the old days were over already the change had come  i turned my head at the sound of a footstep upon the gravel path the doctor was standing beside me  well i asked what do you think of him  he answered me a little evasively the cheerful optimism which had made him a very popular practitioner seemed for the moment to have deserted him  your friend is in rather a curious state of health he said slowly to tell you the truth i scarcely know how to account for certain of his symptoms  i smiled  he seems in a very weak state i remarked supinely  is he a very old friend the doctor asked  why do you ask that i inquired curiously  simply because i thought that you might know something of his disposition the doctor answered whether for instance he is the sort of man who would be likely to indulge in drugs  i shook my head  i cannot tell i said  there is something a little peculiar about his indifference the doctor continued he answers my questions and submits to my examination and all the time he has the air of a man who would say i could tell you more about myself if i would than you could ever discover he has had a magnificent constitution in his time  is he likely to die i asked  not from any symptoms that i can discover the doctor answered yet as i told you before there are certain things about his condition which i do not understand i should like to see him again in the morning i am giving him a tonic more as a matter of form i scarcely think his system will respond to it  it has not occurred to you i suppose i remarked that he might be suffering from poisoning  the doctor shook his head  there are no traces of anything of the sort he declared my own impression is that he has been taking some sort of drug  will you come in and have something i asked as we neared the house  the doctor shook his head  not tonight he answered i have another call to pay  so i went back into the house alone and found my guest waiting for me in some impatience he was lying upon a sofa piled up with cushions and the extreme pallor of his face alarmed me  give me some brandy and soda he demanded your village aesculapius has been prodding me about till i scarcely know where i am  i hastened to the sideboard and attended to his wants  well did he invent a new disease for me he asked  no i answered on the contrary he admitted that he was puzzled  honest man what did he suggest  he asked whether you were in the habit of taking drugs i answered  never touched such a thing in my life he declared  neither did i i remarked grimly until last night and then i told him what had happened to me he listened eagerly to my story  so there is a division in the camp he murmured softly i imagined as much as usual it is the woman who plays the whole game  i wonder i said whether you would mind telling me what you know of miss van hoyt  he moved on the couch a little uneasily the request for some reason or other seemed to disquiet him nevertheless he answered me  miss van hoyt he said is an american young lady of excellent family and great fortune she has lived for the last few years in berlin and other european capitals she has intimate friends i believe attached to the court at berlin she is a young person of an adventurous turn of mind and she has i believe no particular love for england and english institutions  you number her i remarked amongst your enemies  and amongst yours he answered dryly  yet it was through her that i was able to bring you away i remarked  he turned his head towards me  you are not supposing for one moment he said that any measure of kindness was included in her motive  i suppose not i answered doubtfully  listen he said i fell into a trap at the universal i have been in danger too often not to recognize a hopeless position when i see one i knew that escape for me was impossible it was not as though my task were finished i had months of work before me and i was tracked down so that i could not have moved except on sufferance our genial friend whom you will remember in the grey tweed suit and glasses and who has the knack of sticking to any one in whom he is interested like a leech thought that my death with as much dispatch as was wise would be the simplest and pleasantest way out of the difficulty the young lady however plays for the great stakes she wanted to succeed where others have failed  he paused for a moment and drank from his tumbler there were dark lines under his eyes and i felt that i ought to stop him talking  tell me the rest in the morning i suggested i am sure that you ought to go to bed  you forget he remarked grimly that for me there may be no morning i am drawing very near the end or even she would not have dared to let me come besides you must understand for it must be through you that she hopesto succeed she expects that i shall tell you that you will be the legatee of this knowledge which she would give so much to gain and i supposedont be offendedthat she counts you amongst the fools whom a womans lips can tempt to any dishonor you neednt glare at me like that miss van hoyt is very young and very beautiful she has not yet learnt all the lessons of lifeamongst which are her limitations you see i do not ask you for any pledgefor any promise but i do ask you as an englishmanand a man of honorto take my burden from my back and carry it onto the end  i came over to his side  what does it mean i asked quietly  death very likely he answered danger always no more sport no more living in the easy places but in the end gloryand afterwards peace a man can die but once courage  i am not afraid i answered slowly but am i the man do you think for a task like this  none better he answered listen where do you sleep  in the next room to yours i answered  good will you leave your door open so that if i call in the night you may hear  certainly you can have a servant sleep on the couch in your room if you like  he shook his head  i would rather not he answered just now i cannot talk any more if my time comes in the night i shall wake you if nottomorrow     chapter xii  old friends   a flavor of unreality hung about the events of the last few days i felt myself slowly waking as though from a nightmare the dazzling sunshine was everywhere around us the whir of reaping machines the slighter humming of bees and the song of birds were in our ears the perfume of all manner of flowers and of the newmown hay made the air wonderfully sweet my guest in a cool grey flannel suit and a panama hat was by my side looking like a man who has taken a new lease of life he had patted my shire horses and admired those of my hunters which were on view he had walked three times round my walled garden and amazed my headgardener by his intimate acquaintance with the science of pruning we had talked country talk and nothing else from the moment when somewhat to my surprise he had appeared upon the terrace just as i was finishing my afterbreakfast pipe no word of any more serious subject had passed our lips we had talked and passed the time very much as any other host and guest the first morning in a quiet country house we were standing now upon a little knoll in the park and i was pointing out my deer he looked beyond to where the turrets and chimneys of a large grey stone house were half visible through the trees  who is your neighbor he asked  lord dennisford i answered a very decent fellow too although i dont see much of him he spends most of his time abroad  lord dennisford  i turned to look at my companion he had repeated the name very softly yet with a peculiar intonation which made me at once aware that the name was of interest to him  yes do you know him i asked inanely  is his wife here he asked  lady dennisford is seldom away i answered she entertains a good deal down here a very popular woman in the county  he seemed to be measuring the distance across the park with his eyes  let us go across and see her he said  i looked at him doubtfully  can you walk as far i asked  he nodded  yes i have my stick and if necessary you can help me  so we set out across the park i asked him no questions he told me nothing but when we had crossed the road and were on our way up the avenue to dennisford house he clutched at my arm  i want to see heralone he muttered  i will see what i can do i answered lady dennisford and i are old friends  we reached the great sweep in front of the house i pointed to the terrace on which were several wicker chairs  the windows from the drawingroom where i shall probably see lady dennisford open out there i remarked if you could give me any message which would interest her perhaps  tell her he muttered that you have a guest who walked with her once under the orange trees at seville and whoin a few dayswill walk no more anywhere she will come  he made his way along the terrace leaning heavily upon his stick and sank with a little sigh of relief into one of the cushionladen wicker chairs i watched him lean back with halfclosed eyes and i realized then what an effort this walk must have been to him before me the great front doors stood open and with the familiarity of close neighborship i passed into the cool shaded hall with its palms and flowers its billiardtable invitingly uncovered its tiny fountain playing in its marble basin there was no one in sight but stretched upon a bright crimson cushion set back in the heart of a great easychair was a small japanese spaniel  our recognition was mutual the dog rose slowly to his haunches and sat there looking at me his applegreen bow had wandered to the side of his neck and one ear was turned back yet notwithstanding the fact that his appearance was so far grotesque i felt no inclinations whatever towards mirth his coalblack eyes were fixed upon me steadfastly his tiny wrinkled face seemed like the shrivelled and ageworn caricature of some eastern magician he showed no signs of pleasure or of welcome at my coming nor did he share any of the bewilderment with which i gazed at him but for the absurdity of the thing i should have said that he had been sitting there waiting for me  while i stood there dumfounded not so much in wonder at this meeting with the dog but amazed beyond measure at the things which his presence there seemed to indicate he descended carefully from his chair and crossing the smooth oaklaid floor he made his way to the foot of the great staircase and after a premonitory yawn he indulged in one sharp penetrating bark almost immediately the french maid came gliding down the stairs still gowned in the sombrest black still as pale as a woman could be the dog looked at her and looked at me then apparently conceiving that his duty was finished he returned to his chair and curled himself up i spoke to the maid  is your mistress staying here i asked  but yes monsieur she answered we arrived yesterday  is she in now i asked could i see her  i will inquire the maid answered mademoiselle is in her room  she turned and left me and almost immediately the butler entered the hall he was one of the local cricket eleven and had been in service in the neighborhood all his life so he knew me well and greeted me at once with respectful interest  is her ladyship in murray i asked  i believe so sir he answered will you come into the drawingroom  i followed him into lady dennisfords presence she was writing letters in a small sanctum leading out of the drawingroom and she looked round and nodded a cheery greeting to me  in one moment hardross she exclaimed ive just finished  i had known lady dennisford all my life but i found myself studying her now with altogether a new interest she was a slim elegant woman pale and perhaps a little insipid looking at ordinary times but a famous and reckless rider to hounds and an enthusiastic sportswoman she was one of the few women concerning whom i never heard a single breath of scandal notwithstanding her husbands long and frequent absences she gave me little time however to revise my impressions of her for with a little spluttering of her pen she finished her letter and came towards me  i hope youve come to lunch she remarked i have the most delightful young person staying with me youll be charmed with her  a young lady i remarked  yes an american girl who talks englishand doesnt enthuse seems to know something about horses too  where did you discover this paragon i asked  my cousin sent her down she knows everybody lady dennisford answered i met her at lunch last week and she spoke of hunting with the pytchley next season shes going to have a look at the country sorry the rain spoilt your match  i hesitated a moment  lady dennisford i said i had a particular reason for coming to see you this morning  she raised her eyebrows  my dear jim  i too have a visitor i told her rather a more mysterious person than yours seems to be he is very ill indeed and he is almost a stranger to me but he was once i believe a friend of yours  a friend of mine she repeated how interesting do tell me his name  i cannot do that i answered because i do not know itnot his real name but in the park this morning i happened to tell him who lived here and although he is very weak he insisted upon paying you an immediate visit  she looked around the room  but where is he she asked  he is outside on the terrace i answered  my dear jim she exclaimed really all this mystery isnt like you arent you overdoing it a little do call your friend in and let me see who he is  lady dennisford i said of course my guest may have misled me but he seemed to think that an abrupt meeting might be undesirable he wished me to tell you that he used once to walk with you under the orange trees of seville and to ask you to go out to him alone  lady dennisford sat quite still for several seconds her eyes were fixed upon me but i am quite certain that i had passed from within the orbit of her vision the things which she saw were of another worldsomehow it seemed sacrilege on my part to dream of peering even into the dimmest corner of it so i looked away and i could never tell altogether what effect my words had had upon her for when i looked up she was gone      chapter xiii  the shadow deepens   mr courage  i looked up quickly she was within a few feet of me although i had not heard even the rustling of her gown the dog with his applegreen bow now put to rights was sitting upon her shoulder by the side of his uncanny features it seemed to me that i had never sufficiently appreciated the fresh girlishness the almost ingenuous beauty of her own face she wore a plain white linen gown and a magnificent blossom of scarlet geraniums in her bosom  miss van hoyt i exclaimed  she nodded but glanced warningly at the window  they must not hear she said softly remember your cousin introduced you to me at lordsour only meeting  my heart sank i hated all this incomprehensible secrecy a moment before she had seemed so different  come out into the other room she said they cannot hear us from there we passed into the drawingroom an uncomfortable thought struck me  you were here all the time i exclaimed  certainly i wanted to hear you and lady dennisford converse  eavesdropping in fact i remarked savagely  precisely she agreed  we were silent for a moment her eyes were full of mild amusement  i thought she said demurely that you would be glad to see me  glad of course i am glad i answered im such a poor fool that i cant help it why did you leave me in london without a word  why on earth not she exclaimed smiling besides i knew that i should see you here very soon i had to act quickly too they did not wantshe glanced towards the terracehim to leave london  it was you then i remarked who had him sent down to my place  she nodded  it was not easy she said if they had known that you were going to have a doctor to visit him it would have been impossible  he has been poisoned i suppose i said calmly  she shrugged her shoulders  he will die and die very soon she answered that is certain but i think you will find no doctor here who will have anything to say about poison  she moved a little nearer to me the overhanging bunch of scarlet geraniums from her waistband brushed against my coat the beady black eyes of the dog upon her shoulder were fixed steadily upon me  has he said anything she murmured  not yet i answered  he will do so she declared confidently and before long that is why i am here you must come to me the momentthe very moment you know you understand that  yes i answered a little discontentedly i understand  her expression suddenly changed a frown darkened her face  perhaps she said you have already repented  repented of what i asked quickly  that you have moved a little out of the rut that you have taken a hand even if it is a dummys hand in the game of life do you wish to draw back  no i answered  do you wish to be relieved of leslie guest i could arrange it it would be a matter of a few hours only  no i answered again i wish for one thing only  and that  you know i declared  she turned a little way from me  i am not a magician she declared  and yet you know i answered a woman always does i have no idea what these ties are which seem to bind you to a life of mystery and doubledealing but i should like to cut them loose you have talked to me of ambition of a larger life where excitement and tragedy walk hand in hand i should like to sweep all that away i should like to convert you to my point of view  she looked at me curiously never in my experience of her sex had i seen any one who varied so quickly in appearance who seemed to pass with such effortless facility from the girl with the madonnalike face and dreamy eyes to the thoughtful and scheming woman of the world her rapid changes were a torture to me i felt the elusiveness of her attitude  you would like me she said scornfully to lead your village life to watch the seasons pass from behind your windows i was not born for that sort of thing the thirst for life was in my veins from the nursery you and i are as far apart as the north star and the unknown land over which it watches sin itself would be less terrible to me than the indolence of such a life  you have never tried it i remarked  nor shall i ever she answered unless  unless what  she raised her eyebrows and flashed a sudden strange look upon me there was mockery in it subtlety and a certain uneasiness which pleased me most after all she was like a beautiful wild young creature the ways of her life were not yet wholly decreed  unless the great magician comes and waves his wand she declared the magic may fall upon my eyes you know and i may see new things  i touched her hand for a moment the dogs face was wrinkled like a monkeys he growled and his narrow red tongue shot out threateningly  it is that i murmured which i shall pray for  she raised her head suddenly we heard lady dennisford moving upon the terrace she leaned over towards me  leslie guest she whispered will not live for more than fortyeight hours make him tell youtonight tomorrow may be too late do you heartonight  i was absolutely tonguetied wherever else she failed she was certainly a superb actress a moment ago she had been keeping my earnestness at bay with bantering words then at the sound of lady dennisfords approach had come those few dramatic words and now at her entrance i felt at once that i was the casual guest being entertained as a matter of duty during my hostess absence  i told you didnt i that i had met mr courage in town she remarked looking up after all it is such a small world isnt it  lady dennisford was scarcely in a condition to be observant i believe that if we had been sitting hand in hand she would scarcely have noticed the fact she was very pale and her eyes were exceedingly bright she passed halfway through the room without even seeming to realize our presence then she stopped suddenly and addressed me  i am ordering a ponycart she said to take mr guest back he seems overfatigued  very thoughtful of you lady dennisford i answered we certainly did not mean to walk so far when we came out into the park  a servant entered the room she gave him some orders and then with a word of excuse to adèle she came over to my side  hardross she said softly what is the matter with him  general breakdown i answered i do not know of anything else  what does the doctor say  the london doctor i admitted gave little hope rust cannot discover that anything much is the matter with him  you yourselfwhat do you think  i hesitated her fingers gripped my arm  i think that he is very ill i answered  dying  i should not be surprised  she looked back towards the terrace her eyes were full of tears  do what you can for him she said softly he was once a great friend of mine he was different then will you go out to him now i promised to send you  guest was sitting upon the terrace exactly as i had left him his eyes were fixed upon vacancy his lips were slightly curled in a meditative smile there was a distinct change in his appearance his expression was more peaceful the slight restlessness had disappeared from his manner but he had never looked to me more like a dying man  lady dennisford sent me out i remarked she has ordered a ponycart to take us home  he nodded  i am quite ready he said  he tried to rise but the effort seemed too much for him i hastened to his aid or i think that he would have fallen he leaned on my arm heavily as we passed on our way to the avenue where a carriage was already awaiting us  i was once he remarked in an ordinary conversational tone engaged to be married to lady dennisford  there was nodisagreement between you i asked  none that has not been healed he answered softly  you would consider her today as a friendnot a likely enemy i asked  he looked at me curiously  she is my friend he answered softly of that there is no doubt at all why do you ask  because i answered for your friend she has a strange guest  whom do you mean he asked  mademoiselle and her maidand poodle i answered they are all here  i felt him shiver for he was leaning heavily upon me nevertheless he answered me with confidence  it is the gathering of the jackals he mutteredthe jackals who are going to be disappointed but you may be sure of one thing my friend the young lady is here as an ordinary guest that was a matter very easy to arrange there is a great social backing behind her she can come and go where she pleases but lady dennisfords knowledge of her is wholly innocent  we drove back almost in silence rust was waiting for us when we arrived and he eyed his patient curiously and hurried him off to the house they were alone together for some time and when he came out his face was very grave he came out into the garden in search of me  courage he said i wish to heavens i had never seen your guest  what do you mean i asked have you been quarrelling  quarrelling no one doesnt quarrel with a dying man he answered  a dying man i repeated  he nodded  he was on the verge of a collapse just now he said i honestly fear that he will not live many more hours yet though i could fill in his death certificate plausibly enough if you were to ask me honestly today what was the matter with him i could not tell you do you mind if i wire for a friend of mine to come down and see him  by all means i answered you mean a specialist i suppose  yes  on the heart i asked  no a toxicologist rust remarked dryly  i glanced into his face he was in deadly earnest  you believe  what the devil is one to believe the doctor exclaimed irritably the man is sound but he is dying if i told you that i understood his symptoms i should be a liar i can think only of one thing you yourself gave me the idea  wire by all means i said  i shall go to the village rust said and return immediately dont let him be left alone he has a draught to take in case of necessity  i turned back to the house with a sigh i am afraid that i had as little faith in medicine as guest himself     chapter xiv  gathering jackals   guest for the remainder of the morning seemed to have fallen into a sort of stupor he declined to sit in the garden or come down to lunch when i went up to his room he was lying upon a couch half undressed and with a dressinggown wrapped around him he opened his eyes when i came in but waved me away  i am thinking he said dont interrupt me i want to be alone for an hour or so  but you must have something to eat i insisted you will lose your strength if you dont  quite right he admitted send me up some soup and let me have pencil and paper  he was supplied with both when i went up an hour later he was smoking a cigarette and writing  i do not wish he said to be worried with any more doctors it is only a farce and i have little time to spare  nonsense i answered rust declares that there is very little the matter with you he has sent for a friend to come and have a look at you  a little gesture of impatience escaped him  my dear courage he said i am obliged to you for all this care but i am quite sure that in your inner consciousness you realize as i do that it is sheer waste of time  he drew his dressinggown a little closer around him the hollows under his eyes seemed to have grown deeper since the morning  i am fairly run to earth he continued even these few hours of life i owe to my enemies they hope to profit by them of course if you are the man i think you are they will be mistaken but dont waste my time with doctors  he began to write again i made some perfunctory remark which he entirely ignored just then i was called away he watched my departure with obvious relief  i was told that a stranger was waiting to see me in the library my first thought was of the doctor when i arrived there i found a young man whose face was familiar but whom i could not at once place then like a flash i remembered it was the younger of the two men who had forced their way into my room at the hotel universal  now i was in no very good humor for dealing with these gentry i had a distinct inclination to take him by the collar of the coat and throw him out i fancy that he divined from my face how i was feeling for he began hastily to explain his presence  i am very sorry to be an intruder mr courage he said in his slow precise english i had no wish to come at all we were willing to leave you undisturbed but we do not understand why you have sent for a doctor from londonand especially professor kauppmann  i looked at him deliberately he was wearing english clothesa dark tweed suit illcut and apparently readymade but the foreigner was written large all over him from the tie of his bow to his narrow patent boots his eyes were fixed anxiously upon melarge black eyes with long feminine eyelashes i think that if he had not been under the shelter of my own roof i must have laid violent hands upon him  why the devil should you understand i exclaimed mr guest is my visitor and if i choose to send for a doctor to see him it is my business and nobody elses if you have come here with any idea of bullying me i am afraid you have wasted your time  you have evidently he answered not troubled yourself to understand the situation mr guest is our prisoner  your what i exclaimed  our prisoner the young man answered let me ask you this has mr guest himself encouraged you in your attempt to interfere between him and his inevitable fate no i am sure that he has not he accepts what he knows must happen a few days more or less of lifewhat do they matter  you make me feel inclined i said grimly to test your theory  the young man stepped back my fingers were itching to take him by the throat and i think that he read the desire in my face  will you allow me to see mr guest he asked  no im dd if i will i answered i shall give you i added with my hand upon the bell exactly two minutes to leave this house  the young man smiled superciliously but he picked up his hat  i suppose mr courage i must not blame you he remarked you have all the characteristics of your countrypeople you meet a delicate situation with the tactics of a bull  i laid my hand gently but firmly upon his shoulder we were halfway down the hall now and the front door was wide open i longed to throw him out but i restrained myself he was perfectly conscious i am sure of my inclination but he showed no signs of uneasiness  i admit i said calmly that you seem all of you to be engaged in proceedings of an extraordinary nature which i do not in the least understand but under my own roof at any rate i am master i will not tolerate any interference with my guests and as for mr stanley from liverpool and you whatever you may call yourself i will not have you near the place you see my lodge gates i added pointing down the avenue i shall stand here until you have passed through them if you come again you will meet with a different reception  the young man laughed unpleasantly  never fear mr courage he answered always we try first the simple means if they should fail we have many surer ways of gaining our ends au revoir  he left me and walked briskly off down the avenue i fetched a pair of fieldglasses and watched him until he reached the lodge gates a few moments later i saw him climb into a motor car and vanish in a cloud of dust  later in the afternoon a victoria drew up before my front door just as i was starting for the village lady dennisford leaned forward as i approached she was closely veiled but her voice shook with anxiety  how is he she asked  it is hard to say i answered he has been writing for the last three hours i was just going down to see if rust has heard from the london man he wired for  do you know why she whispered he is so sure that he is going to die  i hesitated for a moment  he seems to imagine i said that he has some enemies  she sighed  i am afraid she said that it is no imagination  i looked at her in surprise  he has told me perhaps she said a little hastily more than he has told you and perhaps i am in a better position to understand mr courage i wonder whether it would be possible for me to have an interview with any one of these men who are watching him  if you had been here a few hours ago i said it would have been very possible indeed one of them was here  what did he want she asked sharply  to see mr guest for one thing  did you allow it  no guest is writing secrets with a loaded revolver by his side he certainly does not want to see any of that crew  oh he is mad she murmured why should he not buy his life what else is there that counts  there are two to a bargain i answered i do not think that he has value to give  oh he has she answered if only he would be reasonable  we were silent for a moment in the distance coming up the avenue was the figure of a man i watched him with curiosity finally i pointed him out to lady dennisford  do you see this man coming up to the house i saida sleek middleaged man smoking a cigar  i see him she answered  what do you think he looks like i asked  a prosperous tradesman she answered a friend of your bailiffs perhaps  he calls himself mr stanley from liverpool i answered and you can bargain with him for guests life  he is one of them she exclaimed  he is i answered grimly for i had good reason to know it  she got out of the carriage at once  i am going to meet him she said no please let me go alone she added as i prepared to accompany her afterwards we may need you  i sent her carriage round to the stables and i stood upon my steps watching her slim and elegant she walked with swift level footsteps towards the approaching figure i saw him shade his eyes with his hand as she approached when she was within a few yards of him he took his cigar from his mouth and raised his hat they stood for a moment or two talking then lady dennisford turned and they both came slowly towards the house as they drew near me she came on rapidly ahead  he is willing she declared he will make terms where can we talk alone we three  i led the way to my study mr stanley greeted me affably and with a commendable assumption of bluff respect  fine place of yours mr courage he declared very fine place indeed no wonder you prefer a country life finest thing in the world  i made a pretence of answering him but when we were in the study and the door was closed behind us i felt that there was no longer any need to mince words  mr stanley i said lady dennisford says that you are willing to abandon your persecution of my guest for a consideration  he smiled upon us slowly  persecution he remarked thoughtfully well it is a harmless word mind i admit nothing but i am willing to hear what you have to say  this first then i declared will you tell me why as a magistrate of this county i should not be justified in signing a warrant for your apprehension  on what charge he asked  conspiracy to murder i answered  he seemed to consider the suggestion with perfect seriousness  yes he admitted it could be done putting myself in your place i should even imagine that it might be the most obvious course but have you considered what the probable result would be  it would keep you out of mischief for a time at any rate  not for a day he answered softly in the first place the slenderness of your evidence which by the by when the affair came to trial would disappear altogether would necessitate bail and in the second were i to be swept off the face of the earth there are thousands ready to take my place besides no man likes to make himself the laughing stock of his friends and the press and forgive me mr courage if i remind you that that is precisely what would happen in your case  suppose for a moment then said that i abandon that possibility make your own proposals i do not know who you are or what you stand for i do not know whether this is an affair of private vengeance or whether you stand for others that poor fellow upstairs cannot have a long life before him in any case what is there we can offer you to leave him in peace  you twonothing mr stanley said gravely he himself can buy his life from us if he wills  then can ior lady dennisford here i asked be your ambassador can we tell him your terms  mr stanley shook his head  it is impossible he said matters would have to be discussed between us which may not even be mentioned before any other person  you mean that you would have to see him alone  precisely  i turned to lady dennisford  he would never consent i declared  you must make him she answered mr courage  lady dennisford  let me speak to you alone for a moment she begged laying her hand upon my arm mr stanley will excuse us i am sure  by all means he declared selecting an easychair  you will await us here i asked  certainly  on parole  on parole if you will give me a cigar  i rang the bell for refreshments then lady dennisford and i left the room together     chapter xv  a dying man   i had known lady dennisford for a good many years in a neighborly sort of way but the woman who stood before me in the small sittingroom to which i had led her was a stranger to me she had raised her veil she was as pale as a woman may be and her mouth usually so firm and uncompromising was now relaxed and tremulous before she spoke i knew that tragedy was in the room with me she tried to speak twice before the words came  mr courage she said may i speak to you as a friend  most certainly you can lady dennisford i answered  i said and i meant it for i was exceedingly sorry for her  once i was to have married him she said and i have cared for no one else all my life there was a great scandala political scandaland it was he upon whom the burden fell his lips were sealed i did not understand then but i understand now i sent him away i joined with the others who persecuted him and all the timeall the time he was innocent  her last words were almost a wail i was relieved to see that the tears were in her eyes at last  it was very hard fortune i said awkwardly  his life has been one long exile she said he has never married he has been dead to the world for many years his name of course is not leslie guest if i dared tell you you would understand i want himoh i want him so much to have a few years of happiness  what can we do lady dennisford i asked earnestly  take me up to him leave me with him alone  i opened the door  at once i said  he was still writing the air of the room was thick with cigarette smoke i opened the door gently and lady dennisford glided past me i myself hastened downstairs  mr stanley was apparently very comfortable he was smoking one of my best cigars and a whisky and soda stood at his elbow he looked up from behind the times as i entered  lady dennisford is with him i said she will endeavor to persuade him to see you  excellent he remarked pray do not trouble to stay with me if you have other matters to attend to i have both time and patience to spare  i went out into the garden i began to feel the need of being alone events had marched rapidly with me during the last few hours and i was not used to such eruptions in my quiet life i gave a few orders to my bailiff and gamekeeper who were waiting to see me i little guessed then how unimportant to me would be the prospects of the coming sport it must have been nearly an hour before a servant found me and announced that my guest desired to see me in his room i hastened there at once  lady dennisford was sitting at the table by guests side she looked up as i entered and i saw that the shadows lay deeper still upon her face  he chooses death she said simply  he leaned over and touched her hand his tone and manner had softened wonderfully  eleanor he said earnestly it is not i who choose there is no choice your friend downstairs would say tell me all that you know of a certain matter and the sentence which has been passed upon you shall be held over but when i had told him when he knew everything no agreement no promise could possibly be binding i could not myself expect it in his place i should make very sure that in a matter of hours i was a dead man i say that myself whose whole life has been sacrificed to a matter in which honor was largely concerned  lady dennisford began to weep softly he laid his hand upon hers  are you sure mr guest i said that you are not exaggerating the importance of this secret knowledge of yours i dare say that mr stanley like every other man has his price if money  he interrupted me with a slight gesture of impatience  my young friend he said i am not a poor man mr stanley is not to be dealt with as a single individual he represents a system i do not blame you for not being able to grasp these things there is scarcely one englishman in a thousand who would i think that you have shown a great amount of trust as it is believe me now when i tell you that there are only two things in the world which can be done for me the first is that you leave me a few minutes to say goodbye to lady dennisford and the second that you keep every one away from me for one hour while i finishthese documents  i left them alone there was nothing else which i could do and i waited in the hall below for lady dennisford  when she came she walked like a woman in a dream her veil was close drawn and i could not see her face but i was very sure that she had been weeping i had already ordered her carriage round and she took her place in it without a word  i went back to the man whom i had left in the library  he had lighted a fresh cigar and was showing no signs of impatience  our friend i said has asked for one hour for consideration if you will allow me i should be pleased to show you the gardens and stables  he accepted my offer at once and proved himself an intelligent sightseer he seemed to know a little about everything including horses i took him on to the orchidhouses and it was quite an hour and a half before we returned to the house i left him once more in the library and i was on my way upstairs when i came face to face with rust and another man on their way down for a moment i was speechless  professor kauppmann was unfortunately indisposed rust explained but he has sent this gentleman downdr kretznow mr courage curiously enough dr kretznow has already been called in to attend our friend upstairs  mr courage no doubt remembers me the newcomer remarked i am sorry to find our patient no better  i looked him steadily in the face  you think that he will die i asked  i must admit the doctor answered that i think he has very little chance of recovery his constitution has gone he has no recuperative powers  rust drew me a little on one side  you will be relieved to hear he said that dr kretznow considers his state quite a natural one he does not encourage in any way the suspicions which i must admit i had formed  indeed i answered  we are going to try an altogether new treatment rust continued as we stood together upon the landing i think perhaps you ought to know however that our friend here gives very little hope  i nodded  i shall leave you to entertain dr kretznow i said for a few minutes i want to see mr guest  i found him anxiously awaiting me he had ceased writing but he held a roll of papers in his hand and there was an ominous bulge in the pocket of his dressinggown he had more color than i had yet seen him with and his eyes were unusually bright  for heavens sake come in courage and close the door he said irritably you see the result of your little doctor meddling with things he does not understand i could have told you that no one would be allowed to enter these doors who might possibly give them away  we sent for kauppmann i explained  of course you will not realize what you are up against you might as well have sent for the angel gabriel now will you do exactly as i ask you  go on i said  ring for your man and let him sit in the room with me go downstairs and get rid of those doctors then come up yourself and be prepared to spend at least three hours here  i obeyed him i kept silent as to the fact that stanley was in the house i thought that he was already sufficiently excited downstairs i found that dr kretznow was on the eve of departure i did not seek to detain him for a moment rust i think wondered a little at my apparent lack of courtesy but i almost bundled them out of the house  he offered me his hand as he climbed up into the dogcart which i pretended however not to see  mind i give you very little hope mr courage he said i studied the case very seriously in london and i perceived symptoms which our friend here has not yet had the opportunity of observing my own opinion is that his time is short  i am sorry to hear you say so doctor i answered for i quite believe that you are in a position to know  he blinked at me for a moment from behind his thick spectacles and i fancied that he was going to say something more apparently however he changed his mind and the carriage drove off i made my way at once into the library mr stanley was still awaiting me  my mission i announced has been a failure he declines even to discuss the matter  mr stanley knocked the ash off his cigar and rose to his feet his face showed neither disappointment nor surprise  the lady i am afraid he remarked will be sorry  it will be a great blow to her i answered if he should die  mr stanley shrugged his shoulders  he will die and very soon he declared you and i know that very well you are a young man mr courage he added very slowly and with his eyes fixed intently upon me you have a beautiful home and a simple useful lifea long one i trustbefore you mr guest is not by any means old but he made enemies it is never wise to make enemies  is this a warning i asked  accept it as one if a warning is necessary he answered take my advice if leslie guest or the man who is dying upstairs has a legacy to leave let him choose another legatee there is death in that legacy for you  death comes to all of us i answered we must take our risks  he picked up his hat  number 317 was it not he repeated thoughtfully an unlucky number for you i fear  by the bye mademoiselle is in the neighborhood  what of it i asked  he looked at me long and curiously then he sighed and lit still another of my finest havanas as he prepared to depart  you will be better off he said without that legacy     chapter xvi  i take up my legacy   towards dawn i lit another lamp in my study and chanced to catch a glimpse of my face in a small mirror which stood upon my writingtable almost involuntarily i glanced over my shoulder expecting to find another man there it was a moments madness but as a matter of fact i did not recognize myself it seemed to me that the change in the man upstairs who had passed from the world of living things with breath in his body and life in his brain to the cold negation of death was a change no greater than had come to me for i was passing as i knew very well from behind the fences of my somewhat narrow but wellcontained life into the great world of tragical happenings where life and death are but small things and ones self but a pawn in the great game this because i believed because i had accepted the trust of the man who a few hours ago had closed his eyes with his hand in mine and the faint welcoming smile upon his lips of a brave but weary man who finds nothing terrible in death  there was something almost fearful in a change so absolute and vital as that which had come over my life i realized this as i allowed myself a few moments rest and threw myself upon the sofa the old outlook the old ideas had been torn up by the root the things which had seemed to be of life itself only a few hours ago seemed now to have lapsed into the insignificance of trifles i thought of myself and my old life with the tolerance of one who watches a child at play sport and all its kindred delightsthe whole glorification of the physical lifei viewed as a stock exchange man might view the gambling for marbles of his youth it was incredible that i had ever even fancied myself content my brain was still in a whirl but it seemed to me that i was already conscious of new powers my thoughts travelled more quickly i felt a greater alertness of brain a swifter rush of ideas but it seemed to me also that something had gone that never again would i find my way lie through the rose gardens of life  i must have dozed for a time upon the sofa and was awakened by a soft tapping upon the low oldfashioned windows which opened upon the terrace i sprang up and for a moment it seemed to me that i must be dreaming it was adèle who stood there all in white with sunlight around her i gasped for a moment and then recovered myself it was adèle sure enough in a white linen riding habit and morning had come while i slept but i knew then that one link at least remained with the old life  she tapped upon the windowpane a little imperiously and i threw open the sash her eyes were fixed upon my face i think that she too saw the change with the opening of the window came a rush of sweet fresh air she stepped into the room  dont look at me as though i were something unreal she exclaimed i told them that i was fond of early morning rides and i saw your light burning here from the park tell meis he worse  i was suddenly calm i realized that this was the beginning  he is dead i answered he died about midnight  there was a momentary horror in her face for which i was gratefuli scarcely knew why  dead she repeated softly so soon  she looked around the room and back at me  turn out the lamps she said this light is ghastly  there was little more color in her face than mine even the sunlight seemed cold and cheerless she came a little nearer to me  he was consciousat the end  yes i answered  her breath seemed to be coming a little faster her eyes were full of eager questioning  you were with him  yes  again there was a pause i was steadfastly silent  dont keep me in suspense she muttered he told you  yes i answered he told mecertain things  she drew a long breath of relief i could see that she was trembling all over she sank into a chair  i felt that he would she declared i knew that he could not carry his secret to the grave is the door locked  yes i answered the door is locked  she was still pale but her eyes were burning  go on she said dont lose a moment i am waiting  for what i asked calmly  to hear everything she answered quickly  i have nothing to tell you i said  she stamped her foot with the petulance of a spoilt child  oh how dense you are she exclaimed repeat to me exactly what he said to younow before you forget a single word  i cannot do that i said  she leaned a little forward in her chair even then she did not understand  what do you mean she asked  i mean that the things which he told me with his last breath were for my own ear and my own knowledge alone i answered i cannot share that knowledge even with you  it seemed to me that there was something unreal almost hideous about the silence which followed through the open window there drifted into the room the early morning sounds of an awakening worldthe whistling of birds in the shrubberies and upon the lawn the more distant whir of a reaping machine at work in the cornfields but between ussilence i could not move my eyes from her face there was no anger there only a slowly dawning horror she seemed to be looking upon me as a man doomed i lit a match and taking some papers from my pocket i slowly destroyed them  there go the last records i said blowing the ashes away i have learnt them by heart  i never thought of this she murmured i never thought that you might beoh you cannot understand she broke off you cannot know what you are doing  i have an idea i answered grimly he warned me  yet you cannot understand she persisted do you know that even in saying this much to me you are signing your deathwarrantthat from this moment your life will not be safe for a single moment  i know that there is danger i answered but i am not an easy person to kill i have had narrow escapes before and escaped without a scratch  she rose to her feet  if only i could make you understand she muttered  leslie guest did his best i answered he told me what the last few years of his life had been i know that i have to face great odds i can but do my best we only die once  then she came swiftly over to me and laid her hands upon my shoulders there was now something more human in her face her eyes seemed to plead with mine and the joy of her near presence was a very real and subtle thing i felt my eyes kindle and my heart beat fast there was no other danger to be compared with this  i did not dream that this might happen she said softly i meant to use you as a tool i even thought that you had consented oh i am sorry i shall be sorry all my life that i asked you to bring him here will you listen to me for a moment  i am listening all the time i answered taking one of her hands in mine  have you realized what all this means she continued are you prepared to give up your life here your sports your beautiful home to feel that you have spies and enemies on every side working always in the dark against you the man who lies dead upstairs knew every move of the gameyet you see what has happened to him how can you hope to succeed when he failed forget last night my friend i believe that it was a nightmare and i too will forget what you have told me come it is not too late we will say that he died suddenly in a stupor and that whatever his secrets were he carried them with him is it agreed  i shook my head  one cannot break faith with the dead i answered that is amongst the impossible things let us speak no more of it  she leaned towards me her breath was upon my cheek and her eyes shone into mine  men have done more than this she murmured when a woman has pleadedandit is for your own sake think must i count you amongst my enemies  god only knows why you should i answered i am no judge of others but if i betrayed the trust of a dead man even for the sake of the woman i loved i should put a bullet in my brain sooner or later what i cannot understand dear is why you are not on my side you are practically an englishwoman what have you to do with leslie guests enemies  she turned away sadly  there are some things she said which cannot be altered you and i are on opposite sides we may as well say goodbye we shall never meet again like this  i cannot believe it i answered there are many things which seem dark enough in the future to me but i shall never believe that this is our goodbye  it seemed to me strange afterwards that of the immediate future neither of us spoke i did not even ask her how long she was going to stay with lady dennisford she did not speak to me of my plans as she had come so she went silently and unexpectedly she would not even let me follow her out onto the terrace from the window i watched her mount her horse and ride away only just before she went she had looked back  i must see you again she said you too must have time to think i am going to forget this morning i am going to forget that i have seen you you too must do the same  forget she asked a hard thing     chapter xvii  nagaskis instinct   i was busy all the morning sending and receiving telegrams and making certain plans on my own account rust was with me a good deal of the time but the visitor whose coming i was expecting every minute did not arrive till early in the afternoon i sent out word to mr stanley that i was exceedingly busy and should be glad to be excused but as i had confidently expected he was insistent in about a quarter of an hour i received him in the library  he sank softly into the chair towards which i had pointed for a moment he sat and blinked at me behind his goldrimmed spectacles  so our friend he murmured has passed away it is very sadvery sad indeed  i leaned back in my chair and regarded him steadfastly  mr stanley i said you did not come here to express your sympathy with the man whom you have done your best if not to kill at least to frighten to death ask me all the questions you want tosay anything you think necessary only finish it up when you leave this room let me feel that circumstances will not require any further meeting between us  my words seemed to afford mr stanley matter for thought his brows were slightly puckered i knew that from behind his glasses i was being subjected to a very keen examination  i only trust mr courage he said softly that the wish you have expressed may become a possibility i myself have always regretted your intervention in this affair you are if you will forgive my saying so in strange waters  i dont know about that i answered curtly i dont see now how i could have done other than i have done but anyhow im sick of it i dont want to seem discourteous but if you could manage to say to me in the course of a quarter of an hour all that you have to say and ask all the questions you want to i should be glad to have done with the whole business once and for all  my visitor nodded thoughtfully  very good mr courage he said i will endeavor to imitate your frankness is there to be a postmortem  there is not i answered dr rust does not consider it necessary and i am forced to confess that i cannot see anything to be gained by it you and your friends may have been responsible for his death i cannot say at any rate i am sure that we should never be able to fix the guilt in the proper quarter  mr stanley shrugged his shoulders slightly  i must congratulate you upon your common sense mr courage he said i pass on now to a more important question did our friend before he died impart to you any of the hallucinations under which he suffered are you his legatee  i am not i answered i believe that he meant me to be but his death when it came was quite sudden all the secret information i had from him was his name and the address of his lawyers  there was a short silence i was able to bear with perfect calmness the keen scrutiny to which my visitor was subjecting me  i congratulate you heartily mr courage he said at last mr guests story if he had told it to you would have been a mixture of stolen facts and hallucinations which might have influenced your life very forcibly for evil i wished for his death i admit it freely but i wished it for this reason because in all europe yesterday there did not breathe a more dangerous man than the man who called himself leslie guest  well he has gone i said and his life so far as i know of it has been a very sad one i have already explained to you my wishes in the matter i want to forget as speedily as possible the events of the last eight days  i should like mr stanley said to see him  i am sorry i answered but that is impossible the nurses are busy in the room now and apart from that the dead at least should have peace from their enemies of one thing i can assure you every scrap of paper he had with him is burnt there is nothing about him or the room which could be of interest to you i have sent for his lawyer and am making arrangements for the funeral there is nothing more to be said or done except to say good afternoon to you mr stanley  he rose slowly up from his chair  you are a little precipitate mr courage he said but i do not know that i can blame you do you object to telling me when the funeral will be  i am not myself informed at present i answered i am waiting for the arrival of the lawyer  i had risen to my feet and was standing with the handle of the door in my hand mr stanley took the hint yet i fancied that he departed unwillingly  i should like he admitted to have seenhim and also the lawyer  then you can find another opportunity i answered stiffly mr guests friends would receive every consideration from me his enemies i must admit i cannot under the circumstances see the back of too quickly  mr stanley had no alternative but to depart which he did with as good a grace as possible i was glad to be alone for a few minutes my ordinary share of the vices of life both great and small i was without a doubt possessed of but i had never been a liar i had never looked a man in the face and made statements which i had known at the time were absolutely and entirely false this was my first essay in a new role  my next visitor was a very different sort of person a fair florid little man with easy courteous manners and dressed in deep mourning he introduced himself as mr raynes of raynes and bishop solicitors lincolns inn and alluded to the telegram which i had sent him earlier in the morning  may i inquire he asked after we had exchanged a few commonplaces if you are aware that mr leslie guest was an assumed name of the deceased  i was in his confidence towards the last i answered he told me a good deal of his history  the lawyer nodded sympathetically  a very sad one i fear you found it he remarked  very sad indeed i assented  i have here he continued lord leslies will and instructions as to his burial i presume you would like me to take entire charge of all the arrangements  certainly i answered  his lordship wished to be buried very quietly in the nearest churchyard to the place where he died the lawyer continued i presume that can be arranged  quite easily i answered the clergyman is waiting to see you now if you like i will take you to him  in the hall we met lady dennisford she was plainly dressed in black and she carried a great bunch of white roses i introduced mr raynes to the vicar and hurried back to her  you would like to see him i asked  she nodded and i led the way upstairs i opened the door and closed it again softly leaving them alone  i descended into the hall and there upon the steps looking at me with black beady eyes deep set in his wrinkled face was my friend or rather my enemy nagaski he eyed my approach with gloomy disfavor he opened his mouth in a seeming yawn a little red tongue shot out from between his ivory teeth then i heard him called by a familiar voice and passing out i found his mistress leaning back in the corner of lady dennisfords victoria  she welcomed me with a slow curious smile  i will get out she said there is something i should like to say to you  i handed her down she led the way on to the terrace a few paces behind nagaski with drooping head and depressed mien followed us when we halted he sat upon his haunches and watched me  nagaski i remarked does not seem to be quite himself today  it is your presence she answered which affects him he dislikes you  i looked at him thoughtfully if nagaski disliked me i was very sure that i returned the sentiment to a most unreasonable extent  i wonder why i said i have always been decent to him  nagaski has antipathies she said quietly it is a good thing that we are not in his own country there his breed are supposed to have some of the qualities of seers and his dislike would be a very ominous thing  are you superstitious i asked  i am not sure she answered gravely if i were i should certainly avoid you his attitude is a distinct warning  i drew a little nearer to her it seemed to me that she was very pale and there was trouble in her face  do you think it possible i asked that i could bring sorrow upon you  very possible indeed she murmured avoiding my eyes and looking steadily across the park  since when have you discovered this i asked  within the last hour she answered  i laid my hand upon hers she withdrew it at once there was a distinct change in her manner towards me  i suppose she remarked that i ought to congratulate you you are certainly cleverer than i gave you credit for you have deceived mr stanley and he is not at all an easy person for a beginner to deceive  i kept silence i began to see the trouble into which i was drifting  but she continued you did not attempt to deceive me and in this matter mr stanley and i are one  you have told him i exclaimed  not yet she answered but i am forced to do so unless  unless what  she looked me in the face  unless you give me your word of honor that you make no attempt to carry on the task which leslie guest had assigned himself that you do not regard yourself in any shape or form as his successor dont you see that it must be so you plead that you must keep faith with the dead i at least must keep faith with the living i offer you a chance of safety and i beg you to take it i can do no more  there was a sharp little yap from nagaski we looked around lady dennisford had come out we turned towards her nagaski trotted on ahead his demeanor was generally more brisk and his expression one of relief a cloud of anxiety seemed to have rolled away from his small brain adèle pointed to him significantly  you see she said his instinct is right there are evil things between you and me if i speak there is no hope for you and if i keep silent there is danger for me and i am a woman forsworn if only i had never gone to lords and seen you play cricket  would that have helped us i asked  of course i should never have counted upon you as a possible tool i saw you strain every nerve in your body to catch a ball and i judged you by your pursuits andall this has come of it nagaski was right we go ill together you and i and one of us must suffer  i can only pray then i answered as i handed her into the carriage that it may be i  nagaski sprang upon his mistress lap and his was the only farewell i received as the carriage drove away his upper lip was drawn back over his red gums there was something fiendish and uncanny in his snarl and the hatred which shone from his tiny black eyes i watched the carriage until it disappeared he had not moved he was still looking back at me     chapter xviii  in the death chamber   i sat up suddenly in bed and turned on the light it was barely two oclock by my watch but i felt sure that i had not been mistaken some one had knocked at my door  in the act of springing out of bed the sound was repeated this time there was certainly no mistake about it and i heard my name called  mr courage mr courage  i opened the door the landing was dimly lit and i could see little else except the figure of the woman who stood there with one hand she was leaning against the wall her face was as white as a sheet she wore a hastily thrown on dressinggown of dingy red her whole appearance was that of a person convulsed with fright  who are you i asked what do you want  her lips parted she seemed to have the intention of speaking but no words came her teeth began to chatter  come i said brusquely you mustwhy you are the nurse whom dr rust sent arent you i asked suddenly recognizing her what is the matter with you are you ill  all the time although she was silent her eyes distended and terrorstricken were fixed upon me she nodded feebly  somethingis wrong she faltered at last come  she turned away still with one hand holding on to the wall she evidently wished me to follow her  one moment i said wait while i put something on  i turned back into my room and wrapped my dressinggown around me then i followed her along the corridor she led the way to the room which had been occupied by leslie guest outside the door she hesitated she turned and faced me abruptly she was white to the lips her appearance was horrible  i dare not go in she moaned i have been a nurse for fifteen years and i have never known anything like this  like what i asked bewildered what is it that has happened  she shivered but she did not answer me i was beginning to feel impatient  are you hysterical i asked i wish you would try and tell me what is the matter  go in she answered go in and seeif you can see anything  i opened the door and entered the room was dimly lit by a lamp placed on the table near the window upon the bed covered by a sheet his waxenlike face alone visible was the body of the man who had been my guest beyond with the connecting door wide open was the anteroom where the nurse had been sleeping except for the ticking of a clock there was no sound to be heard there was no sign anywhere of any disturbance or disorder i looked back at the nurse for an explanation  what is it that has upset you so i asked i can see nothing wrong  she pointed to the bed  his eyes she murmured go and look  i walked over to the bedside and leaned reverently over the still figure suddenly i felt as though i were turned to stone the blood in my veins ran cold i staggered back my gaze had been met with an upturned glassy stare from a pair of wideopened deepset eyes  good god i cried his eyes are open  the nurse who had gained a little courage came to my side  i closed them myself she whispered i closed them carefully i thought that i heard a noise and i came in i lit a lamp and i sawwhat you can see fifteen years i have been a nurse and i have watched by the dead more times than i can count but i have never known that happen  once more i approached the bedside one arm was drawn up a little from under the clothes i noticed its somewhat unnatural position and pointed it out to the nurse  did you leave it like that i asked  her teeth chattered  no she answered the arms were quite straight some one has been in the roomor  or what tasked  he must have moved she whispered in an unnatural tone  once more i bent over the still form the pupils of the wideopen eyes were slightly dilated they seemed to meet mine with a horrible unseeing directness there was no sign about his waxen face or still cold mouth that life had lingered for a moment beyond the stated period and yet something of the nurses terror was slowly becoming communicated to me i felt that i was in close company with mysterious things  i turned towards the nurse  go to your room i said and shut yourself in there i am going to send for dr rust understand it is you that are ill i do not want a word of this to be spoken of amongst the servants  she passed into her room and closed the door without a word i had a telephone from my room to the stables and in a few moments i had succeeded in awakening one of the grooms  the nurse is ill i told him take a dogcart and go down and fetch dr rust ask him to come back with you at once  i heard his answer and a few minutes later the sound of wheels in the avenue then i put on my clothes and going downstairs fetched some brandy and took it up to the nurse she too was dressed and although she was still pale she had recovered her selfpossession  i am very sorry to have been so foolish sir she said declining the brandy i have never had an experience like this before and it rather upset me  you think i asked that he has lived since  i am sure of it she answered his was a very peculiar illness and i know that it puzzled the doctor very much it was just the sort of illness to have led to a case of suspended animation  you think it possible i asked that he is alive now  it is quite possible she answered but not very likely he probably died with the slight effort he made in moving his arm i am quite willing to go in and examine him if you like or would you prefer to wait until the doctor comes  we will wait i answered he cannot be more than a few minutes  almost as i spoke i heard the dogcart returning i hurried downstairs and admitted the doctor it was almost daybreak and very cold a thin grey mist hung over the park a few stars were still visible eastwards there was a faint break in the clouds  whats wrong he asked as i closed the door behind him  something very extraordinary doctor i answered hurrying him upstairs come and hear what the nurse has to say  he looked at me in a puzzled manner but i hurried him upstairs the nurse met him on the landing she whispered something in his ear and they entered the bedchamber together i remained outside  in about ten minutes the door was thrown open and the doctor appeared upon the threshold he was in his shirtsleeves and there was a look upon his face which i had never seen there before he had the appearance of a man who has been in touch with strange things  some hot water said heboiling if possible dont ask me any questions theres a good fellow  i had already aroused some of the servants telling them that the nurse had been taken ill and i was able to bring what he had asked for in a few minutes but when i returned with it and tried the handle of the door i found it locked rust opened it after i had knocked twice and took the can from me  go away theres a good fellow he begged i will come to you as soon as i canas soon as there is anything to tell  i obeyed him without demur i went into my study ordered some tea and tried to read it must have been an hour before the door was opened and rust appeared  courage he said i have some extraordinary news for you  i am quite prepared for it i answered calmly  he is alive  i nodded  i judged as much  more than that i believe he will recover  there was a short silence i had never seen rust so agitated  you dont seem to grasp quite all that this means he continued for the first time in my life i have signed a certificate of death for a living person  you have signed the certificate i asked  he nodded  the undertaker has it  the maid entered just then with the tea i ordered another cup for rust and when it had arrived i made him sit down opposite to me  his was exactly the kind of illness he remarked thoughtfully to lead to something of this sort i am quite sure now whatever kauppmanns friend may say that his disease was not a natural one he has been suffering from some strange form of poisoning it is the most interesting case i have ever come in contact with there were certain symptoms  rust i interrupted forgive me but i dont want to hear about symptoms i want to talk to you as man to man we are old friends you must listen carefully to what i have to say  rusts goodhumored weatherbeaten little face was almost pitiful  youre going to pitch into me of course he remarked well i suppose i deserve it you may not believe it but i can assure you that ninetynine out of every hundred medical men would have signed the certificate in my case  i have no doubt of it i answered that is not the matter i want to discuss with you at all there is something more serious terribly serious behind all this frankly if i did not know you so well rust i should offer you the biggest fee you had ever received in your life to leave the place this morning and be called totimbuctoo as it is i continued more slowly i am going to appeal to you as a sportsman i am going to take you into my confidence as far as i dare i want if i can to justify a very extraordinary request  rust took off his spectacles and laid them upon the table  the request being he asked  that you start for the holiday you were speaking of the other day i said within twelve hours  he glanced at me curiously i think that he was beginning to wonder whether i might not be the next person to need medical advice  go on he said i am prepared to listen at any rate  he listened and at 1030 that morning he left saxbyfor the south coast     chapter xix  an affair of state   my cousin met me at st pancras i saw him before my own carriage had reached the platform peering into the window of every compartment in his shortsighted way he recognized me at last with a little wave of the hand  glad to see you hardross these your things well have a hansom where are you staying  at the club if i can get a room i answered i shall try there before i go to an hotel at any rate  come and have some lunch first sir gilbert said firmly you can see about your room afterwards remember your appointment is at three oclock  i acquiesced and got into a cab with my cousin i was perfectly aware that he was almost consumed with curiosity he scarcely waited until we were off before he began  hardross he asked whats up  nothing particular i answered lamely  rubbish he declared you are the last man in the world i should have expected to see in town the second week in september you havent come for nothing have you and then this interview with lord polloch what on earth can you have to say to the prime minister  im afraid gilbert i answered that i cant tell youjust yet you see it isnt my own affair at all itsanother mans secret  my cousin was palpably disappointed  well he said a little curtly whatever sort of a secret it is it hasnt agreed with you very well i never saw you look so seedyand years older too what on earth have you been doing with yourself  i shrugged my shoulders  ive had a cold i said got wet through shooting one day last week  my cousin regarded me incredulously  a cold you he remarked i like that i dont believe you ever had such a thing in your life  i leaned forward in the cab to look at the placards of the afternoon papers  any news in town i asked  none at all gilbert answered theres scarcely any one about im off to hamburg tomorrow myself  and lord polloch i asked  hes off to scotland tonight for a fortnights golf afterwards i believe hes going abroad you must confess that your appearance here is a little extraordinary if i hadnt been on particularly good terms with polloch i could not possibly have got you an interview hes up to his eyes in work and as keen as a schoolboy on getting away for his holiday  its very good of you i answered  my cousin regarded me critically  youll forgive my suggesting it im sure hardross he said but you have got something particular to say to him i suppose these fellows dont like being bothered about trifles the responsibility is on my shoulders you see  i have something quite important to say to him i declared in all probability he will give you a seat in the cabinet for having arranged the meeting  gilbert abandoned the subject for the moment a sense of humor was not amongst his characteristics and i do not think that he approved altogether of my levity but later on as we sat at luncheon he returned to it  have you ever thought of parliament hardross he asked  i shook my head  one in the family i murmured is sufficient  the diplomatic service he remarked you are of course too old for  naturally i agreed as a matter of fact i have no hankerings for what you would call a career  and yet he began  and yet i interrupted i am anxious for an interview with the prime minister i am afraid i cannot tell you very much gilbert but i will tell you this some rather important information has come into my possession in a very curious fashion i conceive it to be my duty to pass it on to the government of this country lord polloch can decide whether or not it is of any real value it is for this purpose that i am seeking this interview with him i tell you this much in confidence i cannot tell you more  my cousin smiled in a somewhat superior manner  you have got a cheek he said as though any information you could pick up would be worth bothering polloch with  i glanced at the clock and leaned back in my chair  well i said in about a quarter of an hour his lordship will have an opportunity of judging for himself by the bye gilbert do you mind keeping what i have told you entirely to yourself  you havent told me anything he grunted  i have told you enough to get me into pretty considerable trouble i remarked grimly shall i see you later  i shall wait till you return he answered firmly i am rather anxious to hear how you get on with the chief  i am a little anxious about it myself i admitted as we went out into the hall  i walked the short distance to downing street the afternoon was brilliantly fine and the pavements were thronged with footpassengers i passed down the club steps into what seemed to me to be a new world i did not recognize myself or my kinship with my fellowcreatures for the first time in my life i was affected with forebodings i scanned the faces of the passersby i had an uneasy suspicion all the time that i was watched as i turned in to downing street the feeling grew stronger there were several loiterers in the roadway i watched them suspiciously the idea grew stronger within me that i should not be allowed to reach my destination i found myself measuring the distance almost counting the yards which separated me from that quiet grey stone house almost the last in the street it was with a sense of immense relief that i pushed open the gate and found myself behind the high iron palings a butler in sombre black opened the door almost before my hand had left the bell i was myself again immediately my vague fears melted away i handed in my card and explained that i had an appointment with lord polloch in less than five minutes i was ushered into his presence  i am very glad to see you mr courage he said i understand that you have some information which you wish to give me i have exactly twentyfive minutes to give you take that easychair and go ahead  in less than threequarters of an hour i was back in the club i found my cousin almost alone in the smokingroom he looked up with illsuppressed eagerness as i entered  well  i lit a cigarette and threw myself into an easychair  quiet afternoon here i remarked  you saw lord polloch  i nodded  i was with him exactly twentyfive minutes i answered  well he repeated  i called a waiter and ordered something to drink i felt that i needed it  my dear gilbert i said i will not affect to misunderstand you you want to know how lord polloch received me what the nature of my business with him was and its final result that is so isnt it  to a certain extent yes he admitted as i was responsible for the interview i naturally feel some interest in it he added stiffly  lord polloch was most civil i assured him he thanked me very much for coming to see him he hoped that i would call again immediately on his return from scotland andi have no doubt that by this time he has forgotten all about me  your information after all then gilbert exclaimed was not really important  he did not appear to find it so i admitted  i wonder gilbert said looking at me curiously what sort of a mares nest you have got hold of rather out of your line this sort of thing isnt it  the walls of the club smokingroom seemed suddenly to break away i was looking out into the great work where men and women faced the whirlwinds and were torn away struggling and fighting always into the juggernaut of destruction i looked into the quiet corners where the cowards lurked and i seemed to see my own empty place there  oh i dont know i answered calmly we are all the slaves of opportunity lord polloch very courteously but with little apparent effort has made me feel like a fool perhaps i am one perhaps lord polloch is too much of an englishman that remains to be discovered  what do you mean by too much of an englishman gilbert asked  i shrugged my shoulders  too much selfconfidence too little belief in the possibility of the unusual i answered  suppose you appoint me arbitrator gilbert suggested  i shook my head  i cannot gilbert i answered as i have said the issue is between lord polloch and myself and i hope to heaven that lord polloch is in the right or there will be trouble  you are extraordinarily mysterious gilbert remarked  i must seem so i answered i cannot help it have a drink gilbert and wish me god speed  are you off back to medchestershire tonight gilbert asked  i shook my head  no but i thought of running over to the states next week  gilbert laid down his cigar and looked at me anxiously  have you seen a doctor lately hardross he asked  not necessary i answered im as fit as i can be  then will you tell me he asked why with the shooting just on and the hunting in full view you are talking of going to america  ive had a good many years of hunting and shooting and cricket and sport of all sorts gilbert i answered perhaps im not quite so keen as i was  if you are not going to america for sport my cousin asked what are you going for  i rose to my feet  gilbert i said its no use some day or other you will know all about itperhaps very soon but for the present i can tell you nothing ive stumbled into a queer place and ive got to get out of it somehow wish me good luck old chap i added holding out my hand andif anything should happen to me abroadlook after the old placeitll be yours you know every stick and stone  then i got away as soon as i could gilbert was by way of becoming incoherent and so far as i was concerned there was nothing more to be said     chapter xx  travelling companions   i locked the door of my stateroom and seated myself upon the edge of the lower bunk with a little sigh of relief the slow pounding of the engines had commenced the pulse of the great liner was beating and through the porthole i could see the docks with their line of people gliding past us we were well out in the mersey already  were off guest i exclaimed and off safely too i think chuck that now theres a good fellow  guest was engaged in emptying the contents of one of my bags he turned slowly round and faced me with a pair of my trousers upon his arm  i shall do nothing of the sort he answered calmly i am here as your servant courage and your servant i intend to remain we cant hope to keep the thing up on the other side if we are all the time drifting back to our old relations i wish i could make you understand this  i opened the porthole as far as it would go and lit a cigarette  thats all very well i said but i dont see any need to keep the farce up in private and im sure i can unpack my own things a thundering sight better than you can  very likely he answered but you certainly wont do it cant you understand that unless we grow into our parts they will never come naturally to us besides we may be watched you cannot tell  the door is locked i remarked dryly  for the moment no doubt were all right guest answered but you wont be able to lock it often upon the voyage remember that we are up against a system with a thousand eyes and a thousand ears its no good running risks i am peters your man and peters i mean to be  do you propose i asked to have your meals in the servants saloon  most certainly i do was the curt answer i expect to make acquaintances there who will be most useful did you get the passengers list  i drew it from my pocket guest came and looked over my shoulder halfway down the list he pointed to a name  mr de valentin and valet he murmured that is our friend i recognize the name he has used it before now let us see  again his forefinger travelled down the listagain it paused  mrs van reinberg and the misses van reinberg ah he said that is the lady whose acquaintance you must contrive to make  one of the court i asked  he nodded  there are others of course but i do not recognize their names they will sort themselves up naturally enough now unlock that door and go up on deck the stewards will be in directly for orders  i rose and stretched out my hand towards the door suddenly from outside an unexpected sound almost paralyzed methe sharp shrill yapping of a small dog  i felt the color leave my cheeks guest looked at me in amazement  whats the matter with you he asked youre not frightened of a toy terrier are you  i opened the door of course my sudden fear had been absurd i peered out into the passage and a little exclamation broke from my lips sitting on his haunches just outside his mouth open his little red tongue hanging out was a small japanese spaniel there may have been thousands of others in the world but that one i was very sure from the first that i recognized and i was equally sure that he recognized me i stared at him fascinated his beadlike black eyes blinked and blinked again and his teeth like a row of ivory needles gleamed white from his red gums he neither growled nor wagged his tail but it seemed to me that the expression of his aged puckeredup little face was the incarnation of malevolence i pointed to him and whispered hoarsely to guest  her dog  whose he asked sharply  miss van hoyts i answered  rubbish he declared there are hundreds of dogs like that  i shook my head  never another in the wide world i said look how the little brute is scowling at me  the bedroom steward came round the corner at that moment i pointed to the dog  i always understood that dogs were not permitted in the staterooms steward i remarked  they are not sir the man answered promptly the young lady to whom this one belongs has a special permission but he is not allowed to be out alone he must have run away  there was the sound of rustling petticoats a young woman in black came hurrying down the passage she caught up the dog without a word and hastened away  at what time would you like to be called sir the man asked  send me the bathroom steward and i will let you know i answered stepping back into the stateroom  hell be round in a few minutes sir the man answered and passed on  guest leaned towards me his eyes were bright and alert and his manner was perfectly composed he was more used to such crises than i was he asked no question he waited for me to speak  it was her maid i exclaimed i was sure of the dog  miss van hoyts  yes  he caught up the passengers list there was no such name there  if it is she he said quietly she is here to watch you it proves nothing else i shall be seasick all the way over and at new york we must part go to the pursers office and find out courage there is no reason why you shouldnt you are interested of course  i nodded and left the stateroom but i had no need to visit the purser i met her face to face coming out of the saloon if appearances were in any way to be trusted the meeting was as much a shock to her as to me she was wearing a thick veil which partially obscured her features but i saw her stop short and clutch at a pillar as though for support as she recognized me if the amazement in her tone was counterfeited she was indeed an actress  you she exclaimed where are you going  america i hope i answered and you i did not see your name on the passengers list  i am goinghome she answered i made up my mind at the last moment to come on this steamer to cross with my stepmother  i did not like the way she said it it was too apta little too mechanical and yet i could not get it out of my head that her surprise was natural  a little fair woman wearing a magnificent fur cloak and with an eyeglass dangling at her bosom suddenly bore down upon us  adèle she exclaimed have you seen my woman ive forgotten the number of my stateroom  it is opposite mine adèle answered i can show it to you  they passed on together the fair little lady had favored me with a very perfunctory and somewhat insolent glance adèle herself left me without a word i went into the saloon took my place for dinner and then sought the deck for some fresh air i felt that i needed it  a slight drizzling rain was falling but i took no notice of it i walked backwards and forwards along the promenade deck my pipe in my mouth my hands clasped behind me the appearance of adèle had been so utterly unexpected that i felt myself almost unnerved for six days we should be living in the close intimacy which fellow passengers upon a steamer find it almost difficult to avoid our opportunities for conversation would be practically unlimited if indeed guests suspicions as to the reason of her presence here were well founded a single slip on my part might mean disaster and yet beneath it all i knew quite well that her near presence was a delight to me my blood was running more warmly my heart was the lighter for the thought of her near presence danger might come of it the success of our undertaking itself might be imperilledyet i was glad i leaned over the vessels side and gazed through the gathering twilight at the fast receding shores with their maze of yellow lights life had changed for me during the last few weeks the old placid days of content were over already i was in a new world a world of bigger things where the great game was being played with the tense desperateness of those who gamble with life and death i had not sought the change rather it had been forced upon me i had no ambitions to gratify the old life had pleased me very well i had quitted it simply upon compulsion and here i was with unfamiliar thoughts in my brain groping my way along paths which were strange to me face to face now with the greatest happening which heaven or hell can let loose upon a man it was a queer trick this which fortune had played me  after all we are very human the dressing bugle brought me back to the present and i remembered that i was hungry i descended into my stateroom and found all my things neatly laid out and guest sitting on the opposite bunk regarded them critically  you shouldnt have bothered about my clothes guest i protested  nonsense he answered curtly i cant play the part without a few rehearsals what about miss van hoyt  she is on board i answered  you have spoken to her  yes  did she offer any explanations as to her presence  she appeared to be surprised to see me i answered she said that she was going home  guest nodded thoughtfully  her stepmother is an american he remarked i dont suppose you knew that  i did not i admitted i wish you would tell me all that you know of miss van hoyt  no time now he answered you will be late for dinner as it is dont seem too eager about it but remember it is absolutely necessary that you get an introduction to mrs van reinberg  i nodded  ill do my best i promised     chapter xxi  for you   i found that a place had been allotted to me about halfway down the captains table on the righthand side my immediate neighbors were an englishman on his way to the states to buy some commodity in which he dealt and a very old lady quite deaf in charge of a spinster daughter neither of them imposed upon me the necessity for conversation i had therefore plenty of time to look around me and take note of the people in whom i was interested  they were all seated together at a small table in the far corner of the saloon at the head of that table was a man whom i had not yet seen but whom i at once knew to be mr de valentin he was tall rather sallow with a pointed black beard and he continually wore an eyeglass set in a horn rim with a narrow black ribbon on his right was the woman to whom adèle had spoken upon the stairs she wore a plain but elegant dinnergown of some dark material she was exquisitely coiffured and obviously turned out by a perfectly trained maid there were two girls at the table whom i judged to be her daughters andadèle  adèle was seated so that i could see only her profile i noticed however that she seemed to be eating little and to be taking but a very small part in the conversation once or twice she leaned back in her chair and looked round the saloon as though in search of some one on the last of these occasions our eyes met and she smiled slightly mrs van reinberg who was sitting opposite to her leaned forward and asked some question i judged that it concerned me for immediately afterwards that lady herself raised her gold eyeglass and favored me with a somewhat deliberate stare then she leaned forward again and made some remark to adèle the purport of which i could not guess  dinner lasted a long time but i was all the while interested i was facing adèle and her friends so i could observe them all the time without being myself conspicuous i was able to take note of the somewhat wearied graciousness of mr de valentin who seemed always to be struggling with a profound boredom the almost feverish amiability of mrs van reinberg and in a lesser degree her daughters and the undoubted reserve with which adèle seemed to protect herself from mr de valentins attentions when at last they rose and left the saloon i quickly followed their example  i put on an ulster lit a cigar and went up on deck i found my chair on the sheltered side of the ship and wrapping myself in a rug prepared to spend a comfortable halfhour but i had scarcely settled down before a little group of people came along the deck and halted close to me a smoothfaced manservant laden with a pile of magnificent rugs struck a match and began to examine the labels on the chairs its flickering light was apparently sufficient for adèle to recognize my features  so you are going to join the freshair brigade mr courage she remarked i think you are very wise we found the musicroom insufferable  i can assure you that the smokeroom is worse miss van hoyt i answered struggling to my feet can i find your chair for you  thanks the deck steward is bringing it she answered let me introduce you to my friendsmrs van reinbergmy stepmother miss van reinberg miss sara van reinberg mr de valentinmr hardross courage  i bowed collectively mr de valentin greeted me stiffly mrs van reinberg and the misses van reinberg with a cordiality which somewhat surprised me  i met your cousin sir gilbert in london i think mr courage she remarked he was kind enough to give us tea on the terrace at the house of commons  i bowed  gilbert is rather fond of entertaining his friends there i remarked it is the one form of frivolity which seems to appeal to him  he was very kind she continued he introduced a number of interesting people to us the duke of westlingham is a relation of yours is he not  my second cousin i remarked  is this your first visit to america she asked  i was once in canada i answered i have never been in the states  she smiled at me a little curiously all the time i felt somehow that she was taking very careful note of my answers  we say in my country you know she remarked that you englishmen come to us for one of two things onlysport or a wife  i hope to get some of the former at any rate i answered as for the latter  well  i have always thought of myself as a bachelor i said but ones good fortune comes sometimes when one least expects it  i looked across at adèle and mrs van reinberg followed the direction of my eyes she laughed shrilly but she did not seem displeased  if you englishmen only made as good husbands as you do acquaintances she said i should settle down in london with my girls and study matchmaking i am afraid though that you have your drawbacks  tell me what they are i begged and i will do my best to prove myself an exception  you have too much spare time she declared and you know what that leads to  mr courage has not adèle interrupted he works really very hard indeed  works mrs van reinberg repeated incredulously  at games adèle declared he plays in cricket matches that last three days long i saw him once at lords and i can assure you that it looked like very hard work indeed  mrs van reinberg turned away with a laugh and settled herself down into the little nest of rugs which her maid had prepared  you young people can walk about if you like she said i am going to be comfortable my cigarette case annette and electric lamp i shall read for half an hour  she dismissed us all adèle and i moved away as though by common consent mr de valentin followed with the two other girls though i had noticed that his first impulse had been to take possession of adèle she avoided the others skilfully however and we strolled off to the farther end of the ship  your stepmother i remarked seems to be a very amiable person  she can be anything she likes adèle answeredupon occasions  we turned on to the weather side of the ship which was almost deserted adèle glanced behind mr de valentin and the two girls were still within a few feet of us  do you mind walking on the lower deck she asked i want to talk to you and i am sure that we shall be disturbed here  with pleasure i answered quickly i too have something to say to you  we descended in silence to the promenade deck here we had the place almost to ourselves adèle did not beat about the bush  mr courage she said tell me what you thought when you saw me on this steamer  she looked me full in the face her beautiful eyes were full of anxiety there was about her manner a nervousness which i had never before noticed her cheeks were paler and with these indications of emotion something of the mystery which had seemed to me always to cling to her personality had departed she was more naturalmore lovable  i thought i answered that it was part of the gamethat you were here to watch me isnt that the natural conclusion  mr courage she said please look at me  i faced her at once her eyes were fixed upon mine  i am not here to watch you she said quietly i came because i have decided to go back to my home in america and live there quietly for a time whatever share i had in the events which led to leslie guests death these things do not interest me any more i have finished  i congratulate you i answered  i cannot tell you anything about those events or my connection with them she went on but i want you to believe that i have no longer any association with those who planned them i am not here to spy upon you i am not in communication with any one to whom your actions are of any interest will you believe this  i hesitated for a moment her eyes held mine it was not possible for me to disbelieve her  i am glad to hear this i said seriously  you do not doubt me  i cannot i answered  she drew a little sigh of relief  and now she said about yourself be as frank with me as i have been with you are you really the legatee of guests secret  you know that he told me certain thingsbefore he died i answered slowly  yes but what are you going to do with the knowledge are you going to be wise and let fate take its course or are you going to meddle in affairs which you know nothing about dont do it mr courage she exclaimed with a sudden catch in her voice leslie guest was a diplomatist and a schemer all his life and you know the penalty he paid you have not the training or the disposition for this sort of thing you would be foredoomed to failure dont do it  i turned and looked at her she was so much in earnest that her whole expression was transformed the mysterious smile which was so often upon her lips half supercilious half mocking was gone and with it something of that elusiveness which had so often puzzled me her eyes met mine frankly and pleadingly her fingers were upon my arm and she was swaying a little towards me with the motion of the boat so that i was tempted almost beyond measure to take her into my arms and with my lips upon hers promise whatever she would have had me promise it was only a moment of madness the memory of other things came back to me  it is very good of you i said slowly to warn me i know that i am not made of the stuff that guest was it is possible that i may  it is true then she interrupted breathlessly you are really meaning to go with his schemes  you take too much for granted i answered  oh dont let us misunderstand one another she begged tell me why you are on your way to america tell me why you are on this steamer of all others  i am going to shootout west i said and i want to know something of your wonderful countrypeople  she let her fingers slip from my arm  you will tell me no more than that she murmured  i have nothing more to tell you i answered  once more she leaned towards me the wind was blowing around us she came closer as though seeking for the shelter of my body i could smell the crushed violets which she was still wearing at her bosom her eyes were soft and bright her lips were slightly parted i took her into my armsshe clung to me for a momentone long delicious moment  i have given it all up she whispered for you if i had told the truth if i had told them that you knew it would have meant death you must forget you must swear to forget  i held her tightly  dear adèle i whispered you are a woman who understands life and death come to all of us but a coward could never deserve your loveyou could never stoop to care for a man who thought of his life before his honor  you are pledged she cried  i must do what i can i answered  she staggered away from me  god help us both she murmured  i would have caught her to me again but a dark figure was coming slowly down the deck a little yapping bark came from the deck at her feet nagaski was leaping up at his mistress she stooped and picked him up he showed me his teeth and snarled  you really must make friends with nagaski mr courage she remarked turning away come we must go back to the others my stepmother will think that i am lost     chapter xxii  loved i not honor more   i told guest exactly what had passed between adèle and myself leaving out only the personal element at which i allowed him to guess he was thoughtful for some time afterwards  what is to be the end of it between you and her he asked me presently exactly on what terms do you stand at present  some day i answered i shall marry heror no other woman as regards other matters i believe that she is neutral  you do not think then that she will obstruct our plans he asked of course a word from her and our journey to america can only end in failure  she will not speak it i answered confidently i do not know of course how deeply she was involved in the schemes of those whom we may call our enemies but i am perfectly certain that she has finished with them now  guest nodded  i hope so he remarked shortly at any rate it is one of the risks which we must take  we said no more about the subject then and i very soon perceived that the intimacy between adèle and myself was likely to be of the greatest use to us for the next two days neither of us referred to those things which lay in the background we walked and sat together played shuffleboard and in every way made the most of all those delightful opportunities of têteàtêtes which a sea voyage affords mrs van reinberg for some reason or other watched our intimacy with increasing satisfaction mr de valentin on the other hand though he concealed his feelings admirably seemed to find it equally distasteful gradually the situation became clear to me mrs van reinberg desired to reserve the whole interest of mr de valentin for herself and her daughters he on the other hand had shown signs of a partiality for adèle the fates were certainly working for me  on the third night out we were all together on deck after dinner i was standing near mrs van reinberg who had been exceedingly gracious to me  tell me mr courage she asked what are your plans when you land  i thought of using some of my letters of introduction i answered and going west after christmas i have been told that the country round lenox and pittsfield is very beautiful just now and i shall stay i expect with a man i know fairly well who lives up thereplaskett white  why isnt that strange mrs van reinberg exclaimed the plaskett whites are our nearest neighbors if you really are coming that way you must stay with us for a week or as long as you can manage it we are going straight to lenox  i shall be delighted i answered heartily  mr de valentin dropped his eyeglass and polished it deliberately his usually expressionless face was black with anger even the two girls looked a little surprised at their mothers invitation i felt that the situation was a delicate one  i should not be able to intrude upon you for more than a day or two i remarked a little diffidently but if you will really put me up for that length of time i shall look forward to my visit with a great deal of pleasure  mrs van reinberg was looking across at mr de valentin with a very determined expression on her pale hard face she was obviously a woman who was accustomed to have her own way and meant to have it in this particular instance  it is settled then mr courage she declared come whenever you like we can always make room for you  i bowed my gratitude and to relieve the situation i took adèle away with me for a walk we were scarcely out of hearing before i heard mr de valentins cold but angry voice  my dear madame do you consider that invitation of yours a prudent one   we walked on the other side of the deck adèle was silent for several moments then she turned towards me and the old smile was upon her lipsthe smile which had always half fascinated half irritated me  so she remarked i have become your unwilling ally  in what way i asked  i suppose she said that an invitation to lenox was necessary to your plans wasnt it  i had fairly obvious reasons for hoping for one i answered smiling  she passed her arm through mine and leaned a little towards me it was at such moments that i found her so dangerously sweet  ah she murmured i wish that that were the only reason  i pressed her arm to mine but i said nothing when i could avoid it i preferred not to discuss those other matters we walked to the ships side and leaned over to watch the phosphorus suddenly she whispered in my ear her lips were so close to my cheek that i felt her warm breath  jim she said do you love me very much  i would have kissed the lips which dared to ask such a question but she drew a little away it was not that which she wantedjust then  listen she murmured but do not look at me watch that star there sinking down towards the seathere near the horizon now listen when we land at new york let us run away from everything from everybody we can go west to mexico and beyond there are beautiful countries there which i have always wanted to see let us lose ourselves for a year two yearslonger even i will not let you be weary oh i promise you that i will give you myself and all my life think we can only live once and you and i have found what life is dont let us trifle with it jim will you come  soft though her voice was there was passion quivering in every sentence when i turned to look at her her eyes and face seemed aflame with it the color had streamed into her cheeks she had drifted into my arms and her clinging lips yielded unresistingly to mine  oh jim she murmured the rest isnt worth anything tell me that you will come  i did not answer her at once and she seemed content to lie where she was my own senses were in a wild tumult of delight but there was a pain in my heart presently she drew a little away there was a new note in her tonea note of halfalarmed surprise  answer me jim oh answer me please she begged dont let me thinkthat you mean to refuse  i held her tightly in my arms the memory of that moment might have to last me all my life  my dear heart i whispered it would be paradise some day we will do it but in your heart you know very well that you would love me no more if i forgot my honor and my dutyeven for the love of you  it is not your task she pleaded tell what you know and leave it to others you are too honest to play the spy you will fail and it will cost you your life  i shall not fail i answered steadfastly and my life is insured in heaven for the sake of the things i carry with me have faith in me adèle i swear that i will do my duty and live to realizeeverything  she shook her head sadly  there are others she said who could do what you are doing but for me there is no one else in the world  you shall not need any one else i declared mine is after all a simple task you know that i went to see lord polloch in london  well  he would not believe me why should he my story sounded wild enough and i had no proofs i only need to gather together a few of these loose ends to weave something tangible out of them and show him the results and my task is finished  do you suppose she asked quietly that you will be allowed to do that  i must do my best i answered it is inevitable there will be more mr stanleys and such like no doubt they may hinder me but i think that in the end i shall pull through and i promise you dear that when i have something definite to show i shall have finished with the whole business it is no more to my liking than yours  i cannot move you then she murmured  you must not try i answered  she laughed a little unnaturally  i do not feel any longer she said that you belong to me there is something else which comes first  without that something dear i answered i should not be worthy of your love  with men there is always something else she said sadly it is the woman only who realizes what love is who puts it before body and soul and honor a man cannot do that  no i answered softly a man cannot do that  she turned away and i walked by her side in silence when she reached the companionway she stepped inside a little abruptly  i am going to my stateroom she said good night  you are not angry with me adèle i asked anxiously  no not that she answered of course you are right only i have been a little mad and i dreamed a beautiful dream it is all impossible of course but i dont feel like bridge or my stepmothers questions say i am coming up again it will save trouble  i played bridge later with mrs van reinberg for a partner mr de valentins manner to me was coldly frigid and a general air of restraint seemed to indicate that the evening had scarcely been a cheerful one i myself did not feel much like contributing towards a more hilarious state of affairs we had one rubber only and then mrs van reinberg who as a rule hated to go to bed before midnight announced her intention of retiring she accepted my escort to the door and bade mr de valentin a cold goodnight  i hope you will understand mr courage she said as we shook hands that i shall expect you at lenox you wont disappoint us  there isnt the faintest chance that i shall do so mrs van reinberg i answered i have the best of reasons for wishing to come  she smiled at me encouragingly  may i guess at the attraction she asked  i fancy i answered that it is fairly apparent may i by the way mrs van reinberg i continued ask you a question  certainly she answered  it is rather a delicate matter to allude to i said but your friend mr de valentin seemed to find your invitation to me a matter for personal disapproval i hope that i have not unwillingly been the cause of any unpleasantness  mrs van reinberg was a little embarrassed she hesitated and dropped her voice a little in answering me  since you have mentioned it mr courage she said i will treat you confidentially mr de valentin has shown a desire to become an admirer of my stepdaughter for several reasons i find it necessary to discourage his advances in fact between ourselves mr de valentin although he is a person for whom i have a great respect and esteem would be an altogether impossible suitor for adèle i am sure he will realize that directly he thinks the matter over seriously but you see he is a person who has been very much spoilt and he annoyed me tonight very much i do not care to have my invitations criticised by my other guests whoever they may be now you understand the position mr courage  perfectly i answered i am exceedingly obliged to you for being so frank with me  and we shall expect you at lenox  without fail i answered confidently  she passed down the stairs humming a tune to herself followed a few steps behind by her maid her wonderfully arranged fair hair was ablaze with diamonds her gown was more suitable to a london drawingroom than the deck of a steamer and yet she seemed neither overjewelled nor overdressed she had all the marvellous aplomb of her countrywomen who can transgress all laws of fashion or taste and through sheer selfconfidence remain correct  i felt a touch upon my shoulder and turned around it was mr de valentin who stood there  i beg your pardon mr courage he said but if you have nothing particular to do for a few minutes will you smoke a cigarette with me  with pleasure i answered i was just going into the smokeroom  he stalked solemnly ahead and i followed him along the corridor     chapter xxiii  the pretender   mr de valentin led the way to a secluded corner of the smokeroom and laid a wellfilled cigarette case upon the table he beckoned to the steward  you will take something he asked  i ordered a whisky and soda and lit a cigarette i had tasted nothing like them since i had left england mr de valentin leaned across the table towards me  mr courage he said i am going to ask you to accept a confidence from me you are an english gentleman and although i have not the honor to be myself an englishman my associations with your country have always been very close and i am well aware that a special significance attaches itself to that term  he paused and looked across at me somewhat anxiously his speech was slow but very distinct he had little accent but i had known quite well that he was not an englishman  i shall be very glad to hear anything that you have to say mr de valentin i answered  he beat with his forefinger upon the table for a few moments absently i found myself studying him critically his appearance was without doubt distinguished his sallow face his pointed black beard his high wellshaped nose and almost brilliant eyes gave him the appearance of a spaniard but the scrupulous exactness of his plain dinner clothes his wellmanicured nails and the ring upon his little finger with its wonderful green stone were all suggestive of the french aristocrat his eyebrows were knit just now as though with thought presently he looked up from the table and continued  if you will permit me he said i should like to introduce myself my name is not mr de valentin i am victor louis comte de valentin marquis de st auteuil duc de bordera and escault prince of normandy  i nodded gravely  and according to some i remarked in a low tone king of france  he looked at me in keen surprise he was evidently taken aback  you knew me he exclaimed  i felt very sure i answered that you were the person whom you have declared yourself to be i have seen you twice in paris and you must remember that this is an age of illustrated papers and journalistic enterprise  you have not mentioned your recognition of me he asked quickly  certainly not i answered it was not my affair and in your position i can conceive that there may be many reasons for your desiring to travel incognito  he smiled a little wearily  yet it would tax your ingenuity i imagine he continued to account for my travelling in company with mrs van reinberg and her daughters  it is not my affair i answered we englishmen are supposed to have learnt the secret of minding our own business  you englishmen certainly he answered but not always your servants  i looked at him a little puzzled his words had seemed to possess some special significance  you will not i am sure take offence at what i am about to say mr courage he continued but may i ask if you have confidence in the manservant who is now travelling with you  it was a shock but i fancy that i remained unmoved  you mean my man peters i inquired i can guarantee his honesty certainly  can you also guarantee mr de valentin asked me that he is simply what he professes to bea valet and not for instance a spy  my dear sir i protested we scarcely know the meaning of that word in england to say the least of it such a suggestion would be wildly improbable  he sighed  in france he said one looks for spies everywhere i myself have suffered painfully on more than one occasion from espionage one grows suspicious and in this instance i have grounds for my suspicions  may i know what they are i asked  i was about to tell you mr de valentin answered i have with me in my cabin certain papers which are of great importance to me i had occasion to look them through last night and although none were missing yet there was every indication of their having been tampered with i questioned my servant who is a very faithful fellow and i found that the only person with whom he had made friends and who had entered my cabin was your man peters i think you called him  mr de valentin was watching me closely and the test was a severe one i was annoyed with guest for having kept me in ignorance of what he had done  i do not see how your private papers could have been of the slightest use to peters i said but if you like to come down to my stateroom you can question him yourself  that he answered i will leave to you i take it then that you have no suspicion that your servant is any other than he professes to be  i am perfectly convinced that he is not i declared  mr de valentin bowed  for the moment he said we will quit the subject i have another matter equally delicate which i should like to discuss with you  i am quite at your service i assured him  you have a saying in english he continued which if i remember it rightly says that necessity makes strange bedfellows i myself am going into a strange country upon a strange errand i do not consider myself a person of hyperexclusive tastes but i must confess that i do not find myself in sympathy with the countrypeople and friends of mrs van reinberg  i shrugged my shoulders  then why go amongst them i asked you are surely at liberty to do as you choose  mr de valentin took up his case and chose another cigarette  in this instance he said coldly i am not entirely my own master there were powerful reasons why i should have taken this voyage to america and there are reasons why i should have done so with mrs van reinberg which brings me by the bye to the second matter concerning which i wished to speak to you  i accepted another of mr de valentins excellent cigarettes and composed myself once more to listen  i am going to lenox he continued to meet there a few american friends with whom i have certain affairs of importance to discuss you also have been invited to lenox my request is that you defer your visit there until after my departure  i raised my eyebrows at this it seemed to me that mr de valentin was going a little too far  may i inquire i asked politely in what respect you find my presence there undesirable we are not bound i presume to come much into contact with one another  you misunderstand me mr de valentin declared it is not a personal matter at all my visit to lenox has been arranged solely to discuss a certain matter with certain people the presence of those who are not interested in it would be an embarrassment to all of us further to recur to a matter which we have already spoken of i cannot divest myself of certain suspicions concerning your servant  i considered my reply for a moment or two  as regards the latter i said after a pause i can not take you seriously besides it is very unlikely that my servant would accompany me to lenox if my presence there would be an embarrassment i really do not see why mrs van reinberg asked me  she did so thoughtlessly mr de valentin answered her reasons were tolerably clear to me perhaps to you with regard to them i have nothing to say except that your visit could be paid just as well say in a fortnight after we land  unfortunately i answered that would not suit me to be frank with you miss van hoyt would have left  if i can arrange mr de valentin continued with some eagerness that she should not have left  i hesitated for a moment  mr de valentin i said i cannot conceive what cause for embarrassment could arise from my presence in lenox at the same time as yourself i do not ask you to tell me your secrets but in the absence of some more valid reason for staying away i shall certainly not break my present engagement  there was a silence between us for several moments mr de valentin was fingering his cigarette case nervously  i am perhaps asking too much of a stranger mr courage he said the matter is of the deepest importance to me or i would not have troubled you supposing miss van hoyt should herself fix the date of your visit and engage to be there  that i answered would of course be sufficient for me  mr de valentin rose from his seat  we will leave it like that then he said i must apologize mr courage for having troubled you with my private affairs and wish you goodnight  we separated a few moments later and i went down to my stateroom i found guest busy writing in a pocketbook seated on the edge of his bunk i told him of my conversation with mr de valentin  i knew it was risky he remarked when i had finished but it was an opportunity which i dared not miss  you might have told me about it i protested i was altogether unprepared  the less you know he answered the better if you like i will show you tracings of some letters which i discovered in mr de valentins portfolio they were quite worth the journey to america apart from anything else personally i should advise you not to see them until our return to england  very well i answered dont show them to me but i shouldnt try it again mr de valentin is on his guard  guest smiled a little wearily  i am not likely to make such a mistake as that he answered besides i have been through all his papers his secrets are ours now only we must know what is decided upon at lenox then we can return to england and the first part of our task will be done     chapter xxiv  a practical woman   mrs van reinberg on the steamer was a somewhat formidable person mrs van reinberg in her own house was despotism personified her word was law her rule was absolute consequently when she swept out on to the sunny piazza where a little party of us were busy discussing our plans for the day we all turned towards her expectantly we might propose but mrs van reinberg would surely dispose we waited to hear what she might have to say  i want to talk to mr courage she declared all the rest of you go away  they obeyed her at once we were alone in less than a minute mrs van reinberg established herself in a low wicker chair and i took up my position within a few feet of her leaning against the wooden rail  i am entirely at your service mrs van reinberg i declared what is it to be aboutadèle  no not adèle she answered i leave you and adèle to arrange your own affairs you can manage that without any interference from me  i smiled and waited for her to proceed she was evidently thinking out her way her brows were knitted her eyes were fixed upon a distant spot in the forest landscape of orange and red yet i was very sure that at that moment the wonderful autumnal tints which she seemed to be so steadily regarding held no place in her thoughts  mr courage she said at last you are a sensible man and a man of honor i should like to talk to you confidentially  i murmured something about being flattered but i do not think that she heard me  i should like she continued to have you understand certain things which are in my mind just now and which concern alsomr de valentin  i nodded the princes identity was an open secret but his incognito was jealously observed  i wonder she said slowly looking for the first time directly towards me whether you have ever seriously considered the question of the american womansuch as myself for instance  i was a little puzzled and no doubt i looked it mrs van reinberg proceeded calmly it was made clear to me that for the present at any rate my rôle was to be simply that of listener  my own case she said is typical at least i suppose so i speak for myself and there are others in the house at the present moment who profess to feel as i do and sufferas i have done in this country we are taught that wealth is power we or rather our husbands acquire or inherit it afterwards we set ourselves to test the truth of that little maxim we begin at home in about three years more or less we reach our limitations then it begins to dawn upon us that whatever else america is good for its no place for a woman with ambitions were on the top too soon and when were there it doesnt amount to anything  which accounts i remarked for the invasion of europe  mrs van reinberg leaned her fair little head upon her white beringed fingers and looked steadily at me i had never for a moment underestimated her but she had probably never so much impressed me there was something napoleonic about this slow unfolding of her carefully thoughtout plans  naturally she answered what however so few of us are able to realize is our utter and miserable failure in what you are pleased to call that invasion  failure i repeated incredulously i do not understand that one hears everywhere of the social triumphs of the american woman  mrs van reinbergs eyes shone straight into mine her face expressed the most unmitigated contempt  social triumphs she repeated scornfully what claptrap i tell you that a season in london or paris much more vienna is enough to drive a real american woman crazy success indeed what does it amount to  she paused for a moment to take breath i realized then that the woman whom i had known was something of a fraud a puppet hung out with the rags of a european manner according to the study and observation of the shrewd little lady who pulled the strings it was mrs van reinberg of london and paris whom i had met upon the steamer it was mrs van reinberg of new york who was talking to me now and she was speaking in her own language  look here mr courage she said leaning towards me with her elbows upon her knees and nothing left of that elegant pose which she had at first assumed i suppose ive got my full share of the american spirit and i tell you im a bad hand at taking a back seat anywhere or even a front one on sufferance and yet wherever we go in europe thats what weve got to put up with you think were mad on titles over here we arent but we are keen on what a title brings over your side take your debrettthere are i dont know how many baronets and lords and marquises and earls and all the rest of it do you realize that whatever public place im in or even at a friends dinnerparty the homely stupid wives of those men have got to go in before me and if they dontwhy i know all the time its a matter of courtesy thats what makes me mad dont you dare to smile at me now im in deadly earnest in this country so far as society goes im at the top you may say it doesnt amount to much and youre right but it makes it all the worse when im in europe and see the sort of women i have to give place to say dont you sit there mr courage and look at me as though i were a woman with some cranky grievance to talk about its got beyond that let me tell you  i can assure you mrs van reinberg i began  now listen here mr courage she interrupted im not the sort of woman to complain at what i dont try to alter whats the good of having a husband whose nod is supposed to shake the money markets of the world if you dont make use of him  i nodded sagely  you are quite right i said money after all is the greatest power in the world today money will buy anything  i guess so if its properly spent mrs van reinberg agreed only very few of my countrypeople have any idea how to use it to get what they want they go over the other side and hire great houses and bribe your great ladies to call themselves their friends and bribe your young men with wonderful entertainments to come to their houses they spend spend spend and think they are getting value for their money idiots the great lady whom they are proud to entertain one night is as likely as not to cut them the next half the people who go to their parties go out of curiosity and half to meet their own friends not one to see them not one because it does them the slightest good to be seen there they are there in the midst of it all and that is all you can say their motto should be on sufferance thats what i call going to work the wrong way  you have i suggested some other scheme  she drew her chair a little closer to mine and looked around cautiously  i have she admitted that is what we are all here forto discuss it and make our final plans  and prince victor i murmured  precisely he is in it of course i may as well tell you that hes dead against my making a confidant of you but ive a sort of fancy to hear what you might have to say about it you see im a practical woman and though ive thought this scheme out myself and i believe in it there are times when it seems to me a trifle airy now youre a kind of levelheaded person and living over there your point of view would be interesting  i should be glad to hear anything you might have to tell me mrs van reinberg i said slowly but you must please remember that i am an englishman  oh we dont want to hurt your old country she declared i consider that for all the talk about kinship and all that sort of thing she treats usi mean women like myselfdisgracefully but thats neither here nor there ive finished with england for the present were going to play a greater game than that  mrs van reinberg had dropped her voice a little there was a somewhat uncomfortable pause i could see that even at the last moment she realized that in telling me these things she was guilty of what might well turn out to be a colossal indiscretion i myself was almost in a worse dilemma if i accepted her confidence i was almost if not quite bound in honor to respect it if as i suspected it fitted in with the great scheme if it indeed formed ever so small a part of these impending happenings in which guest so firmly believed what measure of respect were we likely to pay to it none at all if i stopped her i should be guilty from guests point of view of incredible folly if i let her go on it must be with the consciousness that i was accepting her confidences under wholly false pretences it was a big problem for a man like myself new to the complexities of life i could only think of guests words conscience for heavens sake man lock it up until we have done our duty  i leaned against the wooden rail of the piazza looking across the grounds within a dozen yards or so of us several of mrs van reinbergs guests with a collection of golf sticks were clambering into a huge automobile beyond the pleasure gardens was a range of forestcovered hills yellow and gold now with the glory of the changing foliage in the valley was a small steeplechase course towards which several people were riding the horse which had been saddled for me was still being led about a little way down the avenue with the exception that there was no shooting party it was very much like the usual sort of gathering at an english country house and yet it all seemed wholly unreal to me i felt a strong inclinationperhaps a little hystericalto burst out laughing this was surely a gigantic joke planned against the proverbial lack of humor of my countrymen i was not expected to take it seriously and yet in a moment i remembered certain established facts of which these things were but the natural sequel i remembered too a certain air of seriousness and a disposition towards confidential talk manifested among the older members of the party mrs van reinbergs suppressed but earnest voice again broke the silence she called me back to her side  mr courage she said you are going to marry adèle  i hope so i answered confidently glancing away to where she stood talking to mr de valentin on the piazza steps  i shall treat you then she declared as one of the family tonight after dinner we are going to hold the meeting for which this houseful of people was really brought together i invite you to come to it afterwards you will understand everything now i must hurry off and so must you your horse is getting the fidgets  she swept off down the piazza mr de valentin came forward eagerly to meet her i saw his face darken as she whispered in his ear     chapter xxv  a cable from europe   dinner that night was a somewhat oppressive meal several new guests had arrived some of whom bore names which were well known to me there was a sense of some hidden excitement which formed an uneasy background to the spasmodic general conversation the men especially seemed uncomfortable and ill at ease  poor father adèle whispered to me he would give a good many of his dollars not to be in this  i glanced across at our host who had come down from new york specially in his magnificent private car which was now awaiting his return on a siding of the little station he was a hardfaced elderly man with a shrewd mouth and keen eyes sparely built yet a man you would be inclined to glance at twice in any assemblage he wore a most unconventional evening suit the waistcoat cut very high and a plain black tie two footmen stood behind his chair and a large florid lady wearing a crown of diamonds and with a european reputation for opulence sat on his right hand neither seemed to embarrass him in the least for the simple reason that he took no notice of them he drank water ate sparingly and talked wall street with a man a few places down the table on the left his speech was crisp and correct but his intonation more distinctly american than any of his guests on the whole i think he interested me more than any one else there  by the bye i remarked i ought to be having a little private conversation with your father this time oughtnt i  she smiled at me faintly  it is usual she assented i dont think you will find that he will have much to say i am my own mistress and he is too wise to interfere in such a matter but  well  you are a very confident person she murmured  i am confident of one thing at any rate i answered and that is that you are going to be my wife  she rebuked me with a glance which was also wonderfully sweet  some one will hear you she whispered  i shook my head  every one is too busy talking about the mysteries to come i declared  she shrugged her dazzlingly white shoulders  perhaps even you she murmured may take them more seriously some day  a few minutes later mrs van reinberg rose  we shall all meet she remarked looking round the table at eleven oclock in the library  in common with most of the younger men i left the table at the same time the usual custom i had discovered here where cigarettes were smoked indiscriminately there was baccarat in the hall billiards and bridge for those who care for them mrs van reinberg waited for me in the first of the long suite of receptionrooms mr de valentin who had been talking earnestly to her most of the time during the service of dinner remained only a few paces off it struck me that mrs van reinberg was not in the best of humors  mr courage she said i think it only right that i should let you know that mr de valentin strongly objects to your presence at our meeting tonight  i am very sorry to hear it i answered may i ask upon what grounds  he seems to imagine she declared that you are not trustworthy  mr de valentin hastily intervened  my dear mrs van reinberg he exclaimed  i hope you will believe mr courage he continued turning towards me that nothing was further from my thoughts i simply say that as you are not interested in the matter which we are going to discuss your presence is quite unnecessary and might become a source of mutual embarrassment  on the contrary i assured him i am very much interested perhaps mr de valentin does not know i added turning towards mrs van reinberg that your stepdaughter has done me the honor of promising to be my wife  there was a moments breathless pause i saw mrs van reinberg falter and i saw something which i did not understand flash across mr de valentins face  even in that case he said in a very low tone miss van hoyt will herself be present it is not necessary that you should accompany her  i regret to say that i think differently i answered unless mrs van reinberg withdraws her invitation i shall certainly be present  that mrs van reinberg declared i shall not do mr courage must do as he thinks best  mr de valentin bowed slightly and turned away his lips were parted in a very unpleasant and most peculiar smile  i am very sorry i said to mrs van reinberg to be the cause of any uneasiness  the prince she answered departing for the first time from the use of his incognito is very nervous he is used to advisers and friends and for almost the first time in his life he is entirely alone i sometimes wonder whether he has really sufficient nerve to take up a great part in life  circumstances i remarked often create the man  i hope she said a little grimly that they will make a man of mr de valentin  she took a cigarette from the little gold case which hung from her chatelaine and lit it  i will tell you mr courage she said why i am rather anxious for you to be present at the meeting tonight you are altogether disinterested and you should be able to form a sane opinion of mr de valentins proposals i should like to hear how they appeal to you  i bowed  i will tell you exactly what i think i answered  she dismissed me with a little nod  i went in search of adèle but could find no trace of her in any of the rooms at last in one of the corridors i heard nagaski barking and found him sitting outside the closed door of a small readingroom directly i moved towards him however he flew at me and seized my trousers between his teeth his eyes were fierce with anger his whole skin seemed to be quivering with excitement at the sound of his angry growls the door was opened and adèle appeared  nagaski you naughty dog she exclaimed  nagaski let go of my trousers but continued to growl adèle stooped to pick him up and he immediately attempted to lick her face i saw then to my surprise that she was very pale and had all the appearance of having received a shock  what has happened i asked  she motioned me to enter the room and closed the door behind us  i have just received a cable from europe she said in a low tone it concerns you  i looked at her keenly  well  something has been found out a friend of mr stanleys left havre yesterday for new york you will not be safe for a moment after he arrives and in the meantime i have a message for mr de valentin i wonder she added with a faint smile what chance you would have of being at the meeting tonight if i should deliver it now  then please dont deliver it i begged i am really getting curious about this affair you can hold it back for an hour or so cant you  yes she answered quietly i can do that  she was a changed being during the last hour her eyes were full of fear she seemed to have lost alike her brilliancy and her splendid courage she did not resist me when i took her into my arms but her very passiveness was ominous  come i said cheerfully this really isnt so serious as it seems i shall be away from here before mr stanleys friend arrives i may even be out of the country why shouldnt you come with me adèle  she disengaged herself gently from my arms  you are a very thoughtless person she said quietly not only would it be impossible for me to do that but there must not be a word about our engagement remember that i have given false information about you it is not the risk for myself that i mind so much butthere are other things tomorrow you or i must leave here  it shall be i of course i answered i was going anyhow dont lose heart adèle if we are to be separated it shall not be for long  she shook her head but she smiled at me although it was a little sadly  we may not have the power to decide that for ourselves she answered listen  the great clock in the tower over the stables was striking eleven we listened until it had finished  now kiss me dear she said leaning towards me  i stooped down and her arms were suddenly around me like a vise she clung to me with her whole body and held me so that i could scarcely breathe  i will not let you go she cried it is death for you if you learn their plans fate has given you to me and no one shall take you away oh stay with me jimmy sweetheartmy dear dear dear  her lips were upon mine before i could speak she was drawing me away from the door her eyes her arms her whole body seemed to be pleading with me then suddenly there came a low knocking at the door i stood awayno longer a prisoner it was a wonderful intervention this how else could i have escaped  the door opened slowly it was the french maid who stood there she looked around the room and beckoned to the dog  i beg mademoiselles pardon she said i came for nagaski i heard him whine and i thought that he was alone  she stood there motionless her pale expressionless face turned towards us her full black eyes turned hurriedly away i think that she knew what she had done adèle sank down upon the sofa and nagaski with a low growl at me sprang into her lap i left the room ungracefully enough with only a muttered word of farewell as i passed along the corridor i heard nagaskis bark of joy     chapter xxvi  for value received   there were exactly twelve people present when i entered the room and took my place at the long tablesix men and six women mr de valentin sat at the extreme end and as i entered his face grew dark with sudden anger he glanced quickly at mrs van reinberg who however was whispering to her husband and declined to look then he half rose to his feet and addressed me  mr courage he said this is a little private gathering between these friends of mine and myself to discuss a private matter in which we are all much interested under these circumstances i trust that you will not think it discourteous if i ask you to withdraw your presence might very possibly tend to check free discussion and i might add would be a source of embarrassment to myself  i glanced towards mrs van reinberg  i am here i said by the invitation of our hostess if mrs van reinberg asks me to withdraw i should of course have no alternative but to do so i should like to say however that it would give me very much pleasure to be admitted to your conference and any advice i might be able to offer as an impartial person would be entirely at your service  mrs van reinberg whispered for a moment with her husband who then leaned over towards me  mr courage he said i believe you to be a person of common sense i am not sure that i can say the same for the rest of us here seems to me id like to have you stop but there is one thing i think should be understood this is a private meeting of friends are you prepared as a man of honor to give your word to keep secret whatever passes here  i was afraid that some condition of this sort would be imposed but i was ready with my answer  most certainly i am mr van reinberg i declared with one reservation and that is that nothing is proposed which is inimical to my country i presume that i may take that for granted  you may mr van reinberg answered shortly we are not such fools as to run up against the old country on the contrary mr de valentin has assured us that his scheme has a little more than the moral support of your government  mr de valentin intervened with a little gesture of excitement  no he exclaimed i do not i must not go so far as that i do not mention any government by name  quite right mr van reinberg assented but the facts there all the same i guess you can stay where you are mr courage  mr de valentin shot an evil glance at me but he leaned back in his chair with the air of a man who has no more to say mr van reinberg on the other hand cleared his throat and stood up  well he said well get to business ive a word or two to say first to you hickson and my other friends weve none of us been idlers in the world we started out to make money and weve made it were probably worth more than any other five men in the world we can control the finance of every nation we can rule the money markets of every capital in europe personally im satisfied i guess you are it seems however that our wives arent im sorry for it but it cant be helped they want something that dollars in the ordinary way cant buy this scheme is to meet that case its my wifes ideamy wifes and mr de valentins between them i take it that if you go into it youll go into it for the same reason that i dofor your wives sakes i want to make this clear for i tell you frankly i think its the biggest fools game ive ever taken a hand in im proud of my name if my wife isnt if any one got calling me monsieur le duc of anything i guess my fingers d itch to knock him down if our wives however wont be happy till they hear themselves called madame la duchesse i suppose weve got to take a back seat mr de valentin here says that hes the rightful king of france i know nothing about history but no doubt hes right he says too that in their hearts the french people want him on the throne and with money he says he could find his way there the bargain is i understand that we find the money and he establishes our wives well amongst the aristocracy of france he asks for twelve million dollars that is two millions each if my wife asks me to i shall put my lot down much as i should buy her the czar of russias crown if it came on the market and she wanted it its for you to say whether you want to come in if you want to ask any questions theres mr de valentin hes come over to fix the thing up and i guess hes prepared to give you all particulars  there was a little murmur of conversation mr de valentin rose to his feet  my friends he said mr van reinberg in his very plain words has put before you the outline of my plans it is not very much more that i can tell you beyond this the army and the navy are loyalists i have friends everywhere they wait only for an opportunity when it comes all will be easily arranged those who are indifferent i bribe there is already a great secret society in both services one whole army corps is pledged to me look then this is what happens a great powermr de valentin looked steadfastly at mea great power one day makes a demonstration against france it is a bolt from a clear blue sky for my country alas is always preparing but never ready for war the pressi bribe the press those who are not already my friendsis hysterical it strikes the note of fear it attacks vehemently the government the moment of war arrives all is confusion i appear i address the people of france i appeal to my fellowcountrymen put your trust in me i cry and i will save you the power of whom i have spoken stays its hand its press declares for me the government resigns i march boldly into paris at the head of the army and beholdit is finished the people are at my feet the crown is on my head not a drop of blood has been spilt but war is averted and a great new alliance is formed france takes once more her place amongst the great nations of the world  the man was in earnest beyond a doubt the perspiration stood out in little beads upon his forehead his dark eyes were on fire his tone and manner tremulous with the eloquence of conviction there was a little murmur from the womena soft whisper of applause  monsieur i said quietly you have spoken well and convincingly pardon my presumption if i venture to ask you one question the power of whom you have spokenis it england  he faced me bravely enough  sir he said you ask a question which you know well it is impossible that i should answer it is not for me to betray a confidence such as this but to those who are curious i would say this which is the power think you most likely to play such a magnificent such a generous part in the history of the nations answer your own question mr courage it should not be an impossible task  six ladies leaned forward in their places and looked at me with flashing eyes it was a suitable triumph for mr de valentin and yet i knew now all that i desired dimly i began to understand the great plot and all that it meant  mr van reinberg looked across the table  well stern he asked  my husbands cheque is ready the lady at his side answered quickly i guess the prince can have it right now if he chooses  and mine five other ladies declared almost in a breath  mr van reinberg smiled  then i guess the deal is fixed he remarked  a darkhaired little woman sitting at my right hand leaned forward towards mr de valentin she wore a magnificent crown of diamonds and sapphires which had once graced a royal head and a collar of diamonds which was famous throughout the world  id like to know she said are we to choose our own titles ive fixed on one i want  mr de valentin rose in his place  my dear lady he said that would not be possible to mrs van reinberg alone i have been able to offer the name she desired that i think you will none of you object to for it is through mrs van reinberg that you are all here tonight for the rest i have taken five of the great names of france of whom today there are no direct descendants it is for you yourselves to say how these shall be allotted  five ladies looked at one another a little doubtfully mr van reinberg glanced at me and there was a shrewd twinkle in his keen eyes  i should think you had better draw for them he suggested mr de valentin can write the names down on pieces of paper and mr courage as a disinterested party can hold the hat  mr de valentin shrugged his shoulders his composure was not in the least disturbed whatever he may have felt he treated the suggestion with perfect seriousness  if the ladies are agreeable he declared i myself am quite indifferent how it is arranged as regards the money i shall give to each an undertaking to repay the amount in treasury notes within a year of my ascending the throne of my country  my neighbor in the diamonds was still a little disturbed  say she inquired what do these titles amount to anyway what shall we be able to call ourselves  either madame la comtesse or madame la marquise mr de valentin answered  madame la marquise she repeated thats the one i should like  so should i nearly all the ladies declared in unison  mr van reinberg laughed softly to himself for the first time he seemed to be enjoying the situation  theres nothing for it but the hat mr de valentin he declared  mr de valentin bowed  if every one is agreeable he said stiffly drawing a sheet of note paper towards him and beginning to write  no one seemed quite satisfied but on the other hand no one had any other suggestion to make mr van reinberg leaned forward in his chair he was beginning apparently to take a keen interest in the proceedings  of course he said softly the names could be read out and if any of you took a special fancy to any of the titles we could have a sort of auction the proceeds to go to the fund  mr de valentin turned towards him with a stony look only his eyes expressed his anger  i presume that you are not in earnest mr van reinberg he said in a low tone such a course is utterly out of the question  mr van reinberg scratched his chin thoughtfully mr de valentin completed his task and handed the slips of paper over to me  i shall ask mr courage he said rising to distribute these through the agency of chance for myself i will with your permission retire i will only say this to you ladies and to my friends i hope and believe that it will not be long before i shall have the pleasure of meeting you under very different circumstances you will be very welcome to the court of france i trust that together we may be able to revive some of her former glories and i do believe that your presence amongst our ancient aristocracy will be for her lasting good  so mr de valentin left the room a little abruptly and i thought it the most graceful thing he had done i shook up the slips of paper which he had given me in a hat and handed them round  there was an intense silence and then a perfect babel of exclamations  marquise de lafoudrè my isnt that fine  comtesse de st estien well i declare  comtesse de vinoy say richard are you listening madame la comtesse de vinoy great isnt it  mrs van reinberg smiled upon them all the wellsatisfied smile of one whose guerdon is deservedly greater than these the little dark woman turned towards her abruptly  tell us yours edith she exclaimed dont say youre a princess  mrs van reinberg shook her head unconsciously her manner was already a little changed she was after all a swan amongst these geese  we are to have the duchy of annonay she answered i suppose i shall be madame la duchesse  monsieur le duc touched me on the shoulder  here he exclaimed in my ear lets get out of this     chapter xxvii  international politics   mr van reinberg led the way silently into the smokingroom and ordered scotch whisky mr courage he said from the depths of his easychair ive got to ask you a question what do you think of us  i laughed outright  i think i answered that you are a very good husband  he lit a cigar and pushed the box towards me  im glad you put it like that he said earnestly and yet i guess were to blame weve let our wives slip away from us only natural i suppose we have our battlefields and they must have theirs we rule the money markets and they aspire to rule in society i dont know how to blame my wife mr courage but i hope youll believe me when i tell you this id sooner chuck ten or twenty millions into the atlantic than be mixed up with this affair  i believe you mr van reinberg i answered  he drew a sigh of relief i think that my assurance pleased him  tell me now he said you are a man of common sense is that fellow a crank or is he going to pull this thing off  i hesitated  his scheme is ingenious enough i said and i believe it is quite true that there are a great many people in france who would be glad to see the monarchy revived they are a people too whom it is easy to catch on the top of a wave of sentiment but so far as i can see there are at least two things against him  i trust mr van reinberg murmured that they are big enough  in the first place i continued i doubt whether mr de valentin is a sufficiently heroic figure to fire the imagination of the people he does not seem to me to have the daring to carry a mob with him and he will need that and in the second place  well  i glanced around the room we were absolutely alone but i dropped my voice  is this in confidence mr van reinberg i asked  sure  i do not believe that the power whose intervention he relies so much upon is england i do not believe that my country would risk so much to gain so little we are on excellent terms with france as it is secret negotiations with mr de valentin would be unpardonable chicanery on our part and i do not think that our ministers would lend themselves to it  mr van reinberg nodded  whom do you believe he referred to then he asked  germany i told him that is where i believe that he has made a fatal mistake he will never make a successful bid for the sympathies of the french people if he presents himself before them backed by their historic enemy of course you must understand i added that this is pure speculation on my part i may be altogether wrong one can only surmise  on the whole then mr van reinberg asked anxiously you would not back his chances  i should not i admitted  for a man who had just invested two million dollars in those chances mr van reinberg looked remarkably cheerful  im right down glad to hear you say that he admitted i know nothing about things over in europe myself and my wife seemed so confident itll be a blow to her im afraid if it doesnt come off but i fancy itll be a bigger one to me if it does  you do not fancy yourself then as monsieur le duc i remarked smiling  he looked at me in speechless scorn  do i look like a duke he asked indignantly besides im an american citizen an american born and bred and i love my country he added with a note of pride in his tone paris to me means the grand hotel the american bar the telephone and an interpreter mrs van reinberg will stay at the ritz i guess i sleep there and thats all no sir when im through with business im meaning to spend what i can of my dollars in the country where i made them and not go capering about amongst a lot of people whose language i dont understand and who wouldnt care ten cents about me anyway some people have a fancy to end their days up in the mountains where they can hear the winds blow and the birds sing and nothing else im not quite that way myself i hope ill die with my window wide open so that i can hear the ferryboats in the river and the broadway cars and the rattle of the elevated trains thats the music that beats in my blood mr courage and i guess ill never be able to change the tune say will you pass that bottle sir well drink once more sir and ill give you a toast may that last investment of mine go to smash i drink to the french republic  i pledged him and we set down our glasses hastily we heard voices and the trailing of dresses in the corridor in a moment they all came trooping in  mrs stern looked round the room eagerly  if hes gone to bed ill never forgive him she declared im just crazy to know whether there isnt some sort of old chateau belonging to the family that richard can buy and fix up have you seen mr de valentin she asked us  hes gone upstairs sure enough mr van reinberg answered give the poor man a rest till the morning wheres the marquis come and have a drink marquis  quit fooling mr stern declared testily heres esther saying ill have to wear black satin knickerbockers and a sword  wear them in wall street mr van reinberg declared and ill stand you terrapin at the waldorf come on count and the rest of you noblemen lets toast one another  mrs van reinberg motioned me to follow her into the billiardroom  well she exclaimed looking at me searchingly  i could scarcely keep from smiling but she was terribly in earnest  i want to know exactly she said what you think of it all i know my husband has been making fun of it he does not understand he never will  mr de valentins scheme is a good one i said slowly but he has not told us everything if you want my opinion  of course i do she declared  then i think i continued that his success depends a good deal upon something which he did not tell us  what is it she asked eagerly  it depends i think i said upon the power which has agreed to back his claims if that power is england as he tried to make us believe he has a great chance if it is germany i think that he will fail  she frowned impatiently  you are prejudiced she declared  perhaps i answered still i may be right you know  germany is infinitely more powerful she objected if she mobilized an army on the frontier and france found half her soldiers disaffected  you forget i interposed that there would be england to be reckoned with england is bound to help france in the event of a german invasion  she smiled confidently  i dont fancy she remarked that england could help much  i shrugged my shoulders  perhaps not i admitted yet i do not believe that german intervention will ever win for mr de valentin the throne of france  she changed the subject abruptly  apart from this let me ask you something else mr courage supposing the plot should succeed how do you think it will be with us at the french court you know more about these things than we do shall we be accepted as the original holders of these titles would have been do you think that we shall have trouble with the french aristocrats  i am afraid mrs van reinberg i answered that i am scarcely competent to answer such questions still you must remember that your countrypeople have secured a firm footing in france and it will be the king himself who will be your sponsor  she raised her head her selfconfidence seemed suddenly to have become reestablished  you are right mr courage she said it was absurd of me to have any doubts at all and now let me ask youif i maya more personal question  by all means i answered  what have you and adèle been quarrelling about  i looked at her in some astonishment  i can assure you i said that there has been nothing in the nature of a quarrel between miss van hoyt and myself  she raised her eyebrows  then why she asked has adèle gone away at a moments notice  gone away i repeated incredulously  is it really possible that you did not know mrs van reinberg asked she left just as we went in to the meeting mr sterns automobile is taking her to the depot  i had not the slightest idea of it i declared do you mean that she is not coming back  not at present at any rate mrs van reinberg declared you mean to tell me mr courage that you have not quarrelled and you did not know that she was going  i had no idea of it i said and i am quite certain that we have not quarrelled  mrs van reinberg looked as though she found my statement hard to believe  you had better go to your room she suggested and see if there is not a note for you she must have a reason for going she would tell me nothing but i took it for granted that you were connected with it  not to my knowledge i assured her if you will excuse me i will go and see if she has left any message  i hurried up to my room there was a note upon my dressingtable i tore it hastily open a few lines only hastily scribbled in pencil  dear  everything is changed since the news i told you of this evening we must separate at once and keep apart remember you have only five days if you remain in america longer than that your life is not safe  for my sake go home for my sake also burn this directly you have read it     chapter xxviii  double dealing   what sort of a place is this anyhow guest i asked him looking round me with some curiosity we were a long way from fifth avenue and what i had always understood to be the centre of new york but the bar in which we sat was quite equal to anything i had seen at the waldorfastoria the walls were panelled with dark oak and hung with oil paintings the bar itself was of polished walnut wood all the appurtenances of the place from the white linen clothes of the two servitors to the glass and silver upon the polished counter were spotless and immaculate in addition to the inevitable high stools there were several little compartments screened off after the fashion of the oldfashioned english coffeeroom of the seventeenth century and furnished with easychairs and lounges of the most luxurious description in one of these we were now sitting  better not ask me that guest answered dryly there are some places in new york of strange reputation and this is one of them now go ahead  i told him everything he was a good listener he asked no questions he understood everything when i had finished he smoked a cigarette through before he said a word then he stood up and gave me my hat  come he said we have a busy morning before us and we must catch the german steamer for hamburg this afternoon  back to europe i asked as we left the place  yes  but wont that rather give us away i asked i came to go out west you know  we must try and arrange that guest answered ill explain as we go along  we climbed an iron staircase which came down to the pavement within a few yards of the bar and took the elevated railway up town we descended at 47th street and after a short walk entered a tall building from the hall of which several lifts were running we took one of them and stopped at the eleventh floor exactly opposite to us was a door on the frosted glass of which was painted in black letters  philip h magg agent  we opened the door and entered a middleaged man dark and with jewish features was sitting writing at a desk there was no one else in the room which was quite a small one he glanced at us both carelessly enough and leaned back in his chair  good morning mr magg guest said  good morning gentlemen mr magg answered  you do not by chance remember me i suppose guest said  a faint smile parted the lips of the gentleman in the chair he rather avoided looking at us but seemed to be glancing through the letter which he had just been writing  i never forget a faceand i never remember oneunnecessarily he answered it is the a b c of my profession today i believe that it is mr guest and his friend mr courage whom i have the pleasure of greeting  for once guests face lost its immovability of expression even his tone betrayed his admiration  wonderful as ever my dear sir he exclaimed  not in the least mr magg replied i know of your presence here very simply yesterday i cabled my refusal to accept a commission on the other side  they sent to you guest exclaimed in a low tone  mr magg nodded  a very unimportant affair he answered just a record of your movements and to keep you shadowed until the french steamer is in next week unfortunately they forgot one of my unvarying rulesnever to accept a commission against a quondam client  you are a great man magg my companion exclaimed  i guess not the other answered simply what do you want with me  look at my friend guest said  mr magg looked at me and though his inspection was brief enough i felt that for the rest of my life i was a person known to mr magg  well  he is going to europe with me this afternoonand he is also going west a long way west to shoot anything he can find on four legs  mr magg nodded  he has to be duplicated then he remarked  precisely guest assented  i understand mr magg said which mr courage am i to provide  the one who stays guest answered  it can be done of course mr magg said pardon me one instant  he stooped down and fished up a kodak  a little more in the light if you please mr courage thank you that will do now sideface  i was snapshotted twice before i knew where i was then mr magg drew a sheet of paper towards him and began to make notes  you are staying he asked  waldorfastoria i answered  you will be prepared to leave practically the whole of your effects there and take your chance of ever seeing them again  certainly i answered  mr magg nodded and turned towards my companion  the other parties he remarked do not stick at trifles what do they want from mr courage  guest was serious  well he said they probably give him credit for knowing more than is good for him  mr magg was thoughtful for a moment  it will cost you five thousand dollars he said and another five for life insurance  agreed guest declared  mr magg made another note upon the sheet of paper in front of him then he turned to me  you must bring me he said before you leave the key of your room the clothes you are now wearing the keys of your trunks and any information you deem it necessary for your successor to have the french boat is due here on wednesday on tuesday mr courage shall leave the waldorf for the rockies you will excuse me now i have another appointment  we were out in the street again in a few moments  i was feeling a little bewildered  these things i said are arranged pretty quickly over here  guest nodded  mr magg he said is known as well in europe as in new york there is no one else like him he has been offered retainers from the secret service of every country in europe but he prefers to work on his own he has over a hundred assistants and yet you never meet a soul in his office  when we returned there in a couple of hours time i thought for a moment that i was looking into a mirror  a man of my own height complexion and general appearance was standing by the side of maggs desk the latter looked backwards and forwards rapidly from me to my double  very fair he remarked eyebrows a little deeper and you must note the walk george now please step into the next room and change clothes with this gentleman mr courage  i did as i was told the next room i found was a most delightfully furnished sittingroom with a chairbedstead in the corner and a dressingroom and bathroom opening out from it  you dont wear an eyeglass mr courage my companion asked  i shook my head  no glasses of any sort  you have no peculiarity of speech i have noticed your walk i suppose you are righthanded have you any friends over here whom i should be likely to come across  i should think it very improbable i answered i have made out a list of all the people i have met in america and the house in lenox where i have been staying  my companion nodded  at the waldorf he said your room i understand is 584 you havent made any friends there  i have scarcely spoken to a soul i answered  and you have made no arrangements out west  none whatever i answered  it seems easy enough he declared go on talking if you dont mind your voice needs a little study  when we reappeared in the outer room mr magg eyed us for a moment sharply and then nodded  goodday gentlemen he said pleasant voyage  we found ourselves outside with exactly an hour to catch the boat  i must buy some things for the steamer i declared  i have everything that you will want guest declared i have sent my luggage down to the boat myself no need for a man who doesnt exist you see to take any special precautions besides we are quite four miles away from the docks  we drove down to the steamer  where are our staterooms i asked  guest smiled  i havent engaged any yet he answered dont look so startled i can arrange it directly were off  i expect the sailing lists will be looked through pretty carefully  on the stroke of the hour the captains whistle sounded and the gangways were drawn up the engines began to throb in a few minutes we were on our way down the harbor i stayed on deck watching the wonderful stream of shipping and the great statue of liberty until dusk soon the lights began to flash out all around us and our pace increased america lay behind us and with it all the wonderful tissue of strange happenings and emotions which made my few days there seem like a grotesque dream     chapter xxix  i change my nationality   guest had never lost his sense of humor as we left the agents office and walked down wellington street into the strand he studied for a few moments my personal appearance and began to laugh softly  my friend he said you are wonderful after all beauty is but skin deep hardross courage if i remember rightly was rather a goodlooking fellow who would have believed that readymade clothes from hamburg glasses and a beard could work such a change  i looked down a little disconsolately at my baggy trousers and thick clumsy boots  its all very well i replied but youre not exactly a distinguished looking object yourself  guest smiled  i admit it he answered but you must remember that for ten years since i was kicked out of the diplomatic service in fact i have studied the art of disguising myself you on the contrary when i first had the pleasure of meeting you were a somewhat obvious person who would have thought that a fortnight on a german steamer and six weeks in hamburg would have turned you out such a finished article  its these dd clothes i answered a little irritably  they are helpful certainly guest admitted come let us go and have luncheon chez nous  we turned northwards again towards soho and entered presently a small restaurant of foreign appearance the outside which had once been painted white was now more than a little dingy greyishcolored muslin blinds were stretched across the front windows within the smell of cooking was allpervading a short dark man with black moustache and urbane smile greeted us at the door and led us to a table  very good luncheon today sirs he declared in german hans hors doeuvres to the gentlemen  we seated ourselves arranged our napkins as teutons and ordered beer then guest assumed a mysterious manner  business good eh he inquired  always good the headwaiter declared we have our regular customers always they come  guest nodded two or three times  heard anything about your new proprietor he asked  not yet the man answered the nephew of mr muller who died lives in switzerland a friend of mine has gone over to see him he will buy the goodwillall the place it will go on as before  guest smiled meaningly at me a smile which was meant to puzzle the waiter  but he said supposing some one should step in before your friend supposing mr mullers nephew should have put this place into the hands of an agent in london and he should have sold it to some one else eh  for the first time the man showed signs of genuine uneasiness his smile suddenly disappeared he looked at us anxiously  mr mullers nephew would not do that he declared it was always promised to my friend if anything should happen to mr muller  guest smiled cheerfully  ah he said it is unfortunate for your friend but he will be too late  too late the man exclaimed  too late guest declared i will tell you some news i have taken over the lease of this restaurant i have bought the goodwill and effects i have the papers in my pocket  the man was struggling with a more than ordinary discomposure  you make a joke sir he exclaimed the place does not pay well it is a poor investment no one would be in such a hurry to take it  guest was much concerned  a poor investment he exclaimed we shall see i have been in america for many years my nephew and i here and i have made a little money i have bought the place and it must pay  the expression on the mans face was indescribable he seemed stricken dumb as though by some unforeseen calamity with a halfmuttered apology he left us and a few moments later we saw him leave the place guest looked at me meaningly  we are right then he murmured i felt sure that i could not be mistaken this is the place they have made their headquarters that fellow has gone out to fetch somebody soon we shall have some amusement  in less than five minutes the waiter returned and there followed him through the swing doors a man to whom he turned and pointed us out this newcomer was of almost aggressively foreign appearance he wore dark clothes a soft slouch hat his black moustaches were waxed and upturned his complexion was very sallow and he was in a perspiration as though with hurrying he came straight up to us and bowed politely  is it permitted he asked in german that i seat myself at your table there is a little conversation which i should much like to have with you  both guest and myself rose and returned his bow and guest pointed to a seat  with much pleasure sir he answered my name is mayer and this is my nephew schmidt we have just returned from america  more bows the newcomer was exceedingly polite  my name he announced is kauffman i am resident in london  my nephew guest continued has lived in america since he was a boy and he speaks more readily english  mr kauffman nodded  to me he replied in english it is of no consequence i speak english most i presume from what karl there has told me that it is your intention to go into the restaurant business in this country  exactly guest answered i have a little money and my nephew there knows something of the business the headwaiter told you perhaps that i have taken this place  he did mr kauffman answered it is for that reason that i hurried here i want to give you good advice i want you not to lose your money  lose my money guest repeated anxiously no no i shall take good care of that if the books spoke the truth one does not lose money here no indeed i want to make a little and then put in my nephew as manager myself i should like to go home in a year or two  mr kauffman leaned across the table he spread out his hands with their tobaccostained fingers he was very much in earnest and he wished us to realize it  mr mayer you will have no money to take back from this place he declared slowly and emphatically on the contrary you will lose what you have put in what you saw in the books is all very well but it proves nothing amongst a certain community this place has become a meetinghouse it was to see and talk with old muller that they came a social club used to meet herethere is a room out behind as you know if a stranger comes here it will be broken up his friends will all eat and drink elsewhere  but the goodwill guest declared i bought it i have the receipt here i have paid good money for it  mr kauffman struck the table with his open hand  not worth the paper it is written on sir he exclaimed you cannot force the old customers to come a stranger will lose them all  but what am i to do guest asked uneasily if what you say is true i am a ruined man  i will swear by the kaiser that it is true mr kauffman declared now listen i will tell you a way not to lose your money i myself had meant to take over this place it would have been mine before now but i never dreamed that any one else would step in i know all the customers they are all my friends i will take it over from you at what you paid for it no i will be generous i will give you a small profit to make up for the time you have wasted  guests expression changed he beamed on the other and adopted a knowing air  aha he said i begin to understand it is a matter of business this so you were thinking of taking this restaurant eh  kauffman nodded  for me it would be a different affair altogether he said hastily i have explained that  guest still smiled  i think mr kauffman he said that i have made a good bargain i am very much obliged to you but i think that i shall stick to it  mr kauffman was silent for several moments the expression upon his face was not amiable  i understand he said at last you do not believe me yet every word that i have spoken to you is truth if a stranger becomes proprietor of this restaurant its business will be ruined  no no guest protested they will come once to see and they will remain the chef the waiters i keep them all there will be no alterations the social club of which you spokethey can have their room i am not inquisitive i shall never interfere  mr mayer kauffman said i will give you fifty pounds for your bargain  guest shook his head  i shall not sell he answered i want my nephew to learn the business and i want to go home myself soon i have no time to look out for another  one hundred  i shall not sell guest repeated obstinately i am sorry if you are disappointed  mr kauffman rose slowly to his feet  you will be sorry before very long that you refused my offer he remarked  guest shook his head  no he said i think not the people will come where they can eat well and eat cheaply they shall do both here  kauffman remained for a few more minutes at our table but he did not return to the subject after he had left us with a somewhat stiff bow he went and talked earnestly with karl the little headwaiter then he slowly returned  mr mayer he said im going to make you a very rash offer i will give you £200 profit on your bargain  i am not inclined to sell guest said one hundred or two hundred or five hundred wont tempt me now that my mind is made up  kauffman left the restaurant without a word guest called the waiter to him  karl he said do you wish to stay here as headwaiter  certainly sir the man answered a little nervously i know most of the customers but i fear they will not stay  we shall see guest answered i am not in a great hurry to make money i want them to be satisfied and i want my nephew to be learning the business you shall do what you can to keep them karl and it will mean money to you now about this club they spend money these members eh  not much karl answered dubiously  that is bad guest declared but they must spend more we will give them good things cheap what nights do they meet  no one knows karl answered the room is always ready they pay a small sum for it and they come when they choose  hm guest remarked doesnt sound very profitable what do they dosing talk or is it business  i think karl answered slowly that it is business  well well guest said we are not inquisitivemy nephew and i can one see the room  karl shook his head  not at present he answered mr kauffman has a key but he is gone  ah well guest remarked another time the bill karl for this morning i shall call myself a guest this afternoon we will take possessionmy nephew and i     chapter xxx  the waiters union   guest and i had taken small rooms not a hundred yards from the café suisse as the restaurant was called we made our way there immediately after we had settled with our friend karl and guest locked the door of our tiny sittingroom behind us he first of all walked round the room and felt the wall carefully then he seated himself in front of the table and motioned me to draw my chair up almost to his side  my young friend he said we have now reached the most difficult part of our enterprise for several days we have not spoken together confidentially i have not even told you the little i was able to discover in hamburg shall i go on  of course i answered  take off your gloves guest said you cannot wear them in the restaurant good now first of all have you seen the morning papers  no i answered  he produced one from his pocket and placing it before me pointed to a paragraph  read he said your obituary notice  this is what i read  tragic death of an english gentleman in the rockies  yesterday whilst mr charles urnans and a party of friends from new york were returning to their camp near mount phoenix they came across the body of a man in a deserted gorge halfway down the mountain he had apparently been shot through the heart by a rifle bullet and must have been dead for some weeks from papers and other belongings found in his possesion the deceased gentleman appears to have been a mr hardross courage of england  later  the body found this morning by mr charles urnans of new york has been identified as that of mr hardross courage the famous english cricketer and wellknown sportsman mr courage is known to have left new york some months ago for a hunting trip in the rockies and nothing has been heard of him for some time no trace has been discovered of his guides although his camp and outfit were found close at hand as no money or valuables were discovered on the body of the deceased it is feared that he has met with foul play  i think that no man can read his own obituary notice without a shiver for a moment i lost my nerve i cursed the moment when i had met guest i felt an intense sick hatred of my present occupation and everything connected with it i felt myself guilty of this mans death guest listened to my incoherent words gravely when i had finished he laid his hand upon nine  gently courage he said i knew that this must be a shock to you but you must not lose your sense of proportion think of the men who have sacrificed their lives for just causes remember that you and i today and from today onward can never be sure that each moment is not our last remember that we are working to save our country from ruin to save europe from a war in which not one life but a hundred thousand might perish remember that you and i alone are struggling to frustrate the greatest the most subtle the most farreaching plot which the mind of man ever conceived that poor fellow who lies out on the rockies with a bullet in his heart is only a tiny link in the great chain you or i may share his fate at any moment be a man courage we have no time for sentiment  you are right i answered go on  we are now guest declared in this position in hamburg i discovered the meetingplace of the no 1 branch of the waiters union and the place itself is now under our control in that room at the café suisse will be woven the final threads of the great scheme how are we to get there how are we to penetrate its secrets  we must see the room first i remarked  and then there is the question of ourselves guest continued we are both nominally dead men but none the less our friends leave little to chance you may not have noticed it but i knew very well that we were followed home today from the café every moment of ours will be spied upon is the change in our appearance sufficient  i looked at myself in the little gilt mirror over the mantelpiece perhaps because i looked thinking of myself as i had been in the days before these strange happenings had come into my life i answered his question promptly  i cannot believe i said that any one would know me for hardross courage i am perfectly certain too that i should not recognize in you today the leslie guest whodied at saxby  i believe that you are right guest admitted at any rate it is one of those matters which we must leave no chance only keep your identity always before you at the café suisse we shall be watched every moment of the day remember that you are a germanamerican of humble birth remember that always  i nodded  i am not an impulsive person i answered i am used to think before i speak i shall remember but there is one thing i am afraid of guest it must also have occurred to you now that the café suisse is in the hands of strangers will not your friends change their meetingplace  i think not guest answered slowly i know a little already about that room it has a hidden exit by way of the cellar into a court every house of which is occupied by foreigners a surprise on either side would be exceedingly difficult i do not think that our friends will be anxious to give up the place unless their suspicions are aroused concerning us you see their time is very close at hand now this at any rate is another of the risks which we must run  very well i answered you see the time  guest nodded  i am going to explain to you exactly he said what you have to do  right i answered  the parcel on the sofa there he said contains a secondhand suit of dress clothes you will put them on over them your old black overcoat which we bought at hamburg and your bowler hat at four oclock precisely you will call at the offices of the german waiters union at no 13 old compton street and ask for mr hirsch your name is paul schmidt you were born in offenbach but went to america at the age of four you were back in germany for two years at the age of nineteen and you have served your time at mayence you have come to england with an uncle who has taken a small restaurant in soho and who proposes to engage you as headwaiter you will be enrolled as a member of the waiters union as a matter of course but when that has been arranged you write on a slip of paper these words and pass them to mr hirschi too have a rifle  i was beginning to get interested  i too have a rifle i repeated yes i can remember that but i shall be talking like a pollparrot for i shant have the least idea what it means  you need not know much guest answered those words are your passport into the no 1 branch of the waiters union whose committee by the bye meet at the café suisse if you are asked why you wish to join you need only say because you are a german  right i answered ill get into the clothes  guest gave me a few more instructions while i was changing and by four oclock punctually i opened the swing door of no 13 old compton street the place consisted of a waitingroom very bare and very dirty a counter behind which two or three clerks were very busy writing in ponderous wellworn ledgers and an inner door i made my way towards one of the clerks and inquired in my best german if i could see mr hirsch  the clerkhe was as weedy a looking youth as ever i had seenpointed with inkstained finger to the benches which lined the room  you wait your turn he said and waved me away  i took my place behind at least a dozen boys and young men whose avocation was unmistakable most of them were smoking either cigarettes or a pipe and most of them were untidy and unhealthy looking they took no notice of me but sat watching the door to the inner room which opened and shut with wonderful rapidity every time one of their number came out another took his place it came to my turn sooner than i could have believed possible  i found myself in a small office untidy barely furnished and thick with tobacco smoke its only occupant was a stout man with flaxen hair and beard and mild blue eyes he was sitting in his shirtsleeves and smoking a very black cigar  well he exclaimed almost before i had crossed the threshold  my name is paul schmidt i said and i should like to join the waiters union  born  offenbach  age  thirty  working  café suisse  come from  america  he tossed me a small handbook  halfacrown he said holding out his hand  i gave it him i was beginning to understand why i had not been kept very long waiting  clear out he said no questions please the book tells you everything  i looked him in the face  i too have a rifle i said boldly  i found then that those blue eyes were not so mild as they seemed his glance seemed to cut me through and through  you understand what you are saying he asked  yes i answered i want to join the no 1 branch  why  because i am a german i answered  who told you about it  a waiter named hans in the manhattan hotel new york  i lied with commendable promptitude  have you served he asked  at mayence eleven years ago i answered  where did you say that you were working he asked  café suisse i said  it seemed to me that he had been on the point of entering my name in a small ledger which he had produced from one of the drawers by his side but my answer apparently electrified him his eyes literally held mine he stared at me steadily for several moments  how long have you been there he asked i do not recognize you  i commence today i said my uncle has just taken the café he will make me his headwaiter  has your uncle been in the business before he asked  he kept a saloon in brooklyn i answered  made money at it  yes  were you with him  no i was at the manhattan hotel  your uncle will not make a fortune at the café suisse he remarked  i do not think i answered that he will lose one  does he know what you propose  i shook my head  the fatherland means little to him i answered he has lived in america too long  you are willing to buy your own rifle he asked  i would rather not i answered  we sell them for a trifle he continued you would not mind ten shillings  i would rather pay nothing i answered but i will pay ten shillings if i must  he nodded  i cannot accept you myself he said we know too little about you you must attend before the committee tonight  where i asked  at the café suisse he answered we shall send for you till then  till then i echoed backing out of the room     chapter xxxi  in the enemys camp   that night i gravely perambulated the little café in my waiters clothes and endeavored to learn from karl my new duties there were a good many people dining there but towards ten oclock the place was almost empty just as the hour was striking mr kauffman who had been dining with mr hirsch rose from his place and with a key in his hand made his way towards the closed door  he was followed by mr hirsch and seven other men all of whom had been dining at the long central table which easily accommodated a dozen or more visitors there was nothing at all remarkable about the nine men who shambled their way through the room they did not in the least resemble conspirators hirsch who was already smoking a huge pipe touched me on the shoulder as he passed  we shall send for you presently he declared your case is coming before the committee  i rushed towards the front door and stood there for a few moments to get some fresh air for the atmosphere of the room was heavy with the odors of countless dinners and thick with tobacco smoke i smoked half a cigarette hurriedly and then returned there were scarcely half a dozen guests now in the place one of them a stout middleaged woman who had been sitting at the long table beckoned me to her she had very dark eyes and a not unpleasant face but she wore a hideous black sailor hat and her clothes were clumsily designed and flamboyant  is it true she asked that this restaurant has changed hands  quite true madam i answered  are you the new proprietor she asked  i am his nephew i told her he is not here this evening  are you going to keep on the eighteenpenny dinner she asked  we are going to alter nothing i assured her so long as our customers are satisfied  she nodded and eyed me more critically  you dont seem cut out for this sort of thing she remarked  i hope i shall learn i answered  where is the proprietor she asked  he is not very well this evening i told her he may be round later on  you do not talk like a german she said dropping into her own language  i have been in america nearly all my life i answered in german i speak english more readily perhaps but the other soon returns  get me the german papers please she said i expect my man will keep me waiting tonight  i bowed and took the opportunity to escape i sent the papers by one of the waiters madame was a little too anxious to crossexamine me i began checking some counterfoils at the desk but before i had been there five minutes the door of the inner room was opened and mr hirsch appeared upon the threshold he caught my eye and beckoned to me solemnly i crossed the room ascended the steps and found myself in what the waiters called the clubroom mr hirsch carefully closed the door behind me  the first thing that surprised me was that although i had seen nine men ascend the three stairs and enter the room there was now besides myself and hirsch only one other person present that other person was sitting at the head of the table and he was of distinctly a different class from hirsch and his friends he was a young man fair and well built and as obviously a soldier as though he were wearing his uniform his clothes were well cut his hands shapely and white some instinct told me what to do i stood to the salute and i saw a glance of satisfaction pass between the two men  your name is paul schmidt the man at the table asked me  yes sir i answered  you served at mayence  yes sir  under  colonel hausman sir thirteenth regiment  you have your papers  i passed over the little packet which guest had given me my questioner studied them carefully glancing up every now and then at me then he folded them up and laid them upon the table  you speak german with an english accent he remarked looking at me keenly  i have lived nearly all my life in america i reminded him  you are sure he said that you understand the significance of your request to join the no 1 branch of the waiters union  quite sure sir i told him  stand over there for a few minutes he directed pointing to the farthest corner of the room  i obeyed and he talked with hirsch for several moments in an undertone then he turned once more to me  we shall accept you paul schmidt he said gravely you will come before the committee with us now  i saluted but said nothing hirsch pushed away the table and stooping down touched what seemed to be a spring in the floor a slight crack was instantly disclosed which gradually widened until it disclosed a ladder we descended and found ourselves in a dry cellar lit with electric lights seven men were sitting round a small table in the farthest corner of the place their conversation was suspended as we appeared and my interlocutor leaving hirsch and myself in the background at once plunged into a discussion with them i too should have followed him but hirsch laid his hand upon my arm  wait a little he whispered they will call us up  who is he i asked pointing to the tall military figure bending stiffly down at the table  call him captain x hirsch answered softly he does not care to be known here  but how did he get into the room upstairs i asked i never saw him in the restaurant  hirsch smiled placidly  it is well he said my young friend that you do not ask too many questions  the man whom i was to call captain x turned now and beckoned to me i approached and stood at attention  i have accepted this man paul schmidt as a member of the no 1 branch of the waiters union he announced paul schmidt listen attentively and you will understand in outline what the responsibilities are that you have undertaken  there was a short silence the men at the table looked at me and i looked at them i was not in any way ill at ease but i felt a terrible inclination to laugh the whole affair seemed to me a little ludicrous there was nothing in the appearance of these men or the surroundings in the least impressive they had the air of being unintelligent middleclass tradesmen of peaceable disposition who had just dined to their fullest capacity and were enjoying a comfortable smoke together they eyed me amicably and several of them nodded in a friendly way i was forced to say something or i must have laughed outright  i should like to know i said what is expected of me  an exceedingly fat man whom i had noticed as the companion of the lady upstairs in the sailor hat beckoned me to stand before him  paul schmidt he said listen to me you are a german born  without doubt i answered  the love of your fatherland is still in your heart  always i answered fervently  also with all of us he answered you have lived in america so long that a few words of explanation may be necessary so  now this mans voice unimpressive though his appearance was seemed somehow to create a new atmosphere in the place he spoke very slowly and he spoke as a man speaks of the things which are sacred to him  it is within the last few years he said that all true patriots have been forced to realize one great and very ugly truth our country is menaced by an unceasing and untiring enmity wherever we have turned we have met with its influence whatever schemes for legitimate expansion our kaiser and his great counsellors may have framed have been checked if not thwarted by our sleepless and relentless foe no longer can we the great peaceloving nation of the world conceal from ourselves the coming peril england has declared herself our sworn enemy  a little murmur of assent came from the other men i neither spoke nor moved  there is but one end possible he continued slowly it is war it must come soon its shadow is all the time darkening the land so we who have understood the signs remind one another that the power who strikes the first blow is the one who assures for herself the final success  again he was forced to pause for his breath was coming quickly he lifted his long glass and solemnly drained its contents all the time over its rim his eyes held mine  so he exclaimed setting it down with a little grunt of satisfaction it must be then germany who strikes germany who strikes in selfdefence my young friend there are in this country today 290000 young countrymen of yours and mine who have served their time and who can shoot shall these remain idle at such a time no we then have been at work clerks tradesmen waiters and hairdressers each have their society each have their work assigned to them the forts which guard this great city may be impregnable from without but from withinwell that is another matter listen the exact spot where we shall attack is arranged and plans of every fort which guard the thames are in our hands the signal will bethe visit of the british fleet to kiel three days before you will have your company assigned to you and every possible particular yours it will be and those of your comrades to take a glorious part in the coming struggle i drink with you paul schmidt and you my friends to that day  he took a drink which he seemed sorely to need if any enthusiasm was aroused by his speech to me if that was really what it had been it was manifested solely by the unanimity and thoroughness with which all glasses were drained a tumbler of hock was passed to me and i also emptied it captain x then addressed me  paul schmidt he said you know now to what you are committed you are content  absolutely i answered is it permitted though to ask a question  certainly as long as it does not concern the details of our plans these do not concern you you have only to obey  i was wondering i remarked about france  captain x twirled his fair moustache  it is not for you he said to concern yourself with politics but since you have asked the question i will answer it the farreaching wisdom of our minters has been exerted to secure the neutrality of englands new ally  my ponderous friend handed a paper to me across the table  see he said it is the order for your rifle and your ticket of membership hirsch  hirsch nodded and took me by the arm a moment later i descended the three steps into the restaurant which was now almost deserted     chapter xxxii  sir gilbert has a surprise   at halfpast ten the next morning i rang the bell at the door of my cousins flat and inquired for sir gilbert hardross it was an excellent testimonial to my altered appearance that the man who answered the door and whom i had known all my life declined promptly to admit me  sir gilbert is just going out he said he is too busy this morning to see any one  i kept my foot in the door  he told me to come i declared i cannot go away without seeing him  then you can stay where you are he declared trying to close the door you can see him as he comes out  i stepped by him quickly he was a small man but he seized me pluckily by the collar just then we heard a door open and my cousin stepped out dressed for the street  what is the matter groves he asked sharply  this fellow has forced his way in sir the man answered he says that you told him to come  my cousin stood drawing on his gloves and eyed me superciliously  i think he remarked that that is a mistake isnt it i am quite sure that i have never seen you before in my life  i felt inclined to smile but the man was watching us  i have some business with you sir i said deferenially i am not begging and i will not keep you longer than two minutes  my cousin stepped back into the sittingroom i followed him and took the liberty of closing the door after me then i took off my hat drew myself up to my full height and dropped the foreign accent which i had been at so much pains to acquire  dont you know me gilbert i asked  he started at the sound of my voice and took a quick step towards me i held out my hand  god in heaven its hardross he exclaimed  i laughed as our hands met  i shall not bother about my disguise any longer i remarked it is evidently better even than i had hoped  he wrung my hand i was delighted to see that there was nothing in his face but joy  old chap he exclaimed im delighted i cant say more youve knocked me all of a heap for heavens sake talk i should like to be quite sure that im awake  youre awake all right i answered as sure as im alive how well you look in black old man i suppose its for me  he nodded  how on earth he exclaimed could the papers have made such a mistake  they werent so much to blame a man was murdered in the rockies who called himself hardross courage and who was travelling with my traps only you see it wasnt i  a man who called himself hardross courage gilbert repeated bewildered its an uncommon name  the men who killed him i answered thought that they had killed me its a long story gilbert ive come here to tell you a little of it if you can spare the time  time of course i can he declared wait one moment while i go to the telephone  i checked him on the way to the door  not a word of this to any one gilbert i said not even to groves there  he nodded and hurried out of the room when he returned he had taken off his hat and overcoat he drew up two easychairs and produced a box of cigars  now then he exclaimed for the mysteries by jove im glad to see you hardross light one of thosetheyre the old sortand go ahead  youre not a nervous person are you gilbert i asked quietly  i dont think so he answered youve given my nerves a pretty good test just now i think why do you ask  because i am going to tell you secrets i answered and because there are men in the world men in london close to us who if they knew would kill us both on sight  i am not a coward if that is what you mean gilbert answered you ought to know that go ahead  i told him everything when i had finished he sat staring at me like a man stupefied  i suppose he said at last looking from his extinct cigar into my face that i am not by any chance dreaming it is you my cousin hardross who has told me this amazing story  every word of which is true i answered firmly and i knew at once that he believed me  well he said after a short silence where do i come in  you fill a most important place i answered i want you to see polloch for us  he nodded  am i to tell him everything  everything i answered we have our secret service i suppose the same as other countries it ought to be easy enough for them to act on our information  have you seen the papers this morning he asked suddenly  no i answered is there any news  our channel squadron he said has received a very courteous invitation to visit kiel during its forthcoming cruise  they will go i exclaimed  they leave in three weeks time  if they enter german waters i said not one of them will ever return the bay will be sown with mines it is part of the great plot  yesterdays paper gilbert continued remarked upon the warm reception of the prince of normandy at the berlin court  ah i ejaculated  and the daily oracle gilbert went on had a leading article upon the huge scale of the impending german manoeuvres three days ago the kaiser made a speech declaring that the white dove of peace was after all more glorious than the eagle of war  that settles it i declared gilbert can you see the prime minister this morning  i can and i will he answered  you must convince him i declared all the proofs i can give you are here there is an account of the meeting at the summer house of mrs van reinberg at lenox with the names of all who were present and particulars of what transpired there is a copy of my admission into the waiters union with some significant notes  this is all he asked  all i repeated isnt it sufficient  polloch is an englishman my cousin said slowly and you know what that means he will need some convincing  then you must convince him i declared i am risking my life over this business gilbert and we can none of us tell which way the pendulum will swing i know that polloch is one of the old school of statesmen and hates secret service work if it were not for that such a plot as this could never have been developed under his very nose it is absolutely necessary gilbert that under some pretext or another the home fleet is mobilized within the next fortnight  its a large order jim  its got to be i answered you dont know what a relief it is gilbert to sit here and talk to you about these things guest and i scarcely ever speak of them and all the time the minutes slip by and we get nearer the time guest and i are playing a desperate game after alla single slip and we should be wiped out and no one else knows  gilbert looked up at me quickly as though a new thing had come into his mind  jim he said have you seen miss van hoyt  not since i was at lenox i answered she must still believe that i was the man who was murdered in the rocky mountainsand i dare not let her know  she certainly does believe it jim my cousin answered gravely she was here last weekshe is coming to see me again today  in england i exclaimed adèle in england  not only that my cousin continued but i believe that her coming was on your account  tell me exactly what you mean i demanded  gilbert leaned a little towards me  jim he said has there been anything between you and miss van hoyt  this much i answered that but for these confounded happenings she would have been my wife if ever i do marry anybody it will be she  gilbert nodded gravely  i thought so he answered well i can tell you something that will perhaps surprise you miss van hoyt is also  he broke off in his sentence we both sprang to our feet a womans clear musical voice was distinctly audible in the hall outside  it is she he declared do you want her to find you here to know that you are alive  good god no i answered  he pointed to the curtains which separated the apartment from the diningroom i stepped through them quickly just as groves knocked at the door     chapter xxxiii  a reunion of hearts   i heard the mans announcement i was almost conscious of his surprise as he realized the fact that his master was alone then i heard gilbert direct him to show the lady in and a moment later my heart seemed to stand still adèle had entered the room she was within a few feet of me i heard the rustle of her gown a faint perfume of violets reached me and then the sharp yap of nagaski as gilbert tried to include him in his welcome softly i stole a little closer to the curtain and peered into the room  now i was never an emotional person but there was a mist gathering before my eyes when at last i saw her she was dressed in black and her cheeks had lost all their color there was a difference even in her tone she spoke like a woman who has left the world of lighter things behind and who has vowed her life to a single purpose the impulse to rush out and take her into my arms was almost irresistible  i have come to see you sir gilbert she said because i thought you would like to know somethingof what i am going to do you andyour cousin were great friends were you not  we were indeed gilbert answered  then she continued it may be some satisfaction for you to know that his death will not be altogether unavenged i know more about it and the reason of it than you can know i know that he was murdered brutally murdered because he had stumbled into the knowledge of some very extraordinary political secrets and because as an englishman he was striving to do what he believed to be his duty his enemies were too many and too powerful but what he beganshe leaned a little forward in her chairi mean to finish  my cousin looked at her gravely  but will you not be running the same risk he asked  her lips parted in quiet scorn  a woman does not count the risks when she has lost through treachery the man she cares for she said quietly but for this i should have been neutral i am not an englishwoman myselfin fact i think my sympathies were with those who are working for her downfall but everything is changed now i am going to paris tonight and tomorrow i shall see the minister of war and general bertillet one part of this great plot at any rate shall go awry  tell me my cousin asked what isthe great plot  the old habit was powerful with her she looked nervously about the room  i cannot tell you she answered only this it is a wonderfully thoughtout scheme which if it were carried out successfully would mean the downfall of your country the part of it which i know anything about is the part which secures the neutrality of france and breaks up the alliance i mean to prevent that  take me into your confidence miss van hoyt gilbert begged  she shook her head  you are wiser not to ask that she said it is one of those cases where knowledge means death but i can at least give you a hint have you any influence at all with any member of your government  a little gilbert admitted  then persuade them not to send your fleet to kiel  gilbert rose to his feet and stood on the hearthrug looking down at her  but my dear young lady he protested there are certain international laws which every nation respects the game of war has its rulesunwritten perhaps but none the less binding the visit of the english fleet to german waters is an affair of courtesy  she interrupted him ruthlessly  did you ever hear of a warship called the maine she asked scornfully do you remember what happened to her cant you understand that these things can be arranged your better understanding with germany hangs upon a thread germany knows exactly when to snap it the english fleet will be allowed to leave kiel harbor without a doubt but every channel outside can be sown with mines in twentyfour hours if i had proofs of what i know is being planned i would give them to you but i havent go and do your best without them the french ambassador may have something to say to your ministers in a few days which should open their eyes  i shall do my best gilbert said slowly but ours is an unsuspicious nation i am afraid i shall be told that for admiral fisher to abandon his visit to kiel now without some very definite reason would be impossible  adèle shrugged her shoulders  after all she said it is your affair england has no claims upon me i have never lived here i never shallnow my work lies in france still take my advice do what you can with your ministers  she rose to her feet and in order to rearrange her scarf which had fallen a little on one side she set nagaski on the ground very slowly he made his way towards me sniffing all the time a few feet from the curtain he stopped his hair stiffened his little beady eyes were like black diamonds he barked angrily  nagaski his mistress called  he did not move neither dared i for he was within a few feet of me adèle came across the room  have you any secrets behind that curtain sir gilbert she asked  a cat most likely he answered nervously let me pick him up for you  adèle stooped down but he eluded her with a low growl he sprang through the opening and fastened his teeth in my trousers adèle turned to my cousin and her face was as pale as death  there was only one person in the world she said to whom nagaski used to behave like that sir gilbert what is there behind that curtain i insist upon knowing if there have been listeners to our conversation it will cost me my life  i stepped out it seemed to me that concealment was no longer possible she staged at me in bewilderment i had forgotten my beard my spectacles and shabby clothes she did not recognize me  has this person been here all the time is this a trap she demanded turning to my cousin with flashing eyes  i stepped forward  adèle i said dont you know me  she started violently she looked steadily at me for a moment in dumb amazement her cheeks were ashen her eyes dilated and then recognition camerecognition in which there was also an element of terror  jim she cried jim oh god  her hands went to her throat her eyes seemed as though they would devour me yet she was not wholly sure i took her into my arms  it was another man whom they shot adèle i murmured it is i indeed dearest  but i spoke as one might speak to the dead adèle had fainted in my arms     chapter xxxiv  rifle practice   adèle was herself in a very few minutes my cousin considerately slipped out of the room directly she opened her eyes and found me kneeling by her side her color became more natural  jim she murmured how did you do it tell me how it is that you are alive  a very simple matter i answered i learned at lenox all that i came to america to find out i wanted to return to england without creating suspicion so i hired a substitute to continue my trip  and he was killed she exclaimed  yes i answered i insured his life and i presume he knew his risks in any case the life of one man was a small thing compared withyou know what  she looked into my face and there was wonder in her eyes  how you have changed jim she whispered it is you isnt it i can scarcely believe it can the months really write their lines so deeply  months i answered i have passed into a different generation adèle it seems to me that my memory stops at a night a few months ago at the hotel français the things which happened before that seem to have happened to a different man  could you play cricket nowor shoot partridges  god knows i answered this thing has swallowed  me up the only thing that i do know is that i must go on to the end  she sighed  and what is to become of me she asked  i touched her lips with mineand all the passion and joy of another sort of life warmed my blood once more  wait only a few months dear i answered confidently and i will teach you  hope and incredulity struggled together in her face  you believe she exclaimed that you will succeed  why not i answered i am counted dead could you yourself recognize me  she shook her head doubtfully  your face itself is so changed she answered my poor jim you are a very different person from the goodlooking boy whose life seemed to depend upon catching that ball at lords i think that you must have suffered a great deal  i have bought experience and the knowledge of life i said grimly and i suppose i have paid a pretty stiff price for it  i hesitated  are you strong enough adèle i asked for another shock  i have lost the capacity for surprise she answered try me  the real name of the man who is passing as my uncleis leslie guest  she scarcely justified her last assertion for her eyes were full of wonder and she drew a little away from me as though in fear  leslie guest the man who died at saxby  he did not die i answered it was a case of suspended animation when i read his letter to me and when i saw you in the morning i believed him dead so did all the others it was in the middle of the next night that the nurse discovered that he was alive we sent for the doctor and by the next morning he was able to speak it was then that we determined to make use of what had happened  i see she murmured that is why you changed the place of burial  i nodded  guest planned the whole thing himself i said it was easily arranged the curious part of it all is that he seems to have got the poison out of his system entirely now  she looked at me a little breathlessly  you are really wonderful people both of you she said  we have been very fortunate i answered  and why she asked are you dressed like a somewhat seedylooking foreigner  i am the headwaiter at the café suisse i answered  where is that  in soho guestmy uncleis the proprietor  listen jim she said do not tell me why you are there or what you are doing i suppose i ought to be working on the other sidebut i shall not what i was going to do for the sake of you dead i shall do now for the sake of you living you and i are allies  pour la vie i answered kissing her fingers you see even nagaski is becoming reconciled to me  she smiled and patted his head  at any rate she said but for him i should not have found you i wonder  i answered her unspoken question  i should not have come out i told her to tell you the truth adèle i am a different man now from what i was half an hour ago i had forgotten that i was still a live being and that the world was after all a beautiful place i think i had forgotten that there was such a person as hardross courage the absorption of these days when one has to remember even with every tick of the clock that the slightest carelessness the slightest slip means certain deathwell it lays hold of you no wonder the lines are there dear  some day she whispered i will smooth them all away for you   gilbert came in a few minutes later  i am sorry to disturb you he said but it is time i was off  he glanced at adèle  we have no secrets i declared quickly  he smiled  well he said i have an appointment with the foreign secretary at three oclock this afternoon where can i see you afterwards  i hesitated that was rather a difficult question to answer  i dont want to come here too often i answered do you mind sitting up a little later than usual tonight  of course not he answered gravely  then let me come to your club about a quarter to one i said you can see me in the strangers room  adèle rose and gave me her hand  i too must go she said i may write to you hereif i do i shall address the envelope to sir gilbert goodbye  i kissed her fingers and she drew away from me a little shyly my cousin saw her to the door and in less than half an hour i was in my shiny dress coat on duty for luncheon at the café suisse  there were the usual crowd of people there but no one whom i recognized particularly until the stout lady who had talked to me the night before came in i showed her to a table and she talked to me graciously in german she had discarded her black sailor hat and had the appearance of being dressed in her best clothes  you see today i am alone she remarked drawing off her gloves and revealing two large but wellshaped hands the fingers of which were laden with rings  you must take good care of meso and i am hungryvery hungry  it was a table dhôte luncheon for eighteenpence and she ate everything that was set before her and frequently demanded second helpings all the time she talked to me sometimes in german sometimes in broken english she seemed quite uneasy when i was not all the time by her side  my good man she told me has gone away for twothree days i am lonely so i eat more why do you smile herr schmidt  i shook my head  i know what you think she continued her black eyes upraised to mine you think that after all i am not so very lonely perhaps you are right my good man he is much older than i sometimes he is very tiresome  i murmured my sympathy just at that moment guest entered and passed through to the little office all smiles and bowsthe typical restaurateur madame eyed him keenly  it is your uncle the new proprietor is it not she asked  i nodded and left her on the pretext of a summons from another table something in guests look had told me that he wished to speak to me he was taking off his overcoat when i entered the office  be careful of that woman he whispered in my ear she is dangerous  i nodded  she is hirschs wife i remarked  she passes as such i know he answered i have come across her once or twice in my time she is cleverer than she seems and she is dangerous any news  we have a fresh ally i answered she goes to paris this afternoon  miss van hoyt he exclaimed  yes  he glanced at a calendar  good luck to her he answered we will talk later go back into the restaurant  i obeyed him and almost immediately madame called me to her side  i have a message for you she whispered in my ear  you are to be at max sonnebergs rifle gallery at four oclock this afternoon  from your husband i asked  so you will be there  certainly where is it i asked  18 old compton street she answered afterwards  she hesitated i stood before her in an attitude of respectful attention  you like to come and drink a glass of beer with me she asked i live close there  she was smiling at me with placid amicability i was a little taken aback and hesitated  you come she whispered persuasively no 36 over the tailors shop you will find it easily afterwards i come here to dine so  i was on the horns of a dilemma for while my acceptance of her invitation might land me in a somewhat embarrassing position i was still anxious to know exactly what her reasons were for asking me she leaned a little closer towards me her black eyes were very bright and sparkling  i expect you she declared so  i bowed  thank you very much i said i will come  she paid her bill and departed i opened the door for her myself and she whispered something in my ear as she went out karl who had been watching us curiously came up to me a few moments later  you know who she is he asked  hirschs wife i answered nodding  you had better be careful he said slowly hirsch is not a safe man to play tricks with  i told guest what had passed he agreed with me that it was an embarrassing position but he was insistent that i should go  one cannot tell he remarked even the cleverest women have their interludes i rather fancy though that this time the lady has something more in her mind  at four oclock i presented myself at the door of an entry at the address which had been given me an untidylooking girl pointed out to me some stairs over which was a hand pointing downwards and a notice  max sonnebergs rifle range  i descended the stairs and found myself in a sort of cellar with two tubelike arrangements down one of which a young man was shooting mr sonneberg rose slowly from a chair and came towards me  paul schmidt is it not he asked  i nodded  i was told to come here at four oclock i said  quite right now tell me what is this he asked taking from a seat near and placing in my hand a weapon similar to the one with which the boy was shooting  i handled it curiously  it is a service rifle reduced size i remarked  he nodded  let me see you load it he directed pointing to a box of cartridges  i obeyed him without hesitation he pointed to the unoccupied tube  shoot he directed  the tube was an unusually long one and the bullseye rather small but i fired six shots and each time the bell rang mr sonneberg made a note in a book which he had taken from his pocket  very good he declared you have passed first class you shall have your rifle tonight and cartridges keep them in a safe place andremember  he pressed a cigar upon me and patted me on the back  there are some who come here he declared and i find it very hard to believe that they have ever seen a rifle before with you it is different you will shoot straight my young friend a life for every cartridge eh  i was always fond of shooting i told him  come again my young friend he said cordially and show some of these others how a young german should shoot you do not need practice but it does me good to see a man hold a rifle as you do so  i left the shooting gallery with flying colors i was not so sure of my next appointment     chapter xxxv  hirschs wife   madame received me with a beaming smile i found her apartment furnished in the typical german fashion there were two heavy mirrors a plush tablecloth and chairs covered with stamped velvet a canary was singing in a cage fashioned like a church a model of a german village stood proudly upon the sideboard one end of the room was hung with thick curtains madame herself had arranged her hair with a heavy black fringe and pinned an enormous blue bow at the back of her neck  we will sit together here she said indicating the sofa and we will talk of england but first you shall open the beer  there were several bottles upon the sideboard and a corkscrew i poured madame out a glass and then one for myself madame was already making room for me by her side when an inspiration came to me  you will drink a health with me i asked  she raised her glass i assumed a profoundly sentimental air  it is to a little girl in frankfort i said sighing to meine liebe elsie soon i shall return to marry her  madame raised her glass  to elsie she repeated and drank very nearly the whole of its contents then she set the glass down and looked at it thoughtfully  so she murmured you have in frankfort a little girl  yes madame i answered  my hostess became thoughtful for a few moments i could not flatter myself that it was disappointment which had furrowed her brow she had however the air of one who finds it necessary to readjust her plans it was during those few moments that i noticed the bulge in the curtains concerning which i was wise enough to hold my peace  you will marry her some day she inquired  as soon i answered as i have saved enough money my uncle offers me the chance now it is for that that i came back from america  she nodded  money she remarked is not easily made it takes time  it is true i agreed  and you are very anxious to be married she is pretty this little one  i wish i had her picture madame i answered with enthusiasm that i could show you you would understand then that i am very anxious indeed to be married  but to save money she said slowly it takes time that eh  i could not see for the life of me what she was driving at but i assented sorrowfully at any rate i was holding my own  herr paul she said raising her black eyes to mine have you ever looked about you for a way to make money more quickly  i have thought of it often i admitted but i have not succeeded one cannot do as these foolish english doback horses in races they never see stocks and shares i do not understand i can only work and my uncle though he promises much pays little  she nodded her head  and all this time she murmured the poor little girl waits  what can one do i murmured dejectedly she motioned me to draw a little nearer to her herr paul she said i think that i could show you a way to make money a large sum of money quickly if you had courage  ah  i drew a little closer to her she nodded again several times  you are not a fool herr paul she remarked  i am not very clever i answered sorrowfully but i do not think that i am a fool  you are a member of the no 1 branch of the waiters union she said slowly  there is no money in that i answered they even want me to pay something for my own rifle  and when the time comes she said thoughtfully you will probably be shot  at least i said hopefully i will shoot a few english first but it is true what you say madame  she whispered in my ear  the english government she said would give a great deal of money to the person who told them about that no 1 branch it would be easily earned eh  i would have risen to my feet but she pulled me back  do not be foolish herr paul she said what has your country done for you when you are older and wiser you will understand that there is only one hand worth playing for in the world and that is your own i hate all this talk about patriotism and the fatherland they are all very well for holiday times but the first thing in the world and the only thing is money i want it and so do you let us earn it together  i rose slowly to my feet  madame i said permit me to leave i shall try to forget what you have suggested i love my little girl and i love money but never that way  i think that madame was a little surprised she tried to pull me down again by her side but i resisted  you are a very foolish young man she said vigorously sit still and listen to me what would your sweetheart say if she knew that you were throwing away a chance of marrying her perhaps next month who can tell  madame i said if you say more you say it at your own risk so far as we have gone i will try to forget but i would like you to understand that i am not an informer  her face darkened  you are afraid of running a little risk she muttereda very small risk remember that it would be a fortune with what i can tell you it would be a fortune for both of us and no one need know that it was us  i took up my hat  madame i said i am sorry that i came i wish you good afternoon  i think that she had made up her mind then to waste no more time upon me for with a shrug of the shoulders she rose to her feet she smoothed her hair in front of the glass and patted her bow  i think herr paul she said that if it had not been for the little girl in frankfort we might have arranged thiseh  i shook my head  never i answered but if it had not been for her  well  madame knows i answered bowing over her bejewelled fingers auf wiedersehen  she let me go then and glad enough i was to get away from the atmosphere of cheap scent and madames stealthy advances i realized of course that the whole affair was a trap bred of this womans suspicions of me nevertheless i scarcely dared to hope that they were finally allayed i told guest about my afternoons adventure and he treated it very seriously indeed  she is one of the most dangerous women we could possibly have to deal with he told me i have known of her all my life she was in paris twelve years ago and she has twice brought germany and france to the brink of war she trusts or mistrusts wholly by instinct and i have heard her boast that she is never mistaken you have scored this time but she wont let you alone she is a regular sleuthhound  i am warned i assured him i shall do all that i can to keep out of her way  i left a little before closing time that night and made my way by a circuitous route to my cousins club i was shown into the strangers room and gilbert came to me in a few moments his face told me at once that he had met with no success he carefully closed the door and came over to my side of the room  jim he said its horrible but ive failed completely to convinceour friend i havent even made the least impression upon him he listened to all that i had to say with a very polite smile and every now and then kept on taking out his watch when i had finished he thanked me very much but gave me clearly to understand that he considered i had been made a fool of i tried to persuade him to see you but he declined pointblank shall i tell you his message to you  i nodded  he sent his compliments and begged you not to neglect your winter practice said he had set his heart upon the county winning the championship next season  in plain words i remarked bitterly he recommends me to mind my own business  gilbert nodded silently he was unfolding an evening paper  it is like trying to save a drowning man who persists in clinging to ones neck i remarked gilbert i have had a german servicerifle given me today with a plain hint that i may expect to be using it within a month i even know which of the tilbury forts i shall be expected to share in taking  my cousin nodded and opened out his paper  the channel squadron he announced leaves devonport for kiel on thursday next and here in another part of the paper is the little rift in the lute listen  we understand that a slight difficulty has arisen with germany as to the proposed morocco commission in view of the better understanding however now existing between the two governments a speedy agreement is believed certain  we shall have an ultimatum gilbert declared grimly as soon as our ships are safely anchored in kiel harbor polloch may change his tone then but he will be a little too late what can we do jim whom can we appeal to  heaven only knows i answered if adèle succeeds in paris a hint may come from there  it is a slender reed gilbert said for so mighty an issue to rest upon  i was thoughtful for a few moments  i have had proof within the last few hours i said that i am under a certain amount of suspicion and it is very possible that i am watched yet after all that is comparatively unimportant do you think that polloch would see me  i am sure that he would not gilbert answered promptly in fact i may as well tell you at once that he has set us down for a pair of cranks he dismissed me today almost peremptorily and i have reason to know that he has warned other members of the cabinet against us he told me plainly that it was the policy of his government to conciliate germany and he considered that a good deal of the illfeeling in the past had been due to the fact that we were always oversuspicious of germany and her actions when i spoke of organized corps of waiters and clerks here 300000 of them in commission all of whom had had military training and possessed rifles he practically called me an ass  gilbert i said slowly we are up against an impasse i shall go back and consult with guest he is the most resourceful man i know he may be able to suggest something  gilbert did not attempt to detain me we walked together across the hall of the club of which i too by the bye was a member and i was careful to carry my hat in my hand just as we were reaching the porters box a man in brilliant uniform only partially concealed by a heavy military cloak pushed open the swing doors and entered the club he passed us by without a glance but my heart was in my mouth  gilbert i whispered who was that  count metterheimhe is on the military staff at the german embassy why  i looked around count metterheim had passed into the smokingroom and there was no one else within earshot  he is also i said on the committee of the no 1 branch of the waiters union i have been up before him at the café suisse     chapter xxxvi  an urgent warning   madame came alone to luncheon the next morning and beckoned me to her table well she said with her black eyes fixed steadily upon mine you are of the same mind eh  i bowed  i prefer to think i said that you were joking yesterday  so she answered and began to eat i gathered that i was dismissed but presently she called me back again  you have many friends in london herr paul she asked  none at all i answered it is very lonely  i thought she said that i saw you coming out of some flats in dover street the other day  madame was a little overanxious she was showing her hand too openly  i leaned over the table after a cautious glance around  i will tell you i said since you are so kind as to be interested i am looking for another situation i think that i shall go into a private family  another situation she exclaimed you are not satisfied here  i shook my head  my uncle i said is a very mean man he does not like to pay both karl and myselfand he pays me very little it is all promisesand meanwhile elsie waits  madame laughed not altogether pleasantly  elsie is likely to wait she said you are too scrupulous herr paul i have shown you how to make a great deal of money  the money with which i marry elsie i answered shall not be blood money  she let me go then and i went away well pleased i fancied that i was holding my own with madame and i had left the way clear for my next visit which was no small thing  at halfpast three the restaurant was almost empty very soon after four i rang the bell of lady dennisfords town house in park lane the man who opened it stared at my request to see her ladyship eventually however i persuaded him to take in a message i wrote a single word upon a plain card and in five minutes i was shown into a small boudoir  lady dennisford entered the room almost at the same instant from an opposite door she was dressed in deep mourning but it seemed to me that something of the old weariness was gone from her face she looked at me searchingly but obviously without recognition  i am lady dennisford she said what is your business with me  i kept my eyes fixed upon her steadily  you do not recognize me lady dennisford i asked  she frowned slightly  your voice is familiar she answered andwhy you have a look of hardross courage who are you  i am hardross courage i answered please do not look at me as though i were something uncanny the report of my death was a little premature  she held out her hands  my dear hardross she exclaimed you have taken my breath away i am delighted of course butshe continued looking at me wonderinglywhat has happened to you where did you get those clothes  i am going to explain everything to you lady dennisford i declared but before i do so let me ask you something i have given you one shock can you stand another  what do you mean she asked  you see before you i answered one dead man who has come to life can you bear to hear of another  then every shred of color left her cheeks and she trembled like one stricken with an ague but all the time her eyes were pleading passionately with mine as though it lay in my power to make the thing which she longed for true  notnot leslie it is impossible  it is the truth i answered he is alive  i caught her just in time and led her to the sofa her face was bloodless even to the lips  lady dennisford i said earnestly for his sake for mine bear up dont let me have to call for the servants we are both in danger your people will probably be questioned  i will be brave she answered with quivering lips but what did it meanat saxby then why there was a funeral  he was hardpressed i told her and it was the only way to save him be brave lady dennisford for i have come to you for help  i will do everything you ask me to she answered but tell me one thing more he is alive  he is in london i answered he would have come himself but the risk would have been greater will you listen to what i have to say  go on she answered i am ready  you know what happened to him in berlin fifteen years ago i began he suffered for anothers fault but he suffered his career was over he was left with but two objects in life one was a desire to reinstate himself another hatred for the country whose spies had brought ruin upon him he changed his identity but he remained at berlin for years he met with no success then fortune favored him by chance he picked up one of the threads of the most cunning the most cruel the most skilfully thoughtout plots against this country which the secret history of the world had ever known he escaped to london but spies were already on his track i saved him from death once and from that moment i too was drawn into the vortex let me tell you exactly what has happened to us since we joined forces  lady dennisford was a good listener i gave her in as few words as possible a faithful account of our adventures and she never once interrupted me with a single question when i had finished she was perfectly calm and selfpossessed  it is the most wonderful story i have ever heard she declared with glowing eyes  the most wonderful part of it from our point of view is to come i answered grimly we have a fair amount of proof and we have laid all the facts before the foreign secretary and the prime minister  well  they absolutely refuse to believe us notwithstanding everything that we have put before them the channel squadron has sailed for kiel  lady dennisford was a woman born for emergencies she made no remark she simply asked the one sensible question  what can i do  lord esherville is your cousin is he not  yes  he is an influential member of the cabinet will you go to him tell him what you know of us tell him who guest is and his history try and convince him that we are not cranks and that the country is really in the deadliest peril get him to see polloch at once both guest and myself are watched because we have taken a café which is frequented by these people but we will arrange a meeting somehow try and get us a hearing  she rose to her feet  when  it must be within the next thirtysix hours i answered or it will be too late  where shall i let you know  letters are not safe i answered i will call here at eleven oclock tomorrow morning  you are not going she exclaimed you will have some tea  i laughed outright  please dont forget i begged her that i have come about a situation i am going to bring my references tomorrow  absurd she murmured softly islesliealso awhat did you say you werea waiter  he is the proprietor of the café suisse in old compton street i answered i am his nephew learning the business  may i come and lunch she asked  i think not i answered smiling our restaurant does not cater for such clients  then how shall i let you know she asked  i will bring my references tomorrow i answeredat eleven oclock  i bought an evening paper on my way back to the café suisse of news here was very little a leading article commented with what to me seemed fatuous satisfaction upon our improved foreign relations our entente with france was now in a fair way to be supplemented by a better understanding with germany great things were hoped from the friendly visit of our fleet to kiel such international courtesies made always for good and as i walked through the twilight with the paper clenched in my hand i forgot where i was i seemed to see over the grey sea to where silently and secretly the long service trains to germany crawled to that far northward point disgorging all the while their endless stream of soldiers with mathematical regularity the great plot moved i read the extracts from the berlin and frankfort papers and i knew that the wonderful example of the worlds newest power had been scrupulously followed no word was there of secret manoeuvres amidst the wastes of those northern sands i read the imposing list of battleships and cruisers now ploughing their stately way across the dark waters and i shuddered as i thought of the minesown track across which they would return i remembered what a great german statesman had once boldly declaredthere is no treachery if it be only on sufficiently great a scale which success does not justify and here was i almost the only englishman who knew the truthpowerless  it was a busy night at the café suisse guest promenaded the room in his tightly fitting frock coat his grey wig and newly grown imperial exchanging greetings with his clients in many languages the long table was full hartwell was there and hirsch and kauffman madame and the others and always i fancied that when i approached their table their voices dropped a little and covert glances followed me when i turned away had madame succeeded in making them suspicious i wondered  they went into the clubroom as usual and a quiet time followed in the restaurant i went to talk with madame but she had little to say to me somehow though i could not move a yard without feeling that her eyes were upon me once only she beckoned to me  well she asked have you found the place yet where you will make so much money that you can send for the beloved elsie  i smiled deprecatingly  i have answered two advertisements i said one at a club but they were no good i am going to see a rich english lady tomorrow morning she may engage me as butler  you are a very foolish young man herr paul she said you do not know how to look after yourself you will never make any money  it was one oclock the next morning before guest and i turned homeward to our rooms for we had thought it well to separate and i could tell him what had passed between lady dennisford and myself he heard me without interruption but i saw his face twitch with anxiety  it is almost the last chance he muttered     chapter xxxvii  the black bag   lady dennisford had failed i saw it in her face as soon as i entered the room and her first few words confirmed it  its no use jim she declared ive done my best but there isnt a soul who will listen to me  good god i murmured and sat down on the sofa  there is not a single man in the cabinet of the slightest influence she continued who will take this affair seriously lord esherville assured me solemnly that the whole affair was absurd and impossible polloch declares that we have been brought to the brink of war with germany twice already through treating her overtures with too much suspicion he is absolutely determined that the mistake shall not be repeated  how about the massing of troops on the french frontier i asked  ordinary manoeuvres lady dennisford said the whole proceeding is absolutely open  and the reception of the prince of normandy by the emperor  an act of private courtesy he ridicules the idea of german interference in french politics  and the rifle union  if he believes in it at all he looks upon it simply as a social and patriotic club with which we have nothing to do he ridicules the idea of regarding it as a force that could be utilized even in the event of war  then all three things happening together are merely coincidences i said bitterly he is blind enough to believe that  he believes it most sincerely lady dennisford answered  he will not stop the fleet going to kiel  he almost lost his temper at the bare suggestion lady dennisford answered the slight hitch in the morocco negotiations he says is simply owing to a misunderstanding which will be cleared up in a day or two  now i can understand i said why on the continent they always speak of british diplomacy with their tongues in their cheeks to think that the destinies of a great country should be in the hands of men like this why what can our secret service be about  i believe lady dennisford said that they have lately been presenting some disquieting reports but it is all of no use every member of the cabinet has got his back up lord polloch says that germanys friendship is absolutely necessary to us just now and his cabinet are determined to secure it  they will i muttered at a price lady dennisford you will excuse me i know i must hurry back and see guest  what is there left for you to do  heaven only knows i answered i am afraid we are at the end of our tether if guest has yet another card up his sleeve he has kept it secret from me i must see him at once  you will let me hear from you soon she begged as i departed  the newspapers may have more to tell you than i i answered but i will come againabout the situation  guest was waiting for me in the little glass enclosure we called an office he saw my news written in my face  she has failed he murmured  utterly i answered  we were both silent for a moment the crisis of our fortunes had come and for the first time i saw guest falter he removed his spectacles for a moment and there was despair in his eyes  to think that we should have done so muchin vain he muttered if one could think of it there must be a way out  his head drooped for a moment and glancing up i saw hirschs dark inquisitive face watching us through the glass  put on your spectacles and be careful i whispered we are being watched  guest was himself again in a moment i stepped out into the restaurant where a few early luncheon guests were already arriving and attended to my duties as well as i could hirsch and his wife were at their usual corner table and they were presently joined by marx and two others of the committee before whom i had appeared they all carried newspapers and their conversation though constant and animated always languished at my approacha fact which somewhat alarmed me madame watched me ceaselessly i was perfectly certain once when their heads were very close together that i was the subject of their conversation as soon as i realized this i tried without pointedly avoiding them to keep out of their way  we were very full that morning and every one seemed to linger a long time over their luncheon i was sick to death of the place and my weary peregrinations from table to table of the smile i wore and the small jests and complaints i was forced to receive the smell of the cooking was like some loathsome poison in my nostrils i felt that morning with the depression of despair upon my heart that this was a fools game which i had been playing and then my heart stood still and my recently developed powers of selfcontrol received a severe shock a familiar little yap had given me the first warning i turned sharply round towards the door adèle followed by a small elderly gentleman with a red ribbon in his buttonhole had just entered  i hastened towards them and i addressed adèle without a flicker of recognition in my face i piloted them to a table a little apart and handed her the carte  we shall remain she said calmly and with the air of one giving an order until the place is nearly empty come and talk to us as soon as you can safely  i bowed and handed them over to the waiter whose duty it was to serve at their table as i passed down the room i glanced towards the hirsch table they had ceased their conversation every one of them was staring at the newcomers soon they began to whisper together madame beckoned to me  do you know who they are herr paul those people who have just come in she asked the little old gentleman for instance he is a frenchman is he not  i shook my head  they are strangers madame i told her the gentleman has not spoken yet but he wears a red ribbon in his coat  madame dismissed me with a little nod i stood for a moment at a neighboring table and i heard hirschs low voice  if it is he he muttered there is mischief brewing but he has come too late  if it is he madame murmured there is danger there is always danger you rememberat brussels  i could hear no more and i dared not show my curiosity somewhat abruptly it seemed to me the little party finished their luncheon and departed the place began to grow emptier i took careful stock of the few people that were left and decided that the coast was clear i returned to adèle and her friend  tell us both quickly she said in a low tone exactly how things stand this gentleman is the head of the french secret police he is here to help if it is possible  we have collected our material i answered and placed it before the government here we are up against an impasse through different sources we have approached several members of the cabinet the result has been the same in every case we are treated as madmen polloch will do nothing the fleet has sailed the rifles remain in the alleys of soho and heaven knows where not a single precautionary measure has been taken  in a lesser degree she said i too have failed i have succeeded in getting the royalist officers removed from the frontier army but with regard to the navy they would do nothing the french government declined to believe that england might need assistance we shall get no aid from there  the little old gentleman leaned over and addressed me  what is your next step  we have none i answered bluntly i have only spoken for a minute or two with guest since we heard of our last failure shall i fetch him  adèle nodded i went for guest who was promenading the room with his hands behind him casting every now and then a sharp glance in our direction  they wish to speak to you said  he nodded and walked by my side  our friend he said is admirably disguised but i recognized him it is monsieur bardow the cleverest man in france  the two men exchanged bows and smiles a waiter was standing near  i insist monsieur monsieur bardow said that you and your nephew here join me in a bottle of wine we will drink luck to your new venture no you must seat yourself you and your nephew also  the farce was well kept up till the wine had been fetched and the waiter dismissed then monsieur bardow with the mild expression of one who is still exchanging compliments began to talk  mr guest he said i know you and i think that you know me we are both up against a hard thingofficials who wont believe what does sound a little perhaps like a fairy story i have succeeded a little you not at all i consider that a disaster to england however would be a disaster also to my country i am here therefore to see if i can be of service to you  adèle leaned over towards us  monsieur bardow she said has already been to his ambassador here  and monsieur lestrange who is good enough to have complete confidence in me went at once to downing street monsieur bardow explained when he returned he was angry  guest tapped on the table with his forefinger  we have submitted our proofs he said and they have been received with derision your ambassador monsieur bardow has spoken for usand in vain in what different manner can we approach this woodenheaded government you have come here with something to propose what is it  monsieur bardow nodded assent he opened his mouth to speak suddenly his expression changed he pointed to the door the words came from his lips with the crisp rapidity of a repeating rifle  who is that man he demanded look quick  i was just in time to see hirschs figure disappearing through the swing doors  a man named hirsch i answered  who is he  one of the committee of the union i answered  he left something with a waiter call the waiter quickly monsieur bardow demanded  i obeyed at once the waiter a swissgerman hurried to our table  what did mr hirsch want i asked  he said that he was coming back to dinner this evening and he left a bag the waiter replied  bring the bag here at once bardow ordered  already he had risen to his feet something of his excitement had become communicated to us in obedience to a peremptory gesture from guest the waiter hurried off and returned almost immediately carrying a small black bag bardow held it for a moment to his ear we were all conscious of a faint purring noise nagaski began to whine monsieur bardow laid the bag gently down upon the table  out of the place for your lives he commanded in a tone of thunder i took adèles arm we all rushed for the door we had barely reached it before the floor began to heave the windows to fall in and a report like thunder deafened us we emerged into the street wrapped in a thick cloud of curling smoke with masonry and fragments of furniture falling all around us but we emerged safely though of the café suisse there was scarcely left one stone upon another     chapter xxxviii  a last resource   from all sides a great crowd gathered with almost inconceivable rapidity we pushed our way through and gained a side street in safety monsieur bardow arrested the attention of a fourwheeled cab galloping towards the scene of the disaster and motioned us to enter we all crowded in and monsieur bardow who entered last gave an address to the driver  my friends he said as he finally stepped in i am afraid that it was my presence which has brought this disaster upon your café my disguise is good but not good enough to deceive the cleverest rogues in europe let us take up our conversation where it was interrupted  guest nodded  the café has served its turn he declared i am glad it is gone although it was a close shave for us monsieur bardow i believe that you have something to suggest there is no time to lose  the little frenchman nodded  i have he admitted it is perhaps a forlorn hope but it is our only chance you have appealed to the governmentyou have failed appeal then to their masters  the people guest exclaimed but how there is no time  there is only one way monsieur bardow declared but it is a royal way the things which we four in this cab know could be driven home to every living englishman in little more than twelve hours time if we can only find  the press i cried  if we can only find monsieur bardow continued with a little nod an editor man enough to throw the great dice  staunton guest exclaimed  we are on our way there monsieur bardow declared he is our one hope  i glanced towards guest there was a new fire in his eyes i saw that the idea appealed to him nervously he flung down the window and let in the fresh air  a newspaper agitation he muttered takes time and if that destroyer does not leave by four oclock tomorrow afternoon  monsieur bardow held up his hand  we go no further he said it shall leave  the cab drew up before the palatial offices of the daily oracle monsieur bardow took the lead and with very little delay we were escorted to a lift and into a waitingroom on the third floor here our guide left us but only for a moment in less than five minutes after we had entered the building we were in the presence of john staunton editor and managing director of the daily oracle a paper whose circulation was reported to be the largest which any english journal had ever attained he was sitting a slight spare man before a long table in the middle of a handsomely furnished room before him were telephones of various sorts a mass of documents and a dummy newspaper he held out his hand to monsieur bardow and half rose to his feet as he noticed adèle  you have something to say to me monsieur bardow he said rapidly as quickly as possible if you please this is the busiest hour of the day for me  you may reckon it also monsieur bardow said the greatest hour of your life for i am going to give you an opportunity today of making history for all time  staunton raised his eyebrows yet it was easy to see that he was impressed  your friends he asked glancing towards us  monsieur bardow turned to guest  forgive me he said but it must be truth now and nothing else this is lord leslie wendover third son of the duke of mochester you may remember lord leslie wendovers name in connection with the berlin scandals fifteen years ago this he added turning to me is hardross courage you have heard of him no doubt the lady is miss van hoyt of america  mr staunton bowed to all of us  well he said  each one of us monsieur bardow said standing a slim calm figure at the end of the table with his fingers resting upon its leather top has a story to tell you the stories vary only from their point of view the end of all is the same it is this unless the english government sends a fast destroyer to kiel before four oclock tomorrow afternoon the germans will command london before seven days have passed and to the best of my belief mr staunton you are the only man who can save this country  i will hear the story in a moment staunton said calmly first you have been to the government  we have guest answered they decline to hear us believe us or receive us they scoff at our facts and ignore our warnings  you have some proofs  we have almost convincing ones guest answered a further one almost cost us our lives a few minutes ago the restaurant where we were deliberating was blown up by a bomb placed there by some one who suspected us  the name of the restaurant staunton asked  the café suisse i told him  from his look of interest i knew that he had heard something about the place  well he said let me hear the stories  guest told his first i followed adèle told hers and monsieur bardow rapidly filled in certain blanks all the while staunton listened in silence he had opened an atlas and studied it carefully with a cigarette in his mouth whilst monsieur bardow was speaking when he had heard everything we had to say he pushed the atlas back and leaned over the table towards us  you ask me he said slowly to publish this story tomorrow with what object  that the people of this great country monsieur bardow answered quickly should at least have a chance to themselves arrest this horrible disaster let them rise up and insist that before four oclock tomorrow that destroyer leaves devonport with orders to stop our fleet entering kiel harbor let them insist upon a general mobilization of the fleet and the breaking up of this traitorous rifle corps your ministers have failed you it is by favor of the people that they rule let the people speak  the man at the table moved his position ever so slightly his eyes were fixed downwards he seemed to be thinking deeply monsieur bardow continued  my friends here he said have done all that can be done with members of the cabinet not only themselves but in the person of others of great influence the appeal to you is practically an appeal to caesar ministers are great but you are greater it is your hand today which grasps the levers which guide the world  and still the man at the table was silent monsieur bardow had more to say  i will tell you he said what an american newspaper has done for us tomorrow at twelve oclock ten million of dollars is due to be paid to the agents of prince victor of normandy by the credit lyonnais of paris tomorrow morning the new york herald in great type exposes as a gigantic joke the whole affair it will give the names of the american citizens and the titles which their contribution to the royalist cause in france is to secure tomorrow all new york will be convulsed with laughterand i do not think that that ten million dollars will be cabled to the credit lyonnais  the man at the table lifted his head his face was the face of a man who had been in pain  the two cases he said slowly are not identical the new york herald perpetrates a huge joke upon its readers whichever way that affair ends the newspaper has little to lose you ask me on the other hand to risk ruin  i do monsieur bardow answered i came to you i and my friends here because from the first you have shown yourself the uncompromising foe of german diplomacy and aspirations i give you the chance to justify yourself i know what it is that you fear you do not doubt our faithyour only fear is lest we may have been deceived is that not so  staunton assented gravely  you are asking me a great deal he said the daily oracle represents a million of capital it represents the life work of myself and many dear comrades you ask me to stake our prestige our whole future upon your story you ask me to publicly flout the government which we have supported through thick and thin you give me no time to consult my colleaguesi must decide at once yes or no this is no small matter monsieur bardow  it is a tragedy monsieur bardow answered i tell you that the future history of your country perhaps of europe rests upon your decision dont let any smaller issue weigh with you for a moment be thankful that you are the man whose name will live in history as the savior of his country  do not be too sure even of that staunton said polloch is an obstinate man and i know as well as any one perhaps how set the cabinet are upon this german rapprochement stillyou have fastened the burden on my shoulders and i will carry it  thank god monsieur bardow exclaimed leaning over and shaking hands with staunton have no fear my friend it is heavens truth which you will print  i believe it staunton answered quietly several mysterious things have happened during the last few days and late this afternoon consols began to fall in a most extraordinary fashion the sidewinds have blown some curious information to us even this last hour or so now gentlemen and miss van hoyt he continued in a suddenly altered tone i have to send for all my editors and break up the whole paper i shall be here till daybreak and afterwards one condition i have to make with you  name it monsieur bardow declared  you must not leave this building till the paper is out at any moment we may require information from one of you you shall be made as comfortable as possible do you agree  of course we all answered in fact guest remarked i fancy this is the safest place for us for a few hours  staunton looked at us all a little curiously  i suppose he remarked you know the risk you have been running  our friends have reminded us i answered  an attendant came in and staunton handed us over to him  show this lady and these gentlemen into the strangers room he ordered see that they have food and wine and anything they require  we left at once in the passage we passed a little crowd of hurrying journalists on their way to answer stauntons summons in every room the alarm bell had sounded and the makingup of the paper was stopped     chapter xxxix  working the oracle   we had food and wine plenty of it and very excellently served the room in which we were imprisoned was more than comfortableit was luxurious there were couches and easychairs magazines and shaded electric lights yet we could not rest for one moment adèle and i talked for an hour or so and we had plenty to say but in time the fever seized us too the roar of the machinery below thrilled us through and through it was the warning which in a very few hours would electrify the whole country which was being whirled into type i thought of madame and once i laughed  three times guest was sent for to give some information mainly with regard to earlier happenings in berlin before our fateful meeting at the hotel universal at last my turn came it was interesting to visit if only for a moment the room where staunton himself was writing this story  he was sitting at his table his coat off an unlighted cigarette in his mouth an untasted cup of tea by his side two shorthand clerks sat opposite to him a typist was hard at work a few yards away staunton called me over to him his voice was hoarse and raspy and there were drops of sweat upon his forehead  is it true mr courage he said that you are still believed here to be dead  certainly i answered i have not communicated even with my lawyers my substitutes fate was enough to make me careful  does any one know on this side  my cousin sir gilbert hardross he is with us he saw polloch and tried all he could himself  good staunton declared one more question you say that on the committee of the rifle club was a german officer do you know who he was  i do i answered i saw him at the club when i went to meet my cousin his name is count metterheim and he is on the military staff at the embassy here  better and better staunton grunted thats all thank you  i went back to the room where the others were waiting the few people whom i passed looked at me curiously already there were rumors flying about the place in less than five minutes i was summoned again staunton looked up from his writing  the news has come through of the wrecking of the café suisse he said so far your story is substantiated a man and a woman are in custody their names are hirsch  hes a member of the committee i exclaimed i saw him bring in the bag it was madame his wife who distrusted me all the time  do you think he asked that you were followed here  very likely i answered  staunton turned to a tall dark young man who stood by his side  tell mr courage what has happened he said  the secretary looked at me curiously  a man arrived about a quarter of an hour ago who insisted upon seeing mr staunton he hinted that he had an important revelation to make with regard to the café suisse outrage he would not see any one else and tried to force his way into the place in the scuffle a revolver fell out of his pocket loaded in all six chambers  what have you done with him i asked  handed him over to the police the young man answered but i am afraid they would never get him to the station have you looked out of the window  no i answered  he shrugged his shoulders  do so he suggested  i crossed the room and drawing the blind aside carefully looked out the street was packed with people even as i stood there i heard the crash of breaking glass below  what does it mean i asked bewildered  your rifle corps i should think staunton said without ceasing writing we closed the doors just in time they will try to wreck the place  we have telephoned to scotland yard and the horse guards the man who stood by my side said and we have forty policemen inside the place now good god  the sudden roar of an explosion split the air the floor seemed to heave under our feet and the windows fell in with a crash letting in the cold night air we could hear distinctly now the shrieks and groans from below it seemed to me that the roadway was suddenly strewn with the bodies of prostrate men i sprang back into the room we all looked at one another in horror i think that for my part i expected to see the walls close in upon us  a bomb staunton remarked calmly listen  he leaned a little forward in his chair his pen still in his hand his attitude one of strained and nervous attention by degrees the tension in his face relaxed  it goes he muttered good  he bent once more over his work i looked at the man by my side in bewilderment  what does he mean i asked  the engine the machinery is not damaged was the prompt reply  i wiped the sweat from my forehead the silence in the room seemed almost unnatural and behind it we could hear the dull monotonous roar of the machinery still doing its work once more i turned to the window and as i did so i heard the sullen murmur of voices a little way down the street a solid body of mounted police were forcing back the people  i made my way back to the other room almost knocked down in the passage by a man halfdressed tearing along with a bundle of wet proofs in his hand adèle was standing by the wrecked windowframethere were no more windows anywhere in the buildingand she turned to me with a little cry  jim she exclaimed look look  i saw the line of fire and the policemens saddles emptying fast the people were closing round the building guest stood frowning by our side  this is what comes he said of making london the asylum for all the foreign scum of the earth how goes it courage  staunton is still writing and the machinery is untouched  for how long i wonder he muttered the police are going over like ninepins  i looked below longingly for my blood was up it was no ordinary mob this they were beginning to fire in volleys now and leaders were springing up as far as we could see there was a panorama of white faces it was easy to understand what had happened we had been followed and our purpose guessed tomorrows edition of the daily oracle was never meant to appear  the place will be at their mercy in another few minutes guest said gloomily twentyfour hours ago who would have dared to predict a riot like this in london of all places not all the police in scotland yard would be of any avail against this mob  they may stop the paper i said but stauntons wordand these eventsshould go for something with polloch  guest looked at me and away out of the window adèle was behind us and out of hearing  do you suppose he said in a low tone that staunton or any of us are meant to leave this place alive i am afraid our friends below know too well what they are doing  the door opened and staunton himself appeared he looked years older than the strong debonair man to whom i had told my story a few hours ago but in his face was none of the despair which i had feared he was pale and his eyes were shining with suppressed excitement but he had by no means the air of a beaten man he came over to where we were standing  it is finished he said calmly i read your story in print  magnificent i murmured but look do you think that a single copy will ever leave this place  he stood looking downwards with darkening face for several moments he was silent  look at them he muttered at last the tocsin has sounded and the rats have come out of their holes half a million and more of scum eating their way into the entrails of this great city of ours for years we have tried to make the government see the danger of it it is our cursed british arrogance which has shut the ears and closed the eyes of the men who govern our destinies supposing your invasion should take place who is going to keep them in check the sack of london would be well on its way before ever a german soldier set foot upon our coast  the question for the moment i remarked seems to be how long before the sack of this place takes place look the police are falling back the mob are closing in the street  staunton was unmoved  the soldiers are on their way he answered we received a message just now by the private wire the other has been cut look my god theyve brought the guns there are some men at headquarters who are not fools  we pressed close to the windows and indeed it was a wonderful sight from the far end of the street where the police had retreated men were flying in all directions we caught a gleam of scarlet and a vision of grey horses there was no parley the dead bodies of the police in all directions and the crack of the rifles were sufficient we saw the gleam of fire and we heard the most terrible of all soundsthe quick spitspit of the maxims i drew adèle away from the window  dont look dear i said for already the ranks of the mob were riven we saw the upflung hands we heard their death cries leaders leaped up shouting orders only to go down like ninepins as the line of fire reached them there was no hope for them or any salvation save flight before our eyes we saw that great concourse melt away like snow before the midday sun staunton drew a great breath of relief  in half an hour he said turning abruptly to adèle i will present you with a copy of the daily oracle     chapter xl  the oracle speaks   the issue of the daily oracle which appeared on the following or rather the same morning electrified europe nothing like it had been known in the memory of man for one halfpenny the city clerk the millionaire and the politician were alike treated to a sensation which since the days of caxton has known no parallel the whole of the front page of the paper was devoted to a leading article printed in large type and these questions were the text of what followed  1 do the government know that within eighty miles of kiel are one hundred and eighty thousand troops with guns and all the munitions of war assembled there for the purpose of an immediate invasion of england assembled partly in secrecy and partly under the ridiculous pretexts of manoeuvres  2 do the government know that it is a skeleton fleet the weedings of the german navy which awaits our squadron in kiel waters and that the remainder of the german fleet at its full strength and ready for action is lying in hiding close at hand  3 that there exists in london under the peaceful guise of a trade union an army of nearly 200000 germans who have passed their training and that a complete scheme exists for arming and officering same at practically a moments notice  4 that a german army is even now massed upon the french frontier prepared to support the claims to the throne of france of prince victor of normandy and that a conspiracy has been discovered within the last fortyeight hours amongst the french army to suffer an invasion of their country on this pretext  5 that an american paper is today publishing the names of some of her richest citizens who are finding the money for french royalist agents to buy over the wavering officers of the army of our ally the army of the french republic  there is ignorance which is folly the article went on and ignorance which is sin the government have proved themselves guilty of the first if they show themselves guilty also of the second the people of this country have the right to hurl from their places the fools who have brought them to the brink of disaster and to save themselves in their name we demand two things  the dispatch of a gunboat with orders to the channel squadron to at once return to their waters  the mobilization of our mediterranean fleet  with this text staunton had written his article and he had written it with a pen of fire every word burned its way home with the daring of those few hours of inspiration he had turned inference into fact he had written as a man who sees face to face the things of which he writes there could be but one result at ten oclock a cabinet council was called and staunton was telephoned for before midday everything that he had suggested was done  even then we knew that the question of peace or war must be trembling in the balance  let it come if it will guest declared from his easychair in gilberts study the great plot is smashed i pledge you my word that tomorrow the german newspapers will hold us up to scorn will seek to make of us the laughingstock of the world they will explain everything there will be no war a german invasion of england is only possible by intrigues which will keep france apart and treachery which will render our fleet ineffective this plot has taken five years to develop and i have been on its track from the first thank god i can call myself square now with the past   there was no war but the laughter of the german newspapers was a little hysterical the press of the world took the matter more seriously but there was no war and there are people even today mostly his journalistic enemies who say that staunton was hoaxed                                       do we receive our deserts in this world some one asked one night when our dinner table at saxby was like a suggestion of old timesand we all paused to think  staunton has a peerage adèle remarked  luckier than i guest laughed only he called himself guest no longer but lord leslie wendover my past disgrace had to be wiped out by an invitation to windsor and a ribbon such are the ways of diplomacy which never dare own a mistake  the amazing denseness of the man his wife murmured do i count for nothing  he bent and touched her hand with his lips as adèle leaned forward and laughed at me across the table  i think she said that you both deservewhat you gotus
