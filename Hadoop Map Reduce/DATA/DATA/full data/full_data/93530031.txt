that he had not finished the fortyninth chapter and the fragmentary portion of that chapter stands now just as he left it he left no materials from which the tale could be completed and no attempt at completion will be made at the end of the third volume i have stated what were his intentions with regard to certain people in the story but beyond what is there said i know nothing  henry m trollope     the landleaguers   chapter i  mr jones of castle morony   in the year 1850 the two estates of ballintubber and morony were sold to mr philip jones under the estates court which had then been established they had been the property of two different owners but lay conveniently so as to make one possession for one proprietor they were in the county galway and lay to the right and left of the road which runs down from the little town of headford to lough corrib at the time when the purchase was made there was no quieter spot in all ireland or one in which the lawful requirements of a landlord were more readily performed by a poor and obedient tenantry the people were all roman catholics were for the most part uneducated and it may be said of them that not only were their souls not their own but that they were not ambitious even of possessing their own bodies circumstances have changed much with them since that date not only have they in part repudiated the power of the priest as to their souls but in compliance with teaching which has come to them from america they claim to be masters also of their bodies never were a people less fitted to exercise such dominion without control generous kindly impulsive and docile they have been willing to follow any recognised leader when philip jones bought the property that had belonged to the widow odwyerfor ballintubber had for the last hundred years been the property of the odwyersand morony which had been an outlying townland belonging to the hacketts for the last two centuries he had at first been looked down upon as a new comer but all that had passed by and mr jones was as much respected as though he had been an ojones from the time of queen elizabeth but now the american teaching had come up and things were different  mr jones had expended over £30000 in purchasing the property and was congratulated by all men on having done well with his money there were some among his friends in englandand his friends were all englishwho had told him that he was incurring a great risk in going into so distant and wild a country but it was acknowledged that he could not in england have obtained so good a return in the way of rent and it was soon found that the opportunities for improving the property were many and close at hand at the end of ten years all men who knew mr jones personally or had seen the increasing comforts of morony castle declared that as he liked the kind of life he had done uncommonly well for himself  nor had he done badly for his three married sisters each of whom had left £4000 in his hands all the circumstances of the miss joness as they had been it will be here unnecessary to explain since philip had become owner of morony castle each of them had married and the three brothersinlaw were equally well satisfied with the investment of their money it will however thus be understood that the property did not belong entirely to mr jones and that the brothersinlaw and their wives were part owners mr jones however had been in possession of some other means and had been able to use capital in improving the estate but he was an aspiring man and in addition to his money had borrowed something beyond the sum borrowed however had been so small and so well expended as to have created no sense of embarrassment in his mind  when our story commences he was the father of four children the elder and the younger were boys and two girls came between them in 1880 frank the elder was twoandtwenty the two girls who followed close after were twenty and nineteen and the youngest boy who was born after an interval of nearly ten years was but ten years old some years after the mother had died and mr jones had since lived as a widower it may be as well to state here that in 1880 he was fiftyfive years old  when his wife had died the nature of the man had apparently been changed of all men he had been the most cheerful the most eager and the most easily pleased he had worked hard at his property and had loved his work he knew every man and woman about the place and always had a word to say to them he had had a sailing boat on the lake in which he had spent much of his time but his wife had always been with him since her death he had hardly put his foot within the boat he had lately become quick and shorttempered but always with a visible attempt to be kind to those around him but people said of him that since his wife had died he had shown an indifference to the affairs of the world he was anxiousso it was saidto leave matters as much as possible to his son but as has been already stated his son was only twentytwo he had formerly taken a great pleasure in attending the assizes at galway he had been named as a grand juror for the county which he had indeed regarded as a great compliment but since his wifes death he had not once attended  people said of him that he had become indifferent to the work of his life but in this they hardly spoke the truth he had become indifferent rather to what had been its pleasures to that which his conscience told him was its work he applied himself with assiduity enough there were two cares which sat near his heart first that no one should rob him and secondly that he should rob no one it will often be the case that the first will look after itself whereas the second will require careful watching it was certainly the case with philip jones that he was most anxious to rob no one he was perhaps a little too anxious that no one should rob him  a few words must be said of his children frank the eldest was a goodlooking clever boy who had been educated at the queens college at galway and would have been better trained to meet the world had circumstances enabled him to be sent to a public school in england as it was he thought himself as heir to morony castle to be a little god upon earth and he thought also that it behoved his sisters and his brother and the various dependents about the place to treat him as though he were a god to his father he was respectful and fairly obedient in all matters save one as to that one matter from which arose some trouble much will have to be said as the story goes on  the two girls were named ada and edith and were in form and figure very unlike each other ada the eldest was tall fairhaired and very lovely it was admitted in county galway that among the galway lasses no girl exceeded ada jones in brightness of beauty she was sweettempered also and gracious as she was lovely but edith did not share the gifts which the fairy had bestowed upon her sister in equal parts she was however clever and kind and affectionate in all matters within the house she was ready to accept a situation below her sisters but this was not by her sisters doing the demigod of the family seemed to assume this position but on adas part there was no assumption edith however felt her infirmity among girls this is made to depend more on physical beauty than on other gifts and there was no doubt that in this respect edith was the inferior she was dark and small of stature not ungraceful in her movements or awkward in her person she was blackhaired as had been her mothers and almost swarthy in her complexion and there was a squareness about her chin which robbed her face of much of its feminine softness but her eyes were very bright and when she would laugh or say something intended to make another laugh her face would be brightened up with fun goodhumour or wit in a manner which enabled no one to call her plain  of the younger boy florian much will be said as the story goes on but what can be said of a boy who is only ten which shall be descriptive and also interesting he was small of his age but clever and sharp and since his mothers death had been his fathers darling he was beautiful to look at as were all the children except poor edith but the neighbours declared that his education had been much neglected his father intended to send him to college at galway a bright vision had for a short time flitted before the fathers eyes and he had thought that he would have the boy prepared for winchester but lately things had not gone quite so well at morony castle and that idea had passed by so that it was now understood that florian jones would follow his brother to galway college those who used to watch his ways would declare that the professors of galway college would have some trouble with him  while the mother had lived no family had been more easily ruled than that of the joness but since her death some irregularities had gone on the father had made a favourite of the younger boy and thereby had done mischief the eldest son too had become proud of his position and an attempt had been made to check him with a hard hand and yet much in the absolute working of the farm had been left to him then troubles had come in which mr jones would be sometimes too severe and sometimes too lenient of the girls it must be acknowledged that they were to be blamed for no fault after the first blow had come everyone at morony had felt that the great blow had been the death of the mistress but it must be confessed that other things had happened shortly afterwards which had tended to create disturbance one of the family had declared that he intended to become a roman catholic the joness had been protestants the father and mother having both come from england as protestants they were not therefore ultraprotestants as those will know who best know ireland there had been no horror of a catholic according to mrs jones the way to heaven had been open to both catholic and protestant only it had suited her to say her prayers after the protestant fashion the girls had been filled with no pious fury and as to mr jones himself some of the protestant devotees in the neighbourhood of tuam had declared that he was only halfhearted in the matter an old clergyman attached to the cathedral and who had been chaplain to bishop plunket had been heard to declare that he would rather have to deal with an avowed papist  but the one who had now declared himself as a converti will say pervert if my readers wish itwas no other than our young friend florian he came in one day and assured his sisters that he meant to be a roman catholic they only laughed at him and told him that he did not know what he was talking about dont i though said florian ive had no end of an argument with father malachi and hes got the best o me im not going to church any more when his brother frank was told he threatened to lick the young sinner thats about the best can be said for you protestants said the young imp you lick us when youre strong enough but the father when he heard the tidings declared that he would not have his son molested no doubt he would live to see his mistake it was to be hoped that he would do so but there should be no compulsion so master florian remained for the present attached to his catholic propensities and duly went to mass at ballintubber this had taken place in the autumn of the year  there had occurred a circumstance which may be called the beginning of our story it must first be told that mr jones kept about four hundred acres of the estate in his own hands and had been held to have done very well with it a tract of this land lay down on lough corrib and had in former days produced almost nothing but rushes by means of drains and sluices which had not been brought into use without the expenditure of much capital he had thoroughly fertilised some eighty acres where he grew large crops of hay which he sent across the lake to galway and fed his sheep on the aftergrass with great profit but the care of the sluices had been a great labour and latterly a great trouble to mr jones he had looked for no evil at the hands of his workmen or tenants or neighbours but he had been taught by experience to expect great carelessness it was when the rain had fallen in heavy quantities and when the lough was full that the evil was chiefly expected late in the autumn there came news up to the castle that the flood gates on the ballintubber marshes had now been opened and that the entire eighty acres were under water mr jones and his eldest son rushed down and found that it was impossible to do anything they could only wait till the waters had retreated which would not take place for six months the entire crop for the next year had been destroyed then mr jones returned to the castle stricken by a great blow and was speechless for the rest of the day  when the news had been brought the family had been together at the breakfast table the father and son had gone out together with the teller of the story but ada and edith and florian were left at the table they all sat looking at each other till edith was the first to speak  flory what do you know of all this  what should i know said flory the two sisters looked at him and each was aware that he did know something ada was not so quick as edith but even she was aroused and from this moment edith began to take the lead in managing her brother  you do said ada how was it done who did itand why  sorrow a know i know said the boy  flory that is a lie said edith very solemnly looking at him with all her eyes  youve no right to say that said florian its just because ive turned catholic and its all your spite but the boy blushed ruby red and the colour told its own story  as soon as the news had been announced edith had seen the boys countenance and had instantly watched him his colour had not risen at once but his lower jaw had fallen and his eyes had glanced furtively round and his whole frame had quivered then the rush of blood had flown to his face and the story had been told so that edith could read it his first emotion had made it plain even to ada flory you know all about it said ada  edith got up and went across the room and knelt down at the boys side leaning against his chair and looking up into his face flory you may lie with your voice but you cannot stifle your heart within you you have confessed the truth  i have not said flory i wasnt in it at all  who says that you were in it but you know  deed and i know nothin now the boy began to cry you have no right to say i did it why should i do the likes of that  where were you at four oclock yesterday afternoon asked edith  i was just out up at the lodge yonder  flory i know that you have seen this thing done i am as certain of it as though i had been there myself  i havent seen anything doneand i wont stay here to be questioned this way said the boy feeling that his blushes would betray him and his incapacity to lie square as the americans say  then the two sisters were left to talk over the matter together did you not see it in his face said edith  yes i saw something but you dont mean to say that he knew it was to be done that would make him a fiend  no i dont think he knew it was to be done but when frank was teasing him the other day about his catholic nonsense and saying that he would not trust a papist florian took the part of pat carroll if there be a man about the place who would do a base turn to father its pat carroll now i know that flory was down near the lough yesterday afternoon biddy ryan saw him if he went on he must have seen the water coming in  what shall we do asked ada  ahthats just it what shall we do if he could be made to tell the truth that would be best but as he denies it father will believe him florian will say that we are spiting him because of his religion  but edith we must tell father at last it was decided that edith should take the boy and talk to him he was more prone to listen to edith than to ada edith did find her brother and talked to him for an hourbut in vain he had managed to collect himself after his past breakdown and was better able to bear the examination to which his sister put him than at the first moment he still blushed when he was questioned till he became dogged and surly the interview ended with repeated asseverations on florys part that he knew nothing of the meadows  mr jones and his eldest son returned to the house having been absent the entire day as sure as i am a living man pat carroll has been at the doing of it said frank  he cannot have done it alone said ada  there have been others in it  that has been the worst of it said the father of course i have known since the beginning of the year that that man would do any devils turn of work against me but one man cannot do much  too much too much said edith  one man can murder me of course but we havent yet come to such a state of things as that twelve months ago i thought there was not a man about the place who would raise his hand to do me an ill turn i have done them many good turns in my time  you have father said ada  then this man came to me and said that because the tenants away in county mayo were not paying their rents he could not pay his and he can sell his interest on his holding now for £150 when i endeavoured to explain this to him and that it was at my cost his interest in the farm has been created he became my enemy i dont mind that one has to look for that but that others should be joined in it and that there should be no one to say that they had seen it there must have been five pairs of hands at work and twenty pairs of eyes must have seen what the others were doing  the two sisters looked at each other but they said nothing i suppose we shall work it out of them some day said frank  i suppose nothing of the kind said the father there are eighty acres of meadow lying under lough corrib this moment which will not give a ton of hay next summer or food for a sheep next autumn the pastures will be saturated and sheep would perish with footrot and fluke then money must be laid out again upon it just that mr carroll may again wreak his vengeance after that there was silence for the children felt that not a word could be spoken which would comfort their father  when they sat down to dinner mr jones asked after florian hes not well said edith  florian not well so theres another misfortune  his illhealth is rather illhumour biddy will take care of him father  i do not choose that he should be looked after by biddy in solitude i suppose that somebody has been teasing him  no father said edith positively  has anyone been speaking to him about his religion  not a word said edith then she told herself that to hold her tongue at the present moment would be cowardly florian father has misbehaved himself and has gone away cross i would leave him if i were you till tomorrow  i know there is illwill against him said the father all this was illjudged on behalf of mr jones peter the old butler who had lived in the family was in the room peter of course was a roman catholic and though he was as true as steel it could not but be felt that in this absurd contest he was on the side of the young masther  down in the kitchen the conversion of the young masther to the true religion was a great affair and mr frank and the young ladies were looked upon as hardhearted and cruel because they stood in the way of this act of grace nothing more was said about florian that night     chapter ii  the man in the mask   edith before she went to bed that night crept up to her brothers bedroom and seated herself on the bedside it was a little room which florian occupied alone and lay at the back of the house next to that in which peter slept here as she sat on the bed she could see by a glance that young florian feigned to be asleep  flory you are pretending to be asleep flory uttered a short snoreor rather snort for he was not a good actor you may as well wake up because otherwise i shall shake you  why am i to be shaked up in bed  because i want to speak to you  why am i to be made to speak when i want to sleep  papa has been talking about you downstairs he has come home from ballintubber very tired and very unhappy and he thinks you have been made to go to bed without your supper because we have been attacking you about religion i have told him that nobody has said a word to you  but you did  not a word  you didnt tell him all that you told meabout letting in the water this was asked in a tone of great anxiety  not a wordnot as yet  and you wont mind i tell you its all untrue what do i know about letting in the water  who did it  im not going to tell  you know then  no i dont but im not going to tell as though i knew it you dont care about it in your religion but we catholics dont like telling lies  you saw nothing  whatever i saw im not to tell a lie about it  youve promised not you mean  now edy youre not going to trap me youve got your own religion and ive got mine its a great thing in our religion to be able to hold your tongue father malachi says its one of the greatest trials which a man has to go through  then flory am i to gather that you will say nothing further to me here the boy shook his head because in that case i must tell father at any rate he must be told and if you do not tell him i shall  what is there to be told  i shall tell him exactly what i sawand ada i sawwe sawthat when the news came about the flood you were conscious of it all if you will go to father and tell him the truth he will be but very little angry with you i dont suppose you had a hand in it yourself  no shouted the boy  but i think you saw it and that they made you swear an oath was that not so  no whispered the boy  i am sure it was so then the boy again plucked up his courage and declared with a loud voice that it was not so  that night before she retired to rest edith went to her father and told him all that she had to say she took ada with her and together they used all their eloquence to make their father believe as they believed  no said edith he has not confessed but words drop from him which make us sure that he knows who did it i am certain that he saw it done i dont mean to say that he saw the whole thing the water i suppose was coming in all night  the whole night while we were sleeping in our beds the waters of the lough were ruining me said the father  but he saw enough to be able to tell you who did it  i know who did it it was that ruffian carroll  but father you will want evidence  am i to bring up my own boy to swear that he was there witnessing what was done as the friend of my enemies i do not believe that he was there at all  if you question him he will probably own to it it will be better to get at the truth and face it he is only ten years old you must tell me the story of his pretended conversion  why should it be pretended asked the father  well of his conversion said edith  i dont see what it has to do with it am i to put myself forward as a bigoted protestant florian has been foolish but am i to say that i am angry where i am not angrynot specially angry  it will show the influence under which he has taken up carrolls side said edith  or the influence under which he has been made to hold his tongue said ada  just so said edith we do not think that he has made one with your enemies in the matter but he has seen them at work and has been made to promise that he will hold his tongue i dont suppose you mean to let the affair slip by without punishing any one  when the girls left him mr jones was by no means persuaded as far as he could ascertain from examination of the persons about the locality there was no one willing to state in evidence that he had seen anything the injury had been done in november on a wet dreary dull afternoon he did learn that at halfpast three the meadows were in their usual condition as to the sluices the gates of which had been pulled out and thrown away in twenty different places he could learn nothing no one had seen a sluice gate touched as to florian and what florian had been seen to do he had asked no question because florians name had not then been mentioned but he had been struck by the awful silence of the people there were women there living on the spot with whose families his family had been on the most kindly terms when rheumatism was rifeand rheumatism down on the lough side had often been rifethey had all come up to the castle for port wine and solace he had refused them nothinghe or his dear wife who had gone or his daughters and to give them their due they had always been willing to work for him at a moments notice he would have declared that no man in ireland was on better terms with his tenantry than he and now because there had been a quarrel between him and that pestilent fellow carrollwhom he had been willing to buy out from his bit of land and let him go to america so that they might all be at peacecould they all have turned against him and taken carrolls part as far as he had been able to gather the feelings of the people from conversations with them they had all acknowledged carroll to be wrong he would have said that there was not one among them who was not his friend rather than carrolls he was aware that there had been illfeeling about in other parts of the country there had beenso he was tolda few demagogues in galway town american chiefly who had come thither to do what harm they could and he had heard that there was discontent in parts of mayo about ballyhaunis and lough glinn but where he lived round lough corrib there had been no evil symptoms of such a nature now suddenly he found himself as though surrounded by a nest of hornets there were eighty acres of his land under water and no one would tell him how it was done or by whom  and now to make the matter worse there had come upon him this trouble with reference to his own boy he would not believe the story which his daughters had told him and yet he knew within his heart that they were infinitely the better worthy of credit he believed in them he knew them to be good and honest and zealous on his behalf but how much better did he love poor florian and in this matter of the childs change of religion in which he had foolishly taken the childs part he could not but think that father malachi had been most unkind to him not that he knew what father malachi had done in the matter but florian talked as though he had been supported all through by the priest father malachi had in truth done very little he had told the boy to go to his father the boy had said that he had done so and that his father had assented but frank and the girls are totally against it they have no sense of religion at all then father malachi had told him to say his prayers and come regularly to mass  mr jones agreed with his daughters that it behoved him to punish the culprit in this matter but nevertheless he thought that it would be better for him to let it go unpunished than to bring his boy into collision with such a one as pat carroll he twice talked the matter over with florian and twice did so to no effect at first he threatened the young sinner and frowned at him but his frowns did no good florian if he could stand firm against his sister edith was sure that he could do so against his father then mr jones spoke him fair and endeavoured to explain to him how sad a thing it would be if his boy were to turn against his own father and the interests of the family generally  but i havent said florian confidently  you should tell me what you saw on that afternoon  i didnt see anything said florian sulkily  i dont believe he knew anything about it said mr jones to edith afterwards edith could only receive this in silence and keep her own opinion to herself ada was altogether of her mind but frank at last came round to his fathers view it isnt probable he said to his sisters that a boy of his age should be able to keep such a secret against four of us and then it is most improbable that he should have seen anything of the occurrence and not have come at once to his father but the girls held to their own opinion till at last they were told by frank that they were two pigheaded nincompoops  things were going on in this way and mr jones was still striving to find out evidence by which a case might be substantiated against pat carroll when that gentleman one winter afternoon was using his eloquence upon master florian jones it was four oclock and the darkness of the night was now coming on very quickly the scene was a cottage almost in the town of headford and about two miles from the nearest part of the morony estate in this cottage carroll was sitting at one side of a turf fire while an old woman was standing by the doorway making a stocking and in this cottage also was another man whose face was concealed by an old crape mask which covered his eyes and nose and mouth he was standing on the other side of the fireplace and florian was seated on a stool in front of the fire ever and anon he turned his gaze round on the mysterious man in the mask whom he did not at all know and in truth he was frightened awfully through the whole interview by the man in the mask who stood there by the fireside almost close to florians elbow without speaking a word nor did the old woman say much though it must be presumed that she heard all that was said  faix mr flory an its well for you youve come said carroll jist you sit steady there cause it wont do the laist good in life youre moving about where all the worldd see you it was thus that the boy was addressed by him whom we may now call his coconspirator and carroll showed plainly by his movements and by the glances which he cast around him that he understood perfectly the dreadful nature of the business in which he was engaged you see that jintlman there and carroll pointed to the man in the mask  i see him said poor florian almost in tears  youd better mark him thats all if he cotches a hould oye hed tear ye to tatthers thats all not that hed do ye the laist harum in life if yed just hould yer pace and say nothin to nobody  not a word ill say pat  dont thats all about it dont we knowshe knowswhat theyre driving at down at the castle sorra a word comes out of the mouth o one on em but that he knows it here the man in the mask shook his head and looked as horrible as a man in a mask can look theyll tell ye that the father who owns ye ought to know all about it its just him as shouldnt know  he dont said florian  not a knowan if you main to keep yourself from being holed as they holed muster bingham the other day away at hollymount the boy understood perfectly well what was meant by the process of holing the mr bingham a small landlord who had been acting as his own agent some twenty miles off in the county of mayo had been frightfully murdered three months since it was the first murder that had stained the quarrel which had now commenced in that part of the country mr bingham had been unpopular but he had had to deal with such a small property that no one had imagined that an attack would be made on him but he had been shot down as he was driving home from hollymount whither he had gone to receive rent he had been shot down during daylight and no one had as yet been brought to justice for the murder you minds muster bingham muster flory eh hes gone and sorra a soul knows anything about it its id be sorry to think youd be polished off that way again the man in the mask made signs that he was wide awake  to tell the truth of florian he felt rather complimented in the midst of all his horrors in being thus threatened with the fate of mr bingham he had heard much about mr bingham and regarded him as a person of much importance since his death he was raised to a level now with mr bingham and then his immediate position was very much better than binghams he was alive and up to the present momentas long as he held his tongue and told nothinghe would be regarded with friendly eyes by that terrible man in the mask but through it all there was the agonising feeling that he was betraying them all at home his father and edith and frank would not murder him when they found him out but they would despise him and the boy knew somethinghe knew much of what was due by him to his father at this moment he was much in dread of pat carroll he was in greater dread of the man in the mask but as he sat there terrified by them as they intended to terrify him he was aware of all that courage would demand from him if he could once escape from that horrid cabin he thought that he might be able to make a clean breast and tell everything its i thatd be awful sorry that anything like what happened bingham should happen to you muster flory  why wouldnt you and id have done nothing against you said florian he did feel that his conduct up to the present moment deserved more of gratitude than of threats from pat carroll  youre to remimber your oath muster flory youre become one of us as father brosnan was telling you youre not to be one of us and then go over among them schaming prothestants  i havent gone over among themonly my father is one of them  whats yer father to do with it now youre a catholic av you is ever false to a catholic on behalf of them prothestants though hes twice yer own father youd go t hell for it thats where youd be going and its not only that but the jintlman as is there will be sending you on the journey then pat signified that he alluded to the man in the mask and the gentleman in the mask clenched his fist and shook itand shook his head also you ask father brosnan also whether you aint to be thrue to us catholics now youre one of us its a great favour as has been done you youre mindful o thataint you poor flory said that he was mindful  here they were joined by another conspirator a man whom florian had seen down by the sluices with pat carroll and whom he thought he remembered to have noticed among the tenants from the other side of ballintubber whats the chap up to now asked the stranger  he aint up to nothin said carroll were only a cautioning of him  not to be splitting on yourself  nor yet on you said carroll  sorra a word he can say agin me said the stranger i wasnt in it at all  but you was said florian i saw you pick the latch up and throw it away  youve sharp eyes aint you to be seeing what warnt there to be seen at all if you say you saw me in it ill have the tongue out of your mouth you young liar  whats the good of frightening the boy michael hes a good boy and isnt a going to peach upon any of us  but i aint a liar hes a liar this florian said plucking up renewed courage from the kind words pat carroll had said in his favour  never mind said pat throwing oil on the troubled waters were all frinds at present and shall be as long as we dont split on nobody  its the meanest thing outthat splitting on a pal said the man who had been called michael its twice worse when one does it to ones father i wouldnt show a haporth of mercy to such a chap as that  and to a catholic as peached to a prothestant said carroll intending to signify his hatred of such a wretch by spitting on the ground  or to a son as split because his father was in question then michael spat twice upon the floor showing the extremity of the disgust which in such a case would overpower him  i suppose i may go now said florian he was told by pat carroll that he might go but just at that moment the man in the mask who had not spoken a word extemporised a cross out of two bits of burned wood from the hearth and put it right before florians nose one hand held one stick and the other the other swear said the man in the mask  bedad hes in the right of it another oath will make it all the stronger that yell never say a word of this to mortial ears whether father or sister or brother let em say what they will to yer shelp yer the blessed virgin  i wont then said florian struggling to get at the cross to kiss it  stop a moment me fine fellow said michael nor yet to no one elseand youll give yourself up to hell flames av you dont keep the blessed oath to the last day of your life now let him kiss it pat i wouldnt be in his shoes for a tenpun note if he breaks that oath  nor i neither said pat oh laws no then florian was allowed to escape from the cabin this he did and going out into the dark and looking about him to see that he was not watched made his way in at the back door of a fairly large house which stood near still in the outskirts of the town of headford it was a fairly large house in headford but headford does not contain many large houses it was that in which lived father giles the old parish priest of tuamand with father giles lived his curate that father brosnan of whom mention has above been made     chapter iii  father brosnan   there has come a change among the priests in ireland during the last fifty years as has been natural among whom has there not come a change in half a century in england statesmen are different and parsons and judges and peers when an entire country has been left unmoved by the outside world so as to seem to have been left asleep while others have been awake the different classes will seem to be the same at the end of every half century a village lawyer in spain will be as was a village lawyer fifty years ago but a parish priest in ireland will be an altered personage because the country generally has not been sleeping  there used to be two distinct sorts of priests of whom the elder who had probably been abroad was the better educated whereas the younger who was homenurtured had less to say for himself on general topics he was generally the more zealous in his religious duties but the elder was the better read in doctrinal theology as to the political question of the day they were both apt to be on the list against the government though not so with such violence as to make themselves often obnoxious to the laws it was natural that they should be opposed to the government as long as the protestant church claimed an ascendency over them but their feelings and aspirations were based then on their religious opinions now a set of men has risen up with whom opposition to the rulers of the country is connected chiefly with political ideas a dream of home rule has made them what they are and thus they have been roused into waking life by the american spirit which has been imported into the country there is still the old difference between the elder and the younger priests the parish priest is not so frequently opposed to the law as is his curate the parish priest is willing that the landlord shall receive his rents is not at least anxious that he shall be dispossessed of his land but the curate has ideas of peasant proprietors is very hot for home rule is less obedient to the authority of the bishops than he was of yore and thinks more of the political and less of the religious state of his country  this variance of feeling might be seen in the three priests who have been already mentioned in our story father giles was the parish pastor of headford in which position he had been for nearly forty years he was a man seventy years of age in full possession of all his faculties very zealous in the wellbeing of his people prone to teach them that if they would say their prayers and do as they were bid by their betters they would in the long run and after various phases of catholic well or illbeing go to heaven but they would also have enough to eat in this world which seemed to be almost more prominent in father giless teaching than the happy bliss of heaven but the older father giles became the more he thought of the good things of this world on behalf of his people and the less he liked being troubled with the political desires of his curate he had gone so far as to forbid father brosnan to do this or to do that on various occasions to make a political speech here or to attend a demonstration therein doing which or in not doing it the curate sometimes obeyed but sometimes disobeyed the priest thereby bringing father giles in his old age into infinite trouble  but father malachi in the neighbouring parish of ballintubber ran a course somewhat intermediate between these two he at the present moment had no curate who interfered with his happiness there was indeed a curate of ballintubberso named but he lived away not inhabiting the same house with father malachi as is usual in ireland having a chapel to himself and seldom making his way into our part of the country father malachi was a strongminded man who knew the world he too had an inclination for home rule and still entertained a jealousy against the quasiascendency of a protestant bishop but he had no sympathy whatever with father brosnan ireland for the irish might be very well but he did not at all want to have ireland for the americans father giles and father malachi certainly agreed on one thingthat brosnan was a great trouble  if the conversion of florian jones was to be attributed to any clerical influence father brosnan was entitled to claim the good or the evil done but in truth very few polemical arguments had been used on the occasion the boys head had been filled with the idea of doing something remarkable and he had himself gone to the priest when a protestant child does go to a priest on such a mission what can the priest do but accept him he is bound to look upon the suppliant as a brand to be saved from the burning you stupid young ass the priest may say to himself apostrophising the boy why dont you remain as you are for the present why do you come to trouble me with a matter you can know nothing about but the priest must do as his church directs him and the brands have to be saved from the burning father brosnan sent the boy to father malachi and father malachi told the lad to go to his terrestrial father it was this that mr jones had expected and there the boy was received as a catholic  but to father brosnan the matter was much more important in its political view father brosnan knew the application as to his rent which had been made by pat carroll to his landlord he was of opinion that no rent ought to be paid by any irish tenant to any landlordno rent at least to a protestant landlord wrath boiled within his bosom when he heard of the answer which was given as though mr jones had robbed the man by his refusal mr brosnan thought that for the present a tenant was as a matter of course entitled to abatement in his rent as in a short time he must be entitled to his land without paying any he considered not at all the circumstances whether as had been the case on certain properties in mayo all money expended had been so expended by the tenant or by the landlord as had been the case with pat carrolls land that was an injustice according to mr brosnans theory as is all property in accordance with the teaching of some political doctors who are not burdened with any  it would have been unfair to mr brosnan to say that he sympathised with murderers or that he agreed with those who considered that midnight outrages were fair atonements he demanded rights he himself would have been hot with righteous indignation had such a charge been made against him but in the quarrel which was now beginning all his sympathies were with the carrolls at large and not with the joness at large at every victory won by the british parliament his heart again boiled with indignation at every triumphant note that came over the water from americawhich was generally raised by the record of the dollars senthe boiled on the other hand with joy he had gleams in his mind of a republic he thought of a saxon as an evil being the queen he would say was very well but she was better at a distance the lordlieutenant was a british vanity and english pomp but the chief secretary was a minister of the evil one himself he believed that england was enriched by many millions a year robbed from ireland and that ireland was impoverished to the same extent he was a man thoroughly disloyal and at the same time thoroughly ignorant altogether in the dark as to the truth of things a man who whatever might be his fitness for the duties of the priesthood to which he had been educated had no capability of perceiving political facts and no honesty in teaching them but it would have been unjust to him to say that he was a murderer or that he countenanced murder to him it was that young florian now betook himself and found him seated alone in the back parlour in father giless house the old priest was out and father brosnan was engaged on some portion of clerical duties to give him his due he performed those duties rigidly and the more rigidly when in doing them he obeyed the letter of the law rather than the spirit as father giles in his idea of his duties took altogether the other side of the question and in thinking of the spirit had nearly altogether ignored the letter it may be imagined that the two men did not agree together very well in truth father giles looked upon father brosnan as an ignorant impertinent puppy whereas father brosnan returned the compliment by regarding father giles as half an infidel and almost as bad as a protestant  well master florian said the priest and how are things going with you  oh father brosnan im in terrible throuble  what throubles up now  theyre all agin me at home and fathers nearly as bad as any of them its all along of my religion  i thought your father had given his consent  so he has but still hes agin me and my two sisters are dead agin me what am i to do about pat carroll  just hould your tongue  they do be saying that because what pat and the other boys did was agin fathers interest i am bound to tell  youve given a promise  i did give a promise  and you swore an oath said the priest solemnly  i did swear an oath certainly  then you must hould your tongue in such a case as this i cannot absolve you from your word i dont know what it is that pat carroll did here it must be admitted father brosnan did not stick to the absolute truth he did know what pat carroll had done all headford knew that mr joness meadows had been flooded and the priest must have known that the present cause of trouble at castle morony was the injury thus done father brosnan knew and approved of pat carrolls enmity to the jones family but he was able to justify the falsehood of his own heart by stumbling over the degree of knowledge necessary there was a sense in which he did not know it he need not have sworn to it in a court of law so he told himself and so justified his conscience you need not tell me he went on to say when the boy was proceeding to whisper the story i am not bound to know what it is that pat carroll does and what it is that your father suffers do you go home and keep your toe in your pump as they say and come to me for confession a day or two before christmas and if any of them say anything to you about your religion just sit quiet and bear it  the boy was then dismissed and went home to his fathers home indifferent as to who might see him now because he had come from the priests house but the terror of that man in the mask still clung to him and mingled with that was the righteous fear which still struck cold to his heart of the wicked injury which he was doing his father boy though he was he knew well what truth and loyalty and the bonds which should bind a family together demanded from him he was miserable with a woe which he had not known how to explain to the priest as he thought of his terrible condition at first pat carroll and his friends had recommended themselves to him he had in truth only come on the scene of devastation down by the lough by mere accident but he had before heard that pat was an aggrieved man in reference to his rent and had taken it into his boyish heart to sympathise with such sorrows when pat had got hold of him on the spot and had first exacted the promise of secrecy florian had given it willingly he had not expected to be questioned on the subject and had not attributed the importance to it which it had afterwards assumed he had since denied all knowledge of it and was of course burdened with a boys fear of having to acknowledge the falsehood and now there had been added to it that awful scene in the cabin at headford and on the top of that had come the priests injunction in such a case as this i cannot absolve you from your word it was so that the priest had addressed him and there was something in it that struck his young mind with awe there was the man in the mask tendering to him the oath upon the cross and there had been pat carroll assuring him of that mans wrath then there had come the other stranger speaking out angrily and promising to him all evil were he to divulge a word  nevertheless his conscience was so strong within him that when he reached the castle he had almost made up his mind to tell his father everything but just as he was about to enter the lodge gate he was touched on the arm by a female master florian said the female we is all in your hands it was now dark night and he could not even see the womans face she seemed indeed to keep her face covered and yet he could see the gleam of her eyes youre one of us now master florian  im a catholic if you mean that  what else should i main would ye be unthrue to your own people do ye know what would happen you if ye commit such a sin as that i tould them up there that youd never bring down hell fire upon yer head by such a deed as that it isnt what ye can do to him hell mind i said but the anger o the blessed virgin wornt it thrue for me what i said master florian she held him in the dark and he could see the glimmer of her eyes and hear the whisper of her voice and she frightened him with the fear of the world to come as he made his way up to the hall door it was not the dread of the man in the mask so much as the fear inspired by this woman which made him resolve that come what come might he must stick to the lie which he had told  after breakfast the next morning his father summoned him into his room now said flory to himself as he followed his father tremblingnow must i be true by this he meant that he must be true to his coconspirators if he were false to them he would have to incur the anger of the blessed virgin how this should be made to fall upon him he did not in the least understand but he did understand that the virgin as he had thought her should be kind and mild and gracious he had never stopped to think whether the curse as uttered by the woman might or might not be true of loyalty to his father he had thought much but now he believed that it behoved him to think more of loyalty to the virgin as defined by the woman in the dark  he followed his father into the magistrates room leaving his brother and two sisters in the parlour he was glad that none of them were invited to accompany him for he felt that his father was more prone to believe him than were either his sisters or even his brother florian said his father you know do you not the trouble to which i have been put about this man pat carroll  yes father i know you have  and the terrible loss which i have incurred eighty acres are under water i suppose the miscreant will have cost me between £400 and £500  as much as that said florian frightened by the magnitude of the sum named  indeed he will it is hard to calculate the extent of the malignity of a wicked man whether the barony will share the loss with me i cannot yet say but in either case the wickedness will be the same there is no word bad enough for it it is altogether damnable and this is done by a man who calls me in question because of my religion here the father paused but florian stood by without an answer if pat carroll was right in his religion his father must be wrong and florian thought that pat carroll was right but he did not see how the two things were joined togetherthe opening of the sluices and the truth of pat carrolls religious convictions but bad as the matter is as regards pat carroll it is all as nothing in reference to the accusation made against you here the father came up and laying his two hands on the boys shoulders looked sadly into his face i cannot believe that my own boy my darling boy has joined in this evil deed against me here the father ceased and waited for his son to speak  the son remembered the determination to which he had come and resolved to adhere to it i didnt he said after a pause  i cannot believe it of you and yet your sisters who are as true as steel who are so good that i bless god morning and night that he in his mercy has left me such treasuresthey believe it  they are against me because of my religion  no florian not so they disapprove of your change in religion but they are not brought to accuse you by such a feeling they say that they see it in your face  how can they see all that in my face  that though you are lying persistently you cannot hide from them that you are lying they are not only good girls but they have very sharp wits a cleverer girl than edith or one better able to read the truth of a boys head or even a mans i have never known i hardly dare to put my own judgment against hers  in this case she knows nothing about it  but to me it is of such vital importance it is not simply that your evidence is needed to punish the man i would let the man go and all the evil that he has done me but not for any money that i could name would i entertain such an opinion of my son were i convinced at this moment that you are innocent i should be a happy man  then you may father  but your manner is against you you do not answer me with that appearance of frankness which i should have expected  of course it all makes me very miserable how can a fellow be frank when hes suspected like this  florian do you give me your most solemn assurance that you saw nothing of this evil work while it was being perpetrated  yes father  you saw nothing and you knew nothing  no father  you have no reason to accuse pat carroll except by what you have heard  no father  nor anyone else  no father then mr jones stood silent looking at his son and the more he looked the more he doubted him when the boy had uttered no father for the last time mr jones felt almost convincedalmost convinced that edith was right you may go now florian he said and the boy departed fully convinced that his father had disbelieved him     chapter iv  mr blake of carnlough   three or four days after the occurrences narrated in the last chapter mr jones got on to his car and had himself driven down to carnlough the seat of mr thomas blake a gentleman living about two miles the other side of tuam to reach carnlough he had a journey to make of about ten miles and as he seldom went in these days so far away from home the fact of his going was known to all the household  father is going to carnlough florian said to peter the butler what is he going for  deed then master flory who can tell that mr blake is a very old friend of masters  but why is he going now it isnt often he goes to carnlough and when he does go he is sure to say why  i shouldnt wonder af hes going to ax him as to how he shall get rid of the waters  he knows that better than mr blake can tell him  or maybe hes going to inquire how he shall cotch a hould of pat carroll  it was evident from the butlers answers that all the world at morony castle felt that at present mr jones could engage himself on no other subject than that of the flood  i wish father wouldnt think so much about the flood after all whats £500 it wont ruin a man like my father  but the butler showed by his visage that he regarded £500 as a very serious matter and that he was not at all astonished by the occupation which it gave to his masters thoughts  mr blake of carnlough was the first irishman with whom mr jones had become acquainted in the county galway it was through his instance indeed that the morony and ballintubber properties had been bought so that the acquaintance must have been well established before the purchase had been made mr blake was a man of good property who in former years had always been regarded as popular in the county he was a protestant but had not made himself odious to the roman catholics around him as an orangeman nor had he ever been considered to be hard as a landlord he thought perhaps a little too much of popularity and had prided himself a little perhaps on managing his boysas he called the tenantswith peculiar skill even still he could boast of his success though there had arisen some little difficulties as to rent over at carnlough and indeed he was frightened lest some of the evil ways which had begun to prevail in the neighbouring parts of county mayo should make their way into county galway  mr blake and mr jones had been very intimate it had been at mr blakes instance that mr jones had been brought on to the grand jury but latterly they had not seen very much of each other mr jones since the death of his wife did not go frequently to galway and carnlough was a long distance for a mornings drive but on this occasion mr jones drove himself over simply with the view of making a morning call well jones how are youand how are the girls and how is frank and how is that young pickle master florian these questions were answered by others of a similar nature how are the girls and how is mrs blake and what is going on here at carnlough there was no inquiry after the eldest son for it was mr blakes misfortune that he had no male child to inherit his property  faith then things aint going on a bit too well said mr blake abatement abatement nothing but abatement nobody abates me anything i have to pay all family charges just the same as ever what would they say if i was to take away my wife and girls shut up carnlough and go and live in france i could give them some abatement then and be a richer man but how would they like to have carnlough empty  theres no danger of that i think  upon my word i dont know the girls are talking of it and when they begin to talk of a thing i am very likely to do it and mrs blake is quite ready  you wouldnt leave the country  thats just it ill stay if theyll let me if theyll pay me rent enough to enable me to live here comfortably ill not desert them but if they think that im to keep up the place on borrowed money theyll find their mistake i didnt mind ten per cent for the last two years though i have taken to drinking whisky punch in my old age instead of claret and sherry and i dont mind ten per cent for this year though i am sorely in want of a young horse to carry me but if the ten per cent is to go on or to become twenty per cent as one blackguard hinted i shall say goodbye to carnlough they may fight it out then with terry daly as they can now terry daly was the wellknown agent for the lands of carnlough what has brought you over here today asked mr blake i can see with half an eye that there is some fresh trouble  indeed there is  i have heard what they did with your sluices thats another trick theyve learnt out of county mayo when a landlord is not rich enough to give them all that they want they make the matter easier by doing the best they can to ruin him i dont think anything of that kind has been done at carnlough  there is worse than that said mr jones sorrowfully  the devil there is they have not mutilated any of your cattle  no there is nothing of that kind the only enemy ive got about the place as far as i know is one pat carroll it was he and others whom he paid to serve him that have let the waters in upon the meadows eighty acres are under water at this moment but i can bear that like a man the worst of that is that all the neighbours should have seen him do it and not one of them have come forward to tell me  that is the worst said mr blake there must be some terrible understanding among them some compact for evil when twenty men are afraid to tell what one man has been seen to do its fearful to think that the priests should not put a stop to it how is master florian getting on with his priest  its about him that i have come to speak to you said mr jones  about florian  yes indeed when i tell you my story i think you will understand that i would tell it to no one but yourself in county galway i fear that florian saw the men at work upon the flood gates  and will he not tell the truth  you must remember that i cannot say that i know anything the boy declares that he saw nothing that he knows nothing i have no evidence but his sisters are sure that it is so edith says that he certainly was present when the gates were removed she only judges from his manner and his countenance  what made her suspect him asked mr blake  only that she saw him when the news was brought to us edith is not illnatured she would not be prone to make a story against her brother  if edith says so it is so said mr blake who among all ediths admirers was one of the most ardent  i dont quite say that i only mean to express my conviction that she intends to get at the truth  ill wager my life upon her said mr blake as to the otherwell you know jones that he has turned roman catholic  that means nothing said the distressed father he is only ten years old of course hes a fool for his pains but he would not on that account do such a deed as this  i dont know you must remember that he will be telling everything to the priests  we have two priests about us said mr jones and i would trust them in anything there is father giles at headford and he is as fair a man as any clergyman of our own could be you cannot imagine that he would give such advice to my boy  not father giles certainly said the other man  then down with us at ballintubber there is father malachi  i know him too said mr blake he would not interfere with a boy like florian is there no one else what curate lives with father malachi  there is none with him at ballintubber one brosnan lives with father giles  that man is a firebrand said mr blake he is a wretched politician always preaching up home rule  but i do not think that even he would teach a boy to deceive his own father in such a matter as this  i am not sure said blake it is very difficult to get at the vagaries of mind in such a man as mr brosnan but what do you intend to do  i have come to you for advice but remember thisin my present frame of mind the suspicion that i feel as to poor florian is ten times worse to me than the loss of all my meadows if i could find out edith to have been wrong i should be at once relieved of the great trouble which sits heaviest at my heart  i fear that edith is right said mr blake  you are prejudiced a little in her favour whatever she says you will think right  you must weigh that and take it for what its worth said mr blake we know that the boy has got himself into bad hands you do not suspect him of a desire to injure you  oh no said the father  but he has seen these men do it and now refuses to tell you they have terrified him  he is not a cowardly boy said mr jones still standing up for his son  but they have made him swear an oath that he will not tell there has been something of that sort what does he say himself  simply that he knows nothing about it  but how does he say it does he look you in the face a boy of that kind may lie boys doand girls also when people say they dont they know nothing about it but if its worth ones while to look at them one can generally tell when theyre lying im not a bit afraid of a boy when he is lyingbut only of one who can lie as though he didnt lie  i think that florian is lying said mr jones slowly he does not look me in the face and he does not lie straightforward  then edith is right and i am right when i swear by her  but what am i to do with him if as i suppose he saw pat carroll do the mischief he must have seen others with him if we knew who were the lot we could certainly get the truth out of some of them so as to get evidence for a conviction  cant he be made to speak asked mr blake  how can i make him it will be understood all about morony that he has been lying and i feel that it is thought that he has made himself a hero by sticking to his lie if they should turn upon him mr blake sat silent but made no immediate reply it would be better for me to let the whole thing slide if they were to kill him  they would not do that here in county galway they have not come to that as yet there is not a county in all ireland in which such a deed could be done said mr blake standing up for his country are you to let this ruffian pass unpunished while you have the power of convicting him i think that you are bound to punish him for the sake of your country you are bound to do so  and the boy said mr jones hoarsely  he is but ten years old and will soon live it down and the disgrace of the lie will be drowned in the triumph of telling the truth at last we should all feeli should feelthat he would in such case deserve well rather than ill of his father and of me and of all of us besides you had some idea of sending him to school in england here mr jones shook his head intending to indicate that no such expensive step as that would be possible after the loss incurred by the flooding of the eighty acres at any rate my advice to you is to make him declare the truth i think little harm of a boy for lying but i do think harm of those who allow a lie to pass unnoticed so saying mr blake ended the meeting and took mr jones away to see mrs blake and the girls  i do suppose that father has gone to carnlough to consult with mr blake about this affair of the flood it was thus that ada spoke to her brother florian when he came to her discussing the matter of their fathers absence  what can mr blake know about it said florian  i suppose he means to ask about you it is quite clear florian that no one in the house believes you  peter does  you mean that peter thinks you are right to stand to the lie now you have told it more shame for peter if he does  you wouldnt have a fellow go and put himself out of favour with all the boys through the country there is a horrible man that wears a mask then he remembered and stopped himself he was on closer terms with ada than with edith but not on terms so close as to justify his whispering a word about the man in the mask  where did you see the man in the mask asked ada who is the man in the mask  i dont know  but you know where you saw him you must know that what did the man in the mask say to you  i am not going to tell you anything about him said the boy i am not going to have my secrets got out of me in that way it isnt honest nobody but a protestant would do it so saying florian left his sister with the tale of the man in the mask only half told     chapter v  mr omahony and his daughter   we must now turn to another personage in our story and tell our readers something of the adventures and conditions of this gentlemansomething also of his daughter the adventures of her early life will occupy much of our time and many of our pages and though her father may not be so interesting as it is hoped that she will become still he was so peculiar in his modes of thought and so honest though by no means wise in his manner of thinking as to make his story also perhaps worth the telling  gerald omahony was at the time of the flooding of mr joness meadows not much more than forty years old but he was already the father of a daughter nearly twenty where he was born from what parents or to what portion of ireland his family belonged no one knew he himself had been heard to declare a suspicion that his father had come from county kerry but as he himself had been according to his own statement probably born in the united states the county to which his father had belonged is not important he had been bred up as a roman catholic but had long since thrown over all the prejudices of his religion he had married when he was quite young and had soon lost his wife but in talking of her now he always described her as an angel but though he looked to be so young as to be his daughters brother rather than her father he had never thought of marrying again his daughter he declared was everything to him but those who knew him well said that politics were dearer to him even than his daughter since he had been known in county galway he had passed and repassed nearly a dozen times between new york and ireland and his daughter had twice come with him he had no declared means but he had never been known to borrow a shilling or to leave a bill unpaid but he had frequently said aloud that he had no money left and that unless he returned to his own country he and his daughter must be taken in by some poorhouse for mr omahony fond as he was of ireland allowed no one to say that he was an irishman  but his troubles were apparently no troubles to him he was always goodhumoured and seemed always to be happyexcept when in public when he was engaged upon politics then he would work himself up to such a state of indignant anger as seemed to be altogether antagonistic to goodhumour the position he filledor had filledwas that of lecturer on behalf of the united states he had lectured at manchester at glasgow at liverpool and lately all over ireland but he had risen to such a height of wrath in advocating the doctrine of republicanism that he had been stopped by the police he had been held to have said things disrespectful of the queen this he loudly denied he had always he said spoken of the queens virtues her graces and general fitness for her high office he had declaredand this was truethat of all kings and queens of whom he had read in history she was the best but he had gone on to say there should be no king or queen the practice was an absurdity the reverence paid even to the high office was such as in his idea degraded a man even in america the kotooing which took place before the presidents toe was to him an abomination no man in accordance with his theory should worship another man titles should only be used as indicative of a mans trade or occupation as one man was mr general grant another man should be mr bricklayer green he could not do away with the queen but for the woman he was quite disposed to worship her all women were to be worshipped and it was a privilege of a man to worship a woman when a woman possessed so many virtues as did the queen of england it became a mans duty to worship them but it was a woman whom he would worship and not the queen this was carried to such a length and he was so eloquent on the subject that the police were desired to interfere and he was made to hold his tongueat any rate as far as england and ireland were concerned  he had made galway a kind of centre home attracted thither by the friendship which his daughter had made with ada and edith jones for though ada and edith were by no means republican in their thoughts and feelings it had come to pass that they dearly loved the american girl who was so rachel omahony had frequently been at morony castle as had also her father and mr jones had taken delight in controverting the arguments of the american because as he had said the american had been unselfish and true but since his lecturing had been stopped it had become necessary that he should go elsewhere to look for means of livelihood and he had now betaken himself to london for that purposea circumstance which will be explained at greater length as the story progresses  republicanism was not the only matter in his political creed to which gerald omahony was devoted though he was no irishman as he delighted to intimate his heart was irish and during his various visits to the country he had filled his bosom with thoughts of irish wrongs no educated man was ever born and bred in more utter ignorance of all political truths than this amiable and philanthropic gentleman in regard to ireland his theory was that the land should be taken from the present proprietors and divided among the peasants who tilled it when asked what should be done with the present owners he was quite ready with his answer let them be paid for the property by the state he would have no man injured to the extent of a shilling when asked where the state was to get the money he declared that that was a mere detail states did get money as for the landlords themselves with the money in their pockets let them emigrate to the united states if they were in want of something to do as to the division of the landthat he said would settle itself one man would have ten acres and another fifty but that would be fair because one man had been used to pay for ten and another to pay for fifty as for the men who got no land in the scramble he could see no injustice the man who chanced to have been a tenant for the last twelve months must take the benefit of his position no doubt such man could sell his land immediately after he got it because freedom of sale was one of the points of his charter he could see the injustice of giving the land at a rent fixed by the state because the state has no right to interfere in ordinary contracts between man and man but if the land was to be given up without any rent then he could see no injustice thus and thus only could ireland be made to return to the beauty and the grace of her original simplicity  but on the wrongs arising from the want of home rule he was warmer even than on those which the land question had produced why should ireland be governed by a british parliament a british lordlieutenant a british chiefsecretary a british commanderinchief and trodden under foot by a british soldiery why should scotland be so governed why should wales why should yorkshire mr jones would reply repeal the unions restore the heptarchy mr omahony had but a confused idea of what the heptarchy had been but he was sure that it would be for the benefit of ireland that irish knives should be made of irish steel as undoubtedly would have been the case if the question of protection were to be left to an irish parliament to settle said mr jones heaven help the man who would want to cut his mutton his best chance would be that he would soon have no mutton to cut  so the dispute was carried on with much warmth on one side and with many arguments on the other but without any quarrelling it was impossible to quarrel with omahony who was thoroughly unselfish and desirous of no violence when he had heard what had been done in reference to mr joness meadows and had been told of the suspected conduct of pat carroll he was as indignant as though he had himself been a landed proprietor or even an orangeman and on mr joness part there was a desire to do justice to all around him which came within the capacity of omahonys vision he knew that mr jones himself was a fairdealing honest gentleman and he could not therefore quarrel with him  there is a steamer running from the town of galway across lough corrib to the little village of cong on the mayo side of the lake which stops and picks up passengers within a mile of morony castle from this passengers are landed so that the means of transit between galway and mr joness house are peculiarly easy up and down by this steamer ada and edith jones had frequently gone to visit their friend and as frequently that friend had come to visit them but unfortunately the steamer had been open to others besides the young ladies and rachel omahony had found a dearer friend than either of the girls at morony castle it had come to pass that frank jones and rachel omahony had declared themselves to be engaged on no such ground as want of wealth or want of family or want of education had mr jones based his objection to the match but there had been a peculiarity in the position of rachel which had made him hesitate it was not that she was an american but such an american it was not that he was a republican but such a republican and she was more anxious to carry frank away with her to the united states and to join him in a political partnership with her father than to come and settle herself down at the castle thus there had arisen an understanding on the part of the young people that though they were engaged they were engaged without the consent of the young mans father rachel therefore was not to be brought to the castle while frank was there to all this rachels father had assented in a smiling indifferent manner half intended to ridicule all who were concerned as it was not a question of politics mr omahony could not work himself up to any anger or apparently even to anxiety in the matter your young peoplehere he meant english and irish generallyare taught to think they should begin the world where we leave it off  your young people are just as fond of what money will buy as are ours said mr jones  but they are fonder of one another even than of money when they love one another they become engaged then they marry and as a rule they dont starve as a rule people with us seldom do starve as for making out an income for a young man to start with that with us is quite out of the question frank some day will have this property  that wont give him much of an income said mr jones who since the affair of the flood had become very despondent in reference to the estate  then hes as well off now as ever he will be and might as well marry the girl but all this was said with no eagerness  they are merely boy and girl as yet said mr jones  i was married and rachel was born before i was franks age so saying mr omahony consented to come to morony castle and bid them adieu without bringing his girl with him this was hard upon ada and edith as mr frank of course went into galway as often as he pleased and made his adieu after his own fashion  and there had come up another cause which had created further objections to the marriage in mr joness mind mr omahony had declared that as his lecturing was brought to an end by the police he must throw himself upon rachels capabilities for earning some money rachels capabilities had been often discussed at the castle but with various feelings on the three sides into which the party had formed themselves all the joness were on one side and declared that the capability had better not be exercised in this they were probably wrongbut it was their opinion they had lived for many years away from london the children had so lived all their lives and they conceived that prejudices still existed which had now been banished or nearly banished from the world mr omahony who formed another party thought that the matter was one of supreme indifference as long as he could earn money by lecturing it was well that he should earn it it was always better that the men of a family should work than the women but if the mans talent was of no use then it might be well to fall back upon the woman he only laughed at the existence of a prejudice in the matter he himself had no prejudices he regarded all prejudices as the triumph of folly over education  but rachel who was the third party in the discussion had a very strong feeling of her own she was of opinion that if the capability in question existed it ought to be exercised on that subjecther possession of the capabilityshe entertained she said strong doubts but if the capability existed it certainly ought to be used that was rachels opinion expressed with all the vigour which she knew how to throw into the subject  this capability had already been exercised in new york where it had been efficacious though the effect had not been great she had been brought up to sing and great things had been promised of her voice an american manager had thought much of her performance though she had hitherto he said been young and had not come to the strength of her throat but he had himself seen to her education almost as a child and had been sure that sooner or later she would do great things in the musical world mr mahomet m moss was the gentleman in question and he at present was in london that such a voice as rachel omahonys should be lost to the world was to his thinking a profanity an indecency an iniquity a wasting of gods choicest gifts and an abomination not to be thought of for mr mahomet m moss was in the affairs of his own profession a most energetic gentleman rachel rather turned up her nose at mr mahomet m moss but she was very anxious to go to london and to take her chance and to do something as she said laughing just to keep her fathers pot a little on the boilbut for mr mahomet m moss she did not care one straw mr omahony was therefore ready to start on the journey and had now come to morony castle to say farewell to his friend mr jones are you sure about that fellow moss said mr jones  what do you call sure about him hes as big a swindler i guess as you shall find from here to himself  and are you going to put rachel into his hands  well i think soafter a sort of fashion hell swindle her out of three parts of what she earnsbut shell get the fourth part its always the way with a young girl when shes first brought out  i dont mean about money will you leave her conduct in his hands  hell be a clever chap wholl undertake to look after rachels conduct i guess shell conduct herself mostly  youll be there to be sure said mr jones  yes i shall be there and shell conduct me too very likely  but mr omahonyas a father  i know pretty well what you would be saying our young folk grow old quicker a long sight than yours do now your girls here are as sweet as primroses out of the wood but rachel is like a rose that has been brought up to stand firm on its own bush im not a bit afraid of her nor yet is your son she looks as though you might blow her away with the breath from your mouth you try her and youll find that shell want a deal of blowing  does not a young girl lose something of the aroma of her youth by seeing too much of the world too soon  how old do you expect her to be when shes to die  rachel how can i tell she is only as yet entering upon life and her health seems to be quite confirmed  the best confirmed i ever knew in my life she never has a days illness taking all the chances one way and another shall we say sixty  more than that i should think said mr jones  say sixty she may fall down a trap in the theatre or be drowned in one of your cunarders  the cunard steamers never drown anybody said mr jones  well then a white staror any cockleshell you may please to name well put her down for sixty as an average  i dont know what you are driving at said mr jones  she has lived a third of her life already and you expect her to know nothing so that the aroma may still cling to her aroma does very well for earls daughters and young marchionesses though as far as i can learn its going out of fashion with them what has an american girl to do with aroma whos got her bread to earn shes got to look to her conduct and to be sharp at the same time mr mahomet m moss will rob her of seventyfive cents out of every dollar for the next twelve months in three years time hell rob her of nothing only that she knows what conduct means hed have to look very sharp to keep his own  it is not natural said mr jones  but its american marvels are not natural and we are marvellous people i dont know much about aroma but i think youll find rachel will come out of the washing without losing much colour in the process  then the two friends parted and mr omahony went back to galway preparatory to his journey to london     chapter vi  rachel and her lovers   on the day following that of omahonys return to galway he and his daughter and frank jones were together at the galway station preparatory to the departure of the omahonys for dublin and london i guess you two have got something to say to each other so ill leave you to yourselves said the father  i guess we have said rachel so if youll wait here well come to you when the cars are fixed so saying rachel put her hand on her lovers arm and walked off with him along the platform rachel omahony had not been badly described when her father said of her that she looked as though she might be blown away she was very fair and small and frail to look at her father had also said of her that her health was remarkably goodthe best confirmed that he had ever known in his life but though this too was true she hardly looked it no one could have pointed out any sign of malady about her only one would have said that there was nothing of her and the colour on her face was so evanescent that he who watched her was inclined to think that she herself was like her colour and she moved as though she was always on the vanishing point im very fond of eating she had been heard to say i know its vulgar but its true no doubt she was fond of eating but so is a sparrow there was nothing she would not attempt to do in the way of taking exercise she would undertake very long walks and would then fail and declare that she must be carried home but she would finally get through the days work better than another woman who appeared to have double her strength her feet and hands were the tiniest little adjuncts to a grown human body that could be seen anywhere they looked at least to be so but they were in perfect symmetry with her legs and arms i wish i were bigger she had once been heard to say because i could hit a man the man to whom she alluded was mr mahomet m moss i sometimes want to hit a woman but that would be such a small triumph and yet she had a pride in her little female fineries now frank she had once said i guess you wont get another woman in all galway to put her foot into that boot nor yet in new york either  i dont think i could said the enraptured frank  youd better take it to new york and try and if you find the lady you can bring her back with you  frank refused the commission saying something of course very pretty as to his mistresss foot ten buttons these only have eight she said objecting to a present which her lover had just brought her if i had ten buttons and the gloves to fit me id cut my arm off and put it under a glass case lovers are sent out to do all possible and impossible things in order to deserve their ladyloves you shall go and wander about till you find a glove with ten buttons to fit me then ill consent to be mrsjones by all of which little manoeuvres frank was charmed and oppressed to the last degree when she would call herself the future mrsjones he would almost feel inclined to abandon both the name and the property why not be mrs morony rachel would say or mrs ballintubber the ballintubber of ballintubber would sound exquisitely and then i should always be called madam  her beauty was all but perfect as far as symmetry was concerned only that there was not enough of it and for the perfection of female beauty a tone of colour is methinks needed somewhat darker than that which prevailed with rachel omahony her hair was so light that one felt it rather than saw it as one feels the sunlight it was soft and feathery as is the under plumage on the wings of some small tropical birds a lock of my hair she had once said to frank but it will all go into nothing you should have paid your vows to some girl who could give you a good lump of hair fit to stuff a pillow with if you have mine you will think in a few weeks that the spiders have been there and have left their dust behind but she gave him the lock of hair and laid it on his lips with her own little hands  there was not enough of her beauty even in touching her a lover could not but feel that he had to deal with a little child in looking at her he could only look down upon her it was not till she spoke and that her words came to his assistance that he found that he had to deal with one who was not altogether a child mr mahomet m moss declares his opinion that i shall be seen above the gaslights it was very civil and complimentary of mahomet m m but i mean to make myself heard mahomet m m did not seem to think of this since frank had known her she had taken every opportunity in her power of belittling mahomet m m as she was wont to call mr moss  frank jones was in truth a handsome stalwart young man clever enough for the world who thought a good deal of himself and who thought very much more of the girl whom he loved it was chiefly because he was absolutely unlike an american that rachel omahony had come to love him who does not know the got up look of the gentleman from the other side of the water who seems to know himself to be much better than his father and infinitely superior to his grandfather who is always ready to make a speech on every occasion and who feels himself to be fit company for a prime minister as soon as he has left school probably he is young jones was not so and it was on account of this deficiency that rachel prized him im not like a young girl myself she had said to her father but i do love a jolly nice boy with us at sixteen they are all but decrepit old men and yet they are such little monkeys  for a little monkey what do you think of yourself her father had replied but the conversation then had not gone any further  i know youll be after me before long rachel said to frank as they walked up and down the platform together  if i do i shall ask you to marry me at once he replied  i shall never do that without your fathers leave  is that the way they manage things in america  its the way i shall manage them here said rachel im in the unfortunate position of having three papas to whom i must attend there is papa omahony  you will never be incommoded much by him he replied  he is the least potent of the three no doubt then there is papa jones he is absolutely omnipotent in this matter he would not let me come down to castle morony for fear i should contaminate you all i obeyed without even daring to feel the slightest snub and if i were married tomorrow i should kiss his toe in token of respect and with a great deal more affection than i should kiss your halfbearded lips sir here frank got a hold of her hand beneath his arm and gave it a squeeze he is the real oldfashioned father in the play who is expected to come out at last with a hundred thousand dollars and his blessing  and who is the third papa  dont you know mahomet m moss he is the third papaif only he would consent to remain in that comparatively humble position here frank listened to her words with sharp ears but he said nothing at the moment mahomet m moss is at any rate my lord and master for the present  not whilst i am alive said frank  but he is there is no use in rebelling you are not my lord and master until you have gone through a certain ceremony i wish you were will that satisfy you  there is something in the name of lord and master which a girl shouldnt apply to anyone but to him who is to be her husband  fiddlestick mr lord and master that is to be but is not as yet but he is in many respects i dont think frank you can imagine the horror i feel in reference to that vilest of human beings i shall carry a dagger with me in order to have it ready for any occasion  what does he do you shall not go to be subjected to such danger and such annoyance  she turned round and looked up into his face as with derision the annoyance no doubt will be mine frank and must be endured the danger will be his i think nor shall i use the dagger that i spoke of i can look at him and i can make him hear my voice in spite of the smallness of my stature but there is no one in this world whom i detest as i do that greasy jew it is not for what he does but that i simply detest him he makes love to me  what  oh he does you neednt look like that you neednt be a bit jealous  i shall come over at once  and knock him on the head you had better not do that because we want to make some money by his means as a lover i can keep him at a distance i wish i could do so to you mr jones  why do you wish to keep me at a distance  because you know how to be troublesome it is much harder to keep a lover at a distance when you really love him with all your hearthere she looked up into his face and squeezed his arm and nearly made him mad for the momentthan a beast like that who is no better than a toad to you there do you see that ugly old man there she pointed to a crosslooking old gentleman of sixty who was scolding a porter violently why arent you jealous of that man  you never saw him before  thats just the reason he may be worth my affection but i know that that mahomet m m is not you begin with the most bitter hatred on my part i dont hate that old gentleman i rather like him on the whole though he was so cross at any rate hes not a greasy jew papa says that hating jews is a prejudice loving you is a prejudice i suppose  my darling  you cant suppose you are the best man i ever saw can you  its a sort of thing we are not to reason about  then its a prejudice im prejudiced against mahomet m m im equally prejudiced in favour of mr jones junior of ballintubber its horrible to be troubled by the one  well  well theres nothing more coming mr jones only dont you come over in any of your fits of jealousy or youll have to be sent back again youre not my lord and masteryet  i wish i were  so do i what more do you want than that i dont believe theres another girl in new york would say as much to younor yet in county galway  but what does he say to you  well just the kind of things that you never say and he certainly never does the kind of things which you do and that mr jones is an improvement but papa is in a hurry and i shouldnt wonder if the train didnt go on in a quarter of an hour ill write to you about mahomet m m and if i behave very badly such as prodding him with the dagger or something of that sort then i will let you know the details you cant do it here so you may as well go so saying she jumped into the carriage and the train had started before frank jones had begun to think whether he could do it there or no  hes a good fellow take him all round said mr omahony when the carriages had left the station  as good as the rest of them  i think he is better  of course we all think so of our own why should he be better than any other young ladys mr jones i dont suppose he is better but well endeavour to believe that he is up to the average  is that all that youve got to say for him rachel  what to you not exactlyif i am to speak the solid truth which i dont see why i should have to do even to my own father i do think him above the average i think him so much above the average as to be the best of all but why simply because i believe him when he says he wants to marry me and make me his companion for life and then theres an affinity between us which god certainly manages why should i trust him in every detail of life with a perfect faith and not trust mr mahomet m moss to the extent of halfacrown if he were to ask me for everything i have in the world i should give it to him without a thought except of his goodness in taking care of it for me i wouldnt let mahomet m moss have a dollar of mine without giving me his bond papa there will be a row between me and mr mahomet m moss and so its well to put you on your guard  what sort of a row my dear  a very rowy row i dont mean about dollars for youll have to manage that just at first when we have got into the running i think i shall have something to say on that subject too  what row do you mean  hell misbehave himself he always does more or less  the poor fellow cant open his mouth without your saying that he misbehaves himself  thats quite true he cant he cant brush his hair or tie his cravat or settle his pantaloons without misbehaving himself he certainly cant look out of his eye without gross misbehaviour  what is he to do then said mr omahony nature has imbued him with all these peculiarities and you are fantastic to find fault with him  perhaps sobut then i am fantastic when youve got a dirty coat on or frank i dont find fault with it but when hes got a clean coat i writhe at him in my disgust yet upon the whole i like men to have clean coats  but you havent said how the row is to come  because i dont know but it will come it wont be about his coat nor yet his hat unless he puts it close down under my nose my time as i understand is to be at his disposal  there will be an agreement made as to all that  an agreement as to my performances i quite understand that i must be present at fixed times at the theatre and that he must fix them that will not worry me particularly if you will go to the theatre with me  of course i will do that when you want it  but he is to come to me with his beastly lessons am i to have no relief from that  the hours can be fixed  but they wont be fixed theres no doubt that he understands his trade he can make me open my mouth and keep it open and he can tell me when i sing false or flat providence when she gave him that horrid head of hair did give him also the peculiarity of a fine ear i think it is the meanest thing out for a man to be proud of that if you can run a straight furrow with a plough it is quite as great a gift  that is nonsense my dear such an ear as mr mosss is very rare  a man who can see exactly across an entire field is just as rare i dont see the difference nor when a woman sings do i respect her especially because of her voice when a man can write a poem like homer or rule a country like washington there is something to say for him i shall tell him that i will devote one hour a day to practising and no more  that will settle the difficulty if it be enough  but during that hour there is to be no word spoken except what has to do with the lessons youll bear me out in that  there must be some give and take in regard to ordinary conversation  you dont know what a beast he is papa what am i to do if he tells me to my face that im a beautiful young woman  tell him that you are quite aware of the fact but that it is a matter you do not care to talk about  and then hell simper you do not know what a vile creature he can be i can take care of myself you neednt be a bit afraid about that i fancy i could give him a slap on the face which would startle him a little and if we came to blows i do believe that he would not have a leg to stand upon he is nearly fifty  my dear  say forty but i do believe a good shove would knock him off his nasty little legs i used to think he wore a wig but no hairdresser could be such a disgrace to his profession to let such a wig as that go out of his shop  i always regarded him as a goodlooking young man said mr omahony here rachel shook her head and made a terrible grimace its all fancy you know continued he  i suppose it is but if you hear that i have told him that i regard him as a disgusting monkey you must not be surprised this was the last conversation which mr omahony and his daughter had respecting mahomet m moss till they reached london     chapter vii  browns   when mr omahony and his daughter stepped out of the train on the platform at euston square they were at once encountered by mr mahomet m moss oh dear ejaculated miss omahony turning back upon her father cannot you get rid of him mr omahony without a word of reply to his daughter at once greeted mr moss most affectionately yes my bird is hereas you see you have taken a great deal of trouble in coming to meet us mr moss begged that the trouble might be taken as being the greatest pleasure he had ever had in his life nothing could be too much to do for miss omahony he had had he said the wires at work and had been taught to expect them by this train would miss omahony condescend to take a seat in the carriage which was waiting for her she had not spoken a word but had laid fast hold of her fathers arm i had better look after the luggage said the father shaking the daughter off perhaps mr moss will go with you said sheand at the moment she looked anything but pleasant mr moss expressed his sense of the high honour which was done him by her command but suggested that she should seat herself in the carriage i will stand here under this pillar she said and as she took her stand it would have required a man with more effrontery than mr moss possessed to attempt to move her we have seen miss omahony taking a few liberties with her lover but still very affectionate and we have seen her enjoying the badinage of perfect equality with her papa there was nothing then of the ferocious young lady about her young ladiessome young ladiescan be very ferocious miss omahony appeared to be one of them as she stood under the iron post waiting till her father and mr moss returned with two porters carrying the luggage the pretty little fair flyaway rachel looked as though she had in her hand the dagger of which she had once spoken and was waiting for an opportunity to use it  is your maid here miss omahony asked mr moss  i havent got a maid said rachel looking at him as though she intended to annihilate him  they all seated themselves in the carriage with their small parcels leaving their luggage to come after them in a cab which mr moss had had allowed to him but they the omahonys knew nothing of their immediate destination it had been clearly the fathers business to ask but he was a man possessed of no presence of mind suddenly the idea struck rachel and she called out with a loud voice father where on earth are we going  i suppose mr moss can tell us  you are going to apartments which i have secured for miss omahony at considerable trouble said mr moss the theatres are all stirring  but we are not going to live in a theatre  the ladies of the theatres find only one situation convenient they must live somewhere in the neighbourhood of the strand i have secured two sittingrooms and two bedrooms on the first floor overlooking the views at browns  wont they cost money asked the father  of course they will said rachel what fools we have been we intended to go to some inn for one night till we could find a fitting placesomewhere about gower street  gower street wouldnt do at all said mr moss the distance from everything would be very great two ideas passed at that moment through rachels mind the first was that the distance might serve to keep mr moss out of her sittingroom and the second was that were she to succeed in doing this she might be forced to go to his sittingroom i think gower street would be found to be inconvenient miss omahony  bloomsbury square is very near here we are at the hotel now father before you have anything taken off the carriages ask the prices  then mr moss still keeping his seat made a little speech i think if miss omahony would allow me i would counsel her against too rigid an economy she will have heard of the old proverba penny wise and a pound foolish  cut your coat according to your cloth i have heard of that too and i have heard of burning a candle at both ends  you shouldnt spoil your ship for a haporth of tar said mr moss with a smile which showed his idea that he had the best of the argument  it wont matter for one night said mr omahony getting out of the carriage half the packages had been already taken off the cab  rachel followed her father and without attending to mr moss got hold of her father in the street i dont like the look of the house at all father you dont know what the people would be up to i shall never go to sleep in this house mr moss with his hat off was standing in the doorway suffused as to his face with a bland smile  it may be as well to say at once that the house was all that an hotel ought to be excepting perhaps that the prices were a little high the two sittingrooms and the two bedroomswith the maids room which had also been takendid seem to be very heavy to rachel who knew down to a shillingor rather to a dollar as she would have saidhow much her father had in his pocket indefinite promises of great wealth had been also made to herself but according to a scale suggested by mr moss a pound a night out of which she would have to keep herself was the remuneration immediately promised then a sudden thought struck miss omahony they were still standing discussing the price in one of the sittingrooms and mr moss was also there father she said im sure that frank would not approve  i dont think that he would feel himself bound to interfere said mr omahony  when a young woman is engaged to a young man it does make a difference she replied looking mr moss full in the face  the happy man said mr moss still bowing and smiling would not be so unreasonable as to interfere with the career of his fair fiancée  if we stay here very long said rachel still addressing her father i guess we should have to pawn our watches but here we are for the present and here we must remain i am awfully tired now and should so like to have a cup of teaby ourselves then mr moss took his leave promising to appear again upon the scene at eleven oclock on the following day thank you said rachel you are very kind but i rather think i shall be out at eleven oclock  what is the use of your carrying on like that with the man said her father  because hes a beast  my dear hes not a beast hes not a beast that you ought to treat in that way youll be a beast too if you come to rise high in your profession it is a kind of work which sharpens the intellect but is apt to make men and women beasts did you ever hear of a prima donna who thought that another prima donna sang better than she did  i guess that all the prima donnas sing better than i do  but you have not got to the position yet mr moss i take it was doing very well in new york so as to have become a beast as you call him but hes very goodnatured  hes a nasty stuckup greasy jew a decent young woman is insulted by being spoken to by him  what made you tell him that you were engaged to frank jones  i thought it might protect mebut it wont i shall tell him next time that i am franks wife but even that will not protect me  you will have to see him very often  and very often i shall have to be insulted i guess he does the same kind of thing with all the singing girls who come into his hands  give it up rachel  i dont mind being insulted so much as some girls do you know i cant fancy an english girl putting up with himunless she liked to do as he pleased i hate himbut i think i can endure him the only thing is whether he would turn against me and rend me then we shall come utterly to the ground here in london  give it up  no you can lecture and i can sing and its odd if we cant make one profession or the other pay i think i shall have to fight with him but i wont give it up what i am afraid is that frank should appear on the scene and then oh law if mr moss should get one blow in the eye  there she sat sipping her tea and eating her toast with her feet upon the fender while mr omahony ate his muttonchop and drank his whisky and water  father now im coming back to my temper i want something better than this buttered toast could they get me a veal cutlet or a bit of cold chicken  a waiter was summoned  and you must give me a little bit of ham with the cold chicken no father i wont have any wine because it would get into my head and then i should kill mr mahomet m moss  my dear said her father when the man had left the room do you wish to declare all your animosities before the waiter  well yes i think i do if we are to remain here it will be better that they should all know that i regard this man as my schoolmaster i know what im about i dont let a word go without thinking of it  then again they remained silent and mr omahony pretended to go to sleepand eventually did do so he devoted himself for the time to home rule and got himself into a frame of mind in which he really thought of ireland  the first flower of the earth and first gem of the sea  why should she not be so she had all the sentiment necessary all the poetry all the eloquence all the wit and then when he was beginning to think whether something more than sentiment and eloquence were not necessary he went to sleep  but rachel was not sleeping her thoughts were less stationary than her fathers and her ideas more realistic she had been told that she could sing and she had sung at new york with great applause and she had gone on studying or rather practising the art with great diligence she had already become aware that practice was more needed than study all nearly all this man could teach her was to open her mouth nature had given her an ear and a voice if she would work hard so as to use it it was there before her but it had seemed to her that her career was clogged with the necessary burden of mr moss mr moss had got hold of her and how should she get rid of him he was the old man of the sea and how should she shake him off and then there was present to her alone a vision of frank jones to live at morony castle and be frank joness wife would not that be sweeter than to sing at a theatre under the care of mr mahomet m moss all the sweetness of a country life in a pleasant house by the lake side and a husband with her who would endure all the little petulancy and vagaries and excesses of her wayward but affectionate temper all these things were present to her mind and to be mistress jones who could look all the world in the face thisas compared with the gaslight of a theatre which might mean failure and could only mean gaslightthis on the present occasion did tempt her sorely her moods were very various there were moments of her life when the gaslight had its charm and in which she declared to herself that she was willing to run all the chances of failure for the hope of success there were moments in which mr moss loomed less odious before her eyes should she be afraid of mr moss and fly from her destiny because a man was greasy and to this view of her circumstances she always came at last when her fathers condition pressed itself upon her the house beside the lake was not her own as yet nor would it be her husbands when she was married  nor could there be a home for her father there as long as old mr jones was alive nor possibly when his son should come to the throne for a time he must go to america and she must go with him she had declared to herself that she could not go back to the united states unless she could go back as a successful singer for these reasons she resolved that she would face mr moss bravely and all his horrors  if that gentleman comes here tomorrow at eleven show him up here she said to the waiter  mr moss maam the waiter asked  yes mr moss she answered in a loud voice which told the man much of her story where did that piano come from she asked brusquely  mr moss had it sent in said the man  and my father is paying separate rent for it she asked  whats that my dear whats that about rent  we have got this piano to pay for its one of erards mr moss has sent it and of course we must pay till we have sent it back again thatll do then the man went  its my belief that he intends to get us into pecuniary difficulties you have only got £62 left  but you are to have twenty shillings a day till christmas  whats that  according to what he says it will be increased after christmas he spoke of £2 a day  yes if my singing be approved of but who is to be the judge if the musical world choose to say that they must have rachel omahony that will be all very well am i to sing at twenty shillings a day for just as long as mr moss may want me and are we to remain here and run up a bill which we shall never be able to pay till they put us out of the door and call us swindlers  frank jones would help us at a pinch if we came to that difficulty said the father  i wouldnt take a shilling from frank jones frank jones is all the world to me but he cannot help me till he has made me his wife we must go out of this at the end of the first week and send the piano back as far as i can make it out our expenses here will be about £17 10s a week what the piano will cost i dont know but well learn that from mr moss ill make him understand that we cant stay here having no more than twenty shillings a day if he wont undertake to give me £2 a day immediately after christmas we must go back to new york while weve got money left to take us  have it your own way said mr omahony  i dont mean to remain here and wake up some morning and find that i cant stir a step without asking mahomet m m for some money favour i know i can sing i can sing at any rate to the extent of forty shillings a day for forty shillings a day ill stay but if i cant earn that at once let us go back to new york it is not the poverty i mind so much nor yet the debt nor yet even your distress you dear old father you and i could weather it out together on a twopenny roll things would never be altogether bad with us as long as we are together and as long as we have not put ourselves in the power of mahomet m m fancy owing mr moss a sum of money which we couldnt pay mahomets little bill i would say to a christian all right mr christian you shall have your money in good time and if you dont it wont hurt you he wouldnt be any more than an ordinary christian and would pull a long face but he would have no little scheme ready cut and dry for getting my body and soul under his thumb  you are very unchristian yourself my dear  i certainly have my own opinion of mahomet m m and i shall tell him tomorrow morning that i dont mean to run the danger  then they went to bed and slept the sleep of the just they ordered breakfast at nine so that as rachel said the heavy muttonchop might not be sticking in her throat as she attempted to show off before mr moss on his arrival but from eight till nine she passed her time in the double employment of brushing her hair and preparing the conversation as it was to take place between herself and mr moss when a young lady boasts that she doesnt let a word go without thinking of it she has to be careful in preparing her words and she prepared them now  there will be two of them against me she said to herself as she made the preparation therell be the dear old governor and the governor that isnt dear if i were left quite to myself i think i could do it easier but then it might come to sticking a knife into him  father she said during breakfast im going to practise for half an hour before this man comes  that means that im to go away  not in the least i shall go into the next room where the piano lives and you can come or not just as you please i shall be squalling all the time and as we do have the grandeur of two rooms for the present you might as well use them but when he comes we must take care and see that matters go right you had better leave us alone at first that i may sing to him then when thats over do you be in waiting to be called in i mean to have a little bit of business with my trusted agent manager and parent in music mahomet m m  she went to the instrument and practised there till halfpast eleven at which hour mr moss presented himself youll want to hear me sing of course she said without getting up from the musicstool  just a bar or two to know how you have improved but it is hardly necessary i see from the motion of your lips that you have been keeping your mouth open and i hear from the tone of your voice that it is all there there is no doubt about you if you have practised opening your mouth  at any rate you shall hear and if you will stand there you shall see  then the music lesson began and mr moss proved himself to be an adept in his art rachel did not in the least doubt his skill and obeyed him in everything as faithfully as she would have done had he been personally a favourite with her allow me to express my great delight and my strong admiration for the young débutante as far as miss omahony is concerned the word failure may be struck out of the language and no epithet should be used to qualify success but one in the most superlative degree allow me to and he attempted to raise her hand to his lips and to express his homage in a manner certainly not unusual with gentlemen of his profession  mr moss said the young lady starting up there need be nothing of that kind there had better not when a young woman is going to be married to a young man she cant be too careful you dont know perhaps but im going to be mrs jones mr jones is apt to dislike such things if youll wait half a moment ill bring papa in so saying she ran out of the room and in two minutes returned followed by her father the two men shook hands and each of them looked as though he did not know what he was expected to say to the other now then father you must arrange things with mr moss  mr moss bowed i dont exactly know what i have got to arrange said mr omahony  weve got to arrange so that we shant get into debt with mr moss  there need not be the least fear in the world as to that said mr moss  ah but thats just what we do fear and what we must fear  so unnecessaryso altogether unnecessary said mr moss expecting to be allowed to be the banker for the occasion if you will just draw on me for what you want  but that is just what we wont do then there was a pause and mr moss shrugged his shoulders its as well to understand that at the beginning of course this place is too expensive for us and we must get out of it as soon as possible  why in such a hurry said mr moss raising his two hands  and we must send back the piano it was so good of you to think of it but it must go back  no no no shouted mr moss the piano is my affair a piano more or less for a few months is nothing between me and erards people they are only too happy  i do not in the least doubt it messrs erards people are always glad to secure a lady who is about to come out as a singer but they send the bill in at last  not to younot to you  but to you that would be a great deal worse would it not father we might as well understand each other  mr omahony and i will understand each other very well  but it is necessary that miss omahony and you should understand each other also my father trusts me and i cannot tell you how absolutely i obey him  or he you said mr moss laughing  at any rate we two know what we are about sir you will not find us differing now mr moss you are to pay me twenty shillings a day  till christmastwenty shillings a night till christmas  of course we cannot live here on twenty shillings a day the rooms nearly take it all we cant live on twenty shillings a day anyhow  then make it forty shillings immediately after the christmas holidays  i must have an agreement to that effect said rachel or we must go back to ireland i must have the agreement before christmas or we shall go back we have a few pounds which will take us away  you must not speak of going away really miss omahony  then i must have an agreement signed you understand that and we shall look for cheaper rooms today there is a little street close by where we can manage it but on the one thing we are determinedwe will not get into debt     chapter viii  christmasday 1880   on christmasday rachel omahony wrote a letter to her lover at morony castle      cecil street christmasday 1880     dearest frank     you do love me dont you whats the use of my loving    you and thinking that you are everything only that you    are to love me i am quite content that it should be so    only let it be so youll ask me what reason i have to be    jealous i am not jealous i do think in my heart that you    think that imjust perfect and when i tell myself that    it is so i lay myself back in my chair and kiss at you    with my lips till i am tired of kissing the space where    you aint but if i am wrong and if you are having a good    time of it with miss considine at mrs mckeons ball and    are not thinking a bit of me and my kisses whats the    use its a very unfair bargain that a woman makes with a    man yes i do love you i saybut then theres a    sigh yes ill love you you sayif then theres    a laugh if i tell a fib and am not worth having you    can always recuperate but we cant recuperate im to go    about the world and be laughed at as the girl that frank    jones made a fool of oh mr jones if you treat me in    that way wont i punish you ill jump into the lough    with a label round my neck telling the whole story but i    am not a bit jealous because i know you are good     and now i must tell you a bit more of my history we got    rid of that lovely hotel paying £6 10s when that just    earned £1 and i have brought the piano with me the man    at erards told me that i should have it for £2 10s a    month frankly owning that he hoped to get my custom but    mr moss is to pay nothing i asked he swore that mr    moss would have to pay nothing and leave what occurred    between him and me i dont think he will £30 a year    ought to be enough for the hire of a piano so here we    are established at £10 a monththe firstfloor with    fathers bedroom behind the sittingroom i have the room    upstairs over the sittingroom they are small stumpy    little roomsbut mine own who saysbut mine own    somebody does and i repeat it they are mine own at any    rate till next saturday     and we have settled this terrible engagement and signed    it im to sing for moss at the embankment for four    months at the rate of £600 a year it was a jews    bargain for i really had filled the house for a    fortnight fancy a theatre called the embankment there    is a nasty muddy rheumatic sound about it but its very    prettily got up and the exits and entrances are also    good father goes with me every night but i mean to let    him off the terrible task soon he smiles and says he    likes it i only tell him he would be a child if he did    they want to change the piece but i shall make them    pay me for my dresses i am not going to wear any other    womans old clothes its not the proper way to begin    you have to begin as a slave or as an empress of course    anybody prefers to do the empress they try and then they    fail and tumble down i shall tumble down no doubt but    i may as well have my chance     and now im going to make you say that im a beast and    so i am i make a little use of mahomet m ms passion    to achieve my throne instead of taking up at once with    serfdom but i do it without vouchsafing him even the    first corner of a smile the harshest treatment is all    that he gets men such as mahomet m will live on harsh    treatment for a while looking forward to revenge when    their time comes but i shall soon have made sure of my    throne or shall have failed and in either case shall    cease to care for mahomet m by bullying him and by    treating him as dust beneath my feet i can do something    to show how proud i am and how sure i am of success he    offers me moneynot paid money down which would have    certain allurements i shouldnt take it i neednt    tell you that i should like to have plenty of loose    sovereigns so as to hire broughams from the yard instead    of walking or going in a bus about london which is very    upsetting to my pride father and i go down to the theatre    in a hansom when we feel ourselves quite smart but it    isnt money like that which he offers he wants to pay me    a month in advance and suggests that i shall get into    debt and come to him to get me out of it there was some    talk of papa going to new york for a few weeks and he    said he would come and look after me in his absence    thank you mr moss i said but im not sure i should    want any looking after only for such as you those are    the very words i spoke and i looked him full in the face    why what do you expect from me he said insult i    replied as bold as brass and then we are playing the    two lovers at the embankment isnt it a pretty family    history he said nothing at the moment but came back in    half an hour to make some unnecessary remarks about the    part why did you say just now that i insulted you    he asked because you do i replied never never    he exclaimed with most grotesque energy i have never    insulted you you know my dear he has twenty times    endeavoured to kiss my hand and once he saw fit to stroke    my hair beast if you knew the sort of feeling i have for    himsuch as you would have if you found a cockroach in    your dressingcase of course in our life young women have    to put up with this kind of thing and some of them like    it but he knows that i am going to be married or at any    rate am engaged mr frank i make constant use of your    name telling everybody that i am the future mrs jones    putting such weight upon the jones with me he knows that    it is an insult but i dont want to quarrel with him if    i can help it and therefore i softened it down you hear    me say mr moss that im an engaged young woman knowing    that you oughtnt to speak to me as you do why what    do i say you should have seen his grin as he asked me    such a leer of triumph as though he knew that he were    getting the better of me mr jones wouldnt approve    if he were to see it but luckily he dont said my    admirer oh if you knew how willingly id stand at a    tub and wash your shirts while the very touch of his    gloves makes me creep all over with horror let us have    peace for the future i said i dislike all those    familiarities if you will only give them up we shall    go on like a house on fire then the beast made an    attempt to squeeze my hand as he went out of the room    i retreated however behind the table and escaped    untouched on that occasion     you are not to come over whatever happens until i tell    you you ought to know very well by this time that i can    fight my battles by myself and if you did come there    would be an end altogether to the £200 which i am earning    to give him his due hes very punctual with his money    only that he wants to pay me in advance which i will    never have he has been liberal about my dresses telling    me to order just what i want and have the bill sent in    to the costume manager when i have worn them they become    the property of the theatre god help any poor young woman    that will ever be expected to get into them so now you    know exactly how i am standing with mahomet m m     poor father goes about to public meetings but never is    allowed to open his mouth for fear he should say something    about the queen i dont mean that he is really watched    but he promised in ireland not to lecture any more if they    would let him go and he wishes to keep his word but i    fear it makes him very unhappy he has at any rate the    comfort of coming home and giving me the lecture which    he ought to have delivered to more sympathetic ears not    but what i do care about the people only how am i to    know whether they ought to be allowed to make their own    petticoats or why it is that they dont do so he says    its the london parliament and that if they had members    in college green the young women would go to work at    once and make petticoats for all the world i dont    understand it and wish that he had someone else to    lecture to     how are you getting on with all your own pet troubles is    the little subsiding lake at ballintubber still a lake    and what about poor florian and his religion has he told    up as yet i fear i fear that poor florian has been    fibbing and that there will be no peace for him or for    your father till the truth has been told     now sir i have told you everything just as a young    woman ought to tell her future lord and master you    say you ought to know what moss is doing you do know    exactly as far as i can tell you of course you wouldnt    like to see him but then you have the comfort of knowing    that i dont like it either i suppose it is a comfort    eh my bold young man of course you want me to hate the    pig and i do hate him you may be sure that i will get    rid of him as soon as i conveniently can but for the    present he is a necessary evil if you had a home to give    me i would come to itoh so readily there is something    in the glitter of a theatrewhat people call the boards    the gaslights the music the mock lovemaking the    pretence of being somebody the feeling of mystery which    is attached to you and the feeling you have that you are    generally unlike the world at largewhich has its charms    even your name blazoned in a dirty playbill without any    mister or mistress to guard you so unlike the ways of    ordinary life does gratify ones vanity i cant say why    it should be so but it is i always feel a little prouder    of myself when father is not with me i am miss omahony    looking after myself whereas other young ladies have to    be watched it has its attractions     butbut to be the wife of frank jones and to look after    franks little house and to cook for him his chicken and    his bacon and to feel that i am all the world to him and    to think but oh frank i cannot tell you what things    i think i do feel as i think them that i have not been    made to stand long before the glare of the gas and that    the time will certainly come when i shall walk about    ballintubber leaning on your arm and hearing all your    future troubles about rents not paid and waters that have    come in     your own own girl     rachel omahony     chapter ix  black daly   frank jones received his letter just as he was about to leave castle morony for the meet at ballytowngal the seat as everybody knows of sir nicholas bodkin ballytowngal is about two miles from claregalway on the road to oranmore sir nicholas is known all through the west of ireland as a sporting man and is held in high esteem but there is i think something different in the estimation which he now enjoys from that which he possessed twenty years ago he was then as now a roman catholicas were also his wife and children and as a roman catholic he was more popular with the lower classes and with the priests who are their natural friends than with his brother grandjurors of the country who were for the most part protestants  sir nicholas is now sixty years old and when he came to the title at thirty he was regarded certainly as a poor mans friend he always lived on the estate he rarely went up to dublin except for a fortnight when the hunting was over and when he paid his respects to the lord lieutenant the house at ballytowngal was said in those days to be as well kept up as any mansion in county galway but the saying came probably from those who were not intimate in the more gloriously maintained mansions sir nicholas had £5000 a year and though he did manage to pay his bills annually spent every shilling of it he preserved his foxes loyally and was quite as keen about the fishing of a little river that he owned and which ran down from his demesne into lough corrib he was particular also about his snipe and would boast that in a little spinney at ballytowngal were to be met the earliest woodcock found in the west of ireland he was a thorough sportsmanbut a roman catholicand as a roman catholic he was hardly equal in standing to some of his protestant neighbours he voted for major stackpoole when major stackpoole stood for the county on the liberal interest and was once requested to come forward himself and stand for the city as a roman catholic this he did not do being a prudent man but at that period from twenty to thirty years ago he was certainly regarded as inferior to a protestant by many of the protestant gentlemen of the country  but things are changed now sir nicholass neighbours such of them at least that are protestants regard sir nicholas as equal to themselves they do not care much for his religion but they know that he is not a homeruler or latterly since the land league sprang into existence a land leaguer he is in fact one of themselves as a county gentleman and the question of religion has gone altogether into abeyance had you known the county thirty years ago and had now heard sir nicholas talking of county matters you would think that he was one of the old protestants it was so that the rich people regarded himand so also the poor but sir nicholas had not varied at all he liked to get his rents paid and as long as his tenants would pay them he was at one with them they had begun now to have opinions of their own upon the subject and he was at one with them no longer  frank jones had heard in galway that there was to be a difficulty about drawing the ballytowngal coverts the hounds were to be allowed to draw the demesne coverts but beyond that they were to be interrupted foxes seldom broke from ballytowngal or if they did they ran to moytubber at moytubber the hounds would probably changeor would do so if allowed to continue their sport in peace but at moytubber the row would begin knowing this frank jones was anxious to leave his home in time as he was aware that the hounds would be carried on to moytubber as quickly as possible black daly had sworn a solemn oath that he would draw moytubber in the teeth of every homeruler and land leaguer in county galway  a word or two must be said descriptive of black daly as he was called the master of the galway hounds they used to be called the galway blazers but the name had nearly dropped out of fashion since black daly had become their master a quarter of a century since who black daly was or whence he had come many men even in county galway did not know it was not that he had no property but that his property was so small as to make it seem improbable that the owner of it should be the master of the county hounds but in truth black daly lived at dalys bridge in the neighbourhood of castle blakeney when he was supposed to be at home and the house in which he lived he had undoubtedly inherited from his father but he was not often there and kept his kennels at ahaseragh five miles away from dalys bridge much was not therefore known of mr daly in his own house  but in the field no man was better known or more popular if thorough obedience is an element of popularity the old gentry of the county could tell why mr daly had been put into his present situation fiveandtwenty years ago but the manner of his election was not often talked about he had no money and very few acres of his own on which to preserve foxes he had never done anything to earn a shilling since he had been born unless he may have been said to have earned shillings by his present occupation as he got his living out of it he certainly may have been said to have done so he never borrowed a shilling from any man and certainly paid his way but if he told a young man that he ought to buy a horse the young man certainly bought it and if he told a young man that he must pay a certain price the young man generally paid it but if the young man were not ready with his money by the day fixed that young man generally had a bad time of it young men have been known to be driven not only out of county galway but out of ireland itself by the tone of mr dalys voice and by the blackness of his frown and yet it was said generally that neither young men nor old men were injured in their dealings with mr daly that horse wont be much the worse for his splint and hes worth £70 to you because you can ride him ten stone you had better give me £70 for him then the young man would promise the £70 in three months time and if he kept his word would swear by black daly ever afterwards in this way mr daly sold a great many horses  but he had been put into his present position because he hunted the hounds during the illness of a distant cousin who was the then master the master had died but the county had the best sport that winter that it had ever enjoyed i dont see why i should not do it as well as another tom daly had said he was then known as tom daly youve got no money his cousin had said the son of the old gentleman who was just dead it was well understood that the cousin wished to have the hounds but that he was thought not to have all the necessary attributes i suppose the county means to pay for all sport said tom then the hat went round and an annual sum of £900 a year was voted since that the hounds have gone on and the bills have been paid and tom has raised the number of days hunting to four a week or has lowered it to two according to the amount of money given he makes no proposition now but declares what he means to do things are dearer he said last year and you wont have above five days a fortnight unless you can make the money up to £1200 i want £400 a day and £400 i must have the county had then voted him the money in the plenitude of its power and daly had hunted seven days a fortnight but all the galway world felt that there was about to be a fall  black daly was a man quite as dark as his sobriquet described him he was tall but very thin and bony and seemed not to have an ounce of flesh about his face or body he had large black whiskerscoarse and jet blackwhich did not quite meet beneath his chin and he wore no other beard no tuft no imperial no moustachios but when he was seen before shaving on a morning he would seem to be black all over and his hair was black short and harsh and though black round about his ears it was beginning to be tinged with grey he was now over fifty years of age but the hair on his head was as thick as it had been when he first undertook the hounds he had great dark eyes in his head deep down so that they seemed to glitter at you out of caverns and above them were great bushy eyebrows every hair of which seemed to be black and harsh and hard his nose was wellformed and prominent but of cheeks he had apparently none between his whiskers and his nose and the corners of his mouth there was nothing but two hollow cavities he was somewhat over six feet high but from his extraordinary thinness gave the appearance of much greater height his arms were long and the waistcoat which he wore was always long his breeches were very long and his boots seemed the longest thing about himunless his spurs seemed longer he had no flesh about him and it was boasted of him that in spite of his length and in spite of his height he could ride under twelve stone of himself and of his doings he never talked they were secrets of his own of which he might have to make money and no one had a right to ask him questions he did not conceive that it would be necessary for a gentleman to declare his weight unless he were about to ride a race now it was understood that for the last ten years black daly had ridden no races  he was a man of whom it might be said that he never joked though his life was devoted in a peculiar manner to sport and there may be thought to be something akin between the amusements and the lightness of life it was all serious to him though he was bitter over it or happy triumphant or occasionally in despairas when the money was not forthcominghe never laughed it was all serious to him and apparently sad from the first note of a hound in the early covert down to the tidings that a poor fox had been found poisoned near his earth he had much to do to find sport for the county on such limited means and he was always doing it  he not only knew every hound in his pack but he knew their ages their sires and their dams and the sires and the dams of most of their sires and dams he knew the constitution of each and to what extent their noses were to be trusted its a very heavy scent today he would say because gaylap carries it over the plough its only a catching scent because the drops dont hang on the bushes his lore on all such matters was incredible but he would never listen to any argument a man had a right to his own opinion but then the man who differed from him knew nothing he gave out his little laws to favoured individuals not by way of conversation for which he cared nothing but because it might be well that the favoured individual should know the truth on that occasion  as a man to ride he was a complete master of his art there was nothing which a horse could do with a man on his back which daly could not make him do and when he had ridden a horse he would know exactly what was within his power but there was no desire with him for the showing off of a horse he often rode to sell a horse but he never seemed to do so he never rode at difficult places unless driven to do so by the exigencies of the moment he was always quiet in the field unless when driven to express himself as to the faults of some young man then he could blaze forth in his anger with great power he was constantly to be seen trotting along a road when hounds were running because he had no desire to achieve for himself a character for hard riding but he was always with his hounds when he was wanted and it was boasted of him that he had ridden four days a week through the season on three horses and had never lamed one of them he was rarely known to have a second horse out and when he did so it was for some purpose peculiar to the days work on such days he had generally a horse to sell  it is hardly necessary to say that black daly was an unmarried man no one who knew him could conceive that he should have had a wife his hounds were his children and he could have taught no wife to assist him in looking after them with the constant attention and tender care which was given to them by barney smith his huntsman a wife had she seen to the feeding of the numerous babies would have given them too much to eat and had she not undertaken this care she would have been useless at dalys bridge but barney smith was invaluable double the amount of work got usually from a huntsman was done by him there was no kennel man no second horseman no studgroom at the ahaseragh kennels it may be said that black daly filled all these positions himself and that in each barney smith was his first lieutenant circumstances had given him the use of the ahaseragh kennels which had been the property of his cousin and circumstances had not enabled him to build others at dalys bridge gradually he had found it easier to move himself than the hounds and so it had come to pass that two rooms had been prepared for him close to the kennels and that mr barney smith gave him such attendance as was necessary of strictly personal attendance black daly wanted very little but the discomforts of that home while one pair of breeches were supposed to be at dalys bridge and the others at ahaseragh were presumed by the world at large to be very grievous  but the personal appearance of mr daly on hunting mornings was not a matter of indifference it was not that he wore beautiful pink tops or came out guarded from the dust by little aprons or had his cravat just out of the bandbox or his scarlet coat always new and in the latest fashion nor had his hat just come from the shop in piccadilly with the newest twist to its rim but there was something manly and even powerful about his whole apparel he was always the same so that by men even in his own county he would hardly have been known in other garments the strong broad brimmed high hat with the cord passing down his back beneath his coat that had known the weather of various winters the dark red coat with long swallow tails which had grown nearly black under many storms the dark buff striped waistcoat with the stripes running downwards long so as to come well down over his breeches the breeches themselves which were always of leather but which had become nearly brown under the hands of barney smith or his wife and the mahogany topboots of which the tops seemed to be a foot in length could none of them have been worn by any but black daly his very spurs must have surely been made for him they were in length and weight and general strength of leather so peculiarly his own he was unlike other masters of hounds in this that he never carried a horn but he spoke to his hounds in a loud indistinct chirruping voice which all county galway believed to be understood to every hound in the park  one other fact must be told respecting mr daly he was a protestantas opposed to a roman catholic no one had ever known him go to church or speak a word in reference to religion he was equally civil or uncivil to priest and parson when priest or parson appeared in the field but on no account would he speak to either of them if he could avoid it but he had in his heart a thorough conviction that all roman catholics ought to be regarded as enemies by all protestants and that the feeling was one entirely independent of faith and prayerbooks or crosses and masses for him foxhuntingfoxhunting for otherswas the work of his life and he did not care to meddle with what he did not understand but he was a protestant and sir nicholas bodkin was a roman catholic and therefore an enemyas a dog may be supposed to declare himself a dog and a cat a cat if called upon to explain the cause for the old family quarrel  now there had come a cloud over his spirit in reference to the state of his country he could see that the quarrel was not entirely one between protestant and catholic as it used to be but still he could not get it out of his mind but that the old causes were producing in a different way their old effects whiteboys terryalts ribbonmen repeaters physicalforcemen fenians homerulers professors of dynamite and americanirish were to his thinking all the same he never talked much about it because he did not like to expose his ignorance but his convictions were not the less formed it was the business of a protestant to take rent and of a roman catholic to pay rent there were certain deviations in this ordained rule of life but they were only exceptions the roman catholics had the worst of this position and the protestants the best therefore the roman catholics were of course quarrelling with it and therefore the roman catholics must be kept down such had been mr dalys general outlook into life but now the advancing evil of the time was about to fall even upon himself and upon his beneficent labours done for the world at large it was whispered in county galway that the people were about to rise and interfere with foxhunting it may be imagined that on this special day mr dalys heart was low beneath his blackstriped waistcoat as he rode on his way to draw the coverts at ballytowngal  at the crossroads of monivea he met peter bodkin the eldest son of sir nicholas now peter bodkin had quarrelled long and very bitterly with his father every acre of the property at ballytowngal was entailed upon him and peter had thought that under such circumstances his father was not doing enough for him the quarrel had been made up but still the evil rankled in peters bosom who was driven to live with his wife and family on £500 a year and had found himself hardly driven to keep himself out of the hands of the jews his father had wished him to follow some profession but this had been contrary to peters idea of what was becoming but though he had only £500 a year and five children he did manage to keep two horses and saw a good deal of hunting  and among all the hunting men in county galway he was the one who lived on the closest terms of intimacy with black daly for though he was a roman catholic his religion did not trouble him much and he was undoubtedly on the same side with daly in the feuds that were coming on the country indeed he and daly had entertained the same feelings for some years for in the quarrels which had been rife between the father and son mr daly had taken the sons part as far as so silent a man can be said to have taken any part at all  well peter well daly were the greetings as the two men met and then they rode on together in silence for a mile have you heard what the boys are going to do asked the master peter shook his head i suppose theres nothing in it  i fear there is  what will they do asked mr daly  just prevent your hunting  if they touch me or either of the men by god ill shoot some of them then he put his hand into his pocket as much as to explain a pistol was there after that the two men rode on in silence till they came to the gates of ballytowngal     chapter x  ballytowngal   daly among other virtues or vices was famed for punctuality he wore a large silver watch in his pocket which was as true as the sun or at any rate was believed by its owner to be so from dalys watch on hunting mornings there was no appeal he always reached the appointed meet at five minutes before eleven by his watch and by his watch the hounds were always moved from their haunches at five minutes past eleven though the lord lieutenant and the chief secretary and the lord chancellor had been there there would have been no deviation the interval of ten minutes he generally spent in whispered confabulations with the earthwarners secrets into which no attendant horseman ever dived for black daly was a mysterious man who did not choose to be inquired into as to his movements on this occasion he said not a word to any earthwarner though two were in attendance but he sat silent and more gloomy than ever on his big black horse waiting for the minutes to pass by till he should be able to run his hounds through the ballytowngal coverts and then hurry on to moytubber  mr dalys mind was in truth fixed upon moytubber and what would there be done this morning he was a simpleminded man who kept his thoughts fixed for the most part on one object he knew that it was his privilege to draw the coverts of moytubber and to hunt the country around and he felt also after some gallant fashion that it was his business to protect the rights of others in the pursuit of their favourite amusement no man could touch him or either of his servants in the way of violence without committing an offence which he would be bound to oppose by violence he was no lawyer and understood not at all the statutes as fixed upon the subject if a man laid a hand upon him violently and would not take his hand off again when desired he would be entitled to shoot that man such was the law as in his simplicity and manliness he believed it to exist he was a man not given to pistols but when he heard that he was to be stopped in his hunting on this morning and stopped by dastardly pernicious curs who called themselves landleaguers he went into ballinasloe and bought himself a pistol black daly was a sad serious man who could not put up with the frivolities of life to whom the necessity of providing for that large family of children was very serious but he was not of his nature a quarrelsome man but now he was threatened on the tenderest point and with much simpler thought had resolved that it would be his duty to quarrel  but just when he had spoken the word on which barney and the hounds were prepared to move sir nicholas trotted up to him sir nicholas and all the sporting gentlemen of county galway were there whispering with each other having collected themselves in crowds much bigger than usual there was much whispering and many opinions had been given as to the steps which it would be well that the hunt should take if interrupted in their sport but at last peter bodkin had singled out his father and had communicated to him the fact of black dalys pistol hell use it as sure as eggs are eggs said peter whispering to his father  then therell be murder said sir nicholas who though a good hunting neighbour had never been on very friendly terms with mr daly  when tom daly says hell do a thing he means to do it said peter he wont be stopped by my calling it murder then sir nicholas had quickly discussed the matter with sundry other sportsmen of the neighbourhood there were mr persse of doneraile and mr blake of letterkenny and lord ardrahan and sir jasper lynch of bohernane during the ten minutes that were allowed to them they put their heads together and with much forethought made mr persse their spokesman lord ardrahan and sir jasper might have seemed to take upon themselves an authority which daly would not endure and blake of letterkenny would have been too young to carry with him sufficient weight sir nicholas himself was a roman catholic and was peters father and peter would have been in a scrape for having told the story of the pistol so mr persse put himself forward daly he said trotting up to the master im afraid were going to encounter a lot of these landleaguers at moytubber  what do they want at moytubber nobody is doing anything to them  of course not they are a set of miserable ruffians im sorry to say that there are a lot of my tenants among them but its no use discussing that now  i can only go on said daly as though they were in bed then he put his hand in his pocket and felt that the pistol was there  mr persse saw what he did and knew that his hand was on the pistol we have only a minute now to decide he said  to decide what asked daly  there must be no violence on our side daly turned round his face upon him and looked at him from the bottom of those two dark caverns believe me when i say it there must be no violence on our side  if they attempt to stop my horse  there must be no violence on our side to bring us or rather you to further grief  by god id shoot the man who did it said daly  no no let there be no shooting were you to do so there can be no doubt that you would be tried by a jury and  hanged said daly may be so i have got to look that in the face it is an accursed country in which we are living  but you would not encounter the danger in carrying out a trifling amusement such as this  daly again turned round and looked at him was this work of his life this employment on which he was so conscientiously eager to be called trifling did they know the thoughts which it cost him the hard work by which it was achieved the days and nights which were devoted to it trifling amusement to him it was the work of his life to those around him it was the best part of theirs  i will not interfere with them daly said  he alluded here to the enemies of hunting generally he had not hunted the country so long without having had many rows with many men farmers angry with him for the moment had endeavoured to stop him as he rode upon their land and they had poisoned his foxes from revenge or stolen them from cupidity he had borne with such men expressing the severity of his judgment chiefly by the look of his eyes but he had never quarrelled with them violently they had been contemptible people whom it would be better to look at than to shoot but here were men coming or were there now prepared to fight with him for his rights and he would fight with them even though hanging should be the end of it  i will not interfere with them unless they interfere with me  have you a pistol with you daly said persse  i have  then give it me  not so if i want to use a pistol it will be better to have it in my own pocket than in yours if i do not want to use it i can keep it myself and no one will be the wiser  listen to me daly  well mr persse  do not call me mr persse as though you were determined to quarrel with me it will be well that you should take advice in this matter from those whom you have known all your life there is sir nicholas bodkin  he may be one of them for all that i can tell said daly  lord ardrahan is not one of them and sir jasper lynch and blake of letterkenny they are all there if you will speak to them in such a matter as this it is not worth your while to get into serious trouble to you and me hunting is a matter of much importance but the world at large will not regard it as one in which blood should be shed they will come prepared to make themselves disagreeable but if there be bloodshed it will simply be by your hands and think what an injury you would do to your side of the question and what a benefit to theirs  how so  we are regarded as the dominant party as gentlemen who ought to do what is right and support the laws  if i am attacked may i not defend myself  no not by a pistol carried loaded into a huntingfield you would have all the world against you  then the two men rode on silently together the hounds were drawing the woods of ballytowngal but had not found and were prepared to go on to moytubber but according to the galway custom barney smith was waiting for orders from his master daly now sat stock still upon his horse for awhile looking at the dark fringe of trees by which the park was surrounded he was thinking as well as he knew how to think of the position in which he was placed to be driven to go contrary to his fixed purpose by fear was a course intolerable to him but to have done that which was clearly injurious to his party was as bad and this persse to whom he had shown his momentary anger by calling him mr was a man whom he greatly regarded there was no one in the field whose word would go further with him in hunting matters he had clearly been rightly chosen as a deputation but daly knew that as he had gone to bed the previous night and as he had got up in the morning and as he had trotted along by monivea crossroads and had met peter bodkin every thought of his mind had been intent on the pistol within his pocket to shoot a man who should lay hold of him or his horse or endeavour to stop his horse had seemed to him to be bare justice but he had resolved that he would first give some spoken warning to the sinner after that god help the man for he would find no help in black tom daly  but now his mind was shaken by the admonitions of mr persse he could not say of mr persse as he had said most unjustly of sir nicholas that he was one of them mr persse was wellknown as a tory and a protestant and an indefatigable opponent of homerulers to sir nicholas in the minds of some men there attached a slight stain of his religion i will keep the pistol in my pocket said tom daly without turning his eyes away from the belt of trees  had you not better trust it with me said mr persse  no i am not such an idiot as to shoot a man when i do not intend it  seeing how moved you are i thought that perhaps the pistol might be safer in my hands  no the pistol shall remain with me then he turned round to join barney smith who was waiting for him up by the gate out of the covert but he turned again to say a word to mr persse thank you persse i am obliged to you it might be inconvenient being locked up before the season is over then a weird grin covered his face which was the nearest approach to laughter ever seen with black tom daly  from ballytowngal to moytubber was about a mile and a half some few during the conversation between mr persse and the master had gone on so that they might be the first to see what was in store for them but the crowd of horsemen had remained with their eyes fixed upon daly he rode up to them and passed on without speaking a word except that he gave the necessary orders to barney smith then two or three clustered round mr persse asking him whispered questions itll be all right said persse nodding his head and so the cortège passed on but not a word was spoken by daly himself either then or afterwards except a whispered order or two given to barney smith moytubber is a gorse covert lying about three hundred yards from the road and through it the horsemen always passed on other occasions it was locked now the gate had been taken off its hinges and thrown back upon the bank and daly as he passed into the field perceived that the covert was surrounded by a crowd     chapter xi  moytubber   whats all this about said tom as he rode up the covert side and addressing a man whose face he happened to know he was one kit mooney a baker from claregalway who in these latter days had turned landleaguer but he was one who simply thought that his bread might be better buttered for him on that side of the question he was not an ardent politician but few local irishmen were so had no stirring spirits been wafted across the waters from america to teach irishmen that one man is as good as another or generally better kit mooney would never have found it out had not his zeal been awakened by the eloquence of mr omeagher the member for athlone who had just made a grand speech to the people at athenry kit mooney would have gone on in his old ways and would at this moment have been touching his hat to tom daly and whispering to him of the fox that had lately been seen staling away jist there mr daly fore amost yer very eyes but mr omeagher had spent three glorious weeks in new york and having practised the art of speaking on board the steamer as he returned had come to athenry and filled the mind of kit mooney and sundry others with political truth of the deepest dye but the gist of the truths so taught had been chiefly thisthat if a man did not pay his rent but kept his money in his pocket he manifestly did two good things he enriched himself and he so far pauperised the landlord who was naturally his enemy what other teaching could be necessary to make kit understandkit mooney who held twenty acres of meadow land convenient to the town of claregalwaythat this was the way to thrive in the world rent is not known in america that great and glorious country every man owns the fields which he cultivates why should you here allow yourself to be degraded by the unmanly name of tenants the earth which supports you should be as free to you as the air you breathe such had been the eloquence of mr omeagher and it had stirred the mind of kit mooney and made him feel that life should be recommenced by him under new principles things had not quite gone swimmingly with him since because nicholas bodkins agent had caused a sheriffs bailiff to appear upon the scene and the notion of keeping the landlords rent in the pocket had been found to be surrounded with difficulties but the great principle was there and there had come another eloquent man who had also been in america and kit mooney was now a confirmed landleaguer  faix thin yer honour it isnt much hunting the quality will see this day out of moytubber nor yet nowhere round av the boys are as good as their word  why should they not hunt at moytubber said mr daly who as he looked around saw indeed ample cause why there should be no hunting he had thought as he trotted along the road that some individual landleaguer would hold his horse by the rein and cause him to stop him in the performance of his duty but there were two hundred footmen there roaming at will through the sacred precincts of the gorse and daly knew well that no fox could have remained there with such a crowd around him  the boys are just taking their pleasure themselves this fine christmas morning said kit who had not moved from the bank on which he had been found sitting begorra youll find em all out about the counthry intirely mr daly theyre out to make your honour welcome there is lashings of em across in phil frenchs woods and all down to peter browns away at oranmore there is not a boy in the barony but what is out to bid yer honour welcome this morning  kit mooney could not have given a more exact account of what was being done by the boys on that morning had he owned all those rich gifts of eloquence which mr omeagher possessed tom daly at once saw that there was no need for shooting any culprit and was thankful the interruption to the sport of the county had become much more general than he had expected and it was apparently so organised as to have spread itself over all that portion of county galway in which his hounds ran bedad mr daly what kit says is thrue said another man whom he did not know youll find em out everywhere why aint the boys to be having their fun  it was useless to allow a hound to go into the covert of moytubber the crowd around was waiting anxiously to see the attempt made so that they might enjoy their triumph to watch black tom drawing moytubber without a fox would be nuts to them and then to follow the hounds on to the next covert and to the next with the same result would afford them an ample days amusement but the bodkins and the blakes and the persses were quite alive to this and so also was tom daly a council of war was therefore held in order that the line of conduct might be adopted which might be held to be most conducive to the general dignity of the hunt  i should send the hounds home said lord ardrahan if mr daly would call at my place and lunch as he goes by i should be most happy  tom daly on hearing this only shook his head the shake was intended to signify that he did not like the advice tendered nor the accompanying hospitable offer to go home would be to throw down their arms at once and acknowledge themselves beaten if beaten today why should they not be beaten on another day and then what would become of tom dalys employment a sad idea came across his mind as he shook his head warning him that in this terrible affair of today he might see the end of all his lifes work such a thought had never occurred to him before if a crowd of disloyal roman catholics chose to prevent the gentry in their hunting undoubtedly they had the power daly was slow at thinking but an idea when it had once come home to him struck him forcibly as he shook his head at that moment he bethought himself what would become of black daly if the people of the county refused to allow his hounds to run and a second idea struck himthat he certainly would not lunch with lord ardrahan lord ardrahan was to his thinking somewhat pompous and had been felt by tom to expect that he tom should acknowledge the inferiority of his position by his demeanour now such an idea as this was altogether in opposition to toms mode of living even though the hounds were to be taken away from him and he were left at dalys bridge with the £200 a year which had come to him from his father he would make no such acknowledgment as that to any gentleman in county galway so he shook his head and said not a word in answer to lord ardrahan  what do you propose to do daly demanded mr persse  go on and draw till night theres a moon and if we can find a fox before ten barney and i will manage to kill him those blackguards cant keep on with us this was dalys plan spoken out within hearing of many of the blackguards  you had better take my offer and come to ardrahan castle said his lordship  no my lord said daly with the tone of authority which a master of hounds always knows how to assume  i shall draw on barney get the hounds together then he whispered to barney smith that the hounds should go on to kilcornan now kilcornan was a place much beloved by foxes about ten miles distant from moytubber it was not among the coverts appointed to be drawn on that day which all lay back towards ahaseragh at kilcornan the earths would be found to open but it would be better to trot off rapidly to some distant home for foxes even though the days sport might be lost daly was very anxious that it should not be said through the country that he had been driven home by a set of roughs from any one covert or another the days draw would be knownthe line of the country that is which in the ordinary course of things he would follow on that day but by going to kilcornan he might throw them off his scent so he started for kilcornan having whispered his orders to barney smith but communicating his intentions to no one else  what will you do daly said sir jasper lynch  go on  but where will you go inquired the baronet he was a man about dalys age with whom daly was on comfortable terms he had no cause for being crabbed with sir jasper as with lord ardrahan but he did not want to declare his purpose to any man there is no one in the ordinary work of his life so mysterious as a master of hounds and among masters no one was more mysterious than tom daly and this too was no ordinary day tom only shook his head and trotted on in advance his secret had been told only to barney smith and with barney smith he knew that it would be safe  so they all trotted off at a pace much faster than usual whats up with black tom now asked sir nicholas of sir jasper whats daly up to now asked mr blake of mr persse they all shook their heads and declared themselves willing to follow their leader without further inquiry i suppose he knows what hes about said mr persse but we at any rate must go and see so they followed him and in half an hours time it became apparent that they were going to kilcornan  but at kilcornan they found a crowd almost equal to that which had stopped them at moytubber kilcornan is a large demesne into which they would in the ordinary course have made their entrance through the lodge gate at present they went at once to an outlying covert which was supposed to be especially the abode of foxes but even here as barney trotted up with his hounds at a pace much quicker than usual they found that the ground before them had been occupied by landleaguers youll not do much in the hunting way today muster daly said one of the intruders when we heard you were acoming we had a little hunt of our own there aint a fox anywhere about the place now muster daly tom daly turned round and sat on his big black horse frowning at the world before him a sorrowful man what shall we do next it does not behove a master of hounds to seek counsel in difficulty from anyone a man if he is master should be sufficient to himself in all emergencies no man felt this more clearly than did black tom daly he had been ashamed of himself once this morning because he had taken advice from mr persse but now he must think the matter out for himself and follow his own devices  it was as yet only two oclock but he had come on at a great pace taking much more out of his horse than was usual to him on such occasions but sitting there he did make up his mind he would go on to mr lamberts place at clare and would draw the coverts going there as fast as the horses legs would carry him there he would borrow two horses if it were possible but one at least for barney smith then he would draw back by impossible routes to the kennels at ahaseragh men might come with him or might go but to none would he tell his mind if providence would only send him a fox on the route all things he thought might still be well with him it would be odd if he and barney smith between them were not able to give an account of that fox when they had done with him but if he should find no such foxif he the master of the galway hounds should have ridden backwards and forwards across county galway and have been impeded altogether in his efforts by wretched landleaguers thenas he thoughta final day would have to come for him  he spoke no word to anyone but he did go on just as he proposed to himself he drew clare but drew it blank and then leaving his own horses he borrowed two others for himself and barney and went on upon his route before the day was overor rather before the night was far advancedhe had borrowed three others in his course about the country for himself and his servants quick as lightning he went from covert to covert but the conspiracy had been well arranged and a holiday for the foxes in county galway was established for that day some men were very stanch to him going with him whither they knew not so that poor dear tom might not be left alone but alone he was during the long evening of that day as far as all conversation went he spoke to no one except to barney and to him only a few words giving him a direction as to where he should go next and into what covert he should put the hounds they too must have been much surprised and very weary as they dragged their tired limbs to their kennel at about eight oclock and tom dalys ride across the country will long be remembered and the exertions which he made to find a fox on that day  but it was all in vain as tom ate his solitary muttonchop and drank his cold whisky and water and then took himself to bed he was a melancholy man the occupation of his life he thought was gone these reprobates whom he now hated worse than ever having learned their powers to disturb the amusements of their betters would never allow another days hunting in the county he was aware now though he never had thought of it before by how weak a hold his right of hunting the country was held he and his hounds could go into any covert but so also could any other man with or without hounds to disturb a fox three or four men would suffice one would suffice according to toms idea of a fox the occupation of his life was over  tom daly was by nature a melancholy man all county galway knew that he was a man not given to many words by no means devoted to sport in the ordinary sense it was a hard business that he had undertaken the work was in every sense hard and the payment made was very small in fact no payment was made other than that of his being lifted into a position in which he was able to hold his head high among gentlemen of property what should he do with himself during the remainder of his life if hunting in county galway was brought to an end he was an intent eager man whom it was hard to teach that the occupations of his life were less worthy than those of other men but there had come moments of doubt as he had sat alone in his little room at ahaseragh and had meditated whether the pursuit of vermin was worthy all the energy which he had given to it  you may sell those brutes of yours now and then perhaps youll be able to educate your children so sir nicholas bodkin had addressed his eldest son as they rode home together on that occasion  why so peter had asked thinking more of the brutes alluded to than of the children he was accustomed to the tone of his fathers remarks and cared for them not more than the ordinary son cares for the expression of the ordinary fathers ill humour but now he knew that some reference was intended to the interruption that had been made in their days sport and was anxious to learn what his father thought about it why so he asked  because you wont want them for this game any longer hunting is done with in these parts when a blackguard like kit mooney is able to address such a one as tom daly after that fashion anything that requires respect may be said to be over hunting has existed solely on respect i had intended to buy that mare of frenchs but i shant now  what does all that mean lynch said mr persse to sir jasper as they rode home together  it means quarrelling to the knife  in a quarrel to the knife said mr persse all lighter things must be thrown away daly had brought a pistol in his pocket as you heard this morning i have been thinking of it ever since and putting two and two together it seems to me to be almost impossible that hunting should go on in county galway     chapter xii  dont hate him ada   among those who had gone as far as mr lamberts but had not proceeded further had been frank jones he had heard and seen what has been narrated and was as much impressed as others with the condition of the country the populace generallyfor so it had seemed to behad risen en masse to put down the amusement of the gentry and there had been a secret conspiracy so that they had been able to do the same thing in different parts of the county frank as he rode back to morony castle a long way from mr lamberts covert was very melancholy in his mind the persecution of mahomet m moss and of the landleaguers together was almost too much for him  when he got home his father also was melancholy and the girls were melancholy what sport have you had frank said the father but he asked the question in a melancholy tone simply as being one which the son expects on returning from hunting in this expectation mr jones gave way frank shook his head but did not utter a word  what do you mean by that asked the father  the whole country is in arms this no doubt was an exaggeration as the only arms that had been brought to moytubber on the occasion had been the pistol in tom dalys pocket  in arms said philip jones  well yes i call it so i call men in arms when they are prepared to carry out any illegal purpose by violence and these men have done that all through the county galway  what have they done  you know where the meet was well they drew ballytowngal and found no fox there it was not expected and nothing happened there the people did not come into old nick bodkins demesne but we had heard by the time that we were there that we should come across a lot of landleaguers at moytubber there they were as thick as bees round the covert and there was one man who had the impudence to tell tom daly that draw where he might he would draw in vain for a fox today in county galway  do you mean that there was a crowd asked mr jones  a crowd yes all claregalway seemed to have turned out claregalway is not much of a place but everyone was there from oranmore and from athenry and half the town from galway city this certainly was an exaggeration on the part of frank but was excused by his desire to impress his father with the real truth in the matter i never saw half such a number of people by a covert side but the truth was soon known they had beat moytubber and kicked up such a row as the foxes in that gorse had never heard before and they were not slow in obtaining their object  their object was clear enough  they didnt intend that the hounds should hunt that day either at moytubber or elsewhere daly did not put his hounds into the covert at all but rode away as fast as his horses legs could carry him to kilcornan  that must be ten miles at least said his father  twenty i should think but we rode away at a handgallop leaving the crowd behind us this again was an exaggeration but when we got to the covert at kilcornan there was just the same sort of crowd and just the same work had been on foot the men there all told us that we need not expect to find a fox a rumour had got about the field by this time that tom daly had a loaded pistol in his pocket what he meant to do with it i dont know he could have done no good without a regular massacre  did he show his pistol  i didnt see it but i do believe it was there some of the old fogies were awfully solemn about it  what was the end of it all asked edith who together with her sister was now listening to franks narrative  you know mr lamberts place on the road towards gort its a long way off and im a little out of my latitude there but i went as far as that and found a bigger crowd than ever they said that all gort was there but tom having drawn the covert went on and swore that he wouldnt leave a place in all county galway untried he borrowed fresh horses and went on with barney smith as grim as death he is still drawing his covert somewhere  it was thus that frank jones told the story of that days hunting to his fathers ears it sounded as being very ominous he did not care much for hunting himself nor would it much perplex him if the landleaguers would confine themselves to this mode of operations but as he heard of the crowds surrounding the coverts through the county he thought also of his many acres still under water by the operation of a man who had taken upon himself to be his enemy and the whole morning had been spent in fruitless endeavours to make florian tell the truth the boy had remained surly sullen and silent he will tell me at last edith had said to her father but her father had said that unless the truth were now told he must allow the affair to go by the time for dealing with the matter will be gone he had said pat carroll is going about the country as bold as brass and says that he will fix his own rent whereas i know and all the tenants know that he ought to be in galway jail there isnt a man on the estate who isnt certain that it was he with five or six others who let the waters in upon the meadows  then why on earth cannot you make them tell  they say that they only think it said edith  the very best of them only think it said ada  and there is not one of them said mr jones whom you could trust to put into a witnessbox to tell the truth i do not see what right i have to ask them to go there if i was to select a manor two how can i say to them forget yourself forget your wife and children encounter possible murder and probable ruin in order that i may get my revenge on this man  it is not revenge but justice said frank  it would be revenge to their minds and if it came to pass that there was a man who would thus sacrifice himself to me what must i do with him afterwards were i to send him to america with money and take his land into my own hand see what horrible things would be said of me the sort of witness i want to back up others who would then be made to come is florian  what would they do to him asked edith  i could send him to an english school for a couple of years till all this should have passed by i have thought of that  that too would cost money said ada  of course it would cost money but it would be forthcoming rather than that the boy should be in danger but the feeling to me as to the boy himself comes uppermost it is that he himself should have such a secret in his bosom and keep it there locked fast in opposition to his own father i want to get it out of him while he is yet a boy so that his name shall not go abroad as one who by such manifest falsehood took part against his own father it is the injury done to him rather than the injury done to me  he has promised his priest that he will not tell said edith making what excuse she could for her brother  he has not promised his priest said mr jones he has made no promise to father malachi of ballintubber if he has promised at all it is to that pestilent fellow at headford the curate at headford is not his priest and why should a promise made to any priest be more sacred than one made to another unless it were made in confession i cannot understand florian it seems as though he were anxious to take part with these wretches against his country against his religion and against his father it is unintelligible to me that a boy of his age should at the same time be so precocious and so stupid i have told him that i know him to be a liar and that until he will tell the truth he shall not come into my presence having so spoken the father sat silent while frank went off to dress  it was felt by them all that a terrible decision had been come to in the family a verdict had gone out and had pronounced florian guilty they had all gradually come to think that it was so but now the judge had pronounced the doom the lad was not to be allowed into his presence during the continuance of the present state of things in the first place how was he to be kept out of his fathers presence and the boy was one who would turn mutinous in spirit under such a command the meaning of it was that he should not sit at table with his father but in accordance with the ways of the family he had always done so a separate breakfast must be provided for him and a separate dinner then would there not be danger that he should be driven to look for his friends elsewhere would he not associate with father brosnan or worse again with pat carroll ada said edith that night as they sat together florian must be made to confess  how make him  you and i must do it  thats all very well said ada but how you have been at him now for nine months and have not moved him hes the most obstinate boy i think that ever lived  do you know there is something in it all that makes me love him the better said edith  is there there is something in it that almost makes me hate him  dont hate him adaif you can help it he has got some religious idea into his head it is all stupid  it is beastly said ada  you may call it as you please said the other it is stupid and beastly he is travelling altogether in a wrong direction and is putting everybody concerned with him in immense trouble it may be quite right that a person should be a roman catholicor that he should be a protestant but before one turns from one to the other one should be old enough to know something about it it is very vexatious but with flory there is i think some idea of an idea he has got it into his head that the catholics are a downtrodden people and therefore he will be one of them  that is such bosh said ada  it is so to your thinking but not to his in loving him or hating him youve got to love him or hate him as a boy of course its wicked that a boy should lieor a man or a woman or a girl but they do i dont see why we are to turn against a boy of our own when we know that other boys lie he has got a notion into his head that he is doing quite right because the priest has told him  he is doing quite wrong said ada  and now what are we to do about his breakfast papa says that he is not to be allowed to come into the room and papa means it you and i will have to breakfast with him and dine with him first one and then the other  but papa will miss us  we must go through the ceremony of a second breakfast and a second dinner this was the beginning of ediths scheme of course its a bore all things are bores this about the flood is the most terrible bore i ever knew but im not going to let flory go to the devil without making an effort to save him it would be going to the devil if he were left alone in his present position  papa will see that we dont eat anything  of course he must be told there never ought to be any secrets in anything of course hell grow used to it and wont expect us to sit there always and eat nothing he thinks hes right and perhaps he is flory will feel the weight of his displeasure and if we talk to him we may persuade him  this state of things at morony castle was allowed to go on with few other words said upon the subject the father became more and more gloomy as the floods held their own upon the broad meadows pat carroll had been before the magistrates at headford and had been discharged as all evidence was lacking to connect him with the occurrence further effort none was made and pat carroll went on in his course swearing that not a shilling of rent should be paid by him in next march the floods had done him a great injury he said laughingly among his companions so that it was unreasonable to expect that he should pay it was true he had owed a halfyears rent last november but then it had become customary with mr joness tenants to be allowed the indulgence of six months no more at any rate would be said about rent till march should come  and now superinduced upon this cause of misery had come the tidings which had been spread everywhere through the county in regard to the galway hunt tom daly had gone on regularly with his meets and had not indeed been stopped everywhere his heart had been gladdened by a wonderful run which he had had from carnlough the people had not interfered there and the day had been altogether propitious tom had for the moment been in high good humour but the interruption had come again and had been so repeated as to make him feel that his occupation was in truth gone the gentry of the county had then held a meeting at ballinasloe and had decided that the hounds should be withdrawn for the remainder of the season no one who has not ridden with the hounds regularly can understand the effect of such an order there was no old woman with a turkey in her possession who did not feel herself thereby entitled to destroy the fox who came lurking about her poultryyard nor was there a gentleman who owned a pheasant who did not feel himself animated in some degree by the same feeling as theres to be an end of foxhunting in county galway we can do what we like with our own coverts i shall go in for shooting sir nicholas bodkin had been heard to say  but black tom daly sat alone gloomily in his room at ahaseragh where it suited him still to be present and look after the hounds and told himself that the occupation of his life was gone who would want to buy a horse even now that the chief object for horses was at an end     chapter xiii  ediths eloquence   thus they lived through the months of january and february 1881 at morony castle and florian had not as yet told his secret as a boy his nature had seemed to be entirely altered during the last six months he was thoughtful morose and obstinate to a degree which his father was unable to fathom but during these last two months there had been no intercourse between them it may almost be said that no word had been addressed by either to the other no further kind of punishment had been inflicted indeed the boy enjoyed a much wider liberty than had been given to him before or than was good for him for his father not only gave no orders to him but seldom spoke concerning him it was however a terrible trouble to his mind the fact that his own son should be thus possessed of his own peculiar secret and should continue from month to month hiding it within his own bosom with father malachi mr jones was on good terms but to him he could say nothing on the subject the absurdity of the conversion or perversion of the boy in reference to his religion made mr jones unwilling to speak of him to any roman catholic priest father malachi would no doubt have owned that the boy had been altogether unable to see by his own light the difference between the two religions but he would have attributed the change to the direct interposition of god he would not have declared in so many words that a miracle had been performed in the boys favour but this would have been the meaning of the argument he would have used in fact the gaining of a proselyte under any circumstances would have been an advantage too great to jeopardise by any arguments in the matter the protestant clergyman at headford in whose parish morony castle was supposed to have been situated was a thin bigoted protestant of that kind which used to be common in ireland mr armstrong was a gentleman who held it to be an established fact that a roman catholic must necessarily go to the devil in all the moralities he was perfect he was a married man with a wife and six children all of whom he brought up and educated on £250 a year he never was in debt he performed all his dutiessuch as they wereand passed his time in making rude and unavailing attempts to convert his poorer neighbours there was a unionor poorhousein the neighbourhood to which he would carry morsels of meat in his pocket on friday thinking that the poor wretches who had flown in the face of their priest by eating the unhallowed morsels would then have made a first step towards protestantism he was charitable with so little means for charity he was very eager in his discourses in the course of which he would preach to a dozen protestants for threequarters of an hour and would confine himself to one subject the iniquities of the roman catholic religion he had heard of florians perversion and had made it the topic on which he had declaimed for two sundays he had attempted to argue with father brosnan but had been like a babe in his hands he ate and drank of the poorest and clothed himself so as just to maintain his clerical aspect all his aspirations were of such a nature as to entitle him to a crown of martyrdom but they were certainly not of a nature to justify him in expecting any promotion on this earth such was mr joseph armstrong of headford and from him no aid or counsel or pleasant friendship could be expected in this matter  the trouble of florians education fell for the nonce into ediths hands he had hitherto worked under various preceptors his father his sister and his brother also a private school at galway for a time had had the charge of him but now edith alone undertook the duty gradually the boy began to have a way of his own and to tell himself that he was only bound to be obedient during certain hours of the morning in this way the whole day after twelve oclock was at his own disposal and he never told any of the family what he then did peter the butler perhaps knew where he went but even to peter the butler the knowledge was a trouble for peter though a stanch roman catholic was not inclined to side with anyone against his own master florian in truth did see more of pat carroll than he should have done and though it would be wrong to suppose that he took a part against his father he no doubt discussed the questions which were of interest to pat carroll in a manner that would have been very displeasing to his father faix mr flory pat would say to him av youre one of us youve got to be one of us youve had a glimmer of light as father brosnan says to see the errors of your way but youve got to see the errors of your way on arth as well as above dragging the rint out o the body and bones o the people like hair from a womans head isnt the way and so youll have to larn then florian would endeavour to argue with his friend and struggle to make him understand that in the present complicated state of things it was necessary that a certain amount of rent should go to morony castle to keep up the expenses there  we couldnt do you know without peter nor yet very well without the carriage and horses its all nonsense saying that there should be no rent where are we to get our clothes from but these arguments though very good of their kind had no weight with pat carroll whose great doctrine it was that rent was an evil per se and that his world would certainly go on a great deal better if there were no rent  havent you got half the land of ballintubber in your hands said carroll here florian in a whisper reminded pat that the lands of ballintubber were at this moment under water and had been put so by his operation why wouldnt he make me a statement when i asked for it said carroll with a coarse grin which almost frightened the boy  flory said edith to the boy that afternoon you did see the men at work upon the sluices that afternoon  i didnt said florian  we all believe that you did  but i didnt  you may as well listen to me this once we all believe that you didpapa and i and frank and ada peter believes it theres not a servant about the place but what believes it everybody believes it at headford mr blake at carnlough and all the blakes believe it  i dont care a bit about mr blake said the boy  but you do care about your own father if you were to go up and down to galway by the boat you would find that everybody on board believes it the country people would say that you had turned against your father because of your religion mr morris from beyond cong was here the other day and from what he said about the floods it was easy to see that he believed it  if you believe mr morris better than you do me you may go your own ways by yourself  i dont see that flory i may believe mr morris in this matter better than i do you and yet not intend to go my own ways by myself i dont believe you at all on this subject  very well then dont  but i want to find out if i can what may be the cause of so terrible a falsehood on your part it has come to that that though you tell the lie you almost admit that it is a lie  i dont admit it  it is as good as admitted the position you assume is this i saw the gates destroyed but i am not going to say so in evidence because it suits me to take part with pat carroll and to go against my own father  youve no business to put words like that into my mouth  im telling you what everybody thinks would your father treat you as he does now without a cause and are you to remain here and to go down and down in the world till you become such a one as pat carroll and you will have to live like pat carroll with the knowledge in everyones heart that you have been untrue to your father they are becoming dishonest false knaves untrue to their promises the very scum of the earth because of their credulity and broken vows but what am i to say of you you will have been as false and perfidious and credulous as they you will have thrown away everything good to gratify the ambition of some empty traitor and you will have done it all against your own father here she paused and looked at him they were roaming at the time round the demesne and he walked on but said nothing i know what you are thinking of flory  what am i thinking of  youre thinking of your duty you are thinking whether you can bring yourself to make a clean breast of it and break the promises which you have made  nobody should break a promise said he  and nobody should tell a lie when one finds oneself in the difficulty one has to go back and find out where the evil thing first began  i gave the promise first said florian  no such promise should ever have been given your first duty in the matter was to your father  i dont see that at all said florian my first duty is to my religion  even to do evil for its sake go to father malachi and ask him  father malachi isnt the man to whom i should like to tell everything father brosnan is a much better sort of clergyman he is my confessor and i choose to go by what he tells me  then you will be a traitor to your father  i am not a traitor said florian  and yet you admit that some promise has been givensome promise which you dare not own you cannot but know in your own heart that i know the truth you have seen that man carroll doing the mischief and have promised him to hold your tongue about it you have not then understood at all the nature or extent of the evil done you have not then known that it would be your fathers duty to put down this turbulent ruffian you have promised and having promised father brosnan has frightened you he and pat carroll together have cowed the very heart within you the consequence is that you are becoming one of them and instead of moving as a gentleman on the face of the earth you will be such as they are tell the truth and your father will at once send you to some school in england where you will be educated as becomes my brother  the boy now was sobbing in tears he lacked the resolution to continue his lie but did not dare to tell the truth  i will he whispered  what will you do  i will tell all that i know about it  tell me then now  no edith not now he said  will you tell papa then said edith  papa is so hard to me  whom will you tell and when  i will tell you but not now i will first tell father brosnan that i am going to do it i shall not then have told the lie absolutely to my priest  on this occasion edith could do nothing further with him and indeed the nature of the confession which she expected him to make was such that it should be made to some person beyond herself she could understand that it must be taken down in some form that would be presentable to a magistrate and that evidence of the guilt of pat carroll and evidence as to the possible guilt of others must not be whispered simply into her own ears but she had now brought him to such a condition that she did think that his story would be told     chapter xiv  rachels correspondence   there was another cause of trouble at morony castle which at the present moment annoyed them much frank had received three or four letters from rachel omahony the purport of them all being to explain her troubles with mahomet m m as she called the man but still so as to prevent frank from attempting to interfere personally  no doubt the man is a brute she had said if a young lady without ceasing to be ladylike may so describe so elegant a gentleman if not so still he is a brute because i cant declare otherwise even for the sake of being ladylike but what you say about coming is out of the question you cant meddle with my affairs till youve a title to meddle now you know the truth im going to stick to you and i expect you to stick to me for certain paternal reasons you want to put the marriage off very well im agreeable as the folks say if you would say that you would be ready to marry me on the first of april again i should be agreeable you can nowhere find a more agreeable young woman than i am but i must be one thing or the other  then he wrote to her the sort of loveletter which the reader can understand it was full of kisses and vows and ecstatic hopes but did not name a day in fact mr jones in the middle of his troubles was unable to promise an immediate union and did not choose that his son should marry in order that he might be supported by a singing girl but to this letter frank added a requestor rather a commandthat he should be allowed to come over at once and see mr mahomet it was no doubt true that his father was for the minute a little backward in the matter of his income but still he wanted to look after mahomet and he wanted to be kissed      you must not come at all and i wont even see you if you    do you men are always so weak and want such a lot of    petting mahomet tried to kiss me last night when i was    singing to him before going to dress i have to practise    with him i gave him such a blow in the face that i dont    think hell repeat the experiment and i had my eyes about    me you neednt be at all afraid of me but what i am    quick enough he was startled at the moment and i merely    laughed im not going to give up £100 a month because    he makes a beast of himself and im not going to call    in father as long as i can help it nor do i mean to call    in your royal highness at all i tell everybody that im    going to marry your royal highness king jones there    isnt a bit of a secret about it i talk of my mr jones    just as if we were married because it all comes easier to    me in that way you will see that i absolutely believe in    you and i expect that you shall absolutely believe in me    send you a kiss of course i do i am not at all coy of my    favours you ask mahomet also as to what he thinks of the    strength of my right arm i examined his face so minutely    when i had to fall into his arms on the stage and there i    saw the round mark of my fist and the swelling all round    it and i thought to myself as i was singing my devotion    that he should have it next time in his eye but frank    mark my words i wont have you here till you can come to    marry me   frank did not go over even on this occasion as he was detained not only by his mistresss danger but by his fathers troubles florian had almost but had not quite told the entire truth he had said that he had seen the sluices broken but had not quite owned who had broken them he had declared that pat carroll had done mischief but had not quite said of what nature was the mischief which carroll had done it was now march and the hunting troubles were still going on the whole gentry in county galway had determined to take black tom dalys part and to carry him on through the contest but the effect of taking black tom dalys part was to take the part against which the land leaguers were determined to enrol themselves for of all men in the county black tom was the most unpopular and of all men he was the most determined with him it was literally a question between god and mammon a man could not serve both in the simplicity of his heart he thought that the landleaguers were children of satan and that to have any dealings with them or the passage of any kindness was in itself satanic he said very little but he spent whole hours in thinking of the evil that they were doing and among the evils was the unparalleled insolence which they displayed in entering coverts in county galway now frank jones who had not hitherto been very intimate with tom had taken up his part and was fighting for him at this moment nevertheless the provocation to him to go to london was very great and he had only put it off till the last coverts should be drawn on saturday the 2nd of april the hunt had determined to stop their proceedings earlier than usual but still there was to be one day in april for the sake of honour and glory  but in the latter days of march there came a third letter from rachel omahony like the other letter it was cheerful and highspirited but still it seemed to speak of impending dangers which frank though he could not understand them thought that he could perceive      my present engagement is to go on till the end of july    with an understanding that i am to have twenty guineas    a night for any evening that i may be required to sing    in august this your highness will perceive is a very    considerable increase and at three nights a week might    afford an income on which your highness would perhaps    condescend to come and eat a potato in the honour of    ould ireland till better times should come that would    be the happy potato which would be the first bought for    such a purpose but you must see that i cannot expect    a continuance of my present engagement as the head of    your royal highness seraglio i should have to look for    another chancellor of the exchequer and should probably    find him mr mahomet m moss would hardly endure me    as being part of the properties belonging to your royal    highness     and now i must tell you my own little news beelzebub has    taken a worse devil to himself so that i am likely to be    trodden down into the very middle of the pit i choose to    tell you because i wont have you think that i have ever    kept anything secret from you if i describe the roars of    mrs beelzebub to you and her red claws and her forky    tongue and her fiery tail it is not because i like her    as a subject of poetry but because this special subject    comes uppermost and you shall never say to me why didnt    you tell me when you were introduced to beelzebubs wife    and assert as men are apt to do that you would not    have allowed me to make her acquaintance mrs beelzebub    appears on the stage as belonging to mahomet but how they    have mixed it all up together among themselves i do not    quite know i do not think that theyre in love with one    another because she is not jealous of me she is madame    socani in the plot and a genuine american from new york    but she can sing she has a delicious soprano voice soft    and powerful but she has also a temper and temperament    such as no woman nor yet no devil ought to possess of    monsieur socani or signor socani or herr socani i never    yet heard but such men do not always make themselves    troublesome i have to sing with her and a woman you may    say would not be troublesome but she and mahomet between    them consider themselves competent to get me under their    thumb i dont intend to be under their thumb i intend    to be under nobodys thumb but yours and the sooner the    better now you know all about it but as you shall value    the first squeeze which you shall get when you do come    dont come till your coming has been properly settled   then there was a fourth letter in which she described her troubles still humorously and with some attempt at absolute comedy but she certainly wrote with a purpose of making him understand that she was subjected to very considerable annoyance she was still determined not to call upon him for assistance and she warned him that any assistance whatever would be out of his power a lover on the scene who could not declare his purpose of speedy marriage would be worse than useless all that she saw plainlyor at any rate declared that she saw plainly though she was altogether unable to explain it to frank jones      mrs beelzebub is certainly the queen of the devils i    remember when you read paradise lost to us at morony    castle which i thought very dull milton arranged the    ranks in pandemonium differently but there has been a    revolution since that and mrs beelzebub has everything    just as she pleases i am beginning to pity mahomet and    pity they say is akin to love she urges himwell    just to make love to me what reason there is between    them i dont know but i am sure she wants him to get me    altogether into his hands im not sure but what she is    mahomets own wife this is a horrid kettle of fish as    you will see but i think ill turn out to be head cook    yet if god does not walk atop of the devils whats the    use of running straight but i am sure he will and the    more so because there is in truth no temptation     she told me the other day to my face that i was a fool    i know i am said i demurely but why then she came    out with her demand it was very simple and did not in    truth amount to much i was to become justmistress to    mr moss   frank jones when he read this crushed the paper up in his hand and went upstairs to his bedroom determined to pack up immediately but before he had progressed far he got out the letter and read the remainder      you i said are an intimate acquaintance of mr moss     i am his particular friend she said with that peculiar    new york aping of a foreign accent which is the language    that was i am sure generally used by the devils     ask him with my best compliments i said whether he    remembers the blow i hit him in the face tell him i can    hit much harder than that tell him that he will never    find me unprepared for a moment     now i have got another little bit of news for you    somebody has found out in new york that i am making    money it is true in a limited way £100 a month is    something and so theyve asked papa to subscribe as    largely as he can to a grand homerule antiprotestant    hatetheenglish starsandstripes society it is the    most loyal and beneficent thing out and dear papa thinks    i can do nothing better with my wealth than bestow it    upon these birds of freedom i have no doubt they are    all right because i am an americanirish and have not    the pleasure of knowing black tom daly i have given    them £200 and am therefore at this moment nearly    impecunious on this account i do not choose to give up my    engagement£100 a month with an additional possibility    of twenty guineas a night when august shall be here you    will tell me that after the mild suggestion made by mrs    beelzebub i ought to walk out of the house and go back    to county galway immediately i dont think so i am    learning every day how best to stand fast on my own feet    i am earning my money honestly and men and women here    in london are saying that in truth i can sing a very    nice old gentleman called on me the other day from covent    garden and making me two low bows asked whether i was    my own mistress some time in october next i thought at    the moment that i was at any rate free from the further    engagement proposed by mrs beelzebub and told him that i    was free then he made me two lower bows touched the tip    of my fingers and said that he would be proud to wait    upon me in a few days with a definite proposal this old    gentleman may mean twenty guineas a night for the whole    of next winter or something like £250 a month think    of that mr jones but how am i to go on in my present    impecunious position if i quarrel altogether with my bread    and butter so now you know all about it     remember that i have told my father nothing as to mrs    beelzebubs proposition it is better not he would disown    it and would declare that i had invented it from vanity    i do think that a woman in this country can look after    herself if she be minded so to do i know that i am    stronger than mr moss and mrs beelzebub together i do    believe that he will pay me his money as he has always    done and i want to earn my money i have some little    precautionsjust for a rainy day i have told you    everythingeverything because you are to be my husband    but you can do me no good by coming here but may cause me    a peck of troubles now goodbye and god bless you a    thousand kisses     ever your own     r     tell everybody that im to be mrs jones some day   frank finished packing up and then told his father that he was going off to athenry at once there to meet the night mail train up to dublin  why are you going at once in this sudden manner asked his father  frank then remembered that he could not tell openly the story of mrs beelzebub rachel had told him in pure simpleminded confidence and though he was prepared to disobey her he would not betray her she is on the stage he said  i am aware of it replied his father intending to signify that his sons betrothed was not employed as he would have wished  at the charing cross opera said the son endeavouring to make the best of it  yes at the charing cross opera if that makes a difference  she is earning her bread honestly  i believe so said mr jones i do believe so i do think that rachel omahony is a thoroughly good girl  i am sure of it said ada and edith almost in the same breath  but not less on that account is the profession distasteful to me you do not wish to see your sisters on the stage  i have thought of all that sir said frank i have quite made up my mind to make rachel my wife if it be possible  do you mean to live on what she may earn as an actress here frank remained silent for a moment because if you do i must tell you that it will not become you as a gentleman to accept her income  you cannot give us an income on which we may live  certainly not at this moment with things as they are in ireland now i do not know how long i may have a shilling with which to bless myself it seems to me that for the present it is your duty to stay at home and not to trouble rachel by going to her in london  at this moment i must go to her  you have given no reason for your going frank thought of it and told himself that there was in truth no reason his going would be a trouble to rachel and yet there were reasons which made it imperative for him to go have you asked yourself what will be the expense said his father  it may cost i suppose twelve pounds going and coming  and have you asked yourself how many twelve pounds will be likely to fall into your hands just at present is she in any trouble  i had rather not talk about her affairs said frank  is not her father with her  i do not think he is the best man in the world to help a girl in such an emergency but he had not described what was the emergency  you think that a young man who certainly will be looked on as the young ladys lover but by no means so certainly as the young ladys future husband will be more successful  i do said frank getting up and walking out of the room he was determined at any rate that nothing which his father could say should stop him as he had resolved to disobey all the orders which rachel had given him at any rate during that night and the following day he made his way up to london     chapter xv  captain yorke clayton   at this period of our story much had already been said in the outside world as to flooding the meadows of ballintubber like other outrages of the same kind it had not at first been noticed otherwise than in the immediate neighbourhood and though a terrible injury had been inflicted equal in value to the loss of five or six hundred pounds it had seemed as though it would pass away unnoticed simply because mr jones had lacked evidence to bring it home to any guilty party but gradually it had become known that pat carroll had been the sinner and the causes also which had brought about the crime were known it was known that pat carroll had joined the landleaguers in the neighbouring county of mayo with great violence and that he had made a threat that he would pay no further rent to his landlord the days of the norent manifestation had not yet come as the obnoxious members of parliament were not yet in prison but norent was already firmly fixed in the minds of many men about to lead in the process of time to arrears bills and other abominations of injustice and among those conspicuous in the west who were ready to seize fortune by the forelock was mr pat carroll in this way his name had come forward and inquiries were made of mr jones which distressed him much for though he was ready to sacrifice his meadows and his tenant and his rent he was most unwilling to do it if he should be called upon at the same time to sacrifice his boys character for loyalty  there had been a man stationed at castlerea for some months past who in celebrity had almost beaten the notorious pat carroll this was one captain yorke clayton who for nearly twelve months had been in the county mayo it was supposed that he had first shown himself there as a constabulary officer and had then very suddenly been appointed resident magistrate why he was captain nobody knew it was the fact indeed that he had been employed as adjutant in a volunteer regiment in england having gone over there from the police force in the north of ireland his title had gone with him by no fault or no virtue of his own and he had blossomed forth to the world of connaught as captain clayton before he knew why he was about to become famous famous however he did become  he had two attributes which if fortune helps may serve to make any man famous they were recklessness of life and devotion to an idea if fortune do not help recklessness of life amidst such dangers as those which surrounded captain clayton will soon bring a man to his end so that there will be no question of fame but we see men occasionally who seem to find it impossible to encounter death it is not at all probable that this man wished to die life seemed to him to be pleasant enough he was no forlorn lover he had fairly good health and strength people said of him that he had small but comfortable private means he was remarkable among all men for his good looks and he lacked nothing necessary to make life happy but he appeared to be always in a hurry to leave it a hundred men in mayo had sworn that he should die this was told to him very freely but he had only laughed at it and was generally called the woodcock as he rode about among his daily employments the ordinary life of a woodcock calls upon him to be shot at but yet a woodcock is not an easy bird to hit  then there was his devotion to an idea i will not call it loyalty lest i should seem to praise the man too vehemently for that which probably was simply an instinct in his own heart he lived upon his hatred of a landleaguer it was probably some conviction on his own part that the original landleaguer had come from new york which produced this feeling and it must be acknowledged of him with reference to the lower order of landleaguers that he did admit in his mind a possibility that they were curable there were to him landleaguers and landleaguers but the landleaguer whom captain yorke clayton hated with the bitterest prejudice was the landleaguing member of parliament some of his worst enemies believed that he might be detected in breaking out into illegal expressions of hatred or more unfortunately still into illegal acts and that so the government might be compelled to dismiss him with disgrace others his warmest friends hoped that by such a process his life might be eventually saved but for the present captain yorke clayton had saved both his character and his neck to the great surprise both of those who loved him and the reverse he had lately been appointed joint resident magistrate for galway mayo and roscommon and had removed his residence to galway to him also had pat carroll become intimately known and to him the floods of ballintubber were a peculiar case it was one great desire of his heart to have pat carroll incarcerated as a penal felon he did not very often express himself on this subject but pat carroll knew well the nature of his wishes a thundering bloody rapparee was the name by which carroll delighted to call him but carroll was one who exercised none of that control over his own tongue for which captain clayton was said to be so conspicuous during the last month mr jones had seen captain clayton more than once at galway and on one occasion he had come down to morony castle attended by a man who was supposed to travel as his servant but who was known by all the world to be a policeman in disguise for captain clayton had been strictly forbidden by the authorities of the castle to travel without such a companion and an attempt had already been made to have him dismissed for disobedience to these orders  captain clayton when he had been at morony castle had treated flory with great kindness declining to crossquestion him at all i would endeavour to save him from these gentlemen he had said to his father i dont quite think that we understand what is going on within his mind but this had been before the conversation last mentioned which had taken place between flory and his sisters now he was to come again and make further inquiry and meet halfadozen policemen from the neighbourhood but florian had as yet but half confessed and almost hoped that captain clayton would appear among them as his friend  the girls to tell the truth had been much taken with the appearance of the gallant captain it seems to be almost a shame to tell the truth of what modest girls may think of any man whom they may chance to meet they would never tell it to themselves even two sisters can hardly do so and when the man comes before them just for once or twice to be judged and thought of at a single interview the girlsuch as were these girlscan hardly tell it to herself he is manly and brave and has so much to say for himself and is so goodlooking that what can any girl who has her heart at her own disposal wish for better than such a lover it would have been quite impossible that either of mr joness daughters could ever have so whispered to herself but was it not natural that such an unwhispered thought should have passed through the mind of adaada the beautiful ada the sentimental ada the young lady who certainly was in want of a lover he is very nice certainly said ada allowing herself not another word to her sister  but what is the good of a man being nice when he is a woodcock said edith everybody says that his destiny is before him i daresay he is nice but whats the use  you dont mean to say that you think hell be killed said ada  i do and i mean to say that if i were a man it might be that i should have to be killed too a man has to run his chance and if he falls into such a position as this of course he must put up with it i dont mean to say that i dont like him the better for it  why does he not go away and leave the horrid country said ada  because the more brave men that go away the more horrid the country will become and then i think a man is always the happier if he has something really to think of such a one as captain clayton does not want to go to balls  i suppose not said ada plaintively as though she thought it a thousand pities that captain clayton should not want to go to balls  such a man said edith with an air of firmness finds a woman when he wants to marry who will suit himand then he marries her there is no necessity for any balls there  then he ought not to dance at all such a man ought not to want to get married  not if he means to be killed out of hand said edith the possible young woman must be left to judge of that i shouldnt like to marry a woodcock however much i might admire him i do think it well that there should be such men as captain clayton i feel that if i were a man i ought to wish to be one myself but i am sure i should feel that i oughtnt to ask a girl to share the world with me fancy marrying a man merely to be left a sorrowing widow it is part of the horror of his business that he shouldnt even venture to dance lest some poor female should be captivated  a girl might be captivated without dancing said ada  i dont mean to say that such a man should absolutely tie himself up in a bag so that no poor female should run any possible danger but he oughtnt to encourage such risks to tell the truth i dont think that captain clayton does  ada that afternoon thought a great deal of the positionnot of course in reference to herself was it proper that such a man as captain yorke clayton should abstain from falling in love with a girl or even from allowing a girl to fall in love with him because he was in danger of being shot it was certainly a difficult question was any man to be debarred from the pleasures and incidents and natural excitements of a mans life because of the possible dangers which might possibly happen to a possible young woman looking at the matter all round ada did not see that the man could help himself unless he were to be shut up in a bag as edith had said so as to prevent a young woman from falling in love with him although he were a woodcock the thing must go on in its own natural course if misfortunes did come why misfortunes must come it was the same thing with any soldier or any sailor if she were to fall in love with some officerfor the supposition in its vague undefined form was admissible even to poor adas imaginationshe would not be debarred from marrying him merely by the fact that he would have to go to the wars of course as regarded captain yorke clayton this was merely a speculation he might be engaged to some other girl already for anything she knewor cared as she told herself with more or less of truth  captain yorke clayton came down by the boat that afternoon to morony castle frank jones having started for london two or three days before he reached the pier at about four oclock accompanied by his faithful follower and was there met by mr jones himself who walked up with him to the castle there was a short cut across the fields to mr joness house and as they left the road about a furlong up from the pier they were surrounded by the waters which mr carroll had let in upon the ballintubber meadows  you wont mind my fellow coming with us said captain clayton  your fellow as you call him is more than welcome i came across this way because some of pat carrolls friends may be out on the high road if they fire halfadozen rifles from behind a wall at your luggage they wont do so much harm as if they shot at yourself  there wont be any shooting here said clayton shaking his head hes not had time to get a stranger down and pay him they always require two or three days notice for that work and there isnt a wall about the place youre not giving mr pat carroll a fair chance for his friends i could dodge them always with perfect security by myself only the beaks up in dublin have given a strict order as they pay for the pistols i am bound to carry them then he lifted up the lappets of his coat and waistcoat and showed halfadozen pistols stuck into his girdle our friend there has got as many more  i have a couple myself said mr jones indicating their whereabouts and showing that he was not as yet so used to carry them as to have provided himself with a belt for the purpose  then they walked on chatting indifferently about the landleaguers till they reached the castle the people are not cowards captain clayton had said i believe that men do become cowards when they are tempted to become liars by getting into parliament an irishman of a certain class does at any rate but those fellows if they were put into a regiment would fight like grim death that man there and he pointed back over his shoulder is as brave a fellow as i ever came across in my life i dont think that he would hesitate a moment in attacking three or four men armed with revolvers and gold wouldnt induce him to be false to me but if mr pat carroll had by chance got hold of him before he had come my way he might have been the very man to shoot you or me from behind a wall with a bit of black crape on his face whats the reason of it i love that man as my brother but i might have hated him as the very devil  the force of example sir said mr jones as he led the way into the quiet modern residence which rejoiced to call itself morony castle  what are we to do about this boy said mr jones when they had seated themselves in his study  are you friends with him yet  no i declared to his sisters that i would not sit down to table with him till he had told the truth and i have kept my word  how does he bear it  but badly said the father it has told upon him very much he complains to his sister that i have utterly cast him off  it is the oddest case i ever heard of in my life said the captain i suppose his change of religion has been at the bottom of itthat and the machinations of the priest down at headford when we recollect that there must have been quite a crowd of people looking on all the while it does seem odd that we should be unable to get a single witness to tell the truth knowing as we do that this lad was there if he would only name two who were certainly there and who certainly saw the deed done that would be enough for the people are not in themselves hostile to you  you know he has owned that he did see it said the father and he has acknowledged that pat carroll was there though he has never mentioned the mans name his sisters have told him that i will not be satisfied unless i hear him declare that pat carroll was one of the offenders  let us have him in sir if you dont mind  just as he is  i should say so or let the young ladies come with him if you do not object which of them has been most with him since your edict went forth  mr jones declared that edith had been most with her brother and the order went forth that edith and florian should be summoned into the apartment  ada and edith were together when the order came edith was to go down and present herself before captain yorke clayton  mercy me said edith jumping up i hope they wont shoot at him through the window whilst i am there  oh edith how can you think of such a thing  it would be very unpleasant if some assassin were to take my back hair for captain claytons brown head theyre very nearly the same colour  and edith prepared to leave the room hearing her brothers slow heavy step as he passed before the door  wont you go first and brush your hair said ada and do put a ribbon on your neck  ill do nothing of the kind it would be a sheer manoeuvring to entrap a man who ought to be safeguarded against all such female wiles besides i dont believe a bit that captain clayton would know the difference between a young lady with or without a ribbon what evidence i can givethats the question  so saying edith descended to her fathers room  she found florian with his hand upon the door and they both entered the room i have said that captain clayton was a remarkably goodlooking man and i ought perhaps to give some explanation of the term when first introducing him to the reader in the presence of a lady who is intended to become the heroine of this story but it must suffice that i have declared him to be goodlooking and that i add to that the fact that though he was thirtyfive years old he did not look to be more than fiveandtwenty the two peculiarities of his face were very light blue eyes and very long moustachios florian and i have come to see the latterday hero said edith laughing as she entered the room though i know that you are so done up with pistols that no peaceable young woman ought to come near you to this he made some sportive reply and then before a minute had passed over their heads he had taken florian by the hand     chapter xvi  captain clayton comes to the castle   well my boy how are you asked the captain  theres nothing particularly the matter with me said florian  i suppose all this is troubling you  all what you mean about pat carroll of course its troubling me nobody will believe a word that i say  but they do believe you now that you are telling the truth said edith  do you hold your tongue miss said the boy i dont see why you should have so much to say about it  she has been your best friend from first to last said the father if it had not been for edith i would have turned you out of the house it is terrible to me to think that a boy of mine should refuse to say what he saw in such a matter as this you are putting yourself on a par with the enemies of your own family you do not know it but you are nearly sending me to the grave then there was a long pause during which the captain kept his eyes fixed on the boys face and edith had moved round so as to seat herself close to her brother and had taken his hand in hers  dont edith said the boy leave me alone i dont want to be meddled with and he withdrew his hand  oh florian said the girl try to tell the truth and be a gentleman whether it be for you or against you tell the truth  im not to mind a bit about my religion then  does your religion bid you tell a lie asked the captain  im not telling a lie i am just holding my tongue a catholic has a right to hold his tongue when he is among protestants  even to the ruin of his father suggested the captain  i dont want to ruin papa he said he was going to turnto turn me out of the house i would go and drown myself in the lake if he did or in one of those big dykes which divide the meadows i am miserable among themquite miserable edith never gives me any peace day or night she comes and sits in my bedroom begging me to tell the truth it ought to be enough when i say that i will hold my tongue papa can turn me out to drown myself if he pleases edith goes on cheating the words out of me till i dont know what im saying if i am to be brought up to tell it all before the judge i shant know what i have said before or what i have not said  nil conscire tibi said the father who had already taught his son so much latin as that  but you did see the sluice gates torn down and thrown back into the water said the captain here florian shook his head mournfully i understood you to acknowledge that you had seen the gates destroyed  i never said as much to you said the boy  but you did to me said edith  if a fellow says a word to you it is repeated to all the world i never would have you joined with me in a secret you are a great deal worse than well those fellows that you abuse me about they never tell anything that they have heard among themselves to people outside  pat carroll you mean asked the captain  he isnt the only one theres more in it than him  oh yes we know that there were many others in it besides pat carroll when they let the waters in through the dyke gates there must have been twenty there  no there werentnot that i saw  a dozen perhaps  you are laying traps for me but i am not going to be caught i was there and i did see it you may make the most of that though you have me up before the judge i neednt say a word more than i please  he is more obstinate said his father than any rebel that you can meet  but so mistaken said the captain because he can refuse to answer us who are treating him with such tenderness and affection who did not even want to wound his feelings more than we can help he thinks that he can hold his peace in the same fashion before the entire court and that he can do so although he has owned that he knows the men  i have never owned that said the boy  not to your sister  i only owned to one  pat carroll said the captain but giving the name merely as a hint to help the boys memory  but the boy was too sharp for him thats another of your traps captain clayton if she says pat carroll i can say it was tim brady a boys word will be as good as a girls i suppose  a lie can never be as good as the truth whether from a boy or a girl said the captain endeavouring to look him through and through the boy quavered beneath his gaze and the captain went on with his questioning i suppose we may take it for granted that pat carroll was there and that you did see him  you may take anything for granted  you would have to swear before a jury that pat carroll was there  then there was another pause but at last with a long sigh the boy spoke out he was there and i did see him then he burst into tears and threw himself down on the ground and hid his face in his sisters lap  dear flory said she my own brother i knew that you would struggle to be a gentleman at last  it will all come right with him now said the captain but the father frowned and shook his head how many were there with him asked the captain intent on the main business  but florian feeling that it would be as good to be hung for a sheep as a lamb and feeling also that he had at last cast aside all the bonds which bound him to pat carroll and father brosnanfeeling that there was nothing left for him but the internecine enmity of his old friendsgot up from the floor and wiping away the tears from his face spoke out boldly the whole truth as he knew it it was dark and i didnt see them all there were only six whom i could see though i know that there were many others round about among the meadows whose names i had heard though i do not remember them  we will confine ourselves to the six whom you did see said the captain preparing to listen quietly to the boys story the father took out a pen and ink but soon pushed it on one side edith again got hold of the boys hand and held it within her own till his story was finished  i didnt see the six all at once the first whom i did see was pat carroll and his brother terry and tim brady they were up there just where the lane has turned down from the steamboat road i had gone down to the big sluice gates before anyone had noticed me and there were tim and terry smashing away at the gate hinges up to their middles in mud and pat carroll was handing them down a big crowbar terry when he saw me fell flat forward into the water and had to be picked out again  did they say anything to threaten you said the captain  tim brady said that i was all right and was a great friend of father brosnans then they whispered together and i heard terry say that he wouldnt go against anything that father brosnan might say then pat carroll came and stood over me with the crowbar  did he threaten you  he didnt do it in a threatening way but only asked me to be hand and glove with them  had you been intimate with this man before asked the captain  he had been very intimate with him said the father all this calamity has come of his intimacy he has changed his religion and ceased to be a gentleman here the boy again sobbed but edith still squeezed his hand  what did you say asked the captain when he bade you be hand and glove with him  i said that i would then they made the sign of a cross and swore me on it and they swore me specially to say nothing up here and they swore me again when they met down at tim raffertys house in headford i intended to keep my word and i think that you ought to have let me keep it  but there were three others whom you saw urged the captain  there was con heffernan and a man they call lax who had come from lough conn beyond castlebar  hes not a man of this county  i think not though i had seen him here before he has had something to do with the landleaguers up about foxford  i think i have a speaking acquaintance with that mr lax said the captain and everybody could perceive that the tone of his voice was altered as he spoke about mr lax and who was the sixth  there was that old man papa whom they call terry but he wasnt doing anything in particular  he is the greatest blackguard on the estate said the father  but we will confine ourselves to the five said the captain not forgetting mr lax what was mr lax doing  i cant remember what they were all doing how is a fellow to remember them all there were those two at the hinges and pat carroll was there pulling his brother out of the water  terry was pats brother  they are brothers said the father  and then they went on and took no notice of me for a time lax came up and scowled at me and told me that if a word was said i should never draw the breath of life again  but he didnt do anything asked the captain  i dont remember how is a fellow to remember after so many months  why didnt you tell the truth at the time said his father angrily another tear stood in each of the poor boys eyes and edith got closer to him and threw her left arm round his waist you are spoiling him by being so soft with him said the father  he is doing the best he can mr jones said the captain dont be harsh with him now well florian what came next  they bade me go away and again made me swear another oath it was nearly dark then and it was quite dark night before i got up to the house but before i went i saw that there were many others standing idle about the place  do you remember any particularly  well there was another of the carrolls a nephew of pats and there was tony brady tims brother i cant at this moment say who else there were  it would be as well to have as many as we do know not to prosecute them but to ask them for their evidence three or four men will often contradict each other and then they will break down i think we have enough now but you must remember that i have only questioned you as your friend and as your fathers friend i have not taken down a word that you have said my object has been simply that we might all act together to punish a vindictive and infamous outrage pat carroll has had nothing to get by flooding your fathers meadows but because your father has not chosen to forgive him his rent he has thought fit to do him all the injury in his power i fear that there are others in it who are more to blame even than pat carroll but if we can get hold of this gentleman and also of his friend mr lax we shall have done much  then the meeting was over for that evening and captain clayton retired to his own room you neednt mind following me here hunter he said to the policeman  i wouldnt be too sure sir  you may be sure in mr joness house and no one in the country has any idea of committing murder on his own behalf i am safe till they would have had time to send for someone out of another county but we shall be back in galway tomorrow so saying hunter left his master alone and the captain sat down to write an account of the scene which had just taken place in this he gave every name as the boy had given it with accuracy but nevertheless he added to his little story the fact that it had been related from memory  edith took her brother away into her own room and there covered him with kisses why is papa so hard to me said the boy sobbing then she explained to him as gently as she could the grounds which had existed for hardness on his fathers part she bade him consider how terrible a thing it must be to a father to have to think that his own son should have turned against him while the country was in such a condition  it is not the flood flory nor the loss of the meadows being under water it is not the injury that pat carroll has done him or any of the men whom pat carroll has talked into enmity that indeed is very dreadful to these very men he has been their best friend for many years and now they would help in his ruin and turn us and him out as beggars upon the world because he has not chosen to obey the unjust bidding of one of them here the boy hung down his head and turned away his face but it is not that all that has had no effect in nigh breaking his heart money is but money no one can bear its loss better than our papa though he might have to starve he would starve like a gallant man and we could starve with him you and i frank and ada would bear all that he could bear but the boy looked up into her face again as though imploring her to spare him but she went on with her speech but that a son of his should cease to feel as a gentleman should feeland a christian it is that which moves him to be hard as you call it but he is not hard he is a man and he cannot kiss you as a woman doesas your sister does here she almost smothered the boy with kisses but florian it is not too late it is never too late while you still see that truth is godlike and that a lie is of all things the most devilish it is never too late while you feel what duty calls you to do and again she covered him with kisses and then allowed him to go away to his own room  when edith was alone she sat back in an easychair with her feet on the fender before the turf fire and began to consider how things might go with her poor brother if they should get hold of him and murder him she said to herself the thought was very dreadful but she comforted herself with reflecting that he might be sent out of the country before the knowledge of what he had done should get abroad and then by means of that current of thought which always runs where it listeth independent of the will of the thinker her ideas flew off to captain yorke clayton in her imagination she had put down captain clayton as a possible lover for her sister she possessed a girlish intuition into her sisters mind which made her feel that her sister would not dislike such an arrangement ada was the beauty of the family and was supposed at any rate by edith to be the most susceptible of the two sisters she had always called herself a violent old maid who was determined to have her own way but no one had ever heard ada speak of herself as an old maid and then as to that danger of which ada had spoken edith knew that such perils must be overlooked altogether among the incidents of life if it came to her would she refuse her hand to a man because his courage led him into special perils she knew that it would only be an additional ground for her love and of ada in that respect she judged as she did of herself she knew that ada thought much of manly beauty and her eyes told her that captain yorke clayton was very handsome if he were as black as beelzebub she said to herself i should like him the better for it but ada would prefer a man to be beautiful she went to work to make a match in her own mind between ada and captain clayton but the more she made it the more she continued to thinkon her own behalfthat of all men she had ever seen this man had pleased her fancy most but captain yorke clayton you were never more mistaken in all your life if you think that edith jones has taken a fancy to your handsome physiognomy this she said in almost audible words but nevertheless i do think that you are a hero for myself i dont want a heroand if i did i shouldnt get one but the arrangements made in the house that night were those which are customary for a favoured young mans reception when such matters are left to the favouring young lady in the family  when mr jones found himself alone in his study he began to think of the confession which florian had made it had gradually come to pass that he had been sure of the truth for some months though he had never before heard it declared by his sons lips since the day on which he had called on mr blake at carnlough he had been quite sure that edith was right he was almost sure before now the truth was declared exactly as she had surmised it and what should he do with the boy he could not merely put him forward as a witness in this case some reason must be given why the truth had not been told during the last six months as he thought of this he felt that the boy had disgraced himself for ever  and he thought of the boys danger he had rashly promised that the boy should be sent to england out of harms way but he now told himself that the means of doing so were further from him than ever and that he was daily becoming a poorer if not a ruined man of the rents then due to him not a penny would he feared be paid   end of vol i  charles dickens and evans crystal palace press

 rachel omahony found her position to be very embarrassing she had thought it out to the best of her ability and had told herself that it would be better for her not to acquaint her father with all the circumstances had he been told the nature of the offer made to her by madame socani he would at once she thought have taken her away from the theatre she would have to abandon the theatre at which she was earning her money this would have been very bad there would have been some lawsuit with mahomet moss as to which she could not have defended herself by putting madame socani into the witnessbox there had been no third person present and any possible amount of lying would have been very easy to madame socani rachel was quick enough and could see at a moment all that lying could do against her but he tried to kiss me she would have had to say then she could see how with a shrug of his shoulders her enemy would have ruined her from such a contest a man like moss comes forth without even a scratch that can injure him but rachel felt that she would have been utterly annihilated she must tell someone but that someone must be he whom she intended to marry  and she too had not been quite prudent in all respects since she had come to london it had been whispered to her that a singer of such pretensions should be brought to the theatre and carried home in her private brougham therefore she had spent more money than was compatible with the assistance given to her father and was something in debt it was indispensable to her that she should go on with her engagement  but she told her father that it was absolutely necessary that he should go with her to the theatre every night that she sang it was but three nights a week and the hours of her work were only from eight till ten he had however unfortunately made another engagement for himself there was a debating society dramatic in its manner of carrying on its business at which three or four irish homerulers were accustomed to argue among themselves before a mixed audience of englishmen and irishmen as to the futility of english government here mr omahony was popular among the debaters and was paid for his services not many knew that the eloquent irishman was the father of the singer who in truth was achieving for herself a grand reputation but such was the case a stop had been put upon his lecturings at galway but no policeman in london seemed to be aware that the galway incendiary and the london debater were one and the same person so there came to him an opening for picking up a few pounds towards their joint expenses  but why should you want me now more than for the last fortnight he said contending for the use of his own time  mr moss is disagreeable  has he done anything new he asked  he is always doing things newthat is more beastlyone day than the day before  he doesnt come and sing with you now at your own rooms  no i have got through that thank heaven to tell the truth father i am not in the least afraid of mr moss before he should touch me you may be sure that he would have the worst of it  of course i will do what you want said her father but only if it be not necessary  it is necessary of course i do not wish to be dragged up to the policecourt for sticking mr moss in the abdomen thats what it would come to if we were left together  do you mean to say that you require my presence to prevent anything so disagreeable as that  if they know or if he knows that youre in the house there will be nothing of the kind cant you arrange your debates for the other nights  so it was in fact settled everybody about the theatre seemed to be aware that something was wrong mr omahony had not come back to be constantly on the watch like a newfoundland dog without an object to himself it was an intolerable nuisance he suspected his daughter not at all he was so far from suspecting her that he imagined her to be safe though halfadozen mosses should surround her he could only stand idle behind the scenes or sit in her dressingroom and yawn but still he did it and asked no further questions  then while all this was going on the polite old gentleman from covent garden had called at her lodgings in cecil street and had found both her and her father at home  oh m le gros she had said i am so glad that you should meet my father here  then there was a multiplicity of bowing and m le gros had declared that he had never had so much honour done him as in being introduced to him who was about to become the father of the undoubted prima donna of the day at all which mr omahony made many bows and rachel laughed very heartily but in the end an engagement was proposed and thankfully accepted which was to commence in the next october it did not take two minutes in the making it was an engagement only for a couple of months but as m le gros observed such an engagement would undoubtedly lead to one for all time if covent garden could only secure the permanent aid of mademoiselle omahony covent gardens fortune would be as good as made m le gros had quite felt the dishonesty of even suggesting a longer engagement to mademoiselle the rate of payment would be very much higher very very very much higher when mademoiselles voice should have once been heard on the boards of a true operatic theatre m le gros had done himself the honour of being present on one or two occasions at the charing cross little playhouse he did believe himself to have some small critical judgment in musical matters he thought he might venturehe really did think that he might ventureto bespeak a brilliant career for mademoiselle then with a great many more bowings and scrapings m le gros having done his business took his leave  i like him better than mahomet m said rachel to her father  theyre both very civil said mr omahony  one has all the courtesy of hell with the other it iswell not quite the manners of heaven i can imagine something brighter even than m le gros but it does very well for earth m le gros knows that a young woman should be treated as a human being and even his blandishments are pleasant enough as they are to take the shape of golden guineas as for me m le gros is quite good enough for my idea of this world  but on the next day a misfortune took place which wellnigh obliterated all the joy which m le gros had produced it was not singing night and mr omahony had just taken up his hat to go away to his debating society when frank jones was announced frank what on earth did you come here for these were the words with which the lover was greeted he had endeavoured to take the girl in his arms but she had receded from his embrace  why rachel he exclaimed  i told you not to come i told you especially that you were not to come  why did you tell him so said mr omahony and why has he come  not one kiss rachel said the lover  oh kisses yes if i didnt kiss you father would think that we had already quarrelled but it may be that we must do so when i had told you everything that you should rush up to london to look after meas though you suspected me  what is there to suspect said the father  nothingi suspect nothing said frank but there were things which made it impossible that i should not wish to be nearer she was insulted  who insulted her  the devil in the shape of a woman said rachel he takes that shape as often as the other  rachel should not be left in such hands said frank  my dear mr jones you have no right to say in what hands i shall be left my father and i have got to look after that between us i have told you over and over again what are my intentions in the matter they have been made in utter disregard of myself and with the most perfect confidence in you you tell me that you cannot marry me  not quite at present  very well i have been satisfied to remain as engaged to you but i am not satisfied to be subject to your interference  interference he said  well now im going this came from mr omahony ive got to see if i can earn a few shillings and tell a few truths i will leave you to fight out your battles among you  there will be no battles said frank  i hope not but i feel that i can do no good i have such absolute trust in rachel that you may be quite sure that i shall back her up in whatever she says now goodnight and with that he took his leave  i am glad he has gone because he would do us no good said rachel you were angry with me just now because i spoke of interference i meant it i will not admit of any interference from you then she sat with her two hands on her knees looking him full in the face i love you with all my heart and am ready to tell everyone that i am to become your wife they have a joke about it in the theatre calling me mrs jones and because nobody believes what anybody says they think youre a myth i suppose it is queer that a singing girl should marry mr jones im to go in the autumn to covent garden and get ever so much more money and i shall still talk about mr jonesunless you and i agree to break it off  certainly not that said he  but it is by no means certain will you go back to ireland tomorrow morning and undertake not to see me again until you come prepared to marry me if not we must break it off  i can hardly do that  then said she rising from her chair it is broken off and i will not call myself mrs jones any more he too rose from his chair and frowned at her by way of an answer i have one other suggestion to make she said i shall receive next october what will be quite sufficient for both of us and for father too come and bear the rough and the smooth together with us  and live upon you  i should live upon you without scruple if you had got it and then i shall bear your interference without a word of complaint nay i shall thank you for it i shall come to you for advice in everything what you say will be my law you shall knock down all the mosses for meor lock them up which would be so much better but you must be my husband  not yet you should not ask me as yet think of my fathers position let this one sad year pass by  twothree if there are to be two or three sad years i will wait for you till you are as grey as old peter and i have not a note left in my throat i will stick to you like beeswax but i will not have you here hanging about me do you think that it would not be pleasant for me to have a lover to congratulate me every day on my little triumphs do you think that i should not be proud to be seen leaning always on your arm with the consciousness that mr moss would be annihilated at his very first word but when a year had passed by where should i be no frank it will not do if you were at morony castle things would go on very well as you choose to assume to yourself the right of interference we must part  when you tell me of such a proposition as that made to you by the woman am i to say nothing  not a wordunless it be by letter from morony castle and then only to me i will not have you here meddling with my affairs i told you though i didnt tell my father because i would tell you everything  and i am to leave youwithout another word  yes without another word and remember that from this moment i am free to marry any man that may come the way  rachel  i am free to marry any man that may come the way i dont say i shall do so it may take me some little time to forget you but i am free when that has been understood between us i am sure you will interfere no longer you will not be so unkind as to force upon me the necessity of telling the truth to all the people about the theatre let us understand each other  i understand said he with the air of a much injured man  i quite know your position trusting to your own prospects you cannot marry me at present and you do not choose to accept such income as i can give you i respect and even approve your motives i am living a life before the public as a singer in which it is necessary that i should encounter certain dangers i can do so without fear if i be left alone you wont leave me alone you wont marry me and yet you wont leave me to my own devicestherefore we had better part he took her by the hand sorrowfully as though preparing to embrace her no mr jones she said that is all done i kissed you when my father was here because i was then engaged to be your wife that is over now and i can only say goodbye so saying she retired leaving him standing there in her sittingroom  he remained for awhile meditating on his position till he began to think that it would be useless for him to remain there she certainly would not come down and he though he were to wait for her fathers return would get no more favourable reply from him he as he had promised would certainly back up his daughter in all that she had said as he went down out of the room with that feeling of insult which clings to a man when he has been forced to quit a house without any farewell ceremony he certainly did feel that he had been illused but he could not but acknowledge that she was justified there was a certain imperiousness about her which wounded his feelings as a man he ought to have been allowed to be dominant but then he knew that he could not live upon her income his father would not speak to him had he gone back to morony castle expressing his intention of doing so     chapter xviii  frank jones has ceased to exist   to tell the truth rachel had a thorough good cry before she went to bed that night though there was something hard fixed imperious almost manlike about her manner still she was as softhearted as any other girl we may best describe her by saying that she was an american and an actress it was impossible to doubt her no one who had once known her could believe her to be other than she had declared herself she was loyal affectionate and dutiful but there was missing to her a feminine weakness which of all her gifts is the most valuable to an english woman till she makes the mistake of bartering it away for womens rights we can imagine however that the stanchest womansright lady should cry for her lost lover and rachel omahony cried bitterly for hers it had to be done she said jumping up at last in her bedroom and clenching her fist as she walked about the chamber it had to be done a girl situated as i am cannot look too close after herself father is more like my son than my father he has no idea that i want anything done for me nor do i want much she said as she went on rapidly taking the short course of the room no one could say a word about me till i brought my lover forward and showed him to the theatre i think they did believe him to be a myth but a myth in that direction does no harm till he appears in the flesh they think that i have made an empty boast about my mr jones the ugliest girl that ever came out may do the same thing and nobody ever thinks anything of it a lover in the clouds never does any harm and now my lover is in the clouds i know that he has gone and will never come to earth again how much better i love him because he would not take my offer then there would have been a little contempt and how could i expect him to yield to me in everything with this brute moss insulting me at every turn i do not think he had the courage to send me that message but still what could i do but tell frank and then what could frank do but come i would have come let any girl have bade me to stay away here she had imagined herself to be the lover and not the girl who was loved but it only shows that we are better apart he cannot marry me and i cannot marry him the squire is at his wits end with grief by the squire mr jones had been signified it is better as it is father and the squire ought never to have been brought togethernor ought i and frank i suppose i must tell them all at the theatre that mr jones belongs to me no longer only if i did so they would think that i was holding out a lure to mahomet m theres papa ill go down and tell him all that need be told about it so saying she ascended to their sittingroom  well my dear what did you do with frank  he has gone back to ireland under the name of mr jones  then there was a quarrel  oh dear yes there was safe to be a quarrel  does it suit your book upon the whole  not in the least you see before you the most wretched heroine that ever appeared on the boards of any theatre you may laugh but its true i dont know what ive got to say to mr moss now if he comes forward in a proper manner and can prove to me that madame socani is not madame mahomet m moss i dont know what i can do but accept him the adriatic is free to wed another then she walked about the room laughing to prevent her tears  did you hear anything about castle morony  not a word  or the boy florian  not a syllablethough i was most anxious to ask the question when you are intent upon any matter it does not do to go away to other things i should have never made him believe that he was to leave me in earnest had i allowed him to talk about florian and the girls he has gone now wellgoodnight father you and i father are all in all to each other now not but what somebody else will come i suppose  do you wish that somebody else should come as you say  i suppose so do not look so surprised father girls very seldom have to say what they really wish i have done with him now i had him because i really loved himlike a fool as i was i have got to go in for being a singing girl a singing woman is better than a singing girl if they dont have husbands they are supposed to have lovers i hope to have one or the other and i prefer the husband mr jones has gone who knows but what the marquis de carabas may come next  could you change so soon  yesimmediately i dont say i should love the marquis but i should treat him well dont look so shocked dear father i never shall treat a man badlyunless i stick a knife into mahomet m moss it would be best perhaps to get a singing marquis so that the two of us might go walking about the world together till we had got money enough to buy a castle i am beginning to believe m le gros i think i can sing dont you think father that i can sing  they all say so  it is very good to have one about me like you who are not enthusiastic but i can sing and i am pretty toopretty enough along with my singing to get some fool to care for me yes you may look astonished over there in galway i was fool enough to fall in love what has come of it the man tells me that he cannot marry me and it is true if he were to marry me what would become of you  never mind me said her father  and what would become of him and what would become of me and what would become of the dreadful little impediments which might follow of course to me frank jones is the best of men i cant have him and that is just all about it i am not going to give up the world because frank jones is lost love is not to be lord of all with me i shall steer my little boat among the shiny waters of the london theatres and may perhaps venture among the waves of paris and new york but i shall do so always with my eyes open gas is the atmosphere in which i am destined to glitter and if a marquis comes in the waywhy i shall do the best i can with the marquis i wont bring you to trouble if i can help it or anyone else with whom i have to do so goodnight father then she kissed his forehead and went up to bed leaving him to wonder at the intricacies of his position  he had that night been specially eloquent and awfully indignant as to the wrongs done to ireland by england he had dealt with millions of which great britain was supposed by him to have robbed her poor sister he was not a good financier but he did in truth believe in the millions he had not much capacity for looking into questions of political economy but he had great capacity for arguing about them and for believing his own arguments the british parliament was to him an abomination he read the papers daily and he saw that the number of votes on his side fell from sixty to forty and thirty and twenty and he found also that the twenty were men despised by their own countrymen as well as englishmen that they were men trained to play a false game in order to achieve their objectsand yet he believed in the twenty against all the world and threw in his lot without a scruple and without a doubt nor did he understand at all the strength of his own words he had been silenced in ireland and had rigorously obeyed the pledge that he had given for he was a man to whom personally his word was a bond now he had come over to london and being under no promise had begun again to use the words which came to him without an effort as he would sweep back his long hair from his brows and send sparks of fire out of his eyes he would look to be the spirit of patriotic indignation but he did not know that he was thus powerful to tell the truthand as he had saidto earn a few shillings was the object of his ambition but now on this evening three london policemen in their full police uniform with their fearful police helmets on had appeared in the room in which his dramatic associates had on this evening given way to gerald omahonys eloquence nothing had been said to him but as he came home he was aware that two policemen had watched him and he was aware also that his words had been taken down in shorthand then he had encountered his daughter and all her love troubles he had heard her expound her views as to life and had listened as she had expressed her desire to meet with some marquis de carabas she had said nothing with which he could find fault but her whole views of life were absolutely different from his according to his ideas there should be no marquises no singing girls making huge fortunesonly singing girls in receipt of modest sums of money and that when dire necessity compelled them there should be no gorgeous theatres flaring with gas and certainly no policemen to take down mens words everything in the world was wrongexcept those twenty members of parliament  three or four days after this rachel found that a report was abroad at the theatre that she had dissolved her engagement with mr jones at this time the three policemen had already expressed their opinion about mr omahony but they for the present may be left in obscurity estil vrai que m jones nexiste plus these words were whispered to her as she was dressing by madame socani while mr omahony had gone out to say a word to a police detective who had called to see him at the theatre as madame socani was an american woman there was no reason why she should not have asked the question in englishwere it not that as it referred to an affair of love it may be thought that french was the proper language  mr jones isnt any more as far as i am concerned said rachel passing on  oh he has gone said madame socani following her into the slips they were both going on to the stage but two minutes were allowed to them while mahomet m moss declared in piteous accents the woe which awaited him because albertawho was personated by rachelhad preferred the rustic trullo to him who was by birth a prince of the empire  yes mr jones has gone madameas you are so anxious to know  but why can it be that there was no mr jones then rachel flashed round upon the woman i suppose there was no mr jones  o mio tesor these last three words were sung in a delicious contralto voice by elmirathe madame socani of the occasionand were addressed to the prince of the empire who for the last six weeks had been neglecting her charms rachel was furious at the attack made upon her but in the midst of her fury she rushed on to the stage and kneeling at the feet of elmira declared her purpose of surrendering the prince altogether the rustic trullo was quite sufficient for her go fond girl trullo is there tying up the odoriferous rose then they all four broke out into that grand quartette in the performance of which m le gros had formed that opinion which had induced him to hold out such golden hopes to rachel rachel looked up during one of her grand shakes and saw frank jones seated far back among the boxes oh he hasnt left london yet she said to herself as she prepared for another shake  your papa desires me to say with his kindest love that he has had to leave the theatre this came from mr moss when the piece was ended  he was dressed as princes of the empire generally do dress on the stage and she as the daughter of the keeper of the kings garden  so they tell me very well i will go home i suppose he has had business  a policeman i fear some little pecuniary embarrassment a rumour had got about the theatre that mr omahony was overwhelmed with money difficulties mr moss had probably overheard the rumour  i dont believe that at all its something political more likely  very likely i dont know i will see you to your house and mahomet m looked as though he were going to jump into the brougham in the garments of the imperial prince  mr moss i can go very well alone and she turned round upon him and stood in the doorway so as to oppose his coming out and frowned upon him with that look of anger which she knew so well how to assume  i have that to say to you which has to be said at once  you drive about london with me in that dress it would be absurd you are painted all round your eyes i wouldnt get into a carriage with you on any account  in five minutes i will have dressed myself  whether dressed or undressed it does not signify you know very well that i would on no account get into a carriage with you you are taking advantage of me because my father is not here if you accompany me i will call for a policeman directly we get into the street  ah you do not know said mr moss and he looked at her exactly as he had looked about an hour ago when he was making love to her as trullos betrothed  here is my father she said for at that moment mr omahony appeared within the theatre having made his way up from the door in time to take his daughter home  mr omahony said mr moss i shall do myself the honour of calling tomorrow and seeing your daughter at her apartments in gower street  you will see father too said rachel  i shall be delighted said moss it will give me the greatest pleasure on earth to see mr omahony on this occasion so saying the imperial prince made a low bow paint and all and allowed the two to go down into the street and get into the brougham  mr omahony at once began with his own story the policeman who had called for him had led him away round the corner into scotland yard and had there treated him with the utmost deference nothing could be more civil to him than had been the officer but the officer had suggested to him that he had been the man who had said some rough words about the queen in galway and had promised to abstain in future from lecturing to this i replied said he that i had said nothing rough about the queen i had said that the queen was as nearly an angel on earth as a woman could be i had merely doubted whether there should be queens thereupon the policeman shook his head and declared that he could not admit any doubt on that question but you wouldnt expect me to allow it in new york said i youve got to allow it here said he but my pledge was made as to ireland said i it is all written down in some magistrates book and youll find it if you send over there then i told him that i wouldnt break my word for him or his queen either upon that he thanked me very much for my civility and told me that if i would hurry back to the theatre i should be in time to take you home if it was necessary he would let me hear from him again you will know where to find me said i and i gave him our address in farringdon street and told him i should be there tomorrow at halfpast eight he shook hands with me as though i had been his brotherand so here i am  then she began to tell her story but there did not seem to be much of interest in it i suppose hell come said mr omahony  oh yes hell come  its something about m le gros said he youll find that hell abuse that poor frenchman  he may save himself the trouble said rachel then they reached gower street and went to bed having eaten two muttonchops apiece  on the next morning at eleven oclock tidings were brought up to rachel in her bedroom that mr moss was in the sittingroom downstairs  father is there exclaimed rachel  then the girl who had learned to understand that mr moss was not regarded as a welcome visitor assured her that he was at the moment entertained by mr omahony hes atelling of what the perlice said to him in the city but i dont think as the jew gentleman minds him much from which it may be gathered that rachel had not been discreet in speaking of her admirer before the lodginghouse servant  she dressed herself not in a very great hurry her father she knew had no other occupation at this hour in the morning and she did not in the least regard how mr moss might waste his time and she had to think of many things before she could go down to meet him meditating upon it all she was inclined to think that the interview was intended as hostile to m le gros m le gros would be represented no doubt as a jew twice more jewish than mr moss himself but rachel had a strong idea that m le gros was a very nice old french gentleman when he had uttered all those verys one after another with still increasing emphasis rachel had no doubt believed them all and she was taking great trouble with herself practising every day for two hours together with a lookingglass before her on the pianoforte as mr moss had made her quite understand that the opening of her mouth wide was the chief qualification necessary to her beyond that which nature had done for her rachel did think it possible that she might become the undoubted prima donna of the day as m le gros had called her and she thought it much more probable that she should do so under the auspices of m le gros than those of mr moss when therefore she went down at last to the sittingroom she did so determined to oppose mr moss as bidding for her voice rather than as a candidate for her love when she entered the room she could not help beginning with something of an apology in that she had kept the man waiting but mr moss soon stopped her it does not signify the least in the world he said laying his hand upon his waistcoat if only i can get this opportunity of speaking to you while your father is present then when she looked at the brilliance of his garments and heard the tones of his voice she was sure that the attack on this occasion was not to be made on m le gros she remained silent and sat square on her chair looking at him a man must be wellversed in feminine wiles who could decipher under rachels manners her determination to look as ugly as possible on the occasion in a moment she had flattened every jaunty twist and turn out of her habiliments and had given to herself an air of absolute dowdyism her father sat by without saying a word miss omahony if i may venture to ask a question i trust you may not be offended  i suppose not as my father is present she replied  am i right in believing the engagement to be over which bound you to mrjones  you are said rachel quite out loud giving another quite unnecessary twist to her gown  that obstacle is then removed  mr jones is removed and has gone to ireland then mr moss sighed deeply i can manage my singing very well without mrjones  not a doubt not a doubt and i have heard that you have made an engagement in all respects beneficial with m le gros of covent garden m le gros is a gentleman for whom i have a most profound respect  so have i  had i been at your elbow it is possible that something better might have been done but two monthsthey run byoh so quickly  quite so if i can do any good i shall quickly get another engagement  you will no doubt do a great deal of good but mr jones is now at an end  mr jones is at an end said rachel with another blow at her gown a singing girl like me does better without a loverespecially if she has got a father to look after her  thats as may be said mr omahony  thats as may be said mr moss again laying his hand upon his heart the tone in which mr moss repeated mr omahonys words was indicative of the feeling and poetry within him if you had a lover such as is your faithful moss the words seemed to say no father could look after you half so well  i believe i could do very well with no one to look after me  of course you and i have misunderstood each other hitherto  not at all said rachel  i was unaware at first that mr jones was an absolute reality you must excuse me but the name misled me  why shouldnt a girl be engaged to a man named jones jones is as good a name as moss at any rate and a deal more she had been going to remark that jones was the more christian of the two but stopped herself  at any rate you are now free he said  no i am not yes i am i am free and i mean to remain so why dont you tell him father  i have got nothing to tell him my dear you are so much better able to tell him everything yourself  if you would only listen to me miss omahony  you had better listen to him rachel  very well i will listen now go on then she again thumped herself and she had thumped her hair and thumped herself all round till she was as limp and dowdy as the elder sister of a low church clergyman of forty  i wish you to believe miss omahony that my attachment to you is most devoted she pursed her lips together and looked straight out of her eyes at the wall opposite we belong to the same class of life and our careers lie in the same groove hereupon she crossed her hands before her on her lap while her father sat speculating whether she might not have done better to come out on the comic stage i wish you to believe that i am quite sincere in the expression which i make of a most ardent affection here again he slapped his waistcoat and threw himself into an attitude he was by no means an illlooking man and though he was forty years old he did not appear to be so much he had been a public singer all his life and was known by rachel to have been connected for many years with theatres both in london and new york she had heard many stories as to his amorous adventures but knew nothing against his character in money matters he had in truth always behaved well to her in whatever pecuniary transactions there had been between them but he had ventured to make love to her and had done so in a manner which had altogether disgusted her she now waited till he paused for a moment in his eloquence and then she spoke a word  what about madame socani     chapter xix  fifth avenue and newport   what about madame socani rachel as she said this abandoned for the moment her look against the wall and shook herself instantly free of all her dowdiness she flashed fire at him from her eyes and jumping up from her seat took hold of her father by his shoulder he encircled her waist with his arm but otherwise sat silent looking mr moss full in the face it must be acknowledged on the part of rachel that she was prepared to make her accusation against mr moss on perhaps insufficient grounds she had heard among the people at the theatre who did not pretend to know much of mr moss and his antecedents that there was a belief that madame socani was his wife there was something in this which offended her more grossly than everand a wickedness which horrified her but she certainly knew nothing about it and madame socanis proposition to herself had come to her from madame socani and not from mr moss all she knew of madame socani was that she had been on the boards in new york and had there made for herself a reputation rachel had on one occasion sung with her but it had been when she was little more than a child  what is madame socani to me said mr moss  i believe her to be your wife  oh heavens my wife i never had a wife miss omahonynot yet why do you say things so cruel to me  he at any rate she was sure had sent her that message she thought that she was sure of his villainous misconduct to her in that respect she believed that she did know him to be a devil whether he was a married man or not  what message did you send to me by madame socani  what message none and again he laid his hand upon his waistcoat  he asked me to be but she could not tell her father of what nature was the message father he is a reptile if you knew all you would be unable to keep your hands from his throat and now he dares to come here and talk to me of his affection you had better bid him leave the room and have done with him  you hear what my daughter says mr moss  yes i hear her answered the poor innocentlooking tenor but what does she mean why is she so fierce  he knows father said rachel have nothing further to say to him  i dont think that i do quite know said mr omahony but you can see at any rate mr moss that she does not return your feeling  i would make her my wife tomorrow said mr moss slapping his waistcoat once more and do you as the young ladys papa think of what we two might do together i know myself i know my power madame socani is a jealous woman she would wish to be taken into partnership with menot a partnership of hearts but of theatres she has come with some insolent message but not from meah not from me  you never tried to kiss me you did not make two attempts  i would make two thousand if i were to consult my own heart  when you knew that i was engaged to mr jones  what was mr jones to me now i ask your respectable parent is miss rachel unreasonable when a gentleman has lost his heart in true love is he to be reproached because he endeavours to seize one little kiss did not mr jones do the same  bother mr jones said rachel overcome by the absurdity of the occasion as you observed just now mr jones and i are two things have not turned out happily though i am not obliged to explain all that to you but mr jones is to me all that a man should be you mr moss are not now father had he not better go  i dont think any good is to be done i really dont said mr omahony  why am i to be treated in this way  because you come here persevering when you know its no good  i think of what you and i might do together with mosss theatre between us  oh heavens  you should be called the omahony your respectable papa should keep an eye to your pecuniary interest  i could keep an eye myself for that  you would be my own wife of coursemy own wife  i wouldnt be anything of the kind  ah but listen continued mr moss you do not know how the profits run away into the pockets of impresarios and lessees and moneylenders we should have it all ourselves i have £30000 of my own and my respectable parent in new york has as much more it would all be the same as ours only think before long we would have a house on the fifth avenue so furnished that all the world should wonder and another at newport where the world should not be admitted to wonder only think  and madame socani to look after the furniture said rachel  madame socani should be nowheres  and i also will be nowheres pray remember that in making all your little domestic plans if you live in the fifth avenue i will live in 350 street or perhaps i should like it better to have a little house here in albert place father dont you think mr moss might go away  i think you have said all that there is to be said then mr omahony got up from his chair as though to show mr moss out of the room  not quite mr omahony allow me for one moment as the young ladys papa you are bound to look to these things though the theatre would be a joint affair miss omahony would have her fixed salarythat is to say mrs moss would  i wont stand it said rachel getting up i wont allow any man to call me by so abominable a nameor any woman then she bounced out of the room  its no good you see said mr omahony  i by no means see that so certain of course a young lady like your daughter knows her own value and does not yield all at once  i tell you its no good i know my own daughter  excuse me mr omahony but i doubt whether you know the sex  the two men were very nearly of an age but omahony assumed the manners of an old man and mr moss of a young one  perhaps not said mr omahony  they have been my study up from my cradle said mr moss  no doubt  and i think that i have carried on the battle not without some little éclat  i am quite sure of it  i still hope that i may succeed with your sweet daughter  here the battle is of a different kind not without a touch of satire in the tone of his voice whatever there might be in the words which he used in tournaments of love you have i do not doubt been very successful but here it seems to me that the struggle is for money  that is only an accident  but the accident rises above everything it does not matter in the least which comes first whether it be for love or money my daughter will certainly have a will of her own you may take my word that she is not to be talked out of her mind  but mr jones is gone asked moss  but she is not on that account ready to transfer her affections at a moments notice to her view of the matter there seems to be something a little indelicate in the idea  bah said mr moss  you cannot make her change her mind by saying bah  professional interests have to be considered said mr moss  no doubt my daughter does consider her professional interests every day when she practises for two hours  that is excellentand with such glorious effects she has only now got the full use of her voice my g what could she not do if she had the full run of mosss theatre she might choose whatever operas would suit her best and she would have me to guide her judgment i do know my profession mr omahony a lady in her line should always marry a gentleman in mine that is if she cares about matrimony  of course she did intend to be married to mr jones  oh mr jones mr jones i am sick of mr jones what could mr jones do he is only a poor ruined irishman you must feel that mr jones was only in the way i am offering her all that professional experience and capital can do what are her allurements  i dont in the least know mr moss  only her beauty  i thought perhaps it was her singing  that joined said mr moss no doubt her voice and her beauty joined together madame socanis voice is as valuablealmost as valuable  i would marry madame socani if i were you  no madame socani iswell a leetle past her prime madame socani and i have known each other for twenty years madame socani is aware that i am attached to your daughter well i do not mind telling you the truth madame socani and i have been on very intimate terms i did offer once to make madame socani my wife she did not see her way in money matters she was making an income greater than mine things have changed since that madame socani is very well but she is a jealous woman madame socani hates your daughter oh heavens yes but she was never my wife oh no a woman at this profession grows old quicker than a man and she has never succeeded in getting a theatre of her own she did try her hand at it at new york but that came to nothing if miss rachel will venture along with me we will have 500000 dollars before five years are gone she shall have everything that the world can offerjewels furniture hangings she shall keep the best table in new york and shall have her own bankers account theres no such success to be found anywhere for a young woman if you will only just turn it in your mind mr omahony then mr moss brushed his hat with the sleeve of his coat and took his leave  he had nearly told the entire truth to mr omahony he had never married madame socani as far as madame socani knew her veritable husband socani was still alive and it was not true that mr moss had sent that abominable message to rachel the message no doubt had expressed a former wish on his part but that wish was now in abeyance miss omahonys voice had proved itself to him to be worth matrimonythat and her beauty together in former days when he had tried to kiss her he had valued her less highly now as he left the room he was fully content with the bargain he had suggested mr jones was out of the way and her voice had proved itself to his judgment to be worth the price he had offered  when her father saw her again he began meekly to plead for mr moss  do you mean to say father she exclaimed that you have joined yourself to him  i am only telling you what he says  tell me nothing at all you ought to know that he is an abomination though he had the whole fifth avenue to offer to me i would not touch him with a pair of tongs  but she in the midst of her singing had been much touched by seeing frank jones among the listeners in the back of one of the boxes when the piece was over there had come upon her a desire to go to him and tell him that in spite of all she had said she would wait for him if only he would profess himself ready to wait for her there was not much in itthat a man should wait in town for two or three days and should return to the theatre to see the girl whom he professed to regard it was only that but it had again stirred her love she had endeavoured to send to him when the piece was over but he was gone and she saw him no more     chapter xx  boycotting   frank jones went back to county galway having caught a last glimpse of his ladylove but his ladylove could not very well make herself known to him from the stage as she was occupied at the moment with trullo and as he had left the theatre before her message had been brought round he did so with a bitter conviction that everything between them was over he felt very angry with herno doubt unreasonably the lady was about to make a pocketful of money and had offered to share it with him he refused to take any part of it and declined altogether to incur any of the responsibilities of marriage for the present his fathers circumstances too were of such a nature as to make him almost hopeless for the future what would he have had her do nevertheless he was very angry with her  as he made his way westward through ireland he heard more and more of the troubles of the country he had not in fact been gone much more than a week but during that week sad things had happened boycotting had commenced and had already become very prevalent to boycott a man or a house or a firm or a class of men or a trade or a flock of sheep or a drove of oxen or unfortunately a county hunt had become an exact science and was exactly obeyed it must be acknowledged that throughout the south and west of ireland the quickness and perfection with which this science was understood and practised was very much to the credit of the intelligence of the people we can understand that boycotting should be studied in yorkshire and practisedafter an experience of many years laying on one side for the moment all ideas as to the honesty and expediency of the measure we think that yorkshire might in half a century learn how to boycott its neighbours a yorkshire man might boycott a lancashire man or lincoln might boycott nottingham it would require much teachingmany books would have to be written and an infinite amount of heavy slow imperfect practice would follow but county mayo and county galway rose to the requirements of the art almost in a night gradually we englishmen learned to know in a dull glimmering way what they were about but at the first whisper of the word all ireland knew how to ruin itself this was done readily by people of the poorer classwithout any gifts of education and certainly the immoderate practice of the science displays great national intelligence  as frank jones passed through dublin he learned that morony castle had been boycotted and he was enough of an irishman to know immediately what was meant and he heard too while in the train that the kennels at ahaseragh had been boycotted he knew that with the kennels would be included black daly and with morony castle his unfortunate father according to the laws on which the practice was carried on nothing was to be bought from the land of morony castle and nothing sold to the owners of it no service was to be done for the inhabitants as far as the laws of boycotting might be made to prevail he learned from a newspaper he bought in dublin that the farm servants had all left the place and that the maids had been given to understand that they would encounter the wrath of the new lords in the land if they made a bed for any jones to lie upon  as he went on upon his journey his imagination went to work to picture to himself the state of his fathers life under these circumstances but his imagination was soon outstripped by the information which reached him from fellowtravellers did ye hear what happened to old phil jones down at morony said a passenger who got in at moate to another who had joined them at athlone  divil a hear thin  old phil wanted to get across from ballyglunin to his own place he had been down to athenry there was that chap who is always there with a car divil a foot would he stir for phil phil has had some row with the boys there about his meadows and hes trying to prosecute more fool he a quiet aisygoing fellow he used to be but it seems he has been stirred now he has got some man in galway jail and all the country is agin him anyways he had to foot it from ballyglunin to headford and then to send home to morony for his own car in this way did frank learn that his father had in truth incurred boycotting severity he knew well the old man who had attended the ballyglunin station with almost a hopeless desire of getting a fare and was sure that nothing short of an imperious edict from the great landleaguing authorities in the district would have driven him to the necessity of repudiating a passenger  but when he had reached the further station of ballinasloe he learned sadder tidings in regard to his friend tom daly tom daly had put no man in prison and yet the kennels at ahaseragh had been burned to the ground this had occurred only on the preceding day and he got the account of what had happened from a hunting man he knew well the hounds were out you know last saturday week as a finish and poor tom did hope that we might get through without any further trouble we met at ballinamona and we drew blakes coverts without a word we killed our fox too and then went away to pulhaddin gorse ill be blest if all the county werent there i never saw the boys swarm about a place so thick pulhaddin is the best gorse in the county of course it was no use drawing it but as we were going away on the road to loughrea the crowd was so thick that there was no riding among them ever so many horsemen got into the fields to be away from the crowd but tom wouldnt allow barney and the hounds to be driven from the road i never saw a man look so angry in my life you could see the passion that was on him he never spoke a word nor raised a hand nor touched his horse with his spur but he got blacker and blacker and would go on whether the crowd moved asunder or not and he told barney to follow him with the hounds which barney did looking back ever and anon at the poor brutes and giving his instructions to the whips to see well after that they did not wander they threatened barney scores of times with their sticks but he came on funking awfully but still doing whatever tom told him i was riding just behind him among the hounds so that i could see all that took place at last a ruffian with his shillelagh struck barney over the thigh i had not time to get to him indeed i doubt whether i should have done so but tom by george he saw out of the back of his head he turned round and without touching his horse with spur or whip rode right at the ruffian if they had struck himself i think he would have borne it more easily  how did it end  they said that the blackguard was hurt but i saw him escape and get away over the fence then they all set upon tom but by g it was glorious to see the way in which he held his own out came that cross of his four foot and a half long with a thong as heavy as a flail he soon had the road clear around him and the big black horse you remember stood as steady as a statue till he was bidden to move on then when he had the hounds and barney smith and the whips to himselfand i was therewe all rode off at a fast trot to loughrea  and then  we could do nothing but go home the whole county seemed to be in a ferment at loughrea we went away in our own directions and poor tom with barney smith rode home to ahaseragh but not a word did he speak to anyone even to barney nor did barney dare to speak a word to him he trotted all the way to ahaseragh in moody silence thinking of the terrible ill that had been done him i have known tom for twenty years and i think that if he loves any man he loves me but he parted from me that day without a word  and then the kennels were set on fire  before i left loughrea i heard the report spread about everywhere that tom daly had recklessly ridden down three or four more poor countrymen on the road i knew then that some mischief would be in hand it was altogether untrue that he had hurt anyone and he was bound to interfere on behalf of his own servant but when i heard this morning that a score of men had been there in the night and had burned the kennels to the ground i was not surprised such was the story that frank jones heard as to tom daly before he got home  on reaching ballyglunin he looked out for the carman but he was not there perhaps the interference with his task had banished him frank went on to tuam which increased slightly the distance by road to morony but at tuam he found that morony had in truth been boycotted he could not get a car for love or money there were many cars there and the men would not explain to him their reasons for declining to take him home but they all refused we cant do it mr frank said one man and that was the nearest approach to an explanation that was forthcoming he walked into town and called at various houses but it was to no purpose it was with difficulty that he found himself allowed to leave his baggage at a grocers shop so strict was the boycotting exacted and then he too had to walk home through headford to morony castle  when he reached the house he first encountered peter the butler faix thin mr frank said peter throubles niver comed in arnest till now why didnt they allow mr flory just to hould his pace and say nothing about it to no one  why has all this been done demanded frank  its that born divil pat carroll whispered peter i wouldnt be saying it so that any of the boys or girls should hear menot for my throats sake i am the only one of em he added whispering still lower than before thats doing a haporth for the masther there are the two young ladies aworking their very fingers off down to the knuckles as for me ive got it all on my shoulders no doubt peter was true to his master in adversity but he did not allow the multiplicity of his occupations to interfere with his eloquence  then frank went in and found his father seated alone in his magistrates room this is bad father said frank taking him by the hand  bad yes you may call it bad i am ruined i suppose there are twenty heifers ready for market next week and i am told that not a butcher in county galway will look at one of them  then you must send them on to westmeath i suppose the mullingar butchers wont boycott you  its just what they will do  then send them on to dublin  whos to take them to dublin said the father in his distress  i will if there be no one else we are not going to be knocked out of time for want of two or three pairs of hands  there are two policemen here to watch the herd at night theyd cut the tails off them otherwise as they did over at ballinrobe last autumn to whom am i to consign em in dublin while i am making new arrangements of that kind their time will have gone by there are five cows should be milked morning and night who is to milk them  who is milking them  your sisters are doing it with the aid of an old woman who has come from galway she says she has not long to live and with the help of halfacrown a day cares nothing for the landleaguers i wish someone would pay me halfacrown a day and perhaps i should not care  then frank passed on through the house to find his sisters or flory as it might be he had said not a word to his father in regard to florian fearing to touch upon a subject which as he well knew must be very sore had florian told the truth when the deed was done pat carroll would have been tried at once and whether convicted or acquitted the matter would have been over long ago in those days pat carroll had not become a national or even a county hero but now he was able to secure the boycotting of his enemy even as far distant as ballyglunin or tuam in the kitchen he found ada and edith who had no comfort in these perilous days except when they could do everything together at the present moment they were roasting a leg of mutton and boiling potatoes which frank knew were intended especially for his own eating  well my girls you are busy here he said  oh yes busy said ada who had put up her face to be kissed so as not to soil her brothers coat by touching it with her hands how is rachel  rachel is pretty well i believe we will not talk of rachel just at present  is anything wrong asked edith  we will not talk about her not now what is all this that has happened here  we are just boycotted said ada thats all  and you think that its the best joke in the world  think it a joke said edith  why we have to be up every morning at five oclock said ada and at six we are out with the cows  it is no joke said edith very seriously papa is brokenhearted about it your coming will be of the greatest comfort to us if only because of the pair of hands you bring and poor flory  how has it gone with flory he asked then edith told the tale as it had to be told of florian and of what had happened because of the evidence he had given he had come forward under the hands of captain yorke clayton and repeated his whole story giving it in testimony before the magistrates he declared it all exactly as he had done before in the presence of his father and his sister and captain clayton and he had sworn to it and had had his deposition read to him he was sharp enough and understood well what he was doing the other two men were brought up to support himthe old man terry and con heffernan they of course had not been present at the examination of flory and were askedfirst one and then the otherwhat they knew of the transactions of the afternoon on which the waters had been let in on the meadows of ballintubber they knew nothing at all they said they disremembered whether they had been there on the occasion at all at all yes they knew that the waters had been in upon the meadows and they believed that they were in again still they didnt think that the meadows were of much good for this year they didnt know who had done it at all at all people did be saying that mr florian had done it himself so as to spite his father because he had turned catholic they couldnt say whether mr florian could do it alone or not they thought mr florian and peter the butler and perhaps one other might do it amongst them they thought that yorke clayton might perhaps have been the man to help him they didnt know that yorke clayton hadnt been in the county at that time they wished with all their hearts that he wasnt there now because he was the biggest blackguard they had ever heard tell of  such was the story which was now told to frank of the examination which took place in consequence of florians confession the results were that pat carroll was in galway jail committed to take his trial at the next assizes in august for the offence which he had committed and that florian had been bound over to give evidence what does florian do with himself his brother asked  i am afraid he is frightened said ada  of course he is frightened said her sister how should he not be frightened these men have been telling him for the last six months that they would surely murder him if he turned round and gave evidence against them oh frank i fear that i have been wrong in persuading him to tell the truth  not though his life were sacrificed tomorrow to have kept the counsels of such a ruffian as that against his own father would have been a disgrace to him for ever does not my father think of sending him to england  he says that he has not the money said edith  is it so bad as that with him  i am afraid it is very badbad at any rate for the time coming he has not had a shilling of rent for this spring and he has to pay the money to mrs pulteney and the others poor papa is sorely vexed and we do not like to press him he suggested himself that he would send florian over to mr blakes but we think that carnlough is not far enough and that it would be unfair to impose such a trouble on another man  could he not send him to mrs pulteney now mrs pulteney was a sister of mr jones  he does not like to ask her said edith he thinks that mrs pulteney has not shown herself very kind of late we are waiting till you speak to him about it  but what does florian do with himself he asked  you will see he does little or nothing but roams about the house and talks to peter he did not even go to mass last sunday he says that the whole congregation would accuse him of being a liar  does he not know that he has done his duty by the lie he has told  but to go alone among these people said ada  and to hear their damnable taunts said edith it is very hard upon him i think it is papas idea to keep him here till after the trial in august and then if possible to send him to england there would be the double journey else and papa thinks that there would be no real danger till his evidence had been given  then frank went out of the house and walked round the demesne so that he might think at his ease of all the troubles of his family     chapter xxi  lax the murderer   frank jones found his brother florian alone in the butlers pantry and was told that peter was engaged in feeding the horses and cleaning out the stables hes mostly engaged in that kind of work now said florian  who lays the tablecloth asked frank  i do or edith sometimes we dont have any tablecloth or any clean knives and forks perhaps theyll have one today because you have come  i wouldnt give them increased trouble said frank  papa told them to put their best foot forward because you are here i dont think he minds at all about himself i think papa is very unhappy  of course hes unhappy because they have boycotted him how should he not be unhappy  its worse than that whispered florian  what can be worse  if youll come with me ill tell you i dont want to say it here because the girls will hear meand that old peter will know everything thats said  come out into the grounds and take a turn before dinner at this florian shook his head why not flory  there are fellows about said flory  what fellows  the very fellows that said theyd kill me do you know that fellow lax hes the worst of them  but he doesnt live here  all the same i saw him yesterday  you were out then yesterday  not to say out said flory i was in the orchard just behind the stables and i could see across into the tenacre piece there at the further side of the field i saw a fellow who i am sure was lax nobody walks like him hes got that quick suspicious way of going it was just nearly dark it was wellnigh seven and i had been with peter in the stables helping to make up the horses and i am sure it was lax  he wont come near you and me on the broad walk said frank  wont he you dont know him there are halfadozen places there where he could hit us from behind the wall come up into your room and ill tell you what it is that makes papa unhappy then frank led the way upstairs to his bedroom and florian followed him when inside he shut the door and seated himself on the bed close to his brother now ill tell you said he  what is it ails him  hes frightened said florian because he doesnt wish me to bemurdered  my poor boy who could wish it here florian shook his head of course he doesnt wish it  he made me tell about the meadow gates  you had to tell that flory  but it will bring them to murder me if you had heard them make me promise and had seen their looks papa never thought about that till the man had come and worked it all out of me  what man  the head of the policemen yorke clayton papa was so fierce upon me then that he made me do it  you had to do it said frank let things go as they might you had to do it you would not have it said of you that you had joined these ruffians against your father  i had sworn to father brosnan not to tell but you care nothing for a priest of course  nothing in the least  nor does father but when i had told it all at his bidding and had gone before the magistrates and they had written it down and that man clayton had read it all and i had signed it and papa had seen the look which pat carroll had turned upon me then he became frightened i knew that that man lax was in the room at the moment i did not see him but i felt that he was there now i dont go out at all except just into the orchard and front garden i wont go even there as i saw lax about the place yesterday i know that they mean to murder me  there will be no danger said frank unless carroll be convicted in that case your father will have you sent to a school in england  papa hasnt got the money i heard him tell edith so and they wouldnt know how to carry me to the station at ballyglunin those boys from ballintubber would shoot at me on the road its that that makes papa so unhappy  then they all went to dinner with a cloth laid fair on the table for frank who was as it were a stranger and there were many inquiries made after rachel and her theatrical performances tidings as to her success had already reached morony and wonderful accounts of the pecuniary results they had seen stories in the newspapers of the close friendship which existed between her and mr moss and hints had been given for a closer tie i dont think it is likely said frank  but is anything the matter between you and rachel asked edith  at that moment peter was walking off with the leg of mutton and ada had run into the kitchen to fetch the rice pudding which she had made to celebrate her brothers return edith winked at her brother to show that all questions as to the tender subject should be postponed for the moment  but is it true said ada that rachel is making a lot of money  that is true certainly said her brother  and that she sings gloriously  she always did sing gloriously said edith i was sure that rachel was intended for a success  i wonder what captain yorke clayton would think about her said ada he does understand music and is very fond of young ladies who can sing i heard him say that the miss ormesbys of castlebar sang beautifully and he sings himself i know  captain clayton has something else to do at present than to watch the career of miss omahony in london this was said by their father and was the first word he had spoken since they had sat down to dinner it was felt to convey some reproach as to rachel but why a reproach was necessary was not explained  peter was now out of the room and the door was shut  rachel and i have come to understand each other said frank she is to have the spending of her money by herself and i by myself am to enjoy life at morony castle  is this her decision asked edith  it was on franks lips to declare that it was so but he remembered himself and swallowed down the falsehood unspoken  no he said it was not her decision she offered to share it all with me  and you said his father  well i didnt consent and so we arranged that matters should be brought to an end between us  i knew what she would do said ada  just what she ought said edith rachel is a fine girl nothing else was to be expected from her  and nothing else was possible with you said their father and so that conversation was brought to an end  on the next day captain clayton came up the lake from galway and was again engagedor pretended to be engagedin looking up for evidence in reference to the trial of pat carroll or it might be that he wanted to sun himself again in the bright eyes of ada jones again he brought hunter his double with him and boldly walked from morony castle into headford disregarding altogether the loaded guns of pat carrolls friends in company with frank he paid a visit to tom lafferty in his own house at headford but as he went there he insisted that frank should carry a brace of pistols in his trousers pockets its as well to do it though you should never use them or a great deal better that you should never use them you dont want to get into all the muck of shooting a wretched cowardly landleaguer if all the leaders had but one life among them there would be something worth going in for but it is well that they should believe that you have got them they are such cowards that if they know youve got a pistol with you they will be afraid to get near enough to shoot you with a rifle if you are in a room with fellows who see that you have your hand in your trousers pocket they will be in such a funk that you cow halfadozen of them they look upon hunter and me as though we were an armed company of policemen so frank carried the pistols  well mr lafferty how are things going with you today  deed then captain clayton it aint much as im able to say for myself ive the decentry that bad in my innards as im all in the twitters  im sorry for that mr lafferty are you well enough to tell me where did mr lax go when he left you this morning  whos mr lax i dont know no such person  dont you now i thought that mr lax was as wellknown in headford as the parish priest why hes first cousin to your second cousin pat carroll  deed and he aint thennot that i ever heard tell of  ive no doubt you know what relations hes got in these parts  i dont know nothin about terry lax  except that his name is terry said the captain  i dont know nothin about him and i wont tell nothin either  but he was here this morning mr lafferty  not that i know of i wont say nothin more about him its as bad as lying you are with that dd artful way of entrapping a fellow  here terry carroll pats brother entered the cabin and took off his hat with an air of great courtesy more power to you mr frank he said its i that am glad to see you back from london these are bad tidings they got up at the castle to think of mr flory having such a story to tell as that  its a true story at any rate said frank  musha thin not one o us rightly knows its a long time ago and if i were there at all i disremember it maybe i was though i wasnt doing anything on me own account if pat was to bid me id do that or any other mortal thing at pats bidding  if you are so good a brother as that your complaisance is likely to bring you into trouble mr carroll come along jones ive got pretty nearly what i wanted from them then when they were in the street he continued speaking to frank your brother is right though i wouldnt have believed it on any other testimony than one of themselves that man lax was here in the county yesterday a more murderous fellow than he is not to be found in connaught and hes twice worse than any of the fellows about here they will do it for revenge or party purposes he has a regular tariff for cutting throats i should not wonder if he has come here for the sake of carrying out the threats which they made against your poor brother  do you mean that he will be murdered  we must not let it come to that we must have lax up before the magistrate for having been present when they broke the flood gates  have you got evidence of that  we can make the evidence serve its purpose for a time if we can keep him locked up till after the trial we shall have done much by heavens there he is  as he spoke the flash of a shot glimmered across their eyes and seemed to have been fired almost within a yard of them but they were neither of them hit frank turned round and fired in the direction from whence the attack had come but it was in vain clayton did bring his revolver from out his pocket but held his fire they were walking in a lane just out of the town that would carry them by a fieldpath to morony castle and clayton had chosen the path in order that he might be away from the public road it was still daylight though it was evening and the aggressor might have been seen had he attempted to cross their path the lane was as it were built up on both sides with cabins which had become ruins each one of which might serve as a hidingplace hunter was standing close to them before another word was spoken  did you see him demanded clayton  not a glimpse but i heard him through there where the dead leaves are lying there were a lot of dead leaves strewed about some of which were in sight within an enclosure separated from them by a low ruined wall on leaving this the captain was over it in a moment but he was over it in vain for gods sake sir dont go after him in that way said hunter who followed close upon his track its no more than to throw your life away  id give the world to have one shot at him said clayton i dont think i would miss him within ten paces  but hed have had you captain within three had he waited for you  he never would have waited a man who fires at you from behind a wall never will wait where on earth has he taken himself and clayton with the open pistol in his hand began to search the neighbouring hovels  hes away out of that by this time said hunter  i heard the bullet pass by my ears said frank  no doubt you did but a miss is as good as a mile any day that a fellow like that who is used to shooting shouldnt do better is a disgrace to the craft its that fellow lax and as im standing on the ground this moment ill have his life before ive done with him  nothing further came from this incident till the three started on their walk back to morony castle but they did not do this till they had thoroughly investigated the ruins do you know anything of the man said frank as to his whereabouts or where he comes from then clayton gave some short account of the hero he had first come across him in the neighbourhood of foxford near lough conn and had there run him very hard as the captain said in reference to an agrarian murder he knew he said that the man had received thirty shillings for killing an old man who had taken a farm from which a tenant had been evicted but he had on that occasion been tried and acquitted he had since that lived on the spoils acquired after the same fashion he was supposed to have come originally from kilkenny and whether his real name was or was not lax captain clayton did not pretend to say  but he had a fair shot at me said captain clayton and it shall go hard with me but i shall have as fair a one at him i think it was urlingford gave the fellow his birth i doubt whether he will ever see urlingford again  so they walked back and by the time they had reached the castle were quite animated and lively with the little incident it may be possible said the captain to mr jones that he expected my going to headford it certainly was known in galway yesterday that i was to come across the lake this morning and the tidings may have come up by some fellowtraveller he would drop word with some of the boys at ballintubber as he passed by and they might have thought it likely that i should go to headford they have had their chance on this occasion and they have not done any good with it     chapter xxii  morony castle is boycotted   the men seemed to make a good joke of the afternoons employment but not so the young ladies in the evening they had a little music and captain clayton declared that the miss ormesbys were grand performers and i am told that they are lovely girls said ada  well yes lovely is a very strong word  id rather be called lovely than anything said ada  now captain clayton said edith if you wish for my respect dont fall into the trap which ada has so openly laid for you  i meant nothing of the kind said ada i hope that captain clayton knows me better but captain clayton you dont mean that youll walk down to the boat tomorrow  why not hell never have the pluck to fire at me two days running and i doubt whether hell allow me so fair a chance of seeing him  i wonder how you can sleep at night knowing that such a man as this is always after your life  i wonder whether he sleeps at night when he thinks such a man as i am after his life and i allow him to boot all his walks and hidingplaces then ada began to implore him not to be too rash she endeavoured to teach him that no good could come from such foolhardiness if his life was of no value to himself it was of great value to othersto his mother for instance and to his sister a mans life is of no real value said the captain until he has got a wife and familyor at any rate a wife  you dont think the wife that is to be need mind it said edith  the wife that is to be must be in the clouds and in all probability will never come any nearer i cannot allow that a man can be justified in neglecting his duties for the sake of a cloudy wife  not in neglecting absolute duties said ada sadly  a man in my position neglects his duty if he leaves a stone unturned in pursuit of such a blackguard as this and when a man is used to it he likes it theres your brother quite enjoyed being shot at just as though he were resident magistrate at any rate he looked as though he did  so the conversation went on through the evening during the whole of which poor florian made one of the party he said very little but sat close to his sister edith who frequently had his hand in her own the captain constantly had his eye upon him without seeming to watch him but still was thinking of him as the minutes flew by it was not that the boy was in danger for the captain thought the danger to be small and that it was reduced almost to nothing as long as he remained in the housebut what would be the effect of fear on the boys mind and if he were thus harassed could he be expected to give his evidence in a clear manner mr jones was not present after dinner having retired at once to his own room but just as the girls had risen to go to bed and as florian was preparing to accompany them peter brought a message saying that mr jones would be glad to see captain clayton before he went for the night then the captain got up and bidding them all farewell followed peter to mr joness room i shall go on by the early boat he said as he was leaving the room  youll have breakfast first at any rate said ada the captain swore that he wouldnt and the girls swore that he should we never let anybody go without breakfast said ada  and particularly not a man said edith who has just been shot at on our behalf but the captain explained that it might be as well that he should be down waiting for the boat half an hour at any rate before it started  i and hunter said he would have a fair look out around us there so that no one could get within rifle shot of us without our seeing them and they wont look out for us so early i dont think much of mr laxs courage but it may be as well to keep a watch when it can be so easily done then ada went off to her bed resolving that the breakfast should be ready though it was an hour before the boat time the boat called at the wharf at eight in the morning and the wharf was three miles distant from the house she could manage to have breakfast ready at halfpast six  ada my girl said edith as they departed together dont you make a fool of that young man  what do you mean by that  didnt you tell me that a man who has to be shot at ought not to be married and didnt he say that he would leave his future wife up among the clouds  he may leave her where he likes for me said ada when a man is doing so much for us oughtnt he to have his breakfast ready for him at halfpast six oclock there was no more then said between them on that subject but edith resolved that as far as boiling the water was concerned she would be up as soon as ada  when the captain went into mr joness room he was asked to sit down and had a cigar offered to him thanks no i dont think ill smoke smoking may have some sort of effect on a fellows hand theres a gentleman in these parts who i should be sorry should owe his life to any little indulgence of that sort on my behalf  you are thinking of the man who fired at you  well yes i am not that i shall have any chance at him just at present he wont come near me again this visit the next that i shall hear from him will be from round some corner in the neighbourhood of galway i think i know every turn in that blackguards mind  have you been speaking to florian about him captain clayton  not a word  nor has his brother  i think not  what am i to do about the poor boy said the anxious father  because of his fear about this very man  he is only a boy you know  of course he is only a boy youve no right to expect from him the pluck of a man when he is as old as his brother hell have his brothers nerve i like to see a man plucky under fire when he is not used to it when youve got into the way of it it means nothing  what am i do about florian there are four months before the assizes he cannot remain in the house for four months  what would he be at the end of it said the captain that is what we have to think of  would it alter him  i suppose it wouldif he were here with his sister talking of nothing but this wretched man who seems to haunt him we have to remember mr jones how long it was before he came forward with his story  i think he will be firm with it now  no doubtif he had to tell it out in direct evidence when he is there in the court telling it he will not think much of mr lax nor even of pat carroll who will be in the dock glaring at him nor would he think much of anything but his direct story while a friendly barrister is drawing it out of him but when it comes to his crossexamination it will be different he will want all his pluck then and all the simplicity which he can master you must remember that a skilful man will have been turned loose on him with all the ferocity of a bloodhound a man who will have all the cruelty of lax but will have nothing to fear a man who will be serving his purpose all round if he can only dumbfound that poor boy by his words and his looks a man when he has taken up the cause of these ruffians learns to sympathise with them if they hate the queen hate the laws hate all justice these men learn to hate them too when they get hold of me and i look into the eyes of such a one i see there my bitterest enemy he holds captain yorke clayton up to the hatred of the whole court as though he were a brute unworthy of the slightest mercya venomous reptile against whom the whole country should rise to tear him in pieces and i look round and see the same feeling written in the eyes of them all i found it more hard to get used to that than to the snap of a pistol but i have got used to it poor florian will have had no such experience and there will be no mercy shown to him because he is only a boy neither sex nor age is supposed to render any such feeling necessary to a lawyer a lawyer in defending the worst ruffian that ever committed a crime will know that he is called upon to spare nothing that is tender he is absolved from all the laws common to humanity and then poor florian has lied a gloomy look of sad dull pain came across the fathers brow as he heard these words we must look it in the face mr jones  yes look it all in the face  he has repeated the lie again and again for six months he has been in close friendship with these men it will be made out that he has been present at all their secret meetings he has been present at some of them it will be very hard to get a jury to convict on his evidence if it be unsupported  shall we withdraw him asked mr jones  you cannot do it his deposition has been sworn and put forward in the proper course besides it is his duty and yoursand mine he added he must tell his story once again and must endure whatever torment the lawrebels of the court have in store for him only it will be well to think what course of treatment may best prepare him for the trial you should treat him with the greatest kindness  he is treated kindly  but you i think and his sisters and his brother should endeavour to make him feel that you do not think harshly of him because of the falsehoods he has told go out with him occasionally here mr jones raised his eyebrows as feeling surprised at the kind of counsel given put some constraint on yourself so as to make him feel by the time he has to go into court with you that he has a friend with him  i trust that he always feels that said mr jones  they went on discussing the matter till late at night and captain clayton made the father understand what it was that he intended he meant that the boy should be made to know that his father was to him as are other fathers in spite of the lie which he had told and of the terrible trouble which he had caused by telling it but mr jones felt that the task imposed upon him would be almost impossible he was heavy at heart and unable to recall to himself his old spirits he had been thoroughly ashamed of his son and was not possessed of that agility of heart which is able to leap into goodhumour at once florian had been restored to his old manner of life sitting at table with his father and occasionally spoken to by him he had been so far forgiven but the father was still aware that there was still a dismal gap between himself and his younger boy as regarded that affectionate intercourse which captain clayton recommended and yet he knew that it was needed and resolved that he would do his best however imperfectly it might be done  on the next morning the captain went his way and did ample homage to the kindly exertions made on his behalf by the two girls now i know you must have been up all night for you couldnt have done it all without a servant in the house  how dare you belittle our establishment said ada what do you think of peter is peter nobody and it was poor florian who boiled the kettle i really dont know whether we should not get on better altogether without servants than with them the breakfast was eaten both by the captain in the parlour and by hunter in the kitchen in great good humour now my fine fellow said the former have you got your pistols ready i dont think we shall want them this morning but its as well not to give these fellows a chance hunter was pleased by being thus called into council before the young ladies and they both started in the highest good humour captain clayton as he went told himself that ada jones was the prettiest girl of his acquaintance his last sentimental affinity with the youngest miss ormesby waxed feeble and insipid as he thought of ada perhaps edith he said to himself is the sharpest of the two but in good looks she cant hold a candle to her sister so he passed on and with his myrmidon reached galway without incurring any impediment from mr lax  in the course of the morning mr jones sent for florian and proposed to walk out with him about the demesne i dont think there will be any danger he said captain clayton went this morning and the people dont know yet whether he has gone i think it is better that you should get accustomed to it and not give way to idle fears the boy apparently agreed to this and got his hat but he did not leave the shelter of the house without sundry misgivings mr jones had determined to act at once upon the captains advice and had bethought himself that he could best do so by telling the whole truth to the boy now florian i think it would be as well that you and i should understand each other florian looked up at him with fearful eyes but made no reply of course i was angry with you while you were hesitating about those ruffians  yes you were said florian  i can quite understand that you have felt a difficulty  yes i did said florian  but that is all over now  if they dont fire at me it is over i suppose till august  they shant fire at you dont be afraid if they fire at you they must fire at me too the father was walking with his arm about the boys neck you at any rate shall incur no danger which i do not share you will understandwont youthat my anger against you is passed and gone  i dont know said the boy  it is soaltogether i hope to be able to send you to school in england very soon after the trial is over you shall go to mr monro at first and to winchester afterwards if i can manage it but we wont think of winchester just at present we must do the best we can to get a good place for you on your first going into the school  i am not afraid about that said florian thinking that at the time when the school should have come all the evils of the trials would have been passed away and gone  all the same you might come and read with me every morning for an hour and then for an hour with each of your sisters you will want something to do to make up your time and remember florian that all my anger has passed away we will be the best of friends as in former days so that when the time shall have come for you to go into court you may be quite sure that you have a friend with you there  to all this florian made very little reply but mr jones remembered that he could not expect to do much at a first attempt weary as the task would be he would persevere for the task would be weary even with his own son he was a man who could do nothing graciously which he could not do con amore and he felt that all immediate warm liking for the poor boy had perished in his heart the boy had made himself the friend of such a one as pat carroll and in his friendship for him had lied grossly mr jones had told himself that it was his duty to forgive him and had struggled to perform his duty for the performance of any deed necessary for the boys security he could count upon himself but he could not be happy in his company as he was with edith the boy had been foully untrue to himbut still he would do his best     chapter xxiii  tom daly is boycotted   when the time came round frank jones started for ballinasloe with his fathers cattle and with peter to help him they did succeed in getting a boy to go with them who had been seduced by a heavy bribe to come down for the purpose from ballinasloe to morony castle as he had been used to cattle peters ignorance and franks also were of less account they drove the cattle to tuam and there got them on the railway the railway with its servants being beyond the power of the boycotters at ballinasloe they could not sell the cattle as the name of mr jones of morony had become terribly notorious throughout county galway but arrangements had been made to send them to a salesman up in dublin and from ballinasloe they had gone under the custody of peter and the boy no attempt was made absolutely to harm the beasts or even to stop them in the streets but throughout the town it seemed to be perfectly understood that they were the property of philip jones of morony castle and that philip jones had been boycotted by the league the poor beasts were sent on to dublin without a truss of hay among them and even frank himself was refused a meal at the first inn at which he had called he did afterwards procure accommodation but he heard while in the house that the innkeeper was threatened for what he had done had it not been that peter had brought with him a large basket of provisions for himself and the boy they too would have been forced to go on dinnerless and supperless to dublin  frank on his way back home resolved that he would call on mr daly at dalys bridge near castle blakeney it was dalys wont to live at dalys bridge when the hounds were not hunting though he would generally go four or five times a week from dalys bridge to the kennels to castle blakeney a public car was running and the public car did not dare or probably did not wish to boycott anyone he walked up to the open door at dalys bridge and soon found himself in the presence of black tom daly so you are boycotted said tom  horse foot and dragoons said frank  whats to come of it i wonder tom as he said this was sitting at an open window making up some horses drug to which was attached some very strong odour i am boycotted too and the poor hounds which have given hours of amusement to many of these wretches for which they have not been called upon to pay a shilling i shall have to sell the pack im afraid said tom sadly  not yet i hope mr daly  what do you mean by that whos to keep them without any subscription and whos to subscribe without any prospect of hunting for the matter of that whos to feed the poor dumb brutes one pack will be boycotted after another till not a pack of hounds will be wanted in all ireland  has the same thing happened to any other pack asked frank  certainly it has they turned out against the muskerry and theres been a row in kildare we are only at the beginning of it yet  i dont suppose it will go on for ever said frank  why dont you suppose so whats to be the end of it all do you see any way out of itfor i do not does your father see his way to bringing those meadows back into his hands im told that some of those fellows shot at clayton the other day down at headford how are we to expect a man like clayton to come forward and be shot at in that fashion as far as i can see there will be no possibility for anyone to live in this country again of course its all over with me i havent got any rents to speak of and the only property i possess is now useless  what property asked frank  what property rejoined tom in a voice of anger what property aint the hounds property or were property a few weeks ago wholl subscribe for next year we had a meeting in february you know and the fellows put down their names the same as ever but they cant be expected to pay when there will be no coverts for them to draw the country can do nothing to put a stop to this blackguardism when theyve passed this coercion bill theyre going to have some sort of land billjust a law to give away the land to somebody whats to come of the poor country with such men as mr gladstone and mr bright to govern it theyre the two very worst men in the whole empire for governing a country martial law with a regiment in each county and a strong colonel to carry it outthat is the only way of governing left us i dont pretend to understand politics but every child can see that and you should do away with the constituencies at any rate for the next five years what are you to expect with such a set of men as that in parliamentmen whom no one would speak to if they were to attempt to ride to hounds in county galway it makes me sick when i hear of it  such were tom dalys sad outlooks into the world and sad as they were they seemed to be justified by circumstances as they operated upon him there could be no hunting in county galway next session unless things were to change very much for the better and there was no prospect of any such change its nonsense talking of a poor devil like me being ruined you ask me what property i have got  i dont think i ever asked that said frank  it dont matter youre quite welcome youll find eight or nine pair of leather breeches in that press in there and round about the room somewhere there are over a dozen pair of topboots they are the only available property i have got they are paid for and i can do what i please with them the four or five hundred acres over there on the road to tuam are mostly bog and are strictly entailed so that i cannot touch them as there is not a tenant will pay the rent since ive been boycotted it doesnt make much matter i have not had a shilling from them for more than twelve months and i dont suppose i ever shall see another the poor hounds are eating their heads off as fine a pack of hounds as any man ever owned as far as their number goes i cant keep them and wholl buy them they tell me i must send them over to tattersalls but as things are now i dont suppose theyll pay the expense i dont care who knows it but i havent three hundred pounds in the world and im over fifty years of age what do you think of that as the condition for a man to be brought to  frank jones had never heard daly speak at such length before nor had he given him credit for so much eloquence nor indeed had anyone in the county of galway heard him speak so many words till this misfortune had fallen upon him and he would still be silent and reserved with all except a few hunting men whom he believed to be strongly influenced by the same political feeling as he was himself here was he boycotted most cruelly but not more cruelly than was mr jones of morony castle the story of florian jones had got about the county and had caused mr jones to be pitied greatly by such men as tom daly his own boy to turn against him tom had said and to become a papist a boy of ten years old to call himself a papist as if he would know anything about it and then to lieto lie like that i feel that his case is almost worse than mine therefore he had burst out with his sudden eloquence to frank jones whom he had liked oh yes i can send you over to woodlawn station i have got a horse and car left about the place heres william persse of galway hes the stanchest man we have in the county but even he can do nothing  then mr persse rode into the yardthat mr persse who when the hounds met at ballytowngal had so strongly dissuaded daly from using his pistol he was a man who was reputed to have a good income or at any rate a large estatethough the two things at the present moment were likely to have a very various meaning but he was a man less despondent in his temperament than tom daly and one that was likely to prevail with tom by the strength of his character well tom said persse as he walked into the house how are things using you now how are you jones im afraid your father is getting it rather hot at morony castle  theyve boycotted us thats all  so i understand is it not odd that some selfappointed individual should send out an edict and that suddenly all organised modes of living among people should be put a stop to heres tom not allowed to get a packet of greaves into his establishment unless he sends to dublin for it  nor to have it sent over here said tom unless ill send my own horse and cart to fetch it and every man and boy i have about the place is desired to leave me at the command of some dd otoole whose father kept a tinkers shop somewhere in county mayo and whose mother took in washing  there was a depth of scorn intended to be conveyed by all this because in dalys estimation county mayo was but a poor county to live in as it had not for many a year possessed an advertised pack of foxhounds and the otooles were not one of the tribes of galway or a clan especially esteemed in that most aristocratic of the western counties  have all the helpers gone  i havent asked them to stay but unless they have stayed of their own accord i have just shaken hands with them its all that one gentleman can do to another when he meets him  mr daly is talking of selling the hounds said frank jones  not quite yet tom said mr persse you mustnt do anything in a hurry  theyll have to starve if they remain here said the master of hounds  i have come over here to say a word about them i dont suppose this kind of thing will last for ever you know  can you see any end to it said the other  not as yet i cant except that troubles when they come generally do have an end we always think that evils will last for everand blessings too when twoyearold ewes went up to three pound ten at ballinasloe we thought that we were to get that price for ever but they were soon down to two seventeen six and when we had had two years of the potato famine we thought that there would never be another potato in county galway for the last five years weve had them as fine at doneraile as ever i saw them nobody is ever quite ruined or quite has his fortune made  i am very near the ruin said tom daly  i would struggle to hold on a little longer yet said the other how many horses have you got here and at ahaseragh  there are something over a dozen said tom there may be fifteen in all i was thinking of sending a draught over to tattersalls next week there are some of them would not be worth a fiveandtwentypound note when you got them there  well now ill tell you what i propose you shall send over four or five to be summered at doneraile there is grass enough there and though i cant pay my debts my credit is good at the cornchandlers black tom as he heard this sat still looking blacker than ever he was a man who hated to have a favour offered to him but he could bear the insult better from persse of doneraile than from anyone else in the county ive talked the matter over with lynch  d lynch said daly he didnt dislike sir jasper but sir jasper did not stand quite so high in his favour as did mr persse of doneraile  you neednt d anybody but just listen to me sir jasper says that he will take three and nicholas bodkin will do the same  they are both baronets said daly i hate a man with a handle to his name he always seems to me to be stuckup as though he demanded something more than other people there is that lord ardrahan  a very good fellow too dont you be an ass lord ardrahan has offered to take three more  i knew it said tom  its not as though any favour were offered or received though the horses are your own property they are kept for the services of the hunt we all understand very well how things are circumstanced at present  how do you think i am to feed my hounds if you take away the horses which they would eat said daly with an attempt at a grim joke but after the joke tom became sad again almost to tears and he allowed his friend to make almost what arrangements he pleased for distributing both hounds and horses among the gentry of the hunt and when they are gone said he i am to sit here alone with nothing on earth to do what on earth is to become of me when i have not a hound left to give a dose of physic to  well not leave you in such a sad strait as that said mr persse  it will be sad enough if you had had a pack of hounds to look after for thirty summers you wouldnt like to get rid of them in a hurry im like an old nurse who is sending her babies out or some mother rather who is putting her children into the workhouse because she cannot feed them herself it is sad though you dont see it in that light  frank jones got home to castle morony that night full of sorrow and trouble the cattle had been got off to dublin in their starved condition but he as he had come back had been boycotted every yard of the way he could get in no car nor yet in all tuam could he secure the services of a boy to carry his bag for him he learned in the town that the girls had sent over to purchase a joint of meat but had been refused at every shop is trade so plentiful asked frank that you can afford to do without it  we cant afford to do with it said the butcher if its to come from morony castle     chapter xxiv  from the full heart the mouth speaks   ada was making the beds upstairs and edith was churning the butter down below in the dairy when a little barefooted boy came in with a letter  please miss its from the captain and he says im not to stir out of this till i come back with an answer  the letter was delivered to edith at the dairy door and she saw that it was addressed to herself she had never before seen the captains handwriting and she looked at it somewhat curiously if hes to write to one of us it should be to ada she said to herself laughing then she opened the envelope which enclosed a large square stout letter it contained a card and a written note and on the card was an invitation as follows the colonel and officers of the west bromwich regiment request the pleasure of the company of mr jones the misses jones and mr francis jones to a dance at the galway barracks on the 20th of may 1881 dancing to commence at ten oclock  then there was the note which edith read before she took the card upstairs  my dear miss jones the letter began edith again looked at the envelope and perceived that the despatch had been certainly addressed to herselfmiss edith jones but between herself and her sister there could be no jealousy as to the opening of a letter letters for one were generally intended for the other also      i hope you will both come you ought to do so to show    the county that though you are boycotted you are not    smashed and to let them understand that you are not    afraid to come out of the house although certain persons    have made themselves terrible i send this to you instead    of to your sister because perhaps you have a little    higher pluck but do tell your father from me that i think    he ought as a matter of policy to insist on your both    coming you could come down by the boat one day and return    the next and ill meet you for fear your brother should    not be thereyours very faithfully     yorke clayton     i have got the fellows of the west bromwich to entrust the    card to me and have undertaken to see it duly delivered    i hope youll approve of my mercury hunter says he    doesnt care how often hes shot at   it was in the first place necessary to provide for the mercury because even a god cannot be sent away after the performance of such a journey without some provisions and edith to tell the truth wanted to look at the ball all round before she ventured to express an opinion to her sister and father her father of course would not go but should he be left alone at morony castle to the tender mercies of peter and should florian be left also without any womans hands to take charge of him and the butter too was on the point of coming which was a matter of importance but at last having pulled off her buttermaking apron and having duly patted the roll of butter she went upstairs to her sister  ada she said here is such a letter and she held up the letter and the card  who is it from  you must guess said edith  i am bad at guessing i cannot guess is it mr blake of carnlough  a great deal more interesting than that  it cant be captain clayton said ada  out of the full heart the mouth speaks it is captain clayton  what does he say and what is the card give it me it looks like an invitation  then it tells no story because it is an invitation it is from the officers of the west bromwich regiment and it asks us to a dance on the 20th of may  but thats not from captain clayton  captain clayton has writtento me and not to you at all you will be awfully jealous and he says that i have twice as much courage as you  thats true at any rate said ada in a melancholy tone  yes and as the officers want all the girls at the ball to be at any rate as brave as themselves thats a matter of great importance he has asked me to go with a pair of pistols at my belt but he is afraid that you would not shoot anybody  may i not look at his letter  oh no that would not be at all proper the letter is addressed to me miss edith jones and as it has come from such a very dashing young man and pays me particular compliments as to my courage i dont think i shall let anybody else see it it doesnt say anything special about beauty which i think uncivil if he had been writing to you it would all have been about feminine loveliness of course  what nonsense you do talk edith  well there it is as you will read it you must youll be awfully disappointed because there is not a word about you in it  then ada read the letter he says he hopes we shall both come  well yes your existence is certainly implied in those words  he explains why he writes to you instead of me  another actual reference to yourself no doubt but then he goes on to talk of my pluck  he says its a little higher than mine said ada who was determined to extract from the captains words as much good as was possible and as little evil to herself  so it is only a little higher pluck of course he means that i cant come near himself  you wouldnt pretend to asked ada  what to be shot at like him and to like it i dont know any girl that can come quite up to that only if one becomes quite cocksure as he is that one wont be hit i dont see the courage  oh i do  but now about this ball said edith here we are lone damsels making butter in our fathers halls and turning down the beds in the ladys chamber unable to buy anything because we are boycotted and with no money to buy it if we were not and we cant stir out of the house lest we should be shot and i dont suppose that such a thing as a pair of gloves is to be got anywhere  ive got gloves for both of us said ada  put by for a rainy day what a girl you are for providing for difficulties and youve got silk stockings too i shouldnt wonder  of course i have  and two ball dresses quite new  not quite new they are those we wore at hacketstown before the flood  good gracious how were noahs daughters dressed or were they dressed at all  you always turn everything into nonsense said ada petulantly  to be told im to wear a dress that had touched the heart of a patriarch and had perhaps gone well nigh to make me a patriarchs bride but taking it for granted that the ball dresses with all their appurtenances are here fit to win the heart of a modern captain instead of an old patriarch is there no other reason why we should not go  what reason asked ada in a melancholy tone  there are reasons you go to papa and see whether he has not reasons he will tell you that every shilling should be saved for florians school  it wont take many shillings to go to galway we couldnt well write to captain clayton and tell him that we cant afford it  people keep those reasons in the background said edith though people understand them and then papa will say that in our condition we ought to be ashamed to show our faces  what have we done amiss  not you or i perhaps said edith but poor florian i am determinedand so are youto take florian to our very hearts and to forgive him as though this thing had never been done he is to us the same darling boy as though he had never been present at the flood gates as though he had had no hand in bringing these evils to morony castle you and i have been angry but we have forgiven him to us he is as dear as ever he was but they know in the county what it was that was done by florian jones and they talk about it among themselves and they speak of you and me as florians sisters and they speak of papa as florians father i think it may well be that papa should not wish us to go to this ball  then there came a look of disappointment over adas face as though her doom had already been spoken a ball to ada and especially a ball at galwaya coming ballwas a promise of infinite enjoyment but a ball with captain yorke clayton would be heaven on earth and by the way in which this invitation had come he had been secured as a partner for the evening he could not write to them and especially call upon them to come without doing all he could to make the evening pleasant for them she included edith in all these promises of pleasantness but edith if the thing was to be done at all would do it all for ada as for the danger in which the man passed his life that must be left in the hands of god looking at it with great seriousness as in the midst of her joking she did look at these things she told herself that ada was very lovely and that this man was certainly lovable and she had taken it into her imagination that captain clayton was certainly in the road to fall in love with ada why should not ada have her chance and why should not the captain have his why should not she have her chance of having a gallant lovable gentleman for a brotherinlaw edith was not at all prepared to give the world up for lost because pat carroll had made himself a brute and because the neighbours were idiots and had boycotted them it must all depend upon their father whether they should or should not go to the ball and she had not thought it prudent to appear too full of hope when talking of it to ada but for herself she quite agreed with the captain that policy required them to go  i suppose you would like it she said to her sister  i always was fond of dancing replied ada  especially with heroes  of course you laugh at me but captain clayton wont be there as an officer hes only a resident magistrate  hes the best of all the officers said edith with enthusiasm i wont have our hero run down i believe him to have twice as much in him as any of the officers hes the gallantest fellow i know i think we ought to go if its only because he wants it  i dont want not to go said ada  i daresay not but papa will be the difficulty  hell think more of you than of me edith suppose you go and talk to him  so it was decided and edith went away to her father leaving ada still among the beds of frank not a word had been spoken frank would go as a matter of course if mr jones consented but ada though she was left among the beds did not at once go on with her work but sat down on that special bed by which her attention was needed and thought of the circumstances which surrounded her was it a fact that she was in love with the captain to be in love to her was a very serious thingbut so delightful she had been already oncewell not in love but preoccupied just a little in thinking of one young man the one young man was an officer but was now in india and ada had not ventured even to mention his name in her fathers presence edith had of course known the secret but edith had frowned upon it she had said that lieutenant talbot was no better than a stick although he had £400 a year of his own hed give you nothing to talk about said edith but his £400 a year therefore when lieutenant talbot went to india ada jones did not break her heart but now edith called captain clayton a hero and seemed in all respects to approve of him and edith seemed to think that he certainly admired ada it was a dreadful thing to have to fall in love with a woodcock ada felt that if as things went on the woodcock should become her woodcock the bullet which reached his heart would certainly pierce her own bosom also but such was the way of the world edith had seemed to think that the man was entitled to have a lady of his own to love and if so ada seemed to think that the place would be one very well suited to herself therefore she was anxious for the ball and at the present moment thought only of the difficulties to be incurred by edith in discussing the matter with her father  papa captain clayton wants us to go to a ball at galway it was thus that edith began her task  wants you to go a ball what has captain clayton to do with you two  nothing on earthat any rate not with me here is his letter which speaks for itself he seems to think that we should show ourselves to everybody around to let them know that we are not crushed by what such a one as pat carroll can do to us  who says that we are crushed  it is the people who are crushed that generally say so of themselves there would be nothing unusual under ordinary circumstances in your daughters going to a ball at galway  thats as may be  we can stay the night at mrs darcys and she will be delighted to have us if we never show ourselves it would be as though we acknowledged ourselves to be crushed and to tell the truth papa i dont think it is quite fair to ada to keep her here always she is very beautiful and at the same time fond of society she is doing her duty here bravely there is nothing about the house that she will not put her hand to she is better than any servant for the way she does her work i think you ought to let her go it is but for the one night  and you asked the father  i must go with her i suppose to keep her company  and are not you fond of society  nonot as she is i like the rattle very well just for a few minutes  and are not you beautiful he asked  good gracious no dont be such a goose papa  to me you are quite as lovely as is ada  because you are only a stupid old papa but she kissed him as she said it you have no right to expect to have two beauties in the family if i were a beauty i should go away and leave you as will ada its her destiny to be carried off by someone why not by some of these gallant fellows at galway its my destiny to remain at home and so you may know what you have got to expect  if it should turn out to be so there will be one immeasurable comfort to me in the midst of all my troubles  it shall be so said she whispering into his ear but papa you will let us go to this ball in galway will you not ada has set her heart upon it so the matter was settled  the answer to captain clayton sent by edith was as follows but it was not sent till the boy had been allowed to stuff himself with buttered toast and tea which to such a boy is the acme of all happiness      morony castle 8th of may 1881     dear captain clayton     we will both come of course and are infinitely obliged    to you for the trouble you have taken on our behalf papa    will not come of course frank will no doubt but he is    out after a salmon in the hacketstown river i hope he    will get one as we are badly off for provisions if he    cannot find a salmon i hope he will find trout or we    shall have nothing for three days running ada and i think    we can manage a leg of mutton between us as far as the    cooking goes but we havent had a chance of trying our    hands yet frank however will write to the officers by    post we shall sleep the night at mrs darcys and can    get there very well by ourselves all the same we shall    be delighted to see you if you will come down to the    boat     yours very truly     edith jones     i must tell you what ada said about our dresses only pray    dont tell any of the officers of course we had to have a    consultation about our frocks because everything in the    shops is boycotted for us oh said ada there are the    gauze dresses we wore at hacketstown before the flood    only think of ada and i at a ball with the miss noahs    four or five thousand years ago   frank consented to go of course but not without some little difficulty he didnt think it was a time for balls according to his view of things ginger should be no longer hot in the mouth  but why not said edith if a ball at any time is a good thing why should it be bad now are we all to go into mourning because mr carroll has so decreed for myself i dont care twopence for the ball i dont think it is worth the ten shillings which it will cost but i am all for showing that we dont care so much for mr carroll  carroll is in prison said frank  nor yet for terry lax or tim brady or terry carroll or tony brady the world is not to be turned away from its proper course by such a scum of men as that of course youll do as a brother should do and come with us  to this frank assented and on the next day went out for another salmon thinking no more about the party at galway  but the party at galway was a matter of infinite trouble and infinite interest to the two girls those dresses which had been put by from before the flood were brought forth and ironed and reribboned and redesigned as though the fate of heroes and heroines depended upon them and it was clearly intended that the fate of one hero and of one heroine should depend on them though nothing absolutely to that effect was said at present between the sisters it was not said but it was understood by both of them that it was so and each understood what was in the heart of the other dear dear edith said ada let them boycott us as they will said edith but my pet shall be as bright as any of them there was a ribbon that had not been tossed a false flower that had on it something of the bloom of newness a faint offer was made by ada to abandon some of these prettinesses to her sister but edith would have none of them edith poohpoohed the idea as though it were monstrous dont be a goose ada she said of course this is to be your night what does it signify what i wear  oh but it doesjust the same as for me i dont see why you are not to be just as nice as myself  thats not true my dear  why not true there is quite as much depends on your good fortune as on mine and then you are so much the cleverer of the two  then when the day for the ball drew near there came to be some more serious conversation between them  ada love you mean to enjoy yourself dont you  if i can i will when i go to these things i never know whether they will lead to enjoyment or the reverse some little thing happens so often and everything seems to go wrong  they shouldnt go wrong with you my pet  why not with me as well as with others  because you are so beautiful to look at you are made to be queen of a ballroom not a london ballroom where everything i take it is flash and faded painted and stale and worn out but down here in the country where there is some life among us and where a girl may be supposed to be excited over her dancing it is in such rooms as this that hearts are won and lost a bid made for diamonds is all that is done in london  i never was at a london ball said ada  nor i either but one reads of them i can fancy a man really caring for a girl down in galway can you fancy a man caring for a girl  i dont know said ada  for yourself now  i dont think anybody will ever care much for me  oh ada what a fib it is all very pretty your mock modestly but it is so untrue a man not love you why i can fancy a man thinking that the gods could not allow him a greater grace than the privilege of taking you in his arms  isnt anyone to take you in his arms then  no no one i am not a thing to be looked at in that light i mean eventually to take to womens rights and to make myself generally odious only i have promised to stick to papa and i have got to do that first youwho will you stick to  i dont know said ada  if i were to suggest captain yorke clayton if i were to suppose that he is the man who is to have the privilege  dont edith  he is my hero and you are my pet and i want to bring you two together i want to have my share in the hero and still to keep a share in my pet is not that rational  i dont know that there is anything rational in it all said ada but still she went to bed well pleased that night     chapter xxv  the galway ball   when the 20th of may came the three started off together for galway happy in spite of their boycotting the girls at least were happy though frank was still somewhat sombre as he thought of the edict which rachel omahony had pronounced against him when the boat arrived at the quay at galway captain clayton with one of the officers of the west bromwich was there to meet it he is a wise man whispered edith to ada he takes care to provide for number one  i dont see that at all said ada  that brave little warrior who is four feet and a half high is intended for my escort two is company and three is none i quite agree as to that then they left the boat and edith so arranged the party that she was to walk between the small warrior and her brother whereas ada followed with captain clayton in such straits of circumstances a man always has to do what he is told presence of mind and readiness is needful but the readiness of a man is never equal to that of a woman so they went off to mrs darcys house and ada enjoyed all the little preliminary sweets of the captains conversation the words that were spoken all had reference to edith herself but they came from the captain and were assuredly sweet  and its really true that you are boycotted mrs darcy asked  certainly its true  and what do they do to you do all the servants leave you  unless there be any like peter who make up their minds to face the wrath of landleaguers peter has lived with us a long time and has to ask himself whether it will be best for him to stay or go  and he stays what a noble fellow said mrs darcy  what would he do with himself if he didnt stay said edith i dont suppose theyd shoot him and he gets plenty to eat the girls who were in the house and the young men about the place had friends of their own living near them so they thought it better to go everybody of course does what is best for himself and peter though he has suited himself is already making a favour of it papa told him only yesterday that he might go himself if he pleased only think we had to send all the horses last week into galway to be shodand then they wouldnt do it except one man who made a tremendous favour of it and after doing it charged double  but wont they sell you anything at tuam  not a haporth we couldnt get so much as soap for housewashing unless mrs blake had stood by us and let us have her soap ada and i have to do every bit of washing about the place i do think well of peter because he insists on washing his own shirts and stockings unfortunately we havent got a mangle and we have to iron the sheets if we want them to look at all nice adas sheets and mine and florians are only just rough pressed of course we get tea and those things down from dublin only think of the way in which the tradespeople are ruining themselves everything has to go to dublin to be sold potatoes and cattle and now butter papa says that they wont pay for the carriage when you come to think of it this boycotting is the most ruinous invention on both sides when poor florian declared that he would go to mass after he had first told the story about pat carroll they swore they would boycott the chapel if he entered the door not a single person would stay to receive the mass so he wouldnt go it was not long after that when he became afraid to show his face outside the halldoor  and yet you can come here to this ball said mrs darcy  exactly so i will go where i please till they boycott the very roads from under my feet i expect to hear soon that they have boycotted ada and me so that no young man shall come and marry us of course i dont understand such things but it seems to me that the government should interfere to defend us  when the evening came and the witching hour was there ada and edith appeared at the barracks as bright as their secondhand finery could make them they had awarded to them something of especial glory as being boycotted heroines and were regarded with a certain amount of envy by the miss blakes miss bodkins miss lamberts miss ffrenchs and miss parsons of the neighbourhood they had none of them as yet achieved the full honours of boycotting though some of them were halfway to it the miss ffrenchs told them how their fathers sheep had been boycotted the shepherd having been made to leave his place the miss blakes had been boycotted because their brother had been refused a car and the bodkins of ballytowngal were held to have been boycotted en masse because of the doings at moytubber gorse but none of them had been boycotted as had been the miss jones and therefore the miss jones were the heroines of the evening  i declare it is very nice ada said to her sister that night when they got home to mrs darcys because it got for us the pick of all the partners  it got for you one partner at any rate said edith either the boycotting or something else edith had determined that it should be so or had determined at any rate that it should seem to be so in her resolution that the hero of the day should fall in love with her sister she had almost taught herself to think that the process had already taken place it was so natural that the bravest man should fall in love with the fairest lady that edith took it for granted that it already was so she too in some sort was in love with her own sister ada to her was so fair so soft so innocent so feminine and so lovable that her very heart was in the projectand the project that ada should have the hero of the hour to herself and yet she too had a heart of her own and had told herself in so many words that she herself would have loved the manhad it been fitting that she should burden him with such a love she had rejected the idea as unfitting impossible and almost unfeminine there was nothing in her to attract the man the idea had sprung up but for a moment and had been cast out as being monstrous there was ada the very queen of beauty and the gallant hero was languishing in her smiles it was thus that her imagination carried her on after the notion had once been entertained at the ball edith did in fact dance with captain clayton quite as often as did ada herself but she danced with him she said as the darling sister of his supposed bride all her talk had been about adabecause edith had so chosen the subject but with ada the conversation had all been about edith because the captain had selected the subject  we all know how a little party is made up on such occasions though the party dance also with other people on occasions they are there especially to dance with each other an interloper or two now and again is very useful so as to keep up appearances the little warrior whom edith had illnaturedly declared to be four feet and a half high but who was in truth five feet and a half made up the former frank did not do much dancing devoting himself to thinking of rachel omahony the little man who was a distinguished officer named captain butler of the west bromwich had a very good time of it dancing with ada when captain clayton was not doing so the greatest brick i ever saw in my lifeit was thus captain butler afterwards spoke of edith but ada is the girl for me you know had edith heard this which she could not do because she was then on the boat going back to morony castle she would have informed captain butler that ada was not the girl for him but captain clayton who heard the announcement made did not seem to be much disturbed by it  it was a very nice party mrs darcy said edith the next morning  was there a supper  there was plenty to eat and drink if you mean that but we did not waste our time sitting down i hate having to sit down opposite to a great ham when i am in the full tide of my emotions  there were emotions then  of course there were whats the good of a ball without them fancy captain butler and no emotions or captain clayton ask ada if there were not but as far as we were concerned it was i who had the best of it captain butler was my special man for the evening and he had on a beautiful red jacket with gold buttons you never saw anything so lovely but captain clayton had just a simple black coat that is so ugly you know  is captain clayton adas special young man  most particularly special is he not ada  what nonsense you do talk edith he is not my special young man at all im afraid he wont be any young womans special young man very long if he goes on as he does at present do you hear what he did over at ardfry there was some cattle to be seized for rent and all the people on that side of the country were there ever so many shots were fired and poor hunter got wounded in his shoulder  he just had his skin raised said edith  and captain clayton got terribly mauled in the crowd but he wouldnt fire a pistol at any of them he brought some ringleader away prisonerhe and two policemen but they got all the cattle and the tenants had to buy them back and pay their rent when we try to seize cattle at ballintubber they are always driven away to county mayo i do think that captain clayton is a real hero  of course he is my dear thats given up to him long agoand to you  in the afternoon they went home by boat and frank made himself disagreeable by croaking upon my word he said i think that this is hardly a fit time for giving balls  ginger should not be hot in the mouth said edith  you may put it in what language you like but that is about what i mean the people who go to the balls cannot in truth afford it  thats the officers look out  and they are here on a very sad occasion everything is going to ruin in the country  i wont be put down by pat carroll said edith he shall not be able to boast to himself that he has changed the natural course of my life  he has changed it altogether  you know what i mean i am not going to yield to him or to any of them i mean to hold my own against it as far as i can do so ill go to church and to balls and ill visit my friends and ill eat my dinner every day of my life just as though pat carroll didnt exist hes in prison just at present and therefore so far we have got the best of him  but we cant sell a head of cattle without sending it up to dublin and we cant find a man to take charge of it on the journey we cant get a shilling of rent and we hardly dare to walk about the place in the broad light of day lest we should be shot at while things are in this condition it is no time for dancing at balls i am so brokenhearted at the present moment that but for my father and for you i would cut the place and go to america  taking rachel with you said edith  rachel just now is as prosperous as we are the reverse rachel would not go it is all very well for rachel as things are prosperous with her but here we have the reverse of prosperity and according to my feelings there should be no gaiety do you ever realise to yourself what it is to think that your father is ruined  we ought not to have gone said ada  never say die said edith slapping her little hand down on the gunwale of the boat morony castle and ballintubber belong to papa and i will never admit that he is ruined because a few dishonest tenants refuse to pay their rents for a time a man such as pat carroll can do him an injury but papa is big enough to rise above that in the long run at any rate i will live as becomes papas daughter as long as he approves and i have the power discussing these matters they reached the quay near morony castle and edith as she jumped ashore felt something of triumph in her bosom she had at any rate succeeded in her object i am sure we were right to go she whispered to ada  their father received them with but very few words nor had florian much to say as to the glories of the ball his mind was devoted at present to the coming trial and indeed in a more open and energetic manner so was the mind of captain clayton this will be the last holiday for me he had said to edith at the ball before the great day comes off for patrick carroll esq its all very well for a man once in a way but there should not be too much of it  you have not to complain deeply of yourself on that head  i have had my share of fun in the world he said but it grows less as i grow older it is always so with a man as he gets into his work i think my hair will grow grey very soon if i do not succeed in having mr carroll locked up for his life  do you think they will convict him  i think they will i do think they will we have got one of the men who is ready to swear that he assisted him in pulling down the gates  which of the men she asked  i will tell you because i trust you as my very soul his own brother terry is the man pat it seems is a terrible tyrant among his own friends and terry is willing to turn against him on condition that a passage to america be provided for him of course he is to have a free pardon for himself we do want one man to corroborate your brothers evidence your brother no doubt was not quite straight at first  he lied said edith when you and i talk about it together we should tell the simple truth we have pardoned him his liebut he lied  we have now the one man necessary to confirm his testimony  but he is the brother  no doubt but in such a case as this anything is fair to get at the truth and we shall employ no falsehoods this younger carroll was instigated by his brother to assist him in the deed and he was seen by your brother to be one of those who assisted it seems to me to be quite right  it is very terrible edith said  yes it is terrible a brother will have to swear against a brother and will be bribed to do it i know what will be said to me very well they have tried to shoot me down like a rat but i mean to get the better of them and when i shall have succeeded in removing mr pat carroll from his present sphere of life i shall have a second object of ambition before me mr lax is another gentleman whom i wish to remove three times he has shot at me but he has not hit me yet  from that time forth there had certainly been no more dances for captain clayton his mind had been altogether devoted to his work and amidst that work the trial of pat carroll had stood prominent he and i are equally eager or at any rate equally anxious he had said to edith speaking of her brother when he had met her subsequent to the ball but the time is coming soon and we shall know all about it in another six weeks this was said in june and the trial was to take place in august     chapter xxvi  lord castlewell   the spring and early summer had worn themselves away in london and rachel omahony was still singing at the embankment theatre she and her father were still living in cecil street the glorious day of october which had been fixed at last for the 24th on which rachel was to appear on the covent garden boards was yet still distant and she was performing under mr mosss behests at a weekly stipend of £15 to which there would be some addition when the last weeks of the season had come about the end of july and beginning of august but alas rachel hardly knew what she would do to support herself during the dead months from august to october fashionable people always go out of town father she said  then let us be fashionable  fashionable people go to scotland but they wont take one in there without money we shant have £50 left when our debts are paid and £50 would do nothing for us  theyve stopped me altogether said mr omahony at any rate they have stopped the moneymaking part of the business they have threatened to take the mans license away and therefore that place is shut up  isnt that unjust father  unjust everything done in england as to ireland is unjust they carried an act of parliament the other day when in accordance with the ancient privileges of members it was within the power of a dozen stalwart irishmen to stop it the dozen stalwart irishmen were there but they were silenced by a brutal majority the dozen irishmen were turned out of the house one after the other in direct opposition to the ancient privileges and so a bill was passed robbing five million irishmen of their liberties so gross an injustice was never before perpetratednot even when the bribed members sold their country and effected the accursed union  i know that was very bad father but the bribes were taken by irishmen be that as it may what are we to do with ourselves next autumn  the only thing for us is to seek for assistance in the united states  they wont lend us £100  we must overrun this country by the force of true liberal opinion the people themselves will rise when they have the americans to lead them what is wanted now are the voices of true patriots loud enough to reach the people  and £100 said she speaking into his ear to keep us alive from the middle of august to the end of october  for myself i have been invited to come into parliament the county of cavan will be vacant  is there a salary attached  one or two leading irish members are speaking of it said mr omahony carried away by the grandeur of the idea but the amount has not been fixed yet and they seem to think that it is wanted chiefly for the parliamentary session i have not promised because i do not quite see my way and to tell the truth i am not sure that it is in parliament that an honest irishman will shine the best whats the good when you can be silenced at a moments notice by the word of some mock speaker who upsets all the rules of his office to put a gag upon a dozen men when america has come to understand what it is that the lawless tyrant did on that night when the irishmen were turned out of the house will she not rise in her wrath and declare that such things shall no longer be all this occurred in cecil street and rachel who well understood her fathers wrath allowed him to expend in words the anger which would last hardly longer than the sound of them  but you wont be in parliament for county cavan before next august she asked  i suppose not  nor will the united states have risen in their wrath so as to have settled the entire question before that time  perhaps not said mr omahony  and if they did i dont see what good it would do to us as to finding for us the money that we want  i am so full of irelands wrongs at this moment and with the manner in which these policemen interfered with me that i can hardly bring myself to think of your autumn plans  what are yours she asked  i suppose we should always have money enough to go to america in america a man can at any rate open his mouth  or a woman either but according to what m le gros says in england they pay better at the present moment mr moss has offered to lend me the money but for myself i would sooner go into an english workhouse than accept money from mr moss which i had not earned  in truth rachel had been very foolish with her money spending it as though there were no end to the source from which it had come and her father had not been more prudent he was utterly reckless in regard to such considerations and would simply declare that he was altogether indifferent to his dinner or to the new hat he had proposed to buy for himself when the subject was brought under his notice he had latterly become more eager than ever as to politics and was supremely happy as long as he was at liberty to speak before any audience those angry words which had however been unfortunately for him declared to be treasonable he had till lately been taught to understand that the house of commons was the only arena on which such permission would be freely grantedand could be granted of course only to members of the house therefore the idea had entered his head that it would suit him to become a membermore especially as there had arisen a grand scheme of a salary for certain irish members of which he would be one but even here the brutality of england had at last interfered and men were not to be allowed to say what they pleased any longer even in the house of commons therefore mr omahony was much disturbed and although he was anxious to quarrel with no one individually not even the policemen who arrested him he was full of indignant wrath against the tyranny of england generally  rachel when she could get no good advice from her father with regard to her future funds went back again to her singing it was necessary at any rate that she should carry out her present arrangement with mr moss and she was sure at least of receiving from him the money which she earned but alas she could not practise the economy which she knew to be necessary the people at the theatre had talked her into hiring a onehorse open carriage in which she delighted to drive about and in which to tell the truth her father delighted to accompany her she had thought that she could allow herself this indulgence out of her £15 a week and though she paid for the indulgence monthly that and their joint living nearly consumed the stipend and now as her fathers advice did not get beyond the very doubtful salary which might accrue to him as the future member for the county cavan her mind naturally turned itself to other sources from m le gros or from m le gros employers she was to receive £300 for singing in the two months before christmas with an assurance of a greatly increased though hitherto unfixed stipend afterwards personally she as yet knew no one connected with her future theatrical home but m le gros of m le gros all her thoughts had been favourable should she ask m le gros to lend her some small sum of money in advance for the uses of the autumn mr moss had made to her a fixed proposition on the subject which she had altogether declined she had declined it with scorn as she was wont to do all favours proffered by mr moss mr moss had still been gracious and had smiled and had ventured to express a renewed hope as he called it that miss omahony would even yet condescend to look with regard on the sincere affection of her most humble servant and then he had again expatiated on the immense success in theatrical life which would attend a partnership entered into between the skill and beauty and power of voice of miss omahony on the one side and the energy devotion and capital of mr moss on the other psha had been rachels only reply and so that interview had been brought to an end but rachel when she came to think of m le gros and the money she was desirous of borrowing was afflicted by certain qualms that she should have borrowed from mr moss considering the length of their acquaintance might not have been unnatural but of m le gros she knew nothing but his civility nor had she any reason for supposing that m le gros had money of his own at his disposal nor did she know where m le gros lived she could go to covent garden and ask for him there but that was all  so she dressed herself prettilyneatly as she called itand had herself driven to the theatre there as chance would have it she found m le gros standing under the portico with a gentleman whom she represented to herself as an elderly old buck m le gros saw her and came down into the street at once with his hat in his hand  m le gros said she i want you to do me a great favour but i have hardly the impudence to ask it can you lend me some money this autumnsay £100 thereupon m le gros face fell and his cheeks were elongated and his eyes were very sorrowful ah then i see you cant she said i will not put you to the pain of saying so i ought not to have suggested it my dealings with you have seemed to be so pleasant and they have not been quite of the same nature down at the embankment  my dear young lady  not another word and i beg your pardon most heartily for having given you this moments annoyance  there is one of the lessees there said m le gros pointing back to the gentleman on the top of the steps who has been to hear you and to look at you this two timesthis three times at the embankment he do think you will become the grand singer of the age  who is the judicious gentleman asked rachel whispering to m le gros out of the carriage  he is lord castlewell he is the eldest son of the marquis of beaulieu he haveohlots of money he was sayingah i must not tell you what his lordship was saying of you because it will make you vain  nothing that any lord can say of me will make me vain said rachel chucking up her head then his lordship thinking that he had been kept long enough standing on the top of the theatre steps lifted his hat and came down to the carriage the occupant of which he had recognised  may i have the extreme honour of introducing mademoiselle omahony to lord castlewell and m le gros again pulled off his hat as he made the introduction miss omahony found that she had become mademoiselle as soon as she had drawn up her carriage at the front door of the genuine italian opera  this is a pleasure indeed said lord castlewell i am delightedmore than delighted to find that my friend le gros has engaged the services of mademoiselle omahony for our theatre  but our engagement does not commence quite yet i am sorry to say replied rachel then she prepared herself to be driven away not caring much for the combination of lord and lessee who stood in the street speaking to her a lessee should be a lessee she thought and a lord a lord  may i do myself the honour of waiting upon you some day at the embankment said the lord again pulling off his hat  oh certainly said rachel i should be delighted to see you then she was driven away and did not know whether to be angry or not in having given lord castlewell so warm a welcome as a mere stray lord there was no possible reason why he should call upon her nor for her why she should receive him though frank jones had been dismissed and though she felt herself to be free to accept any eligible lover who might present himself she still felt herself bound on his behalf to keep herself free from all elderly theatrical hangerson especially from such men when she heard that they were also lords but as she was driven away she took another glance at the lord and thought that he did not look so old as when she had seen him at a greater distance  but she had failed altogether in her purpose of borrowing money from m le gros and for his sake she regretted much that the attempt had been made she had already learned one or two details with reference to m le gros though his manners and appearance were so pleasant he was only a subaltern about the theatre and he was a subaltern whom this lord and lessee called simply le gros and from the melancholy nature of his face when the application for money was made to him she had learned that he was both goodnatured and impecunious of herself in regard to the money she thought very little at the present moment there were still six weeks to run and rachels nature was such that she could not distress herself six weeks in advance of any misfortune she was determined that she would not tell her father of her failure as for him he would not probably say a word further of their want of money till the time should come he confined his prudence to keeping a sum in his pocket sufficient to take them back to new york  as the days went on which were to bring her engagement at the embankment to an end rachel heard a further rumour about herself rumours did spring up at the embankment to which she paid very little attention she had heard the same sort of things said as to other ladies at the theatre and took them all as a matter of course had she been asked she would have attributed them all to madame socani because madame socani was the one person whom next to mr moss she hated the most the rumour in this case simply stated that she had already been married to mr jones and had separated from her husband why do they care about such a matter as that she said to the female from whom she heard the rumour it cant matter to me as a singer whether i have five husbands  but it is so interesting said the female when a lady has a husband and doesnt own him or when she owns him and hasnt really got him it adds a piquancy to life especially to theatrical life which does want these little assistances  then one evening lord castlewell did call upon her at the embankment her father was not with her and she was constrained by the circumstances of the moment to see his lordship alone  i do feel you know miss omahony he said thus coming back for the moment into everyday life that i am entitled to take an interest in you  your lordship is very kind  i suppose you never heard of me before  not a word my lord im an american girl and i know very little about english lords  i hope that you may come to know more my special métier in life brings me among the theatres i am very fond of musicand perhaps a little fond of beauty also  i am glad you have the sense my lord to put music the first  i dont know about that in regard to you i cannot say which predominates  you are at liberty at any rate to talk about the one as you are bidding for it at your own theatre as to the other you will excuse me for saying that it is a matter between me and my friends  among whom i trust before long i may be allowed to be counted  the little dialogue had been carried on with smiles and good humour and rachel now did not choose to interfere with them after all she was only a public singer and as such was hardly entitled to the full consideration of a gentlewoman it was thus that she argued with herself nevertheless she had uttered her little reprimand and had intended him to take it as such  you are coming to us you know after the holidays  and will bring my voice with me such as it is  but not your smiles you mean to say  they are sure to come with me for i am always laughingunless i am roused to terrible wrath i am sure that will not be the case at covent garden  i hope not you will find that you have come among a set who are quite prepared to accept you as a friend here she made a little curtsy and now i have to offer my sincere apologies for the little proposition i am about to make it immediately occurred to her that m le gros had betrayed her he was a very civil spoken affable kind old man but he had betrayed her m le gros happened to mention that you were anxious to draw in advance for some portion of the salary coming to you for the next two months m le gros had at any rate betrayed her in the most courteous terms  well yes m le gros explained that the proposition was not selon les règles and it does not matter the least in the world  m le gros has explained that i did not know that m le gros had explained anything  well then he looked it said rachel  his looks must be wonderfully expressive he did not look it to me at all he simply told me as one of the managers of the theatre i was to let you have whatever money you wanted and he did whisper to memay i tell you what he whispered  i suppose you may he seems to me to be a very goodnatured kind of man  poor old le gros a very goodnatured man i should say he doesnt carry the house thats all  you do that then she remembered that the man was a lord i ought to have said my lord she said but i forgot i hope youll excuse memy lord  we are not very particular about that in theatrical matters or rather i am particular with some and not with others youll learn all about it in process of time m le gros whispered that he thought there was not the pleasantest understanding in the world between you and the people here  well no there is notmy lord  bother the lordjust now  with all my heart said rachel who could not avoid the little bit of fun which was here implied not but what thethe people herewould find me any amount of money i chose to ask for there are people you see one does not wish to borrow money from i take my salary here but nothing more the fact is i have not only taken it but spent it and to tell the truth i have not a shilling to amuse myself with during the dull season mr moss knows all about it and has simply asked how much i wanted nothing i replied nothing at all nothing at all and thats how i am situated  no debts  not a dollar beyond that i shouldnt have a dollar left to get out of london with then she remembered herselfthat it was expedient that she should tell this man something about herself i have got a father you know and he has to be paid for as well as me he is the sweetest kindest most generous father that a girl ever had and he could make lots of money for himself only the police wont let him  what do the police do to him said lord castlewell  he is not a burglar you know or anything of that kind  he is an irish politician isnt he  he is very much of a politician but he is not an irishman  irish name suggested the lord  irish name yes so are half the names in my country my father comes from the united states and he is strongly impressed with the necessity of putting down the horrid injustice with which the poor irish are treated by the monstrous tyranny of you english aristocrats you are very nice to look at  thank you miss omahony  but you are very bad to go you are not the kind of horses i care to drive at all thieves traitors murderers liars  goodness gracious me exclaimed the lord  i dont say anything for myself because i am only a singing girl and understand nothing about politics but these are the very lightest words which he has at his tongues end when he talks about you he is the most goodtempered fellow in the world and you would like him very much here is mr moss mr moss had opened the door and had entered the room  the greeting between the two men was closely observed by rachel who though she was very imprudent in much that she did and much that she said never allowed anything to pass by her unobserved mr moss though he affected an intimacy with the lord was beyond measure servile lord castlewell accepted the intimacy without repudiating it but accepted also the servility well moss how are you getting on in this little house  ah my lord you are going to rob us of our one attraction and having bowed to the lord he turned round and bowed to the lady  you have no right to keep such a treasure in a little place like this  we can afford to pay for it you know my lord m le gros came here a little behind my back and carried her off  much to her advantage i should say  we can pay said mr moss  to such a singer as mademoiselle omahony paying is not everything an audience large enough and sufficiently intelligent to appreciate her is something more than mere money  we have the most intelligent audience in all london mr moss said in defence of his own theatre  no doubt said the lord he had during this little intercourse of compliments managed to write a word or two on a slip of paper which he now handed to rachelwill £200 do this he put into her hand and then left her saying that he would do himself the honour of calling upon her again at her own lodgings where i shall hope he said to make the acquaintance of the most goodtempered fellow in the world then he took his leave     chapter xxvii  how funds were provided   mr moss at this interview again pressed his loan of money upon poor rachel  you cannot get on my dear young lady in this world without money if you have spent your income hitherto what do you mean to do till the end of november at covent garden the salaries are all paid monthly  there was something so ineffably low and greasy in his tone of addressing her that it was impossible to be surprised at the disgust which she expressed for him  mr moss i am not your dear young lady she said  would that you were we should be as happy as the day is long there would be no money troubles then she could not fail to make comparisons between him and the english nobleman who had just left her which left the englishman infinitely superior although with the few thoughts she had given to him she had already begun to doubt whether lord castlewells morality stood very high what will you do for money for the next three months you cannot do without money said mr moss  i have already found a friend said rachel most imprudently  what his lordship there  i am not bound to answer any such questions  but i know i can see the game is all up if it has come to that i am a fellowworkman and there have been and perhaps will be many relations between us a hundred pounds advanced here or there must be brought into the accounts sooner or later that is honest that will bear daylight no young lady need be ashamed of that even if you were mrs jones you need not be ashamed of such a transaction  i am not mrs jones said rachel in great anger  but if you were mr jones would have no ground of complaint unless indeed on the score of extravagance but a present from this lord  it is no present it does not come from the lord it comes from the funds of the theatre  ha ha ha laughed mr moss is that the little game with which he attempts to cajole you how has he got his hand into the treasury of the theatre so that he may be able to help you so conveniently you have not got the money yet i suppose  i have not got his moneywhich may be dangerous or yourswhich would certainly be more so though from neither of you could the bare money hurt me if it were taken with an innocent heart from you it would be a distress an annoyance a blister from him it would be simply a loan either from himself or from the theatre with which he is connected i may be mistaken but i have imagined that it would come from the theatre i will ascertain and if it be not so i will decline the loan  do you not know his character nor his mode of living nor his dealing with actresses you will not at any rate get credit for such innocence when you tell the story whyhe has come here to call upon you and of course it is all over the theatre already that you are his mistress i came in here to endeavour to save you but i fear it is too late  impudent scoundrel said rachel jumping up and glaring at him  that is all very well but i have endeavoured to save you i would believe none of them when they told me that you would not be my wife because you were married to mr jones nor would i believe them when they have told me since that you were not fit to be the wife of anyone rachels hand went in among the folds of her dress and returned with a dagger in it words had been said to her now which she swore to herself were unbearable yes you are in a passion now and as he said so he contrived to get the round table with which the room was garnished between himself and her  it is true she said your words have been so base that i am no doubt angry  but if you knew it i am endeavouring to save you imprudent as you have been i still wish to make you my wife here rachel in her indignation spat upon the floor yes i am anxious to make you an honest woman  you can make no woman honest it is altogether beyond your power  it will be so when you have taken this lords money  i have not at any rate taken yours it is that which would disgrace me between this lord and me there has been no word that could do so  will he make you his wife  wife no he is married for aught that i know he has spoken to me no word except about my profession nor shall you cannot a woman sing without being wife to any man  ha ha yes indeed  she understood the scorn intended to be thrown on her line of life by his words and was wretched to think that he was getting the better of her in conversation i can sing and i need no husband  it is common with the friends of the lord that they do not generally rank very high in their profession i have endeavoured to save you from this kind of thing and see the return that i get you will however soon have left us and you will then find that to fill first place at the embankment is better than a second or a third at covent garden  during these hot words on both sides she had been standing at a pierglass arranging something in her dress intended to suit mosss fancy upon the stagemoss who was about to enact her princely loverand then she walked off without another word she went through her part with all her usual vigour and charm and so did he elmira also was more pathetic than ever as the night was supposed to be something special because a royal duke and his young bride were in the stage box the plaudits given would have been tremendous only that the building was so small and the grand quartette became such a masterpiece that there was half a column concerning it in the musical corner of the next mornings daily telephone if that girl would only go as id have her said mr moss to the most confidential of his theatrical friends id make her mrs moss tomorrow and her fame should be blazoned all over the world before twelve months had gone as madame moussa  but rachel though she was enabled so to overcome her rage as to remember only her theatrical passion when she was on the stage spent the whole of the subsequent night in thinking over the difficulty into which she had brought herself by her imprudence she understood to the full the meaning of all those innuendoes which mr moss had provided for her and she knew that though there was in them not a spark of truth as regarded herself still they were so truthlike as to meet with acceptance at any rate from all theatrical personages she had gone to m le gros for the money clearly as one of the theatrical company with which she was about to connect herself m le gros had to her intelligence distinctly though very courteously declined her request it might be well that the company would accede to no such request but m le gros in his questionable civility had told the whole story to lord castlewell who had immediately offered her a loan of £200 out of his own pocket it had not occurred to her in the moment in which she had first read the words in the presence of mahomet m m that such must necessarily be the case was it probable that lord castlewell should on his own behalf recover from the treasury of the theatre the sum of £200 and then the nature of this lords character opened itself to her eyes in all the forms which mr moss had intended that it should wear a man did not lend a young lady £200 without meaning to secure for himself some reward and as she thought of it all she remembered the kind of language in which she had spoken of her father she had described him as an american in words which might so probably give this noble old roué a false impression as to his character and yet she liked the noble old rouéliked him so infinitely better than she did mr moss m le gros had betrayed her or had perhaps said words leading to her betrayal but still she greatly preferred m le gros to mr moss  she was safe as yet with this lord not a sparkle of his gold had she received no doubt the story about the money would be spread about from her own telling of it people would believe it because she herself had said so but it was still within her power to take care that it should not be true she did what was usual on such occasions she abused the illfeeling of the world which by the malignity of its suspicions would not scruple to drag her into the depths of misfortune forgetting probably that her estimation of others was the same as others of her she did not bethink herself that had another young lady at another theatre accepted a loan from an unmarried lord of such a character she would have thought ill of that young lady the world ought to be perfectly innocent in regard to her because she believed herself to be innocent and mr moss in expressing the opinions of others and exposing to her the position in which she had placed herself had simply proved himself to be the blackest of human beings  but it was necessary that she should at once do something to whitewash her own character in her own esteem this lord had declared that he himself would call and she was at first minded to wait till he did so and then to hand back to him the cheque which she believed that he would bring and to assure him that under altered circumstances it would not be wanted but she felt that it would best become her to write to him openly and to explain the circumstances which had led to his offering the loan there is nothing like being straightforward she said to herself and if he does not choose to believe me that is his fault so she took up her pen and wrote quickly to the following effect      my dear lord castlewell     i want to tell you that i do not wish to have the £200    which you were good enough to say that you would lend me    indeed i cannot take it under any circumstances i must    explain to you all about it if your lordship pleases i    had intended to ask m le gros to get the theatre people    to advance me some small sum on my future engagement and    i had not thought how impossible it was that they should    do so as of course i might die before i had sung a single    note i never dreamed of coming to you whose lordships    name i had not even heard in my ignorance then m le gros    spoke to you and you came and made your proposition in    the most goodnatured way in the world i was such a fool    as not to see that the money must of course come from    yourself     mr moss has enlightened me and has made me understand    that no respectable young woman would accept a loan of    money from you without blemish to her character mr moss    whom i do not in the least like has been right in this i    should be very sorry if you should be taught to think evil    of me before i go to your theatre or indeed if i do not    go at all i am not up to all these things and i suppose    i ought to have consulted my father the moment i got your    little note pray do not take any further notice of it     i am very faithfully    your lordships humble servant     rachel omahony   then there was added a postscript your note has just come and i return the cheque as chance would have it the cheque had come just as rachel had finished her letter and with the cheque there had been a short scrawl as follows i send the money as settled and will call tomorrow  whatever may have been lord castlewells general sins among actresses and actors his feelings hitherto in regard to miss omahony had not done him discredit he had already heard her name frequently when he had seen her in her little carriage before the steps of covent garden theatre and had heard her sing at the embankment her voice and tone and feeling had enchanted him as he had wont to be enchanted by new singers of high quality and he had been greatly struck by the brightness of her beauty when m le gros had told him of her little wants he had perceived at once her innocence and had determined to relieve her wants then when she had told him of her father and had explained to him the kind of terms on which they lived together he was sure that she was pure as snow but she was very lovely and he could not undertake to answer for what feelings might spring up in her bosom now he had received this letter and every word of it spoke to him in her favour he took therefore a little trouble and calling upon her the next morning at her lodgings found her seated with mr omahony  father she said when the lord was ushered into the room this is lord castlewell lord castlewell this is my father  then she sat down leaving the two to begin the conversation as they might best please she had told her father nothing about the money simply explaining that on the steps of the theatre she had met the lord who was one of its proprietors  lord castlewell said mr omahony i am very proud then he bowed i know very little about stage affairs but i am confident that my daughter will do her duty to the best of her ability  not more so than i am said lord castlewell upon which mr omahony bowed again you have heard about this little contretemps about the money  not a word said mr omahony shaking his head  nor of the terrible character which has been given you by your daughter  that i can well understand said mr omahony  she says that you wish to abolish all the english aristocracy  most of them said mr omahony peradventure ten shall be found honest and i will not destroy them for tens sake but i doubt whether there be one  i should be grieved to think that you were the judge  and so should i said mr omahony it is so easy to utter curses when no power accompanies the utterances the lord must have found it uncomfortable in regard to sodom i can spit out all my fury against english vices and british greed without suffering one pang at my heart what is this that you were saying about rachel and her money  she is in a little trouble about cash at the present moment  not a doubt about it  and i have offered to lend her a trifle£200 or so just till she can work it off up at the theatre there  then there is one of the ten at any rate said mr omahony  meaning me asked the lord  just so lending us £200 when neither of us have a shilling in our pocket is a very good deed dont you think so rachel  no said rachel lord castlewell is not a fit person to lend me £200 out of his pocket and i will not have it  i did not know said mr omahony  you never know anything you are such a dear innocent old father  theres an end of it then said he addressing himself to the lord he did not look in the least annoyed because his daughter had refused to take the loan nor had he shown the slightest feeling of any impropriety when there was a question as to her accepting it  of course i cannot force it upon you said lord castlewell  no a lord cannot do that even in this country where lords go for so much but we are not a whit the less obliged to your lordship there are proprieties and improprieties which i dont understand rachel knows all about them such a knowledge comes to a girl naturally and she chooses either the one or the other according to her nature rachel is a dragon of propriety  father you are a goose said rachel  i am telling his lordship the truth there is some reason why you should not take the money and you wont take it i think it very hard that i should not have been allowed to earn it  why were you not allowed asked the lord  lest the people should be persuaded to rise up against you lordswhich they very soon would doand will do you are right in your generation the people were paying twentyfive cents a night to come and hear me and so i was informed that i must not speak to them any more i had been silenced in galway before but then i had spoken about your queen  we cant endure that you know  so i learn shes a holy of holies but i promised to say nothing further about her and i havent i was talking about your speaker of the house of commons  thats nearly as bad said lord castlewell shaking his head  a secondrate holy of holies when i said that he ought to obey certain rules which had been laid down for his guidance i was told to walk out what may i talk about i asked then the policeman told me the weather even an englishman is not stupid enough to pay twentyfive cents for that i am only telling you this to explain why we are so impecunious  the policeman wont prevent my lending you £200  wont he now theres no knowing what a policeman cant do in this country they are very goodnatured all the same  then lord castlewell turned to rachel and asked her whether her suspicions would go so far as to interfere between him and her father it is because i am a pretty girl that you are going to do it she said frowning or because you pretend to think so here the father broke out into a laugh and the lord followed him you had better keep your money to yourself my lord you never can have used it with less chance of getting any return this interview however was ended by the acceptance of a cheque from lord castlewell for £200 payable to the order of gerald omahony     chapter xxviii  what was not done with the funds   she has taken his money all the same this was said some weeks after the transaction as described in the last chapter and was spoken by madame socani to mr moss  how do you know  i know very well you are so infatuated by that young woman that you will believe nothing against her  i am infatuated with her voice i know what she is going to do in the world old barytone told me that he had never heard such a voice from a womans mouth since the days of malibran and if there is a man who knows one voice from another it is barytone he can taste the richness of the instrument down to its lowest tinkling sound  and you would marry such a one as she for her voice  and she can act ah if you could have acted as she does it might have been different  she has got a husband just the same as me  i dont believe it but never mind i would risk all that and i will do it yet if you will only keep your toe in your pump we will have such a company as nothing that le gros can do will be able to cut us down  and she is taking money from that lord  they all take money from lords he replied what does it matter and she is as stout a piece of goods as ever you came across she has given me more impudence in the last eight months than ever i took from any of them and by jupiter i never so much as got a kiss from her  a kiss said madame socani with great contempt  and she has hit me a box on the cheek which i have had to put up with she has always got a dagger about her somewhere to give a fellow a prod in her passion here mr moss laughed or affected to laugh at the idea of the dagger i tell you that she would have it into a fellow in no time  then why dont you leave her alone a little wizened monkey like that it was thus that madame socani expressed her opinion of her rival a creature without an ounce of flesh on her bones her voice wont last long it never does with those little mean made apes there was grisi and tietjensthey had something of a body for a voice to come out of and here is this girl that you think so much of taking money hand over hand from the very first lord she comes across  i dont believe a word of it said the faithful moss  youll find that it is true she will go away to some wateringplace in the autumn and hell be after her did you ever know him spare one of them or one of them poor little creatures that wouldnt rise to his bait  she has got her father with her  her father what is the good of fathers hell take some of the money thats all ill tell you what it is moss if you dont drop her you and i will be two  with all my heart madame socani said moss i have not the slightest intention of dropping her and as for you and me we can get on very well apart  but madame socani though she would be roused by jealousy to make this threat once a month knew very well that she could not afford to sever herself from mr moss and she knew also that mr moss was bound to show her some observance or at any rate to find employment for her as long as she could sing  but mr moss was anxious to find out whether any money arrangements did or did not exist between miss omahony and the lord and was resolved to ask the question in a straightforward manner he had already found out that his old pupil had no power of keeping a secret to herself when thus asked she would sternly refuse to give any reply but she would make her refusal in such a manner as to tell the whole truth in fact rachel among her accomplishments had not the power of telling a lie in such language as to make herself believed it was not that she would scruple in the least to declare to mr moss the very opposite to the truth in a matter in which he had she thought no business to be inquisitive but when she did so she had no power to look the lie you might say of her frequently that she was a downright liar but of all human beings whom you could meet she was the least sly my dear child the father used to say to her words to you are worth nothing unless it be to sing them you can make no impression with them in any other way therefore it was that mr moss felt that he could learn the truth from simply questioning his pupil  miss omahony may i say a few words to you so said mr moss having knocked at the door of rachels sittingroom he had some months ago fallen into the habit of announcing himself when he had come to give her lessons and would inform the servant that he would take up his own name rachel had done what she could do to put an end to the practice but it still prevailed  certainly mr moss was not the girl there to show you up  no doubt she was but such ceremony between us is hardly necessary  i should prefer to be warned of the coming of my master i will see to that in future such little ceremonies do have their uses  shall i go down and make her say that i am here and then come up again  it shall not be necessary but you take a chair and begin then mr moss considered how he had better do so he knew well that the girl would not answer kindly to such a question as he was desirous of asking and it might be that she would be very uncivil he was by no means a coward but he had a vivid recollection of the gleam of her dagger he smiled and she looked at him more suspiciously because of his smile he was sitting on a sofa opposite to her as she sat on a musicstool which she had turned round so as to face him and he fancied that he could see her right hand hide itself among the folds of her dress is it about the theatre  well it isand yet it isnt  i wish it were something about the theatre it always seems to come more natural between you and me  i want you to tell me what you did at last about lord castlewells money  why am i to tell you what i did  for friendship  i do not feel any  thats an uncivil word to say mademoiselle  but its true you have no business to ask me about the lords money and i wont be questioned  it will be so deleterious to you if you accept it  i can take care of myself she said jumping off the chair i shall have left this place now in another month and shall utterly disregard the words which anyone at your theatre may say of me i shall not tell you whether the lord has lent me money or not  i know he has  very well then leave the room knowing as you do that i am living here with my own father your interference is grossly impertinent  your father is not going with you i am afraid she rushed at the bell and pulled it till the bell rope came down from the wire but nobody answered the bell can it be possible that you should not be anxious to begin your new career under respectable auspices  i will not stand this leave the room sir this apartment is my own  miss omahony you see my hand with this i am ready to offer at once to place you in a position in which the world would look up to you  you have done so before mr moss and your doing so again is an insult it would not be done to any young lady unless she were on the stage and were thought on that account to be open to any man about the theatre to say what he pleased to her  any gentleman is at liberty to make any lady an offer  i have answered it now leave the room  i cannot do so until i have heard that you have not taken money from this reprobate  at the moment the door opened and the reprobate entered the room  your servant told me that mr moss was here and therefore i walked up at once said the reprobate  i am so much obliged to you said rachel oh lord castlewell i am so much obliged to you he tells me in the first place that you are a reprobate  never mind me said the lord  i dont mind what he says of you he declares that my character will be gone for ever because you have lent my father some money  so it will said moss who was not afraid to stand up to his guns  and how if she had accepted your offer  no one would have thought of it come my lord you know the difference i am anxious only to save her  it is to her father i have lent the money who explained to me the somewhat cruel treatment he had received at the hands of the police i think you are making an ass of yourself mr moss  very well my lord very well said mr moss all the world no doubt will know that you have lent the money to the irish landleaguer because of your political sympathy with him and will not think for a minute that you have been attracted by our pretty young friend here it will not suspect that it is she who has paid for the loan  mr moss you are a brute said the lord  cant he be turned out of the room asked rachel  well yes it is possible said the lord who slowly prepared to walk up and take some steps towards expelling mr moss  it shall not be necessary said mahomet m m you could not get me out but there would be a terrible row in the house which could not fail to be disagreeable to miss omahony i leave her in your hands and i do not think i could possibly leave her in worse i have wished to make her an honest woman what you want of her you can explain to herself in saying this mr moss walked downstairs and left the house feeling as he went that he had got the better both of the lord and of the lady  with mr moss there was a double motive neither of which was very bright but both of which he followed with considerable energy he had at first been attracted by her good looks which he had desired to make his ownat the cheapest price at which they might be had in the market if marriage were necessary so be it but it might be that the young lady would not be so exigeant it was probably the expression of some such feelings in the early days of their acquaintance which had made him so odious to her then frank jones had come forward and like any good honest girl in a position so public she had at once let the fact of mr jones be made known so as to protect her but it had not protected her and mr moss had been doubly odious then by degrees he had become aware of the value of her voice and he perceived the charms that there were in what he pictured to himself as a professional partnership as well as a marriage various ideas floated through his mind down even to the creation of fresh names grand married names for his wife and if she could be got to see it in the light he saw it what a stroke of business they might do he was aware that she expressed personal dislike to him but he did not think much of that he did not in the least understand the nature of such dislike as she exhibited he thought himself to be a very goodlooking man he was one of a profession to which she also belonged he had no idea that he was not a gentleman but that she was a lady he did not know that there were such things madame socani told him that this young woman was already married to mr jones but had left that gentleman because he had no money he did not believe this but in any case he would be willing to risk it the peril would be hers and not his it was his object to establish the partnership and he did not even yet see any fatal impediment to it  this lord who had been trapped by her beauty by that and by her theatrical standing was an impediment but could be removed he had known lord castlewell to be in love with a dozen singers partly because he thought himself to be a judge of music and partly simply because he had liked their looks the lord had now taken a fancy to miss omahony and had begun by lending her money that the father should take the money instead of the daughter was quite natural to his thinking but he might still succeed in looking after miss omahony and rescuing the singer from the lord by keeping a close watch on her he must make it impossible for the lord to hold her therefore when he went away leaving the lord and the singer together he thought that for the present he had got the better of both  why did he tell you that i was a reprobate said the lord when he found himself alone with the lady  well perhaps it was because you are one my lord said rachel laughing she would constantly remember herself and tell herself that as long as she called him by his title she was protecting herself from that familiarity which would be dangerous  i hope you dont think so  gentlemen generally are reprobates i believe it is not disgraceful for a gentleman to be a reprobate but it is pleasant the young women i daresay find it pleasant but then it is disgraceful i do not mean to disgrace myself lord castlewell  i am sure you will not  i want you to be sure of it quite sure i am a singing girl but i dont mean to be any mans mistress he stared at her as she said this and i dont mean to be any mans wife unless i downright love him now you may keep out of my way if you please i daresay you are a reprobate my lord but with that i have got nothing to do touching this money i suppose father has not got it yet  i have sent it  you are to get nothing for it but simply to have it returned without interest as soon as i have earned it you have only to say the word and i will take care that father shall send it you back again  lord castlewell felt that the girl was very unlike others whom he had known and who had either rejected his offers with scorn or had accepted them with delight this young lady did neither she apparently accepted the proffered friendship and simply desired him to carry his reprobate qualities elsewhere there was a frankness about her which pleased him much though it hardly tended to make him in love with her one thing he did resolve on the spur of the moment that he would never say a word to her which her father might not hear it was quite a new sensation to him this of simple friendship with a singer with a singer whom he had met in the doubtful custody of mr moss but he did believe her to be a good girla good girl who could speak out her mind freely and as such he both respected and liked her of course i shant take back the money till it becomes due youll have to work hard for it before i get it  i shall be quite contented to do that my lord then the interview was over and his lordship left the room  but lord castlewell felt as he went home that this girl was worth more than other girls she laughed at him for being a lord but she could accept a favour from him and then tell him to his face that he should do her no harm because she had accepted it he had met some terrible rebuffs in his career the memory of which had been unpleasant to him and he had been greeted with many smiles all of which had been insipid what should he do with this girl so as to make the best of her the only thing that occurred to him was to marry her and yet such a marriage would be altogether out of his line of life     chapter xxix  what was done with the funds   the £200 was not spent in a manner of which lord castlewell would have altogether approved about the end of august mr omahony was summoned back to ireland and was induced at a meeting held at the rotunda to give certain pledges which justified the advanced irish party in putting him forward as a new member for the county of cavan the advanced irish party had no doubt been attracted by the eloquence he had exhibited both in galway and in london and by the patriotic sentiments which he had displayed he was known to be a republican and to look for the formation of a republic to american aid he had expressed most sincere scorn for everything english and professed ideas as to irish property generally in regard to which he was altogether ignorant of their meaning as he was a sincerely honest man he did think that something good for his old country would be achieved by home rule though how the homerulers would set to work when home rule should be the law of the land he had not the remotest conception there were many reasons therefore why he should be a fit member for an irish county but it must be admitted that he would not have been so unanimously selected had all the peculiarities of his mind been known it might be probable that he would run riot under the lash of his leader as others have done both before and since when he should come to see all the wiles of that strategy which he would be called upon to support and in such case the quarrel with him would be more internecine than with other foes such as english members scotch members conservative irish members and liberal irish members not sworn to follow certain leaders a recreant one out of twenty friends would be regarded with more bitter hatred than perhaps six hundred and thirty ordinary enemies it might be therefore that a time of tribulation was in store for mr omahony but he did not consider these matters very deeply when the cheers rang loud in the hall of the rotunda nor did he then reflect that he was about to spend in an injudicious manner the money which must be earned by rachels future work  when rachel had completed her engagement with mr moss it had been intended that they should go down to ambleside and there spend lord castlewells money in the humble innocent enjoyment of nature there had at that moment been nothing decided as to the county of cavan a porkbutcher possessed of some small means and unlimited impudence had put himself forward but the twenty had managed to put him through his facings and had found him to be very ignorant in his use of the queens english now of late there had come up a notion that the small party required to make up for the thinness of their members by the strength of their eloquence practice makes perfect and it is not to be wondered at therefore if a large proportion of the twenty had become fluent but more were wanted and of our friend omahonys fluency there could be no doubt therefore he was sent for and on the very day of his arrival he proved to the patriotic spirits of dublin that he was the man for cavan three days afterwards he went down and cavan obediently accepted its man with her father went rachel and was carried through the towns of virginia bailyborough and ballyjamesduff in great triumph on a onehorse car  this occurred about the end of august and lord castlewells £200 was very soon spent she had not thought much about it but had been quite willing to be the daughter of a member of parliament if a constituency could be found willing to select her father she did not think much of the duties of parliament if they came within the reach of her fathers ability she did not in truth think that he could under any circumstances do half a days work she had known what it was to practise and having determined to succeed she had worked as only a singer can work who determines that she will succeed hour after hour she had gone on before the lookingglass and even mr moss had expressed his approval but during the years that she had been so at work she had never seen her father do anything she knew that he talked what she called patriotic buncombe it might be that he would become a very fitting member of parliament but rachel had her doubt she could see however that the £200 quickly vanished during their triumphant journeyings on the onehorse car everybody in county cavan seemed to know that there was £200 and no more to be spent by the new member there he was however member of parliament for the county of cavan and his breast was filled with new aspirations enmity the bitterest enmity to everything english was the one lesson taught him but he himself had other feelings what if he could talk over that speaker and that prime minister that government generally and all the house of commons and all the house of lords why should not england go her way and ireland hersengland have her monarchy and ireland her republic but still with some kind of union between them as to the nature of which mr omahony had no fixed idea in his brain whatsoever but he knew that he could talk and he knew also that he must now talk on an arena for admission to which the public would not pay twentyfive cents or more his breast was much disturbed by the consideration that for all the work which he proposed to do no wages were to be forthcoming  but while mr omahony was being elected member of parliament for county cavan things were going on very sadly in county galway wednesday the 31st of august had been the day fixed for the trial of pat carroll and the month of august was quickly wearing itself away but during the month of august captain clayton found occasion more than once to come into the neighbourhood of headford and though mr jones was of an opinion that his presence there was adequately accounted for by the details of the coming trial the two girls evidently thought that some other cause might be added to that which pat carroll had produced  it must be explained that at this period frank jones was absent from morony castle looking out for emergency men who could be brought down to the neighbourhood of headford in sufficient number to save the crop on mr joness farm and with him was tom daly who had some scheme in his own head with reference to his horses and his hounds mr persse and sir jasper lynch had been threatened with a wide system of boycotting unless they would give up tom dalys animals a decree had gone forth in the county that nothing belonging to the hunt should be allowed to live within its precincts all the bitterness and the cruelty and the horror arising from this order are beyond the limit of this story but it may be well to explain that at the present moment frank jones was away from castle morony working hard on his fathers behalf  and so were the girls working hardmaking the butter and cooking the meat and attending to the bedrooms and peter was busy with them as their lieutenant it might be thought that the present was no time for lovemaking and that captain clayton could not have been in the mood but it may be observed that at any period of special toil in a family when infinitely more has to be done than at any other time then lovemaking will go on with more than ordinary energy edith was generally to be found with her hair tucked tight off her face and enveloped in a coarse dairymaids apron and ada when she ran downstairs would do so with a housemaids dustingbrush at her girdle and they were neither of them when so attired in the least afraid of encountering captain clayton as he would come out from their fathers room all the world knew that they were being boycotted and very happy the girls were during the process poor papa did not like it so well poor papa thought of his bankers account or rather of that bank at which there was so to say no longer any account but the girls were light of heart and in the pride of their youth but alas they had both of them blundered frightfully it was edith edith the prudent edith the wise edith who was supposed to know everything who had first gone astray in her blundering and had taken ada with her but the story with its details must be told  my pet she said to her elder sister as they were standing together at the kitchen dresser i know he means to speak to you today  what nonsense edith  it has to be done some day you know and he is just the man to come upon one in the time of ones dire distress of course we havent got a halfpenny now belonging to us i was thinking only the other day how comfortable it is that we never go out of the house because we havent the means to buy boots now captain clayton is just the man to be doubly attracted by such penury  i dont know why a man is to make an offer to a girl just because he finds her working like a housemaid  i do i can see it all he is just the man to take you in his arms because he found you peeling potatoes  i beg he will do nothing of the kind said ada he has never said a word to me or i to him to justify such a proceeding i should at once hit him over the head with my brush  here he comes and now we will see how far i understand such matters  dont go edith said ada pray dont go if you go i shall go with you these things ought always to come naturallythat is if they come at all  it did not come at that moment for edith was so far mistaken that captain clayton after saying a few words to the girls passed on out of the backdoor intent on special business what a wretched individual he is said edith fancy pinning ones character on the doings of such a man as that however he will be back again to dinner and you will not be so hard upon him then with your dustingbrush  before dinner the captain did return and found himself alone with edith in the kitchen it was her turn on this occasion to send up whatever meal in the shape of dinner castle morony could afford there you have it sir she said pointing to a boiled neck of mutton which had been cut from the remains of a sheep sent in to supply the family wants  i see said he it will make a very good dinneror a very bad one according to circumstances as they may fall out before the dinner leaves the kitchen  then they will have to fall out very quickly said edith but the colour had flown to her face and in that moment she had learned to suspect the truth and her mind flew back rapidly over all her doings and sayings for the last three months if it was so she could never forgive herself if it was so ada would never forgive her if it was so they two and captain yorke clayton must be separated for ever well what is it she said roughly the joint of meat had fallen from her hands and she looked up at captain clayton with all the anger she could bring into her face  edith he said you surely know that i love you  i know nothing of the kind there can be no reason why i should know itwhy i should guess it it cannot be so without grievous wrong on your part  what wrong  base wrong done to my sister she answered then she remembered that she had betrayed her sister and she remembered too how much of the supposed lovemaking had been done by her own words and not by any spoken by captain clayton and there came upon her at that moment a remembrance also of that other moment in which she had acknowledged to herself that she had loved this man and had told herself that the love was vain and had sworn to herself that she would never stand in adas way and had promised to herself that all things should be happy to her as this mans sisterinlaw acting then on this idea merely because ada had been beautiful she had gone to workand this had come of it in that minute that was allowed to her as the boiled mutton was cooling on the dresser beneath her hand all this passed through her mind  wrong done by me to ada said the captain  i have said it but if you are a gentleman you will forget it i know that you are a gentlemana gallant man such as few i think exist anywhere captain clayton there are but two of us take the best take the fairest take the sweetest let all this be as though it had never been spoken i will be such a sister to you as no man ever won for himself and ada will be as loving a wife as ever graced a mans home let it be so and i will bless every day of your life  no he said slowly i cannot let it be like that i have learned to love you and you only and i thought that you had known it  never  i had thought so it cannot be as you propose i shall never speak of your sister to a living man i shall never whisper a word of her regard even here in her own family but i cannot change my heart as you propose your sister is beautiful and sweet and good but she is not the girl who has crept into my heart and made a lasting home for herself thereif the girl who has done so would but accept it ada is not the girl whose brightness whose bravery whose wit and ready spirit have won me these things go i think without any effort i have known that there has been no attempt on your part but the thing has been done and i had hoped that you were aware of it it cannot now be undone i cannot be passed on to another here here here is what i want and he put his two hands upon her shoulders there is no other girl in all ireland that can supply her place if she be lost to me  he had spoken very solemnly and she had stood there in solemn mood listening to him by degrees the conviction had come upon her that he was in earnest and was not to be changed in his purpose by anything that she could say to him she had blundered had blundered awfully she had thought that with a man beauty would be everything but with this man beauty had been nothing nor had good temper and a sense of duty availed anything she rushed into the diningroom carrying the boiled mutton with her and he followed what should she do now ada would yieldwould give him upwould retire into the background and would declare that edith should be made happy but would never lift up her head again and sheshe herselfcould also give him up and would lift up her head again she knew that she had a power of bearing sorrow and going on with the work of the world in spite of all troubles which ada did not possess it might therefore have all been settled but that the man was stubborn and would not be changed of course he is a man said edith to herself as she put the mutton down of course he must have it all to please himself of course he will be selfish  i thought you were never coming with our morsel of dinner said mr jones  here is the morsel of dinner but i could have dished it in half the time if captain clayton had not been there  of course i am the offender said he as he sat down and now i have forgotten to bring the potatoes so he started off and met florian at the door coming in with them mr jones carved the mutton and captain clayton was helped first in a boycotted house you will always find that the gentlemen are helped before the ladies it is a part of the principle of boycotting that women shall subject themselves  captain clayton after his first little stir about the potatoes ate his dinner in perfect silence that which had taken place upset him more completely than the rifles of two or three landleaguers mr jones was also silent he was a man at the present moment nearly overwhelmed by his cares and ada too was silent as edith looked at her furtively she began to fear that her pet suspected something there was a look of suffering in her face which edith could read though it was not plain enough written there to be legible to others her father and florian had no key by which to read it and captain clayton never allowed his eyes to turn towards adas face but it was imperative on both that they should not all fall into some feeling of special sorrow through their silence it is just one week more she said before you men must be at galway  only one week said florian  it will be much better to have it over said the father i do not think you need come back at all but start at once from galway your sisters can bring what things you want and say goodbye at athenry  my poor florian said edith  i shant mind it so much when i get to england said the boy i suppose i shall come home for the christmas holidays  i dont know about that said the father it will depend upon the state of the country  you will come and meet him ada asked edith  i suppose so said ada and her sister knew from the tone of her voice that some evil was already suspected  there was nothing more said that night till edith and ada were together mr jones lingered with his daughters and the captain took florian out about the orchard thinking it well to make him used to whatever danger might come to him from being out of the house they will never come where they will be sure to be known said the captain and known by various witnesses and they wont come for the chance of a pop shot i am getting to know their ways as well as though i had lived there all my life they count on the acquittal of pat carroll as a certainty whatever i may be you are tolerably safe as long as that is the case  they may shoot me in mistake for you said the boy  well yes that is so let us go back to the house but i dont think there would be any danger tonight anyway then they returned and found mr jones alone in the diningroom he was very melancholy in these days as a man must be whom ruin stares in the face  edith had followed ada upstairs to the bedrooms and had crept after her into that which had been prepared for captain clayton she could see now by the lingering light of an august evening that a tear had fallen from each eye and had slowly run down her sisters cheeks oh ada dear ada what is troubling you  nothingmuch  my girl my beauty my darling much or little what is it cannot you tell me  he cares nothing for me said ada laying her hand upon the pillow thus indicating the he whom she intended edith answered not a word but pressed her arm tight round her sisters waist it is so said ada turning round upon her sister as though to rebuke her you know that it is so  my beauty my own one said edith kissing her  you know it is so he has told you it is not me that he loves it is you you are his chosen one i am nothing to himnothing nothing then she flung herself down upon the bed which her own hands had prepared for him  it was all true as the assertions had come from her one by one edith had found herself unable to deny a tittle of what was said ada if you knew my heart to you  what good is it why did you teach me to believe a falsehood  oh you will kill me if you accuse me i have been so true to you then ada turned round upon the bed and hid her face for a few minutes upon the pillow ada have i not been true to you  but that you should have been so much mistakenyou who know everything  i have not known him said edith  but you will said ada you will be his wife  never ejaculated the other  then slowly ada got up from the bed and shook her hair from off her face and wiped her eyes with her handkerchief it must be so she said of course it must as he wishes it he must have all that he desires  no not so he shall never have this  yes edith he must and he shall do you not know that you loved him before you ever bade me to do so but why oh why did you ever make that great mistake and why was i so foolish as to have believed you come she said i must make his bed for him once again he will be here soon now and we must be away then she did obliterate the traces of her form which her figure had made upon the bed and smoothed the pillow and wiped away the mark of her tear which had fallen on it come edith come said she let us go and understand each other he knows for you have told him but no one else need know he shall be your husband and i will be his sister and all shall be bright between you  never said edith never he will never be married if he waits for me  my dear one you shall be his wife said ada such were the last words which passed between them on that night     chapter xxx  the road to ballyglunin   the days ran on for the trial of pat carroll but edith did not again see captain clayton there came tidings to morony castle of the new honours which mr omahony had achieved  i dont know that the country will be much the wiser for his services said captain clayton he will go altogether with those wretched landleaguers  he will be the best of the lot said mr jones  it is saying very little for him said captain clayton  he is an honest man and i take him to be the only honest man among them  he wont remain a landleaguer long if he is honest but what about his daughter  frank has seen her down in cavan and declares that she is about to make any amount of money at the london theatres  i take it they will find it quite a new thing to have a member of parliament among their number with an income said clayton but ill bet any man a new hat that there is a split between him and them before the next parliament is half over  this took place during one of the visits which captain clayton had made to morony castle in reference to the coming trial florian had been already sent on to mr blakes of carnlough and was to be picked up there on that very afternoon by mr jones and driven to ballyglunin so as to be taken from thence to the assize town by train this was thought to be most expedient as the boy would not be on the road for above half an hour  after captain clayton had gone mr jones asked after edith and was told that she was away in headford she had walked into town to call on mrs armstrong with a view of getting a few articles which mrs armstrong had promised to buy for her such was the story as given to mr jones and fully believed by him but the reader may be permitted to think that the young lady was not anxious to meet the young gentleman  ada said mr jones suddenly is there anything between edith and captain clayton  what makes you ask papa  because peter has hinted it i do not care to have such things told me of my own family by the servant  yes there is papa said ada boldly captain clayton is in love with edith  this is no time for marrying or giving in marriage  ada made no reply but thought that it must at the same time be a very good time for becoming engaged it would have been so for her had such been her luck but of herself she said nothing she had made her statement openly and bravely to her sister so that there should be no departing from it mr jones said nothing further at the moment but before the girls had separated for the night ada had told edith what had occurred  at that time they were in the house alone togetheralone as regarded the family though they still had the protection of peter mr jones had started on his journey to galway  papa said ada knows all about yorke  knows what demanded edith  that you and he are engaged together  he knows more than i do then he knows more than i ever shall know ada you should not have said so it will have to be all unsaid  not at all dear  it will all have to be unsaid have you been speaking to captain clayton on the subject  not a word indeed it was not i who told papa it was peter peter said that there was something between you and him and papa asked me i told papa that he was in love with you that was true at any rate you wont deny that  i will deny anything that connects my name with that of captain yorke clayton  but ada had determined how that matter should arrange itself since the blow had first fallen on her she had had time to think of itand she had thought of it edith had done her best for her presuming that this brave captain was the best and she in return would do her best for edith no one knew the whole story but they two they were to be to her the dearest friends of her future life and she would not let the knowledge of such a story stand in her way or theirs  the train was to start from the ballyglunin station for athenry at 420 pm it would then have left tuam for athenry where it would fall into the day mailtrain from dublin to galway it was something out of the way for mr jones to call at carnlough but carnlough was not three miles from ballyglunin and mr jones made his arrangements accordingly he called at carnlough and there took up the boy on his outside car peter had come with him so as to take back the car to morony castle but peter had made himself of late somewhat disagreeable and mr jones had in truth been sulky  look here peter he had said speaking from one side of the car to the other if you are afraid to come to ballyglunin with me and master flory say so and get down  im not afeared mr jones  then dont say so i dont believe you are afeared as you call it  then why do you be talking at me like that sir  i dont think you are a coward but you are anxious to make the most of your services on my behalf you are telling everyone that something special is due to you for staying in a boycotted house its a kind of service for which i am grateful but i cant be grateful and pay too  why do you talk to a poor boy in that way  so that the poor boy may understand me you are willing i believe to stick to your old masterfrom sheer good heart but you like to talk about it now i dont like to hear about it after that peter drove on in silence till they came to carnlough  the car had been seen coming up the avenue and mr blake with his wife and florian were standing on the doorsteps now do take care of the poor dear boy said mrs blake there are such dreadful stories told of horrible men about the country  dont mention such nonsense winifred said her husband trying to frighten the boy there isnt a human being between this and ballyglunin for whom i wont be responsible till you come to a mile of the station its all my own property  but they can shoot then mrs blake left the rest of her sentence unspoken having been checked by her husbands eye the boy however had heard it and trembled  come along florian said the father get up along with peter the attempt which he had made to live with his son on affectionate paternal relations had hardly been successful the boy had been told so much of murderers that he had been made to fear peterand other peters about the countryhad filled his mind with sad foreboding and there had always been something timid something almost unmanly in his nature he had seemed to prefer to shrink and cower and be mysterious with the carrolls to coming forward boldly with such a man as yorke clayton the girls had seen this and had declared that he was no more than a boy but his father had seen it and had made no such allowance and now he saw that he trembled but florian got up on the car and peter drove them off to ballyglunin  carnlough was not above three irish miles from ballyglunin and mr jones started on the little journey without a misgiving he sat alone on the near side of the car and florian sat on the other together with peter who was driving the horse was a heavy slowgoing animal rough and hairy in its coat but trustworthy and an old servant there had been a time when mr jones kept a carriage but that had been before the bad times had begun the carriage horses had been sold after the floodas ada had called the memorable incident and now there were but three cart horses at morony castle of which this one animal alone was habitually driven in the car the floods indeed had now retreated from the lands of ballintubber and the flood gates were mended but there would be no crop of hay on all those eighty acres this year and mr jones was in no condition to replace his private stud as he went along on this present journey he was thinking bitterly of the injury which had been done him he had lost over two hundred tons of hay and each ton of hay would have been worth three pounds ten shillings he had been unable to get a sluice gate mended till men had been brought together from monaghan and parts of cavan to mend them for him and he had even to send these men into limerick to buy the material as not a piece of timber could be procured in galway for the use of a household so well boycotted as was morony castle there had been also various calls on mr jones from those relatives whose money had been left as mortgages on his property and no rent had as yet come in although various tenants had been necessarily evicted every mans hand was against him so that there was no money in his coffers he who had chiefly sinned against himwho was the first to sinwas the sinner whom he was about to prosecute at galway it must be supposed therefore that he was not in a good humour as he was driven along the road to ballyglunin  they had not yet passed the boundary fence between carnlough and the property of one of the numerous race of bodkins when mr jones saw a mask which he supposed to be a mask worn by a man through a hole in the wall just in front of him but high above his head and at the same moment he could see the muzzles of a doublebarrelled rifle presented through the hole in the wall what he saw he saw but for a few seconds but he could see it plainly he saw it so plainly as to be able afterwards to swear to a black mask and to a doublebarrelled gun then a trigger was pulled and one bulletthe secondwent through the collar of his own coat while the first had had a more fatal and truer aim the father jumped up and turning round saw that his boy had fallen to the ground oh my god said peter and he stopped the horse suddenly the place was one where the commencement had been made of a cutting in the road during the potato failure of 1846 so that the wall and the rifle which had been passed through it were about four or five feet above the car mr jones rushed up the elevation and clambered he did not know how into the field there he saw the back of a man speeding along from the wall and in the mans hand there was a gun mr jones looked around but there was no one nigh him but peter the old servant and his dying boy he could see however that the man who ran was short of stature  but though his rage had sufficed to carry him up from the road into the field the idea that his son had been shot caused him to pause as he ran and to return to the road when he got there he found two girls about seventeen and eighteen years of age one sitting on the road with florians head on her lap and the other kneeling and holding the boys hands oh yer honour sorrow a taste in life do we know about it said the kneeling girl  not a sight did we see or a sound did we hear said the other only the going off of the blunderbuss oh wirra shure oh musha musha and its dead he is the darling boy mr jones came round and picked up poor florian and laid him on the car the bullet had gone true to its mark and had buried itself in his brain there was the end of poor florian jones and all his troubles the father did not say a word not even in reply to peters wailings or to the girls easy sorrow but taking the rein in his own hands drove the car with the body on it back to carnlough  we can hardly analyse the fathers mind as he went not a tear came to his relief nor during this half hour can he hardly have been said to sorrow an intensity of wrath filled his breast he had spent his time for many a long year in doing all in his power for those around him and now they had brought him to this they had robbed him of his boys heart they had taught his boy to be one of them and to be untrue to his own people and now because he had yielded to better teachings they had murdered him they had taught his boy to be a coward for even in his bereavement he remembered poor florians failing the accursed papist people were all cowards down to their backbones so he said of them in his rage there was not one of them who could look any peril in the face as did yorke clayton or his son frank but they were terribly powerful in their wretched want of manliness they could murder and were protected in their bloodthirstiness one by another he did not doubt but that those two girls who were wailing on the road knew well enough who was the murderer but no one would tell in this accursed unhallowed godless country the honour and honesty of one man did not in these days prompt another to abstain from vice the only heroism left in the country was the heroism of mystery of secret bloodshed and of hidden attacks  he had driven back methodically to carnlough gates but he hesitated to carry his burden up to the halldoor would it not be better for him at once to go home and there to endure the suffering that was in store for him but he remembered that it would behove him to take what steps might be possible for tracing the murderer that by no steps could anything be done he was sure but still the attempt was necessary he had however paused a minute or two at the open gate when he was rebuked by peter shure yer honour is going up to the house to get the constables to scour the counthry  scour the country said the father all the country will turn out to defend the murderer of my boy but he drove up to the front and peter knocked at the door  good heaven jones said mr blake as he looked at the car and its occupant the poor boys head was supported on the pillow behind the drivers seat on which no one sat peter held him by both his feet and mr jones had his hand within his grasp  so it is said the father you know where they have cut the road just where your property meres with bodkins there was a man above there who had loopholed the wall i saw his face wearing a mask as plain as i can see yours and he had a doublebarrelled gun he fired the two shots and my boy was killed by the first  they have struck you too on the collar of your coat  i got into the field with the murderer and i could have caught the man had i been younger but what would have been the use no jury would have found him guilty what am i to do oh god what am i to do mrs blake and her daughter were now out upon the steps and were filling the hall with their wailings tell me blake what had i better do then mr blake decided that the body should remain there that night and mr jones also and that the police should be sent for to do whatever might seem fitting to the policemens mind peter was sent off to morony castle with such a letter as miss blake was able to write to the two jones girls the police came from tuam but the result of their enquiries on that night need not be told here     chapter xxxi  the galway court house   there was a feeling very general in the county that the murder had been committed by the man named lax who was known to have been in the neighbourhood lately and was declared by his friends at headford to be now in galway waiting for the trial of pat carroll but there seemed to be a feeling about the country that florian jones had deserved his fate he had it was said been untrue to his religion he had given a solemn promise to father brosnanof what nature was not generally knownand had broken it the bittherness of the orange feud was in his blood said father brosnan but neither did he explain the meaning of what he said as none of the jones family had ever been orangemen but the idea was common about tuam and headford that pat carroll was a martyr and that florian had been persuaded to turn protestant in order that he might give false evidence against him the reader however must understand that florian still professed the catholic religion at the moment of his death and that all headford was aware that pat carroll had broken the sluice gate at ballintubber  after an interval of two days the trial was about to go on at galway in spite of the murder it was quite true that by nothing could the breath of life be restored to florian jones his evidence such as it was could now be taken only from his deposition and such evidence was regarded as being very unfair both on one side and on the other as given against pat carroll it was regarded as unfair as being incapable of subjection to crossexamination the boys evidence had been extracted from him by his parents and by captain yorke clayton in opposition to the statements which had been made scores of times by himself on the other side and which if true would all tend to exonerate the prisoner it had been the intention of mr odonnell the senior counsel employed to defend carroll to insist with the greatest severity on the lies told by the poor boy it was this treatment which florian had especially feared there could be no such treatment now but mr odonnell would know well how to insist on the injustice of the deposition in which no allusion would be made to the falsehood previously told but on the other side it was said that the witness had been removed so that his evidence should not be given they must now depend solely on the statement of terry carroll pats brother and who also had lied terribly before he told the truth and he too was condemned more bitterly even by mr jones and his friends in that he was giving evidence against his brother than had he continued to lie on his behalf the circumstances being such as they were it was felt to be almost impossible to secure the conviction of pat carroll for the offence he had committed and yet there were certainly a dozen persons who had seen that offence committed in the light of day and many other dozens who knew by whom the offence had been committed  and indeed the feeling had become common through the country that all the lawyers and judges in irelandthe lawyers and judges that is who were opposed to the landleaguecould not secure a conviction of any kind against prisoners whom the landleague was bound to support it had come to be whispered about that there were men in the county of galwayand men also in other countiestoo strong for the government men who could beat the government on any point men whom no jury could be brought to convict by any evidence men who boasted of the possession of certain secret powerswhich generally meant murder it came to be believed that these men were possessed of certain mysterious capabilities which the police could not handle nor the magistrates touch and the danger to be feared from these men arose chiefly from the belief in them which had become common it was not that they could do anything special if left to their own devices but that the crowds by whom they were surrounded trembled at their existence the man living next to you ignorant and a roman catholic inspired with some mysterious awe would wish in his heart that the country was rid of such firebrands he knew well that the country and he as part of the country had more to get from law and order than from murder and misrule but murder and misrule had so raised their heads for the present as to make themselves appear to him more powerful than law and order mr lax and others like him were keenly alive to the necessity of maintaining this belief in their mysterious power  the trial came on having been delayed two days by the murder of poor florian jones his body had in the meantime been taken home and the only visitor received at morony castle had been yorke clayton on his coming he had been at first closeted with mr jones and had then gone out and seen the two girls together he had taken adas hand first and then ediths but he had held ediths the longer the girls had known that it was so but neither of them had said a word to rebuke him who was it asked ada  clayton shook his head and ground his teeth do you know or have you an idea you know so much about the country said edith  to you two but to you only i do know he and i cannot exist together the mans name is lax  it may be imagined that the trial was not commenced at galway without the expression of much sympathy for mr jones and the family at morony castle it is hard to explain the different feelings which existed feelings exactly opposed to each other but which still were both in their way general and true he was poor mr jones who had lost his son and worse still his eighty acres of grass and he was also that fellow jones that enemy to the landleague whom it behoved all patriotic irishmen to get the better of and to conquer florian had been murdered on the 30th of august which was a tuesday and the trial had been postponed until friday the 2nd of september it was understood that the boy was to be buried at headford on saturday the 3rd but nevertheless the father was in the assize town on the friday he was in the town and at eleven oclock he took his place in the crown court he was a man who was still continually summoned as a grand juror and as such had no difficulty in securing for himself a place to the right of the judge sat the twelve jurors who had been summoned to try the case and to the left was the grand jurors box in which mr jones took his seat early in the day and frank was also in the court and had been stopped by no one when he accompanied his father into the grand jurors box  but the court was crowded in a wonderful manner so that they who understood the ways of criminal courts in ireland knew that something special was boded as soon as mr justice parry took his seat it was seen that the court was much more than ordinarily filled and was filled by men who did not make themselves amenable to the police many were the instructions given by the judge who had been selected with a special view to this trial judge parry was a roman catholic who had sat in the house of commons as a strong liberal had been attorneygeneral to a liberal government and had been suspected of holding homerule sentiments but men when they become judges are apt to change their ideas and judge parry was now known to be a firm man whom nothing would turn from the execution of his duty there had been many judge parrys in ireland who have all gone the same gait and have followed the same course when they have accepted the ermine a man is at liberty to indulge what vagaries he pleases as long as he is simply a member of parliament but a judge is not at liberty he now gave special instructions to the officers of the court to keep quiet and to preserve order but the court was full densely crowded and the noise which arose from the crowd was only the noise as of people whispering loudly among themselves  the jury was quickly sworn and the trial was set on foot pat carroll was made to stand up in the dock and mr jones looked at the face of the man who had been the first on his property to show his hostility to the idea of paying rent he and lax had been great friends and it was known that lax had sworn that in a short time not a shilling of rent should be paid in the county mayo from that assurance all these troubles had come  then the attorneygeneral opened the case and to tell the truth he made a speech which though very eloquent was longer than necessary he spoke of the dreadful state of the country a matter which he might have left to the judge and almost burst into tears when he alluded to the condition of mr jones the gentleman who sat opposite to him and he spoke at full length of the evidence of the poor boy whose deposition he held in his hand which he told the jury he would read to them later on in the day no doubt the lad had deceived his father since the offence had been committed he had long declared that he knew nothing of the perpetrators the boy had seemed to entertain in his mind certain ideas friendly to the landleague and had made promises on behalf of landleaguers to which he had long adhered but his father had at last succeeded and the truth had been forthcoming his lordship would instruct them how far the boys deposition could be accepted as evidence and how far it must fail and so at last the attorneygeneral brought his eloquent speech to an end  and now there arose a murmuring sound in the court and a stirring of feet and a moving of shoulders louder than that which had been heard before the judge there on his bench looking out from under his bushy eyebrows could see that the people before him were all of one class and he could see also that the halfdozen policemen who were kept close among the crowd were so pressed as to be hardly masters of their own actions he called out a word even from the bench in which there was something as to clearing the court but no attempt to clear the court was made or was apparently possible the first witness was summoned and an attempt was made to bring him up through the dock into the witnessbox this witness was terry carroll the brother of pat and was known to be there that he might swear away his brothers liberty his head no sooner appeared as about to leave the dock than the whole court was filled with a yell of hatred there were two policemen standing between the two brothers but pat only turned round and looked at the traitor with scorn but the voices through the court sounded louder and more venomous as terry carroll stepped out of the dock among the policemen who were to make an avenue for him up to the witnessbox  it was the last step he ever made at that moment the flash of a pistol was seen in the court of a pistol close at the mans ear and terry carroll was a dead man the pistol had touched his head as it had been fired so that there had been no chance of escape in this way was the other witness removed who had been brought thither by the crown to give evidence as to the demolition of mr joness flood gates and it was said afterwardsfor weeks afterwardsthat such should be the fate of all witnesses who appeared in the west of ireland to obey the behests of the crown  then was seen the reason why the special crowd had been gathered there and of what nature were the men who had swarmed into court clayton who had been sitting at the end of the row of barristers jumped up over the back of the bench and rushed in among the people who now tried simply to hold their own places and appeared neither to be anxious to go in or out tear an ages musther clayton what are you after jumping on to a fellow that way this was said by a brawny miletian on to whose shoulders our friend had leaped meaning to get down among the crowd but the miletian had struck him hard and would have knocked him down had there been room enough for him on which to fall but clayton had minded the blow not at all and had minded the judge as little making his way in through the crowd over the dead body of terry carroll he had been aware that lax was in the court and had seated himself opposite to the place where the man had stood but lax had moved himself during the attorneygenerals speech either with the view of avoiding the captains eyesor if he were to be the murderer of finding the best place from which the deed could be done if this had been his object certainly the place had been well selected it was afterwards stated that though fifty people at the judges end of the court had seen the pistol no eyes had seen the face of him who held it many faces had been seen but nobody could connect a single face with the pistol and it was proved also that the ball had entered the head just under the ear with a slant upwards towards the brain as though the weapon had been used by someone crouching towards the ground  clayton made his way out of court followed by the faithful hunter and was soon surrounded by half a score of policemen hunter was left to watch the door of the court because he was well acquainted with lax and because should lax come across hunter god help mr lax as clayton expressed himself and others were sent by twos and threes through the city to catch this man if it were possible or to obtain tidings respecting him a man cannot bury himself under the ground said clayton we have always this pull upon them that they cannot make themselves invisible but in this case it almost did appear that mr lax had the power  though pat carroll was not at once set at liberty his trial was brought to an end it was felt to be impossible to send the case to the jury when the only two witnesses belonging to the crown had been murdered the prisoner was remanded or sent back to gaol so that the crown might look for more evidence if more might chance to be found and everybody else connected in the matter was sent home a dark gloom settled itself on galway and men were heard to whisper among themselves that the queens laws were no longer in force and there was a rowdy readiness to oppose all force the force of the police for instance and the force of the military there were men there who seemed to think that now had come the good time when they might knock anyone on the head at their leisure it did not come quite to this as the police were still combined and their enemies were not so but such men as captain clayton began to look as though they doubted what would become of it if he thinks he is big enough to catch a hold of terry lax and keep him hell precious soon find his mistake this was said by con heffernan of captain clayton     chapter xxxii  mr omahony as member of parliament   frank jones had travelled backwards and forwards between morony castle and the north more than once since these things were doing and had met the new member for cavan together with rachel on the very evening on which poor florian had been murdered it was not till the next morning that the news had become generally known i am sorry to hear frank said rachel that you are all doing so badly at morony castle  badly enough  are you fetching all these people down from here to do the work the men there ought to do how are the men there to get their wages  that is the essence of boycotting said frank the men there wont get their wages and can only live by robbing the governor and men like him of their rents and in that way they cant live long everything will be disturbed and ruined  it seems to me said rachel that the whole country is coming to an end  your father is member of parliament now and of course he will set it all to rights  he will at any rate do his best to do so said rachel and will rob no man in the doing it what do you mean to do with yourself  stick to the ship till it sinks and then go down with it  and your sisters  they are of the same way of thinking i take it they are not good at inventing any way of getting out of their troubles but they know how to endure  now frank said she shall i give you a bit of advice  oh yes i like advice  you wanted to kiss me just now  that was natural at any rate  no it wasntbecause you and i are two when a young man and a young woman are two they shouldnt kiss any more that is logic  i dont know about logic  at any rate it is something of the same sort it is the kind of thing everybody believes in if they want to go right you and i want to go right dont we  i believe so  of course we do and she took hold of his arm and shook him it would break your heart if you didnt think i was going right and why shouldnt i be as anxious about you now for my piece of advice i am going to make a lot of money  i am glad to hear it  come and share it with me i would have shared yours if you had made a lot you must call me madame de iona or some such name as that the name does not matter but the money will be all there wont it be grand to be able to help your father and your sisters only you men are so beastly proud isnt it honest moneymoney that has come by singing  certainly it is  and if the wife earns it instead of the husbandisnt that honest and then you know she said looking up into his face you can kiss me right away isnt that an inducement  the offer was an inducement but the conversation only ended in a squabble she rebuked him for his dishonesty in taking the kiss without acceding to the penalty and he declared that according to his view of the case he could not become the fainéant husband of a rich opera singer and yet you would ask me to become the fainéante wife of a wealthy landowner and because under the stress of the times you are not wealthy you choose to reject the girl altogether who has given you her heart go away you are no good when a man stands up on his hind legs and pretends to be proud he never is any good  then mr omahony came in and had a political discussion with frank jones yes said the member of parliament i mean to put my shoulder to the wheel and do the very best that can be done i cannot believe but what a man in earnest will find out the truth politics are not such a hopeless muddle but what some gleam of light may be made to shine through  there are such things as leaders said frank  then mr omahony stood up and laid his hand upon his heart you remember what van artevelde saidthey shall murder me ere make me go the way that is not my way for an inch i say the same  what will mr parnell do with such a follower  mr parnell is also an honest man cried mr omahony two honest men looking for light together will never fall out i at any rate have some little gift of utterance perhaps i can persuade a man or two men at any rate i will try  but how are we to get back to london father said rachel i dont think it becomes an honest member of parliament to take money out of a common fund you will have to remain here in pawn till i go and sing you out but rachel had enough left of lord castlewells money to carry them back to london on condition that they did not stop on the road and to this condition she was forced to bring her father  early on the following morning before they started the news reached cavan of poor florians death oh god my brother exclaimed frank but it was all that he did say he was a man who like his father had become embittered by the circumstances of the times mr jones had bought his property now thirty years since with what was then called a parliamentary title he had paid hard money for it and had induced his friends to lend their money to assist the purchase for which he was responsible much of the land he had been enabled to keep in his own hands but on none of the tenants had he raised the rent now there had come forth a law not from the hand of the landleaguers but from the government who it was believed would protect those who did their duty by the country under this law commissioners were to be appointedor subcommissionersmen supposed to be not of great mark in the country who were to reduce the rent according to their ideas of justice if a man paid ten poundsor had engaged to pay tenlet him take his pen and write down seven or eight as the subcommissioner should decide as the outside landlords the friends of mr jones must have five pounds out of the original ten that which was coming to mr jones himself would be about halved and the condition of mr jones under the system of boycotting which he was undergoing was hard to endure now frank was the eldest son and the property of castle morony and ballintubber was entailed upon him he was brought up in his early youth to feel that he was to fill that situation which of all others is the most attractive he was to have been the eldest son of a man of unembarrassed property now he was offered to be taken to london as the travelling husbandor upper servant as it might beof an opera singer then while he was in this condition there came to him the news that his brother had been murdered and he must go home to give what assistance was in his power to his poor illused sisters it is not to be wondered at that he was embittered he had been spending some hours of the last day in reading the clauses of the bill under which the subcommissioners were to show him what mercy they might think right as he left cavan the following morning his curses were more deep against the government than against the landleague  mr omahony and his daughter got back to cecil street in september in a very impecunious state he soon began to understand that the position of member of parliament was more difficult and dangerous than that of a lecturer the police had interfered with him but the police had in truth done him no harm nor had they wanted anything from him but as member of parliament for cavan the attacks made on his purse were very numerous and throughout september when the glory of parliament was just newly settled upon his shoulders sundry calls were made upon him for obedience which were distasteful to him he was wanted over in ireland mr omahony was an outspoken frank man who did not at all like to be troubled with secrets i havent got any money to come over to ireland just at present they took what i had away from me in county cavan during the election i dont suppose i shall have any to speak of till after christmas and then it wont be much if you have anything for a man to do in london it will be more within my reach it was thus he wrote to some brother member of parliament who had summoned him to a grand meeting at the rotunda he was wanted to address the people on the honesty of the principle of paying no rent for the matter of that he wrote to another brother member i dont see the honesty why are we to take the property from jack and give it to bill bill would sell it and spend the money and no good would then have been done to the country i should have to argue the matter out with you or someone else before i could speak about it at the rotunda then there arose a doubt whether mr omahony was the proper member for cavan he settled himself down in cecil street and began to write a book about rent when he began his book he hated rent from his very soul the difficulty he saw was this what should you do with the property when you took it away from the landlords he quite saw his way to taking it away if only a new order would come from heaven for the creation of a special set of farmers who should be wedded to their land by some celestial matrimony and should clearly be in possession of it without the perpetration of any injustice he did not quite see his way to this by his own lights and therefore he went to the british museum when a man wants to write a book full of unassailable facts he always goes to the british museum in this way mr omahony purposed to spend his autumn instead of speaking at the rotunda because it suited him to live in london rather than in dublin  cecil street in september is not the most cheerful place in the world while rachel had been singing at the embankment with the occasional excitement of a quarrel with mr moss it had been all very well but now while her father was studying statistics at the british museum she had nothing to do but to practise her singing i mean to do something you know towards earning that £200 which you have lent me this she said to lord castlewell who had come up to london to have his teeth looked after this was the excuse he gave for being in london at this unfashionable season i have to sing from breakfast to dinner without stopping one minute so you may go back to the dentist at once i havent time even to see what he has done  i have to propose that you and your father shall come and dine with me down at richmond today there is old mrs peacock who used to sing bouffe parts at the queens theatre she is a most respectable old party and she shall come if you will let her  for papa to flirt with said rachel  not at all with a party of four there is never any flirting it is all solid sense i want to have some serious conversation about that £200 mrs peacock will be able to give me her opinion  she wont be able to lend me the money  im afraid she isnt a good doctor for that disease but you must dine somewhere and do say you will come  but rachel was determined not to comeat any rate not to say that she would come without consulting her father so she explained that the member of parliament was hard at work at the british museum writing a book against the payment of rents and that she could not go without consulting him but lord castlewell made that very easy ill go and see said he how a man looks when he is writing a book on such a subject and ill be back and tell you all about it ill drive you down in my phaetonof course if your father consents if he wants to bring his book with him the groom shall carry it in a box  and what about mrs peacock  there wont be any trouble about her because she lives at richmond you neednt be a bit afraid for your fathers sake because she is over sixty then he started off and came back in half an hour saying that mr omahony had expressed himself quite satisfied to do as he was told  the deceit of the world the flesh and the devil get the better of one on every side said rachel when she was left to herself who would have thought of the noble lord spinning off to the british museum on such an errand as that but he will give papa a good dinner and i shant be any the worse a man must be very bad before he can do a woman an injury if she is determined not to be injured  lord castlewell drove the two down to richmond and very pleasant the drive was the conversation consisted of quizzing mr omahony about his book as to which he was already beginning to be a little out of heart but he bore the quizzing well and was thoroughly goodhumoured as he saw the lord and his daughter sitting on the front seat before him i am a landleaguing homeruler you know my lord of the most advanced description the speaker has never turned me out of the house of commons only because i have never sat there your character will be lost for ever lord castlewell declared that his character would be made for ever as he had the great prima donna of the next season at his left hand  the dinner went off very pleasantly old mrs peacock declared that she had never known a prima donna before to be the daughter of a member of parliament she felt that great honour was done to the profession  why said lord castlewell he is writing a book to prove that nobody should pay any rent  oh said mrs peacock that would be terrible a landlord wouldnt be a landlord if he didnt get any rentor hardly then mr omahony went to work to explain that a landlord was of his very name and nature an abomination before the lord  and yet you want houses to live in said lord castlewell  when they were in the middle of their dinners they were all surprised by the approach of mr mahomet m moss he was dressed up to a degree of beauty which rachel thought that she had never seen equalled his shirtfront was full of little worked holes his studs were gold and turquoise and those at his wrists were double studs also gold and turquoise the tie of his cravat was a thing marvellous to behold his waistcoat was new for the occasion and apparently all over marvellously fine needlework it might all the same have been done by a sewingmachine the breadth of the satin lappets of his dresscoat were most expansive and his hair must have taken two artists the whole afternoon to accomplish it was evident to see that he felt himself to be quite the lords equal by the strength of his personal adornment well yes he said i have brought madame tacchi down here to show her what we can do in the way of a suburban dinner madame tacchi is about to take the place which miss omahony has vacated at the embankment ah my lord you behaved very shabbily to us there  if madame tacchi said the lord can sing at all like miss omahony we shall have her away very soon is madame tacchi in sight so that i can see her  then mr moss indicated the table at which the lady sat and with the lady was madame socani  they are a bad lot said lord castlewell as soon as moss had withdrawn i know them and they are a bad lot particularly that woman who is with them it is a marvel to me how you got among them  lord castlewell had now become very intimate with the omahonys and by what he said showed also his intimacy with mrs peacock  they are americans said omahony  and so are you said the lord there can be good americans and bad americans you dont mean to say that you think worse of an american than of an englishman  i think higher of an englishman than of an american and lower also if i meet an american where a gentleman ought to be i entertain a doubt if i meet him where a labourer ought to be i feel very confident i suppose that the manager of a theatre ought to be a gentleman  i dont quite understand it all said mrs peacock  nor anybody else said rachel father does fly so very high in the air when he talks about people  after that the lord drove miss omahony and her father back to cecil street and they all agreed that they had had a very pleasant evening   end of vol ii  charles dickens and evans crystal palace press                                      the landleaguers

captain claytons lovemaking   the household at castle morony was very sad for some time after the trial they had hardly begun to feel the death of florian while the excitement existed as they felt it afterwards mr jones his father seemed to regard the lost boy as though he had been his favourite child it was not many months since he had refused to allow him to eat in his presence and had been persuaded by such a stranger as was captain clayton to treat him with some show of affection when he had driven him into ballyglunin he had been stern and harsh to him to the very last and now he was obliterated with sorrow because he had been robbed of his florian the two girls had sorrows of their own though neither of them would permit her sorrow to create any quarrel between her and her sister and frank who since his return from the north had toiled like a labourer on the propertyonly doing double a labourers workhad sorrow too of his own it was understood that he had altogether separated himself from rachel omahony the cause of his separation was singular in its nature  it was now november and rachel had already achieved a singularly rapid success at covent garden she still lived in cecil street but there was no lack of money indeed her name had risen into such repute that some irish people began to think that her father was the proper man for cavan simply because she was a great singer it cannot be said however that this was the case among the men who were regarded as the leaders of the party as they still doubted omahonys obedience but money at any rate poured into rachels lap and with the money that which was quite as objectionable to poor frank he had begun by asserting that he did not wish to live idle on the earnings of a singer and therefore as the singer had said he and she were obliged to be two as she explained to her father she was badly treated she was very anxious to be true to her lover but she did not like living without some lover to whom she might be true you see as i am placed i am exposed to the mosses i do want to have a husband to protect me then a lover had come forward lord castlewell had absolutely professed to make her the future marchioness of beaulieu of this there must be more hereafter but frank heard of it and tore his hair in despair  and there was another misery at castle morony it reached mr joness ears that peter was anxious to give warning it certainly was the case that peter was of great use to them and that mr jones had rebuked him more than once as having made a great favour of his services the fact was that peter if discharged would hardly know where to look for another place where he could be equally at home and equally comfortable and he was treated by the family generally with all that confidence which his faithfulness seemed to deserve but he was nervous and ill at ease under his masters rebukes and at last there came an event which seemed to harrow up his own soul and instigated him to run away from county galway altogether  miss edith miss edith he said come in here thin and see what i have got to show you then with an air of great mystery he drew his young mistress into the pantry look at that now was ever the like of that seen since the mortial world began then he took out from a dirty envelope a dirty sheet of paper and exposed it to her eyes on the top of it was a rude coffin dont it make yer hair stand on end and yer very flesh creep miss edith to look at the likes o that and below the coffin there was a ruder skull and two crossbones thems intended for what im to be i understand their language well enough look here and he turned the envelope round and showed that it was addressed to peter mcgrew butler morony castle they know me well enough all the country round the letter was as follows      mr peter mcgrew     if youre not out of that before the end of the month but    stay there doing things for them infernal blackguards    your goose is cooked so now you know all about it     from yours     moonlight   edith attempted to laugh at this letter but peter made her understand that it was no laughing matter  ive a married darter in dublin who wont see her father shot down that way if she knows it  you had better take it to papa then and give him warning said edith  but this peter declined to do on the spur of the moment seeming to be equally afraid of his master and of captain moonlight  if id the captain here hed tell me what i ought to do the captain was always captain clayton  he is coming here tomorrow and i will show him the letter said edith but she did not on that account scruple to tell her father at once  he can go if he likes it said mr jones and that was all that mr jones said on the subject  this was the third visit that the captain had paid to morony castle since the terrible events of the late trial and it must be understood that he had not spoken a word to either of the two girls since the moment in which he had ventured to squeeze ediths hand with a tighter grasp than he had given to her sister they between them had discussed him and his character often but had come to no understanding respecting him  ada had declared that edith should be his and had in some degree recovered from the paroxysm of sorrow which had first oppressed her but edith had refused altogether to look at the matter in that light it was quite out of the question she said and so captain clayton would feel it if you dont hold your tongue ada she said i shall think youre a brute  but ada had not held her tongue and had declared that if no one else were to know itno one but edith and the captain himselfshe would not be made miserable by it  what is it she said i thought him the best and he is the best i thought that he thought that i was the best and i wasnt it shall be as i say  after this manner were the discussions held between them but of these captain clayton heard never a word  when he came he would seem to be full of the flood gates and of lax the murderer he had two men with him now hunter and another but no further attempt was made to shoot him in the neighbourhood of headford lax finds it too hot he said since that day in the court house and has gone away for the present i nearly know where he is but there is no good catching him till i get some sort of evidence against him and if i locked him up as a suspect he would become a martyr and a hero in the eyes of the whole party the worst of it is that though twenty men swore that they had seen it no galway jury would convict him but nevertheless he was indefatigable in following up the murderer of poor florian as for the murder in the court house he said i do believe that though it was done in the presence of an immense crowd no one actually saw it i have the pistol but what is that the pistol was dropped on the floor of the court house  on this occasion edith brought him poor peters letter as it happened they two were then alone together but she had taught herself not to expect any allusion to his love he is a stupid fellow said the captain  but he has been faithful and you cant expect him to look at these things as you do  of course he finds it to be a great compliment to have a special letter addressed to him by some special captain moonlight is to bring him into the history of his country  i suppose he will go  then let him go i would not on any account ask him to stay if he comes to me i shall tell him simply that he is a fool pat carrolls people want to bother your father and he would be bothered if he were to lose his manservant there is no doubt of that if peter desires to bother him let him go then he has another idea that he wants to achieve a character for fidelity he must choose between the two but i wouldnt on any account ask him for a favour  then edith having heard the captains advice was preparing to leave the room when captain clayton stopped her edith he said  well captain clayton  some months agobefore these sad things had occurredi told you what i thought of you and i asked you for a favour  there was a mistake made between us alla mistake which does not admit of being put to rights it was unfortunate but those misfortunes will occur there is no more to be said about it  is the happiness of two people to be thus sacrificed when nothing is done for the benefit of one  what two she asked brusquely  you and i  my happiness will not be sacrificed captain clayton she said what right had he to tell that her happiness was in question the woman spokethe essence of feminine self putting itself forward to defend feminine rights generally against male assumption could any man be justified in asserting that a woman loved him till she had told him so it was evident no doubtso she told herself it was true at least as the word goes she worshipped the very ground he stood upon he was her hero she had been made to think and to feel that he was so by this mistake which had occurred between the three she had known it before but it was burned in upon her now yet he should not be allowed to assume it and the one thing necessary for her peace of mind in life would be that she should do her duty by ada she had been the fool she had instigated ada to believe this thing in which there was no truth the loss of all ecstasy of happiness must be the penalty which she would pay and yet she thought of him must he pay a similar penalty for her blunder surely this would be hard surely this would be cruel but then she did not believe that man ever paid such penalty as that of which she was thinking he would have the work of his life it would be the work of her life to remember what she might have been had she not been a fool  if so he said after a pause then there is an end of it all and he looked at her as though he absolutely believed her wordsas though he had not known that her assertion had been mere feminine pretext she could not endure that he at any rate should not know the sacrifice which she would have to make but he was very hard to her he would not even allow her the usual right of defending her sex by falsehood if so there is an end of it all he repeated holding out his hand as though to bid her farewell  she believed him and gave him her hand goodbye captain clayton she said  never again he said to her very gruffly but still with such a look across his eyes as irradiated his whole face this hand shall never again be your own to do as you please with it  who says so and she struggled as though to pull her hand away but he held her as though in truth her hand had gone from her for ever  i say so who am its legitimate owner now i bid you tell me the truth or rather i defy you to go on with the lie do you not love me  it is a question which i shall not answer  then said he from a woman to a man it is answered you cannot make me over to another i will not be transferred  i can do nothing with you captain clayton nor can you with me i know you are very strong of course then he loosened her hand and as he did so ada came into the room  i have asked her to be my wife said the captain putting his hand upon ediths arm  let it be so said ada i have nothing to say against it  but i have said edith i have much to say against it we can all live without being married i suppose captain clayton has plenty to do without the trouble of a wife and so have you and i could we leave our father and have we forgotten so soon poor florian this is no time for marriages only think papa would not have the means to get us decent clothes as far as i am concerned captain clayton let there be an end of all this then she stalked out of the room  ada you are not angry with me said captain clayton coming up to her  oh no how could i be angry  i have not time to do as other men do i do not know that i ever said a word to her and yet god knows that i have loved her dearly enough she is hot tempered now and there are feelings in her heart which fight against me you will say a word in my favour  indeed indeed i will  there shall be nothing wrong between you and me if she becomes my wife you shall be my dearest sister and i think she will at last i knowi do know that she loves me poor florian is dead and gone all his short troubles are over we have still got our lives to lead and why should we not lead them as may best suit us she talks about your fathers present want of money i would be proud to marry your sister standing as she is now down in the kitchen but if i did marry her i should have ample means to keep her as would become your fathers daughter then he took his leave and went back to galway     chapter xxxiv  lord castlewells lovemaking   it was explained in the last chapter that frank jones was not in a happy condition because of the success of the lady whom he loved rachel as christmas drew nigh was more and more talked about in london and became more and more the darling of all musical people she had been twelve months now on the london boards and had fully justified the opinion expressed of her by messrs moss and le gros there were those who declared that she sang as no woman of her age had ever sung before and there had got abroad about her certain stories which were true enough in the main but which were all the more curious because of their truth and yet they were not true altogether it was known that she was a daughter of a landleaguing member of parliament and that she had been engaged to marry the son of a boycotted landlord mr jones sorrows and the death of his poor son and the murder of the sinner who was to have been the witness at the trial of his brother were all known and commented on in the london press and so also was the peculiar vigour of mr omahonys politics nothing it was said could be severed more entirely than were mr jones and mr omahony the enmity was so deep that all ideas of marriage were out of the question it was no doubt true that the gentleman was penniless and the lady rolling in wealth but this was a matter so grievous that so poor a thing as money could not be allowed to prevail and then mr moss was talked about as a dragon of iniquitywhich indeed was true enoughand was represented as having caused contracts to be executed which would bind poor rachel to himself both as to voice and beauty but lord castlewell had seen her and had heard her and mr moss with all his abominations was sent down to the bottom of the nethermost pit the fortune of the embankment was made by the number of visitors who were sent there to see and to hear this wicked fiend but it all redounded to the honour and glory of rachel  but rachel was to be seen a fêted guest at all semimusical houses whispers about town were heard that that musical swell lord castlewell had been caught at last and in the midst of all this mr omahony came in for his share of popularity there was something so peculiar in the connection which bound a violent landleaguing member of parliament with the prima donna of the day they were father and daughter but they looked more like husband and wife and it always seemed that rachel had her own way mr omahony had quite achieved a character for himself before the time had come in which he was enabled to open his mouth in the house of commons and some people went so far as to declare that he was about to be the new leader of the party  it certainly was true that about this time lord castlewell did make an offer to rachel omahony  that i should have come to this she said to the lord when the lord had expressed his wishes  you deserve it all said the gallant lord  i think i do but that you should have seen itthat you should have come to understand that if i would be your wife i would sing every note out of my bodyto do you good if it were possible how have you been enlightened so far as to see that this is the way in which you may best make yourself happy  lord castlewell did not quite like this but he knew that his wishedfor bride was an unintelligible little person to whom much must be yielded as to her own way he had not given way to this idea before he had seen how well she had taken her place among the people with whom he lived he was forty years old and it was time that he should marry his father was a very proud personage to whom he never spoke much he however would be of opinion that any bride whom his son might choose would be by the very fact raised to the top of the peerage his mother was a religious woman to whom any matrimony for her son would be an achievement now of the proposed bride he had learned all manner of good things she had come out of mr mosss furnace absolutely unscorched so much unscorched as to scorn the idea of having been touched by the flames she was thankful to lord castlewell for what he had done and expressed her thanks in a manner that was not grateful to him she was not in the least put about or confused or indeed surprised because the heir of a marquis had made an offer to hera singing girl but she let him understand that she quite thought that she had done a good thing it would be so much better for him than going on as he has gone she said to her father and lord castlewell knew very well what were her sentiments  it cannot be said that he repented of his offer indeed he pressed her for an answer more than once or twice but her conduct to him was certainly very aggravating this matter of her marriage with an earl was an affair of great moment indeed all london was alive with the subject but she had not time to give him an answer because it was necessary that she should study a part for the theatre this was hard upon an earl and was made no better by the fact that the earl was forty no my lord earl she said laughing the time for that has not come yet you must give me a few days to think of it this she said when he expressed a not unnatural desire to give her a kiss  but though she apparently made light of the matter to him and astonished even her father by her treatment of him yet she thought of it with a very anxious mind she was quite alive to the glories of the position offered to her and was not at all alive to its inconveniences people would assert that she had caught the lover who had intended her for other purposes that was of course out of the question she said to herself and she felt sure that she could make as good a countess as the best of them with her father a member of parliament and her husband an earl she would have done very well with herself she would have escaped from that brute moss and would have been subjected to less that was disagreeable in the encounter than might have been expected she must lose the public singing which was attractive to her and must become the wife of an old man it was thus in truth that she looked at the noble lord there would be an end she said and for ever of loves young dream the dream had been very pleasant to her she had thoroughly liked her frank he was handsome fresh full of passion and a little violent when his temper lay in that direction but he had been generous and she was sure of him that he had loved her thoroughly after all was not loves young dream the best  an answer was at any rate due to lord castlewell but she made up her mind that before she could give the answer she would write to frank himself my lord she said very gravely to her suitor it has become my lot in life to be engaged to marry the son of that mr jones of whom you have heard in the west of ireland  i am aware of it said lord castlewell gravely  it has been necessary that i should tell you myself now i cannot say whether in all honour that engagement has been dissolved  i thought there was no doubt about it said the lord  it is as i tell you i must write to mr jones hearts cannot be wrenched asunder without some effort in the wrenching for the great honour you have done me i am greatly thankful  let all that pass said the lord  not so it has to be spoken of as i stand at present i have been repudiated by mr jones  do you mean to ask him to take you back again  i do not know how the letter will be worded because it has not been yet written my object is to tell him of the honour which lord castlewell proposes to me and i have not thought it quite honest to your lordship to do this without acquainting you  then that interview was over and lord castlewell went away no doubt disgusted he had not intended to be treated in this way by a singing girl when he proposed to make her his countess but with the disgust there was a strengthened feeling of admiration for her conduct she looked much more like the countess than the singing girl when she spoke to him and there certainly never came a time in which he could tell her to go back and sing and marry mr moss therefore the few days necessary for an answer went by and then she gave him her reply my lord she said if you wish it still it shall be so  the time for loves young dream had not gone by for lord castlewell i do wish it still he said in a tone of renewed joy  then you shall have all that you wish thereupon she put her little hands on his arm and leant her face against his breast then there was a long embrace but after the embrace she had a little speech to make you ought to know lord castlewell how much i think of you and your high position a man they say trusts much of his honour into the hands of his wife whatever you trust to me shall be guarded as my very soul you shall be to me the one man whom i am bound to worship i will worship you with all my heart with all my body with all my soul and with all my strength your wishes shall be my wishes i only hope that an odd stray wish of mine may occasionally be yours then she smiled so sweetly that as she looked up into his face he was more enamoured of her than ever  but now we must go back for a moment and read the correspondence which took place between rachel omahony and frank jones rachels letter ran as follows      my dear frank     i am afraid i must trouble you once again with my affairs    though indeed after what last took place between us it    ought not to be necessary lord castlewell has proposed    to make me his wife and to tell you the truth looking    forward into the world i do not wish to throw over all    its pleasures because your honour whom i have loved does    not wish to accept the wages of a singing girl but the    place is open to you stillthe wages and the singing    girl and all write me a line and say how it is to be     yours as you would have me to be     rachel omahony   this letter frank jones showed to no one had he allowed it to be seen by his sister edith she would probably have told him that no man ever received a sweeter loveletter from the girl whom he loved the place is open to you stillthe wages the singing girl and all the girl had made nothing of this new and noble lover except to assure his rival that he the rival should be postponed to him the lover if he the lover would write but one word to say that it should be so but frank was bad at reading such words he got it into his head that the girl had merely written to ask the permission of her former suitor to marry this new lordly lover and though he did love the girl with a passion which the girl could never feel for the lord he wrote back and refused the offer      my dear rachel     it is i suppose best as it is we are sinking lower and    lower daily my father is beginning to feel that we shall    never see another rent day at castle morony it is not    fitting that i should think of joining my fallen fortunes    to yours which are soaring so high and poor florian is    gone we are at the present moment still struck to the    ground because of florian as for you and the lord who    admires you you have my permission to become his wife i    have long heard that he is your declared admirer you have    before you a glorious future and i shall always hear with    satisfaction of your career     yours with many memories of the past     francis jones   it was not a letter which would have put such a girl as rachel omahony into good heart unless she had in truth wished to get his agreement to her lordly marriage this twice i have thrown myself at his head and he has rejected me then she abided lord castlewells coming and the scene between them took place as above described the marriage was at once declared as a settled thing now my dear you must name the day said lord castlewell as full of joy as though he were going to marry a dukes daughter  i have got to finish my engagement said rachel i am bound down to the end of may when june comes you shant find a girl who will be in a greater hurry do you think that i do not wish to become a countess  he told her that he would contrive to get her engagement broken covent garden is not going to quarrel with me about my wife im sure he said  ah but my own one said rachel we will do it all selon les règles i am in a hurry but we wont let the world know it i the future countess of castlewell i the future marchioness of beaulieu will keep my terms and my allotted times like any candlesnuffer what do you think moss will say  what can it signify what mr moss may say  ah but my own man it does signify mr moss shall know that through it all i have done my duty madame socani will tell lies but she shall feel in her heart that she has once in her life come across a woman who when she has signed a bit of paper intends to remain true to the paper signed and my lord there is still £100 due to you from my father  gammon said the lord  i could pay it by a cheque on the bank to be sure but let us go on to the end of may i want to see how all the young women will behave when they hear of it and so some early day in june was fixed for the wedding  among others who heard of it were of course mr moss and madame socani they heard of it but of course did not believe it it was too bright to be believed when madame socani was assured that rachel had taken the moneyshe and her father between themshe declared with great apparent satisfaction that rachel must be given up as lost as to that wicked old man her father  hes not so very old said moss  shes no chicken and hes old enough to be her father that is if he is her father i have known that girl on the stage any day these ten years  no youve not not yet five i dont quite know how it is and mr moss endeavoured to think of it all in such a manner as to make it yet possible that he might marry her what might not they two do together in the musical world  you dont mean to say youd take her yet said madame socani with scorn  when i take her youll be glad enough to join us that is if we will have you then madame socani ground her teeth together and turned up her nose with redoubled scorn  but it was soon borne in upon mr moss that the marriage was to be a marriage and he was in truth very angry he had been able to endure m le gros success in carrying away miss omahony from the embankment miss omahony might come back again under that or any other name heand shehad a musical future before them which might still be made to run in accordance with his wishes then he had learned with sincere sorrow that she was throwing herself into the lords hands borrowing money of him but there might be a way out of this which would still allow him to carry out his project but now he heard that a real marriage was intended and he was very angry not even madame socani was more capable of spite than mr moss though he was better able to hide his rage even now when christmastime had come he would hardly believe the truth and when the marriage was not instantly carried out new hopes came to himthat lord castlewell would not at last make himself such a fool he inquired here and there in the musical world and the theatrical world and could not arrive at what he believed to be positive truth then christmas passed by and miss omahony recommenced her singing at covent garden three times a week the house was filled and at last a fourth night was added for which the salary paid to rachel was very much increased  i dont see that the salary matters very much said lord castlewell when the matter was discussed  oh but my lord it does matter she always called him my lord now with a little emphasis laid on the my they have made father a member of parliament but he does not earn anything what i can earn up to the last fatal day he shall have if you will let me give it to him  they were very bright days for rachel because she had all the triumph of successsuccess gained by her own efforts  i can never do as much as this when i am your countess she said to her future lord i shall dwell in marble halls as people say but i shall never cram a house so full as to be able to see when i look up from the stage that there is not a place for another mans head and when my throat gave way the other day i could read all the disappointment in the public papers i shall become your wife my lord  i hope so  and if you will love me i shall be very happy for long long years  i will love you  but there will be no passion of ecstasy such as this father says that home rule wont be passed because the people will be thinking of my singing of course it is all vanity but there is an enjoyment in it  but all this was wormwood to mr moss he had put out his hand so as to clutch this girl now two years since understanding all her singing qualities and then in truth loving her she had taken a positive hatred to him and had rejected him at every turn of her life but he had not at all regarded that he had managed to connect her with his theatre and had perceived that her voice had become more and more sweet in its tones and more and more rich in its melody he had still hoped that he would make her his wife madame socanis abominable proposal had come from an assurance on her part that he could have all that he wished for without paying so dear for it there had doubtless been some whispering between them over the matter but the order for the proposal had not come from him madame socani had judged of rachel as she might have judged of herself but all that had come to absolute failure he felt now that he should be paying by no means too dear by marrying the girl it would be a great triumph to marry her but he was told that this absurd earl wished to triumph in the same manner  he set afloat all manner of reports which in truth wounded lord castlewell sorely lord castlewell had given her money and had then failed in his object so said mr moss lord castlewell had promised marriage never intending it lord castlewell had postponed the marriage because as the moment drew nearer he would not sacrifice himself if the lady had a friend it would be the friends duty to cudgel the lord so villainous had been the noble lords conduct but yet in truth who could have expected that the noble lord would have married the singing girl was not his character known did anybody in his senses expect that the noble lord would marry miss rachel omahony  if i have a friend is my friend to cudgel you my lord she said clinging on to his arm in her usual manner my friend is papa who thinks that you are a very decent fellow considering your misfortune in being a lord at all i know where all these words come fromit is mahomet m moss there is nothing for it but to live them down with absolute silence  nothing he replied they are a nuisance but we can do nothing  but lord castlewell did in truth feel what was said about him was he not going to pay too dearly for his whistle no doubt rachel was all that she ought to be she was honest industrious and highspirited and according to his thinking she sang more divinely than any woman of her time and he so thought of her that he knew that she must be his countess or be nothing at all to him to think of her in any other light would be an abomination to him but yet was it worth his while to make her marchioness of beaulieu he could only get rid of his present engagement by some absolute change in his mode of life for instance he must shut himself up in a castle and devote himself entirely to a religious life he must explain to her that circumstances would not admit his marrying and must offer to pay her any sum of money that she or her father might think fit to name if he wished to escape this must be his way but as he looked at her when she came off the stage where he always attended her he assured himself that he did not wish to escape     chapter xxxv  mr omahonys apology   time went on and parliament met mr omahony went before the speakers table and was sworn in he was introduced by two brother landleaguers and really did take his place with some enthusiasm he wanted to speak on the first day but was judiciously kept silent by his colleagues he expressed an idea that until irelands wrongs had been redressed there ought not to be a moment devoted to any other subject and became very violent in his expressions of this opinion but he was not long kept dumb great things were expected from his powers of speech and though he had to be brought to silence ignominiously on three or four occasions still at last some power of speech was permitted to him there were those among his own special brethren who greatly admired him and praised him but with others of the same class there was a shaking of the head and many doubts with the house generally i fear laughter prevailed rather than true admiration mr omahony no doubt could speak well in a debating society or a music hall words came from his tongue sweeter than honey but just at the beginning of the session the speaker was bound to put a limit even to irish eloquence and in this case was able to do so as mr omahony contrived to get upon his feet very frequently either in asking a question or in endeavouring to animadvert on the answer given there was something of a tussle between him and the authority in the chair it did not take much above a week to make the speaker thoroughly tired of this new member and threats were used towards him of a nature which his joint milesian and american nature could not stand he was told of dreadful things which could be done to him though as yet he could not be turned out of the house for the state of the young session had not as yet admitted of that new mode of torture still he could be named let him name me my name is mr omahony and mr omahony was not a man who could be happy when he was quarrelling with all around him he was soon worked into a violent passion in which he made himself ridiculous but when he had subsided and the storm was past he knew he had misbehaved and was unhappy and as he was thoroughly honest he could not be got to obey his leaders in everything he wanted to abolish the irish landlords but he was desirous of abolishing them after some special plan of his own and could hardly be got to work efficiently in harness together with others  dont you think your father is making an ass of himselfjust a little you know  this was said by lord castlewell to rachel when the session was not yet a fortnight old and made rachel very unhappy she did think that her father was making an ass of himself but she did not like to be told of it and much as she liked music herself dear as was her own profession to her still she felt that to be a member of parliament and to have achieved the power of making speeches there was better than to run after opera singers she loved the man who was going to marry her very wellor rather she intended to do so  he was not to her loves young dream but she intended that his lordship should become loves old reality she felt that this would not become the case if loves old reality were to tell her often that her father was an ass lord castlewells father was she thought making an ass of himself she heard on different sides that he was a foolish pompous old peer who could hardly say bo to a goose but it would not she thought become her to tell her future husband her own opinion on that matter she saw no reason why he should be less reticent in his opinion as to her father of course he was older and perhaps she did not think of that as much as she ought to have done she ought also to have remembered that he was an earl and she but a singing girl and that something was due to him for the honour he was doing her but of this she would take no account she was to be his wife and a wife ought to be equal to the husband such at least was her american view of the matter in fact her ideas on the matter ran as follows my future husband is not entitled to call my father an ass because he is a lord seeing that my father is a member of parliament nor is he entitled to call him so because he is an ass because the same thing is true of his own father and thus there came to be discord in her mind  i suppose all parliament people make asses of themselves sometimes lords as well as commons i dont see how a man is to go on talking for ever about laws and landleagues and those sort of things without doing so it is all bosh to me and so i should think it must be to you as you dont do it but i do not think that father is worse than anybody else and i think that his words are sometimes very beautiful  why my dear there is not a man about london who is not laughing at him  i saw in the times the other day that he is considered a very true and a very honest man of course they said that he talked nonsense sometimes but if you put the honesty against the nonsense he will be as good as anybody else  i dont think you understand my dear honesty is not what they want  oh  but what they dont want especially is nonsense  poor papa but he doesnt mean to consult them as to what they want his idea is that if everybody can be got to be honest this question may be settled among them but it must be talked about and he at any rate is eloquent i have heard it said that there was not a more eloquent man in new york i think he has got as many good gifts as anyone else  in this way there rose some bad feeling lord castlewell did think that there was something wanting in the manner in which he was treated by his bride he was sure that he loved her but he was sure also that when a lord marries a singing girl he ought to expect some special observance and the fact that the singing girls father was a member of parliament was much less to him than to her he indeed would have been glad to have the father abolished altogether but she had become very proud of her father since he had become a member of parliament her ideas of the british constitution were rather vague but she thought that a member of parliament was at least as good as a lord who was not a peer he had his wealth but she was sure that he was too proud to think of that  just at this period when the session was beginning rachel began to doubt the wisdom of what she was doing the lord was in truth good enough for her he was nearly double her age but she had determined to disregard that he was plain but that was of no moment he had run after twenty different women but she could condone all that because he had come at last to run after her for his wealth she cared nothingor less than nothing because by remaining single she could command wealth of her ownwealth which she could control herself and keep at her own bankers which she suspected would not be the case with lord castlewells money but she had found the necessity of someone to lean upon when frank jones had told her that he would not marry her and she had feared mr moss so much that she had begun to think that he would in truth frighten her into doing some horrible thing as frank had deserted her it would be better that she should marry somebody lord castlewell had come and she had felt that the fates were very good to her she learned from the words of everybody aroundfrom her new friends at covent garden and from her old enemies at the embankment and from her father himself that she was the luckiest singing girl at this moment known in europe by g shell get him such had been the exclamation made with horror by mr moss and the echo of it had found its way to her ears the more mr moss was annoyed the greater ought to have been her delight butbut was she in truth delighted as she came to think of the reality she asked herself what were the pleasures which were promised to her did she not feel that a week spent with frank jones in some little cottage would be worth a twelvemonth of golden splendour in the marble halls which lord castlewell was supposed to own and why had frank deserted her simply because he would not come with her and share her money frank she told herself was in truth a gallant fellow she did love frank she acknowledged so much to herself again and again and yet she was about to marry lord castlewell simply because her doing so would be the severest possible blow to her old enemy mr moss  then she asked herself what would be best for her she had made for herself a great reputation and she did not scruple to tell herself that this had come from her singing she thought very much of her singing but very little of her beauty a sort of prettiness did belong to her a tiny prettiness which had sufficed to catch frank jones she had laughed about her prettiness and her littleness a score of times with ada and edith and also with frank himself there had been the three girls who had called themselves beauty and the beast and the small young woman the reader will understand that it had not been ada who had chosen those names but then ada was not given to be witty her prettiness such as it was had sufficed and frank had loved her dearly then had come her great triumph and she knew not only that she could sing but that the world had recognised her singing i am a great woman as women go she had said to herself but her singing was to come to an end for ever and ever on the 1st of may next she would be the countess of castlewell and in process of time would be the marchioness of beaulieu but she never again would be a great woman she was selling all that for the marble halls  was she wise in what she was doing she had lain awake one long morning striving to answer the question for herself if nobody else should come of course i should be an ugly old maid she said to herself but then frank might perhaps come againfrank might come againif mr moss did not intervene in the meantime but at last she acknowledged to herself that she had given the lord a promise she would keep her promise but she could not bring herself to exult at the prospect she must take care however that the lord should not triumph over her the lord had called her father an ass she certainly would say a rough word or two if he abused her father again  this was the time of the suspects mr omahony had already taken an opportunity of expressing an opinion in the house of commons that every honest man every patriotic man every generous man every man in fact who was worth his salt was in ireland locked up as a suspect and in saying so managed to utter very bitter words indeed respecting him who had the locking up of these gentlemen poor mr omahony had no idea that he might have used with propriety as to this gentleman all the epithets of which he believed the suspects to be worthy but instead of doing so he called him a disreputable jailer it is not pleasant to be called a disreputable jailer in the presence of all the best of ones fellow citizens but the man so called in this instance only smiled mr omahony had certainly made himself ridiculous and the whole house were loud in their clamours at the words used but that did not suffice the speaker reprimanded mr omahony and desired him to recall the language and apologise for it then there arose a loud debate during which the member of the government who had been assailed declared that mr omahony had not as yet been quite long enough in the house to learn the little details of parliamentary language mr omahony would no doubt soften down his eloquence in course of time but the speaker would not be content with this and was about to order the sinner to be carried away by the sergeantatarms when a friend on his right and a friend on his left and a friend behind him all whispered into his ear how easy it is to apologise in the house of commons you neednt say he isnt a disreputable jailer but only call him a distasteful warderanything will do this came from the gentleman at mr omahonys back and the order for his immediate expulsion was ringing in his ears he had been told that he was ridiculous and could feel that it would be absurd to be carried somewhere into the dungeons and the man whom he certainly detested at the present moment worse than any other scoundrel on the earth had made a goodnatured apology on his behalf if he were carried away now he could never come back again without a more serious apology then farewell to all power of attacking the jailer he did as the man whispered into his ear and begged to substitute distasteful warder for the words which had wounded so cruelly the feelings of the right honourable gentleman then he looked round the house showing that he thought that he had misbehaved himself after that during mr omahonys career as a member of parliament which lasted only for the session he lost his selfrespect altogether he had been driven to withdraw the true wrath of his eloquence from him at whose brow as he told rachel the next morning he had hurled his words with a force that had been found to be intolerable  mr omahony had undoubtedly made himself an ass again on this second third and perhaps tenth occasion this was not the ass he had made himself on the occasion to which lord castlewell had referred but yet he was a thoroughly honest patriotic man desirous only of the good of his country and wishing for nothing for himself is it not possible that as much may be said for others who from day to day so violently excite our spleen as to make us feel that special irishmen selected for special constituencies are not worthy to be ranked with men you shall take the whole house of commons indifferent as to the side on which they sitsome six hundred and thirty out of the numberand will find in conversation that the nature of the animal the absurdity the selfishness the absence of all good qualifies are taken for granted as matters admitting of no dispute but here was mr omahony as hot a homeruler and landleaguer as any of them who was undoubtedly a gentlemanthough an american gentleman can it be possible that we are wrong in our opinions respecting the others of the set  rachel heard it all the next day and living as she did among italians and french and theatrical americans and english swells could not endeavour to make the apology which i have just made for the irish brigade generally she knew that her father had made an ass of himself all the asinine proportions of the affair had been so explained to her as to leave no doubt on her mind as to the matter but the more she was sure of it the more resolved she became that lord castlewell should not call her father an ass she might do soand undoubtedly would after her own fashionbut no such privilege should be allowed to him  oh father father she said to him the next morning dont you think youve made a goose of yourself  yes i do  then dont do it any more  yes i shall it isnt so very easy for a man not to make a goose of himself in that place youve got to sit by and do nothing for a year or two it is very difficult a man cannot afford to waste his time in that manner there is all ireland to be regenerated and i have to learn the exact words which the prudery of the house of commons will admit of course i have made a goose of myself but the question is whether i did not make a knave of myself in apologising for language which was undoubtedly true only think that a man so brutal so entirely without feelings without generosity without any touch of sentiment should be empowered by the queen of england to lock up not only every irishman but every american also and to keep them there just as long as he pleases and he revels in it i do believe that he never eats a good breakfast unless halfadozen new suspects are reported by the early police in the morning and i am not to call such a man a disreputable jailer i may call him a distasteful warder its a disgrace to a man to sit in such a house and in such company of course i was a goose but i was only a goose according to the practices of that special duckpond mr omahony as he said this walked about angrily with his hands in his breeches pockets and told himself that no honest man could draw the breath of life comfortably except in new york  i dont know much about it father said rachel but i think youd better cut and run your twenty men will never do any good here everybody hates them who has got any money and their only friends are just men as mr pat carroll of ballintubber  then later in the day lord castlewell called to drive his bride in the park he had so far overcome family objections as to have induced his sister lady augusta montmorency to accompany him lady augusta had been already introduced to rachel but had not been much prepossessed lady augusta was very proud of her family was a religious woman and was anything but contented with her brothers manner of life but it was no doubt better that he should marry rachel than not be married at all and therefore lady augusta had allowed herself to be brought to accompany the singing girl upon this occasion she was in truth an uncommonly good young woman not beautiful not clever but most truly anxious for the welfare of her brother it had been represented to her that her brother was over head and ears in love with the young lady and looking at the matter all round she had thought it best to move a little from her dignity so as to take her sisterinlaw coldly by the hand it need hardly be said that rachel did not like being taken coldly by the hand and with her general hot mode of expression would have declared that she hated augusta montmorency now the two entered the room together and rachel kissed lady augusta while she gave only her hand to lord castlewell but there was something in her manner on such occasions which was intended to show affectionand did show it very plainly in old days she could decline to kiss frank in a manner that would set frank all on fire it was as much as to sayof course youve a right to it but on this occasion i dont mean to give it to you but lord castlewell was not imaginative and did not think of all this rachel had intended him to think of it  oh my goodness began the lord what a mess your father did make of it last night and he frowned as he spoke  rachel as an intended brideabout to be a bride in two or three monthsdid not like to be frowned at by the man who was to marry her thats as people may think my lord she said  you dont mean to say that you dont think he did make a mess of it  of course he abused that horrid man everybody is abusing him  as for that im not going to defend the man for lord castlewell though by no means a strong politician was a tory and unfortunately found himself agreeing with rachel in abusing the members of the government  then why do you say that father made a mess of it  everybody is talking about it he has made himself ridiculous before the whole town  what lord castlewell exclaimed rachel  i do believe your father is the best fellow going but he ought not to touch politics he made a great mistake in getting into the house it is a source of misery to everyone connected with him  or about to be connected with him said lady augusta who had not been appeased by the flavour of rachels kiss  theres time enough to think about it yet said rachel  no theres not said lord castlewell who intended to express in rather a gallant manner his intention of going on with the marriage  but i can assure you there is said rachel ample time there shall be no time for going on with it if my father is to be abused as it happens you dont agree with my father in politics i as a woman should have to call myself as belonging to your party if we be ever married i do not know what that party is and care very little as i am not a politician myself and i suppose if we were married you would take upon yourself to abuse my father for his politics as he might abuse you but while he is my father and you are not my husband i will not bear it no thank you lady augusta i will not drive out today thems my sentiments as people say and perhaps your brother had better think them over while theres time enough so saying she did pertinaciously refuse to be driven by the noble lord on that occasion     chapter xxxvi  rachel writes about her lovers   what a dear fellow is frank jones that was rachels first idea when lord castlewell left her it was an idea she had driven from out of her mind with all the strength of which she was capable from the moment in which his lordship had been accepted he never shall be dear to me again she had said thinking of what would be due to her husband and she had disturbed herself not without some success in expelling frank jones from her heart it was not right that the future lady castlewell should be in love with frank jones but now she could think about frank jones as she pleased what a dear fellow is frank jones now it certainly was the case that lord castlewell was not a dear fellow at all he was many degrees better than mr moss but for a dear fellowshe only knew one and she did tell herself now that the world could hardly be a happy world to her without one dear fellowat any rate to think of  but he had positively refused to marry her but yet she did not in the least doubt his love im a little bit of a thing she said to herself but then he likes little bits of things at any rate he likes one  and then she had thought ever so often over the cause which had induced frank to leave her why shouldnt he take my money since it is here to be taken it is all a mans beastly pride but then again she contradicted the assertion to herself it was a mans pride but by no means beastly if i were a man she went on saying i dont think i should like to pay for my coat and waistcoat with money which a woman had earned and i should like it the less because things at home in my own house were out of order and then again she thought of it all i should be an idiot to do that everybody would say so what to give up my whole career for a young mans lovemerely that i might have his arm round my waist i to do it who am the greatest singer of my day and who can if i please be countess of castlewell tomorrow that were losing the world for love indeed can any mans love be worth it and i am going on to become such a singer as the world does not possess another like me i know it i feel it daily in the increasing sweetness of the music made i see it in the wakeful eagerness of mens ears waiting for some charm of soundsome wonderful charmwhich they hardly dare to expect but which always comes at last i see it in the eyes of the women who are hardly satisfied that another should be so great it comes in the worship of the people about the theatre who have to tell me that i am their god and keep the strings of the sack from which money shall be poured forth upon them i know it is coming and yet i am to marry the stupid earl because i have promised him and he thinks too that his reflected honours will be more to me than all the fame that i can earn for myself to go down to his castle and to be dumb for ever and perhaps to be mother of some hideous little imp who shall be the coming marquis everything to be abandoned for thateven frank jones but frank jones is not to be had oh frank jones frank jones if you could come and live in such a marble hall as i could provide for you it should have all that we want but nothing more but it could not have that selfrespect which it is a mans first duty in life to achieve but the thought that she had arrived at was thisthat with all her best courtesy she would tell the earl of castlewell to look for a bride elsewhere  but she would do nothing in a hurry the lord had been very civil to her and she on her part would be as civil to the lord as circumstances admitted and she had an idea in her mind that she could not at a moments notice dismiss this lord and be as she was before her engagement with the lord was known to all the musical world the mosses and socanis spent their mornings noons and nights in talking about itas she well knew and she was not quite sure that the lord had given her such a palpable cause for quarrelling as to justify her in throwing him over and when she had as it were thrown him over in her mind she began to think of other causes for regret after all it was something to be countess of castlewell she felt that she could play the part well in spite of all lady augustas coldness she would soon live the lady augusta down into a terrible mediocrity and then again there would be dreams of frank jones frank jones had been utterly banished but if an elderly gentleman is desirous that his future wife shall think of no frank jones he had better not begin by calling the father of that young lady a ridiculous ass  she was much disturbed in mind and resolved that she would seek counsel from her old correspondent franks sister  dearest edith she began      i know you will let me write to you in my troubles i am    in such a twitter of mind in consequence of my various    lovers that i do not know where to turn nor do i quite    know whom i am to call lover number one therefore i    write to you to ask advice dear old frank used to be    lover number one of course i ought to call him now mr    francis jones because another lover is really lover    number one i am engaged to marry as you are well aware    no less a person than the earl of castlewell and if    all things were to go prosperously with me i should in    a short time be the marchioness of beaulieu did you    ever think of the glory of being an absolutely live    marchioness it is so overwhelming as to be almost too    much for me i think that i should not cower before my    position but that i should on the other hand endeavour    to soar so high that i should be consumed by my own    flames then there is lover number threemr mosswho    i do believe loves me with the truest affection of them    all i have found him out at last he wishes to be the    legal owner of all the salaries which the singer of la    beata may possibly earn and he feels that in spite of    all that has come and gone it is yet possible of all the    men who ever forgave mr moss is the most forgiving     now which am i to take of these three of course if    you are the honest girl i take you to be you will write    back word that one at any rate is not in the running    mr francis jones has no longer the honour but what    if i am sure that he loves me and what again if i    am sure that he is the only one i love let this be    quitequitebetween ourselves i am beginning to think    that because of frank jones i cannot marry that gorgeous    earl what if frank jones has spoiled me altogether would    you wish to see me on this account delivered over to mr    mahomet moss as a donkey between two bundles of hay     tell me what you think of it he wont take my money but    suppose i earn my money for another season or two would    not your irish brutalities be then over and my fathers    eloquence and the eccentricities of the other gentlemen    and would not your brother and your father have in some    way settled their affairs surely a little money wont    then be amiss though it may have come from the industry    of a hardworked young woman     of course i am asking for mercy because i am absolutely    devoted to a certain young man you need not tell him that    in so many words but i do not see why i am to be ashamed    of my devotionseeing that i was not ashamed of my    engagement and boasted of it to all the world and i have    done nothing since to be ashamed of     you have never told me a word of your young man but the    birds of the air are more communicative than some friends    a bird of the air has told me of you and of ada also and    had made me understand that from ada has come all that    sweetness which was to be expected from her but from you    has not come that compliance with your fate in life which    circumstances have demanded     your affectionate friend     rachel omahony   it could not but be the case that edith should be gratified by the receipt of such a letter as this frank was now at home and was terribly down in the mouth boycotting had lost all its novelty at morony castle his sisters had begun to feel that it was a pleasant thing to have their butter made for them and pleasant also not to be introduced to a leg of mutton till it appeared upon the table frank too had become very tired of the work which fell to his lot though he had been relieved in the heaviest labours of the farm by emergency men who had been sent to him from various parts of ireland but he was thoroughly depressed in heart as also was his father months had passed by since pat carroll had stood in the dock at galway ready for his trial he was now in march still kept in galway jail under remand from the magistrates a great clamour was made in the county upon the subject florians murder had stirred all those who were against the league to feel that the government should be supported but there had been a mystery attached to that other murder perpetrated in the court which had acted strongly on the other sideon behalf of the league the murder of terry carroll at the moment in which he was about to give evidencefalse evidence as the leaguers saidagainst his brother was a great triumph to them it was used as an argument why pat carroll should be no longer confined while florians death had been a reason why he never should be released at all all this kept the memory of florians death and the constant thought of it still fresh in the minds of them all at morony castle together with the poverty which had fallen upon them had made the two men weary of their misfortunes under such misfortunes when continued men do become more weary than women but edith thought there would be something in the constancy of rachels love to cheer her brother and therefore the letter made her contented if not happy  for herself she said to herself no love could cheer her captain clayton still hung about tuam and headford but his presence in the neighbourhood was always to be attributed to the evidence of which he was in search as to florians death it seemed now with him that the one great object of his heart was the unravelling of that murder it was no mystery as he said over and over again in ediths hearing he knew very well who had fired the rifle he could see in his minds eye the slight form of the crouching wretch as he too surely took his aim from the temporary barricade the passion had become so strong with him of bringing the man to justice that he almost felt that between him and his god he could swear to having seen it and yet he knew that it was not so to have the hanging of that man would be to him a privilege only next to that of possessing edith jones and he was a sanguine man and did believe that in process of time both privileges would be vouchsafed to him  but edith was less sanguine she could not admit to herself the possibility that there should be successful love between her and her hero his presence there in the neighbourhood of her home was stained by constant references to her brothers blood and then though there was no chance for ada adas former hopes militated altogether against edith he had better go away and just leave us to ourselves she said to herself but yet neither was she nor was ada sunk so low in heart as her father and her brother  frank she said to her brother whom do you think this letter is from and she held up in her hand rachels epistle  i care not at all unless it be from that most improbable of all creatures a tenant coming to pay his rent  nothing quite so beautiful as that  or from someone who has evidence to give about some of these murders that are going ona mr morris from the other side of the lake in county mayo had just been killed and the minds of men were now disturbed with this new horroranybody can kill anybody who has a taste in that direction what a country for a man with his family to pitch upon and live in and that all this should have been kept under so long by policemen and rightthinking individuals and then burst out like a subterranean fire all over the country because the hope has been given them of getting their land for nothing in order to indulge in wholesale robbery they are willing at a moments notice to undertake wholesale murder  after listening to words such as these edith found it impossible to introduce rachels letter on the spur of the moment     chapter xxxvii  rachel is ill   rachel before the end of march received the following letter from her friend but she received it in bed the whole world of covent garden theatre had been thrown into panicstricken dismay by the fact that miss omahony had something the matter with her throat this was the second attack the first having been so short as to have caused no trepidations in the world of music but this was supposed to be sterner in its nature and to have caused already great alarm before march was over it was published to the world at large that miss omahony would not be able to sing during the forthcoming week  in this catastrophe her lordly lover was of course the most sedulous of attendants in truth he was so though when we last met him and his bride together he had made himself very disagreeable rachel had then answered him in such language as to make her think it impossible that he should not quarrel with her but still here he was constant at her chamber door whether his constancy was due to his position about the theatre or to his ardour as a lover she did not know but in either case it troubled her somewhat and interfered with her renewed dreams about frank then came the following letter from franks sister      dear rachel     i am not very much surprised though i was a little that    you should have accepted lord castlewell but i had not    quite known the ins and outs of it not having been there    to see frank says that the separation had certainly come    from him because he could not bring himself to burden    your prosperity with the heavy load of his misfortunes    poor fellow they are very heavy they would have made you    both miserable for awhile unless you could have agreed    to postpone your marriage why should it not have been    postponed     but lord castlewell came in the way and i supposed    him naturally to be as beautiful and gracious as he is    gorgeous and rich but though you say nothing about him    there does creep out from your letter some kind of idea    that he is not quite so beautiful in your eyes as was    poor frank remember that poor frank has to wear two blue    shirts a week and no more in order to save the washing    how many does lord castlewell wear how many will he wear    when he is a marquis     but at any rate it does seem to be the case that you and    the earl are not as happy together as your best friends    could wish we had understood that the earl was ready    to expire for love at the sound of every note has he    slackened in his admiration so as to postpone his expiring    to the close of every song or why is it that frank should    be allowed again to come up and trouble your dreams     you are so fond of joking that it is almost impossible for    a poor steadygoing boycotted young woman to follow you    to the end of course i understand that what you say about    mr moss is altogether a joke but then what you say about    frank is i am sure not a joke if you love him the best    as i am sure you doso very much the best as to disregard    the marble hallsi advise you in the gentlest manner    possible to tell the marble halls that they are not    wanted it cannot be right to marry one man when you say    that you love another as you do frank of course he will    wait if you like to wait all i can say is that no man    loves a girl better than he loves you     we are very much down in the world at the present we have    literally no money papas relatives have given their    money to him to invest and he has laid it out on the    property here nobody was thought to have done so well as    he till lately but now they cannot get their interest    and of course they are impatient commissioners have    sat in the neighbourhood and have reduced the rents all    round but they cant reduce what doesnt exist there    are tenants who i suppose will pay pat carroll could    certainly have done so but then papas share in the    property will be reduced almost to nothing he will not    get above five shillings out of every twenty shillings of    rent such as it was supposed to be when he bought it i    dont understand all this and i am sure i cannot make you    do so     i have nothing to tell about my young man as you call    him except that he cannot be mine i fancy that girls are    not fond of writing about their young men when they dont    belong to them frank at any rate is yours if you will    take him and you can write about him with an open heart    i cannot do so think of poor florian and his horrid    death is this a time for marriageif it were otherwise    possiblewhich it is not     god bless you dear rachel let me hear from you again    soon i have said nothing to frank as yet i attempted    it this morning but was stopped you can imagine    that he poor fellow is not very happyyours very    affectionately     edith jones   rachel read the letter on her sick bed and as soon as it was read lord castlewell came to her there was always a nurse there but lord castlewell was supposed to be able to see the patient and on one occasion had been accompanied by his sister it was all done in the most proper form imaginable much to rachels disgust incapable as she was in her present state of carrying on any argument she was desirous of explaining to lord castlewell that he was not to hold himself as bound to marry her if you think that father is an ass you had better say so outright and let there be an end of it she wished to speak to him after this fashion but she could not say it in the presence of the nurse and of lady augusta but lord castlewells conduct to herself made her more anxious than ever to say something of the kind he was very civil even tender in his inquiries but he was awfully frigid she could tell from his manner that that last speech of hers was rankling in his bosom as the frigid words fell from his lips he was waiting for some recoverya partial recovery would be better than a whole oneand then he would speak his mind she wanted to speak her mind first but she could hardly do so with her throat in its present condition  she had no other friend than her father no other friend to take her part with her lovers and she had too fallen into such a state that she could not say much to him according to the orders of the physician she was not to interest herself at all about anything  i wonder whether the man was ever engaged to two or three lovers at once she said to herself alluding to the doctor he knows at any rate of lord castlewell and does he think that i am not to trouble myself about him  she had a tablet under her pillow which she took out and wrote on it certain instructions dear father c and i quarrelled before i was ill at all and now he comes here just as though nothing had happened he said you made an ass of yourself in the house of commons i wont have it and mean to tell him so but i cant talk wont you tell him from me that i shall expect him to beg my pardon and that i shall never hear anything of the kind again it must come to this your own r this was handed to mr omahony by rachel that very day before he went down to the house of commons  but my dear he said rachel only shook her head i can hardly say all this about myself i dont care twopence whether he thinks me an ass or not  but i do said rachel on the tablet  he is an earl and has wonderful privileges as well as a great deal of money  marble halls and impudence said rachel on the tablet then mr omahony feeling that he ought to leave her in peace made her a promise and went his way at covent garden that evening he met the noble lord having searched for him in vain at westminster he was much more likely to find lord castlewell among the singers of the day than with the peers but of these things mr omahony hardly understood all the particulars  well omahony how is your charming daughter  my daughter is not inclined to be charming at all i do hope she may be getting better but at present she is bothering her head about you  it is natural that she should think of me a little sometimes said the flattered lord  she has written me a message which she says that i am to deliver now mind i dont care about it the least in the world here the lord looked very grave she says that you called me an ass well i am to you and youre an ass to me i am sure you wont take it as any insult neither do i she wants you to promise that you wont call me an ass any more of course it would follow that i shouldnt be able to call you one we should both be hampered and the truth would suffer but as she is ill perhaps it would be better that you should say that you didnt mean it  but this was not at all lord castlewells view of the matter though he had been very glib with his tongue in calling omahony an ass he did not at all like the compliment as paid back to him by his fatherinlaw and there was something which he did not quite understand in the assertion that the truth would suffer all the world was certain that mr omahony was an ass he had been turned out of the house of commons only yesterday for saying that the speaker was quite wrong and sticking to it there was not the slightest doubt in the world about it but his lordship knew his gamut which was all that he pretended to know and never interfered with matters of which he was ignorant he was treated with the greatest respect at covent garden and nobody ever suspected him of being an ass and then he had it in his mind to speak very seriously to rachel as soon as she might be well enough to hear him you have spoken to me in a manner my dear which i am sure you did not intend he had all the words ready prepared on a bit of paper in his pocketbook and he was by no means sure but that the little quarrel might even yet become permanent he had discussed it frequently with lady augusta and lady augusta rather wished that it might become permanent and lord castlewell was not quite sure that he did not wish it also the young lady had a way of speaking about her own people which was not to be borne and now she had been guilty of the gross indecency of sending a message to him by her own fatherthe very man whom he called an ass and the man in return only laughed and called him an ass  but lord castlewell knew the proprieties of life here was thisgirl whom he had proposed to marry a sad invalid at the moment the doctor had in fact given him but a sad account of the case she has strained her voice continually till it threatens to leave her said the doctor i do not say that it will be so but it may her best chance will be to abandon all professional exertions till next year then the doctor told him that he had not as yet taken upon himself to hint anything of all this to miss omahony  lord castlewell was puzzled in the extreme if the lady lost her voice and so became penniless and without a profession and if he in such case were to throw her over and leave her unmarried what would the world say of him would it be possible then to make the world understand that he had deserted her not on account of her illness but because she had not liked to hear her father called an ass and had not rachel already begun the battle in a manner intended to show that she meant to be the victor could it be possible that she herself was desirous of backing out there was no knowing the extent of the impudence to which these americans would not go no doubt she had by the use of intemperate language on the occasion when she would not be driven out in the carriage given him ample cause for a breach to tell the truth he had thought then that a breach would be expedient but she had fallen ill and it was incumbent on him to be tender and gentle then from her very sick bed she had sent him this impudent message  and it had been delivered so impudently the truth would suffer he was sure that there was a meaning in the words intended to signify that he lord castlewell was and must be an ass at all times then he asked himself whether he was an ass because he did not quite understand omahonys argument why did the truth suffer as to his being an assomahony being an asshe was sure that there was no doubt about that all the world said so the house of commons knew itand the newspapers he had been turned out of the house for saying the speaker was wrong and not apologising for having uttered such words and he lord castlewell had so expressed himself only to the woman who was about to be his wife then she had had the incredible folly to tell her father and the father had told him that under certain circumstances the truth must suffer he did not quite understand it but was sure that mr omahony had meant to say that they were two fools together  he was not at all ashamed of marrying a singing girl it was the thing he would be sure to do and he thought of some singing girls before his time and of his time also whom it would be an honour for such as him to marry but he would degrade himselfso he feltby the connection with an advanced landleaguing member of parliament he looked round the lot of them and he assured himself that there was not one from whose loins an english nobleman could choose a wife without disgrace it was most unfortunateso he told himself the man had not become member of parliament till quite the other day he had not even opened his mouth in parliament till the engagement had been made and now among them all this omahony was the biggest ass and yet lord castlewell found himself quite unable to hold his own with the irish member when the irish member was brought to attack him he certainly would have made rachels conduct a fair excuse for breaking with heronly that she was ill  if he could have known the state of rachels mind there might have been an end to his troubles she had now at length been made thoroughly wretched by hearing the truth from the doctoror what the doctor believed to be the truth miss omahony i had better tell you your voice has gone at any rate for a year  for a year the hoarse angry rusty whisper came forth from her and in spite of its hoarseness and rustiness was audible enough  i fear so for heavens sake dont talk use your tablet rachel drew the tablet from under her pillow and dashed it across the room the doctor picked it up and with a kind smile and a little caressing motion of his hand put it again back under the pillow rachel buried her head amidst the bedclothes and sobbed bitterly try to make yourself happy in remembering how you have succeeded said the doctor  it wont be back just the same she wrote on her tablet  it is in gods hands said the doctor there came not another word from rachel either by her tablet or by any struggle at speech the doctor having made what attempts at comfort he could went his way then her father who had been in and out constantly came to his daughter he had not been present when she threw the tablet away but he knew what the doctor had said to her  my pet he said but she made no attempt to answer him a year at her time of life a year is an eternity and then this doctor had only told her that her voice was in gods hands she could talk to herself without any effort when they say that they always condemn you when the doctor tells you that you are in gods hands he means the devils  she had been so near the gods and goddesses and now she was no more than any other poor woman she might be less as her face had begun to wither with her voice she had all but succeeded as for her face as for the mere look of her let it go she told herself that she cared nothing for her appearance what was lord castlewell to herwhat even was franks love to stand on the boards of the theatre and become conscious of the intense silence of the crowd before herso intense because the tone of her voice was the one thing desired by all the world and then to open her mouth and to let the music go forth and to see the ears all erect as she fancied she could so that not a sound should be lostshould not be harvested by the hungry hearers that was to be a very god as she told herself of all her regrets there was not a passing sorrow given to lord castlewell and what of the other man oh frank dear frank you will know it all now there need be no more taking money but she did take some comfort at last in that promise of gods hands when she had come as it were to the bitterest moment of her grief she told herself that though it might be even at the end of a whole year there was something to be hoped     chapter xxxviii  lord castlewell is much troubled   when her father had been with her halfanhour and was beginning to think that he could escape and go down to the houseand he had a rod in pickle for the speakers back such a rod that the speakers back should be sore for the rest of the sessionrachel began her lengthened conversation with him in the last halfhour she had made up her mind as to what she would say but the conversation was so long and intricate being necessarily carried on by means of her tablet that poor omahonys rod was losing all its pickle father you must go and see lord castlewell at once  i think my dear he understood me altogether when i saw him before and he seemed to agree with me i told him i didnt mind being called an ass but that you were so absurd as to dislike it in fact i gave him to understand that we were three asses but i dont think hell say it again  it isnt about that at all said the tablet  what else do you want  then rachel went to work and wrote her demand with what deliberation she could assume  you must go and tell him that i dont want to marry him at all he has been very kind and you mustnt tell him that hes an ass any more but it wont do he has proposed to marry me because he has wanted a singing girl and i think i should have done for himonly i cant sing  then the father replied having put himself into such a position on the bed as to read the tablet while rachel was filling it but thatll all come right in a very short time  it cant and it wont the doctor says a year but he knows nothing about it and says its in gods hands he means by that its as bad as it can be  but my dear  i tell you it must be so  but you are engaged he would never be so base a man as to take your word at such a moment as this of course he couldnt do it if you had had smallpox or anything horrible like that he would not have been justified  im as ugly as ever i can be said the tablet and as poor a creature then she stopped her pencil for a moment  of course hes engaged to you why my dear id have to cowhide him if he said a word of the kind  oh no said the tablet with frantic energy  but you see if i wouldnt you see if i dont i suppose they think a lord isnt to be cowhided in this country i guess ill let em know the difference  but i dont love him said the tablet  goodness gracious me  i dont when he spoke of you in that way i began to think of it and i found i hated him i do hate him like poison and i want you to tell him so  that will be very disagreeable said the father  never mind the disagreeables you tell him so i tell you he wont be the worst pleased of the lot of us he wanted a singer and not a landleaguers daughter now he hasnt got the singer but has got the landleaguers daughter and ill tell you something else i want  what do you want asked the father when her hand for a moment ceased to scrawl  i want she said frank jones now you know all about it  then she hid her face beneath the bedclothes and refused to write another word  he went on talking to her till he had forgotten the speaker and the rod in pickle he besought her to think better of it and if not that just at present to postpone any action in the matter he explained to her how very disagreeable it would be to him to have to go to the lord with such a message as she now proposed but she only enhanced the vehemence of her order by shaking her head as her face lay buried in the pillow  let it wait for one fortnight said the father  no said the girl using her own voice for the effort  then the father slowly took himself off and making his way to the house of commons renewed his passion as he went and had himself again turned out before he had been halfanhour in the house  the earl was sitting alone after breakfast two or three days subsequently thinking in truth of his difficulty with rachel it had come to be manifest to him that he must marry the girl unless something terrible should occur to her she might die he said to himself very sadly trying to think of cases in which singers had died from neglected throats and it did make him very sad he could not think of the perishing of that magnificent treble without great grief and after his fashion he did love her personally he did not know that he could ever love anyone very much better he had certainly thought that it would be a good thing that his father and mother and sister should go and live in foreign landsin order in short that they might never more be heard of to trouble himbut he did not even contemplate their deaths so sweetminded was he but in the first fury of his love he had thought how nice it would be to be left with his singing girl and no one to trouble him now there came across him an idea that something was due to the marquis of beaulieusomething that is to his own future position and what could he do with a singing girl for his wife who could not sing  he was unhappy as he thought of it all and would ever and again as he meditated be stirred up to mild anger when he remembered that he had been told that the truth would suffer he had intended at any rate that his singing girl should be submissive and obedient while in his hands but here had been an outbreak of passion and here was this confounded omahony ready to make a fool of himself at a moments notice before all the world at that moment the door was opened and mr omahony was shown into the room  oh dear exclaimed the lord how do you do mr omahony i hope i see you well  pretty well but upon my word i dont know how to tell you what ive got to say  has anything gone wrong with rachel  not with her illnesswhich however does not seem to improve the poor girl but youll say shes gone mad  what do you mean by that  i really hardly know how i ought to break it you must have learned by this time that rachel is a girl determined to have her own way  well well well  and upon my word when i think of myself i feel that i have nothing to do but what she bids me  its more than you do for the speaker mr omahony  yes it is i admit that but rachel though she is inclined to be tyrannical is not such a downright positive old bluebottle nincompoop as that whitewigged king of kings rachel is bad but even you cant say that she is bad enough to be speaker of the house of commons my belief is that hell come to be locked up yet  we have all the highest opinion of him  its because you like to be sat upon you dont want to be allowed to say bo to a goose i have often heard in my own country  but you call yourself an irishman mr omahony  never did so in my life they called me so over there when they wanted to return me to hold my tongue in that house of torment but i guess it will puzzle the best englishman going to find out whether im an american or an irishman they did something over there to make me an american but they did nothing to unmake me as an irishman and there i am member for cavan and it will go hard with me if i dont break that speakers heart before ive done with him what i aint to say that he goes wrong when he never goes right by any chance  have you come here this morning mr omahony to abuse the speaker  by no means it was you who threw the speaker in my teeth  lord castlewell did acknowledge to himself his own imprudence  i came here to tell you about my daughter and upon my word i shall find it more difficult than anything i may have to say to the speaker i have the most profound contempt for the speaker  perhaps he returns it  i dont believe he does or he wouldnt make so much of me as to turn me out of the house when a man finds it necessary to remove an enemy let the cause be what it may he cannot be said to despise that enemy now i wouldnt give a puff of breath to turn him out of the house in truth i despise him too much  he is to be pitied said the lord with a gentle touch of irony  ill tell you what lord castlewell  dont go on about the speaker mr omahonypray dont  you always beginbut i wont i didnt come here to speak about him at all and the chairman of committees is positively worse you know theres a creature called chairman of committees  now mr omahony i really must beg that you will fight your political battles anywhere but here im not a politician how is your charming daughter this morning  she is anything but charming i hardly know what to make of her but i find that i am always obliged to do what she tells me there was another allusion to the speaker on the lords tongue but he restrained himself she has sent me here to say that she wants the marriage to be broken off  good heavens  she does she says that you intend to marry her because shes a singing girland now she cant sing  not exactly that said the lord  and she thinks she oughtnt to have accepted you at allthats the truth the lords face became very long i think myself that it was a little too hurried i dont suppose you quite knew your own minds  if miss omahony repents  well miss omahony does repent she has got something into her head that i cant quite explain she thought that shed do for a countess very well as long as she was on the boards of a theatre but now that shes to be relegated to private life she begins to feel that she ought to look after someone about her own age  oh indeed is this her message  well yes it is her message i shouldnt in such a matter invent it all if she hadnt sent me i dont know now i think of it that she did say anything about her own age but yet she did remarked mr omahony calling to mind the assertion made by rachel that she wanted frank jones frank jones was about her own age whereas the lord was as old as her father  upon my word i am much obliged to miss omahony  she certainly has meant to be as courteous as she knows how said mr omahony  perhaps on your side of the water they have different ideas of courtesy the young lady sends me word that now she means to retire from the stage she finds i am too old for her  not that at all said mr omahony but he said it in an apologetic tone as though admitting the truth  lord castlewell as he sat there for a few moments acknowledged to himself that rachel possessed certain traits of character which had something fine about them from whatever side of the water she had come he was a reasonable man and he considered that there was a way made for him to escape from this trouble which was not to have been expected had rachel been an english girl or an italian or a norwegian he would hardly have been let off so easily as he was an earl and about to be a marquis and as he was a rich man such suitors are not generally given up in a hurry this young lady had sent word to him that she had lost her voice permanently and was therefore obliged to surrender that high title that noble name and those golden hopes which had glistened before her eyes no doubt he had offered to marry her because of her singingthat is he would not have so offered had she not have been a singer but he could not have departed from his engagement simply because she had become dumb he quite understood that mr omahony would have been there with his cowhide and though he was by no means a coward be did not wish to encounter the american member of the house of commons in all his rage in fact he had been governed in his previous ideas by a feeling of propriety but propriety certainly did not demand him to marry a young lady who had sent to tell him that he was too old and this irate member of the house of commons had come to bring him the message  what am i expected to suggest now said lord castlewell after awhile  just your affectionate blessing and youre very sorry said mr omahony with a shrug thats the kind of thing i should say  he couldnt send her his affectionate blessing and he couldnt say he was very sorry had the young lady been about to marry his sonhad there been such a sonhe could have blessed her and he felt that his own personal dignity did not admit of an expression of sorrow  was he to let the young lady off altogether there was something nearly akinvery nearly akinto true love in his bosom as he thought of this the girl was ill and no doubt weak and had been made miserable by the loss of her voice the doctor had told him that her voice for all singing purposes had probably gone for ever but her beauty remainedhad not so faded at least as to have given any token of permanent decay and that peculiarly bright eye was there and the wit of the words which had captivated him the very smallness of her stature with its perfect symmetry had also gone far to enrapture him  no doubt he was forty he did not openly pretend even to be less and where was the young lady singer or no singer who if disengaged would reject the heir to a marquisate because he was forty and he did not believe that rachel had sent him any message in which allusion was made to his age that had been added by the stupid father who was without doubt the biggest fool that either america or ireland had ever produced now that the matter had been brought before him in such bald terms he was by no means sure that he was desirous of accepting the girls offer to release him and the father evidently had no desire to catch him he must acknowledge that mr omahony was an honest fool  its very hard to know what im to say here mr omahony shook his head i think that perhaps i had better come and call upon her  you mustnt speak a word and if youre to be considered as no longer engaged perhaps there might beyou knowsomethingwell something of delicacy in the matter  mr omahony felt at the moment that he ought to protect the interests of frank jones  i understand at any rate i am not disposed to send her my blessing at present as a final step an engagement to be married is a very serious step in life  but her father remembered that she had told him that she wanted frank jones should he tell the lord the exact truth and explain all about frank jones it would be the honest thing to do and yet he felt that his girl should have another chance this lord was not much to his taste but still for a lord he had his good points  i think we had better leave it for the present said the lord i feel that in the midst of all your eloquence i do not quite catch miss omahonys meaning  omahony felt that this lord was as bad a lord as any of them he would like to force the lord to meet him at some debating club where there was no wretched speaker and there force him to give an answer on any of the burning questions which now excited the two countries  very well i will explain to rachel as soon as i can that the matter is still left in abeyance of course we feel the honour done us by your lordship in not desiring to accept at once her decision her condition is no doubt sad but i suppose she may expect to hear once more from yourself in a short time  so mr omahony took his leave and as he went to cecil street endeavoured in his own mind to investigate the character of lord castlewell that he was a fool there could be no doubt a fool with whom he would not be forced to live in the constant intercourse of married life for any money that could be offered to him he was a man who without singing himself cared for nothing but the secondhand life of a theatre but then he mr omahony was not a young woman and was not expected to marry lord castlewell but he had told himself over and over again that lord castlewell had been caught he was a great lord rolling in money and rachel had caught him he had not quite approved of rachels conduct but the lord had been fair game for a woman what the deuce was he to think now of the lord who would not be let off  i wonder whether it can be love for her said he to himself such love as i used to feel  then he sighed heavily as he went home     chapter xxxix  captain claytons first triumph   it was now april and this april was a sad month in ireland i do not know why the deaths of two such men as were then murdered should touch the heart with a deeper sorrow than is felt for the fate of others whose lot is lower in life why the poor widow who has lost her husband while doing his duty amidst outrages and unmanly revenges is not to be so much thought of as the sweet lady who has been robbed of her all in the same fashion but so it is with human nature we know how a people will weep for their sovereign and it was with such tears as that with tears as sincere as those shed for the best of kings that lord frederick cavendish and mr burke were lamented in april these two men had fallen hacked to death in front of the viceregal lodge by whom they were killed as i write now no one knows and as regards lord frederick one can hardly guess the reason he had come over to ireland on that very day to take the place which his luckier predecessor had just vacated and had as yet done no service and excited no vengeance in ireland he had only attended an opening pageantbecause with him had come a new lord lieutenantnot new indeed to the office but new in his return an accident had brought the two together on the day but lord frederick was altogether a stranger and yet he had been selected such had been his fate and such also the fate of mr burke who next to him in official rank may possibly have been in truth the doomed one they were both dealt with horribly on that april morningand all ireland was grieving all ireland was repudiating the crime and saying that this horror had surely been done by american hands even the murderers native to ireland seemed to be thoroughly ashamed of this deed  it would be needless here to tellor to attempt to tellhow one lordlieutenant had made way for another and one chief secretary for another chief secretary it would be trying to do too much in the pages of a novel the novelist can hardly do more than indicate the sources of the troubles which have fallen upon the country and can hardly venture to deal with the names and characters of those who have been concerned for myself i do most cordially agree with the policy of him in whose place lord frederick had this day sufferedas far as his conduct in ireland can be read from that which he did and from that which he spoke as far as he had agreed with the government in their measure for interfering with the price paid for land in the countryfor putting up a new law devised by themselves in lieu of that timehonoured law by which property has ever been protected in englandi disagree of my disagreement no one will take noticebut my story cannot be written without expressing it  but down at morony castle mingled with their sorrows there was a joy and a triumph not loud indeed not sounded with trumpets not as yet perfect not quite assured even in the mind of one man but yet assuring in the mind of that manand indeed of one otheralmost to conviction that man was captain yorke clayton and that other man was only poor hunter the wounded policeman for such triumph as was theirs a victim is needed and in this case the victim the hopedfor victim was mr lax  nothing had ever been made out in regard to the murder of terry carroll in the court house at galway irish mysteries are coming to be unriddled now but there will be no unriddling of that yorke clayton together with hunter and all the police of county galway could do nothing in regard to that mystery they had struggled their very best and from the nature of the crime had found themselves almost obliged to discover the perpetrator the press of the two countries the newspapers in other respects so hostile to each other had united in declaring that the police were bound to know all about it the police had determined to know nothing about it because the government did not dare to bring forward such evidence this was the irish landleague view and though it contained an accusation against the government for having contrived the murder itself it was all the better on that account the english papers simply said that the galway police must be fast asleep this man had been murdered when in the very hands of the officers of justice the judge had seen the shots fired the victim fell into the hands of four policemen the pistol was found at his feet it was done in daylight and all galway was looking on the kind of things that were said by one set of newspapers and another drove yorke clayton almost out of his wits he had to maintain a show of good humour and he did maintain it gallantly my hero is a hero still whispered edith to her own pillow but in truth nothing could be done as to that galway case mr lax was still in custody and was advised by counsel not to give any account of himself at that time it was indecent on the part of the prosecution that he should be asked to do so so said the lawyers on his side but it was clear that nobody in the court and nobody in galway could be got to say that he or she had seen him do it and yet yorke clayton had himself seen the hip of the stooping man i suppose i couldnt swear to it he said to himself and it would be hard to see how he could swear to the man without forswearing himself  but while this lamentable failure was going on success reached him from another side he didnt care a straw what the newspapers said of him so long as he could hang mr lax his triumph in that respect would drown all other failures mr lax was still in custody and many insolent petitions had been made on his behalf in order that he might be set free did the crown intend to pretend that they had any shadow of evidence against him as to the shooting of terry carroll  nobut there was another murder committed a day or two before poor young florian jones had been murdered even presuming that laxs hand cannot be seen visible in the matter of terry carroll there is we think something to connect him with the other murder the two no doubt were committed in the same interest the crown is not prepared to allow lax to escape from its hands quite yet then there were many words on the subject going on just at the time at which lax especially wanted his freedom and at which to tell the truth yorke clayton was near the end of his tether in regard to poor florian  in the beginning of his inquiry as to the ballyglunin murder he entertained an idea that lax after firing the shot had been seen by that wicked cardriver who had boycotted mr jones in his great need the reader will probably have forgotten that mr jones had required to be driven home to morony castle from ballyglunin station and had been refused the accommodation by a wicked old landleaguer who had joined the conspiracy formed in the neighbourhood against mr jones he had done so either in fear of his neighbours or else in a true patriot spiritbecause he had gone without any supper as had also his horses on the occasion the mans name was teddy mooney the father of kit mooney who stopped the hunting at moytubber and he certainly was patriotic from day to day he went on refusing faresfor the boycotted personages were after all more capable of paying fares than the boycotting hero of doing without themsuffering much himself from want of victuals and more on behalf of his poor animal he saw his son kit more than once or twice in those days and kit appeared to be the stancher patriot of the two kit was a baker and did earn wages but he utterly refused to subsidise the patriotism of his father if ye cant do that for the ould counthry said kit ye aint half the man i took ye for but he refused him a gallon of oats for his horse  it was not at once that the old man gave way he went on boycotting individuals till he hadnt a pair of breeches left to sit upon and the nonboycotted tradesmen of the little towns around declined to sit upon his car because the poor horse fed upon roadside grasses refused to be urged into a trot tare and ages man whats the good of it aint we acutting the noses off our own faces and that with the money so scarce that i havent seen the sight of a halfcrown this two weeks it was thus that he declared his purpose of going back to the common unpatriotic ways of mankind to an old pal whom he had known all his days he did do so but found alas that his trade had perished in the meanwhile or forced itself into other channels  the result was that teddy mooney became very bitter in spirit and was for a while an orangeman and almost a protestant the evil things that had been done to him were terrible to his spirit he had been threatened with eviction from ten acres of ground because he couldnt pay his rent or as he said because he had declined to drive a maidservant to the house of another gentleman who was also boycotted this had not been true but it had served to embitter teddy mooney and now at last he had determined to belong to the other side  when an irishman does make up his mind to serve the other side he is very much determined there is but the meditation of two minutes between landleaguing and orangeism between boycotting landlords and thorough devotion to the dear old landlord when kit mooney had first laid down the law to his father how he ought to assist in boycotting all the enemies of the landleague no one saw his way clearer than did teddy mooney i wouldnt mind doing without a bit or a sup he said when his son explained to him that he might have to suffer a little for the cause not a bit or a sup when the ould counthry wants it he had since had a few words with his son kit and was now quite on the other side of the question he was told that somebody had threatened to cut off his old mares tail because he had driven phil darcy since that he had become a martyr as well as an orangeman and was disposed to go any length for the gintlmen this had come all about by degreeshad been coming about since poor florians murder and at last he wrote a letter to yorke clayton or got someone else to write it  yer honourit was lax as dropped master flory divil a doubt about it theres one as can tell more about it as is on the road from ballyglunin all round this comes from a wellwisher to the ould cause for muster clayton  when captain clayton received this he at once knew from whom it had come the landleaguing cardriver who had turned gentlemens friend was sufficiently well known to history to have been talked about clayton therefore did not lose much time in going down to ballyglunin station and requiring to be driven yet once again from thence to carnlough and now mr teddy mooney he said after they had travelled together a mile or two from ballyglunin and had come almost to the spot at which the poor boy had been shot tell me what you know about mr laxs movements in this part of the world he had never come there before since the fatal day without having three policemen with him but now he was alone such a man as teddy mooney would be most unwilling to open his mouth in the presence of two or more persons  o lord captain how you come on a poor fellow all unawares  stop a moment mr mooney and the car stopped whereabouts was it the young gentleman perished  thems the very shotholes said teddy pointing up to the temporary embrasure which had indeed been knocked down half a score of times since the murder and had been as often replaced by the diligent care of mr blake and captain clayton  just so they are the shotholes and which way did the murderer run teddy pointed with his whip away to the east over the ground on which the man had made his escape and where did you first see him  see him ejaculated teddy it became horrible to his imagination as he thought that he was about to tell of such a deed  of course we know you did see him but i want to know the exact spot  it was over there nigh to widow dolans cottage  it wasnt the widow who saw him i think  faix it was the widow thin with her own eyes i hardly knowd him and yet i did know him for id seen him once travelling from ballinasloe with pat carroll and lax is a man as when youve once seen him youve seen him for allays but she knowed him well her husband was one of the boys when the fenians were up if he didnt go into the widow dolans cabin my names not teddy mooney  and who else was there  there was no one else but only her darter a slip of a girl o fifteen come up while lax was there i know she come up because i saw her coming jist as i passed the door  captain clayton entered into very friendly relations with teddy mooney on that occasion trying to make him understand without any absolute promises that all the luck and all the rewardsin fact all the bacon and oatslay on the dish to which mr lax did not belong under these influences teddy did become communicativethough he lied most awfully that did not in the least shock captain clayton who certainly would have believed nothing had the truth been told him without hesitation at last it came out that the cardriver was sure as to the personality of laxhad seen him again and again since he had first made his acquaintance in carrolls company and could swear to having seen him in the widows cabin he knew also that the widow and her daughter were intimate with lax he had not seen the shot fired this he said in an assured tone but captain clayton had known that before he did not expect to find anyone who had seen the shot fired except mr jones and peter as to peter he had his suspicions mr jones was certain that peter had told the truth in declaring that he had seen no one but the captain had argued the matter out with him a fellow of that kind is in a very hard position you must remember that for the truth itself he cares nothing he finds a charm rather in the romantic beauty of a lie lax is to him a lovely object even though he be aware that he and lax be on different sides and then he thoroughly believes in lax thinks that lax possesses some mysterious power of knowing what is in his mind and of punishing him for his enmity all the want of evidence in this country comes from belief in the marvellous the people think that their very thoughts are known to men who make their name conspicuous and dare not say a word which they suppose that it is desired they shall withhold in this case peter no doubt is on our side and would gladly hang lax with his own hand if he were sure he would be safe but lax is a mysterious tyrant who in his imagination can slaughter him any day whereas he knows that he shall encounter no harm from you he and poor florian were sitting on the car with their backs turned to the embrasure and peters attention was given to the driving of the carso that there was no ground for thinking that he had seen the murderer all the circumstances of the moment ran the other way but still it was possible  and captain clayton was of opinion that peter was beginning to be moved from the determined knownothingness of his primary evidence he had seen the flash and then as his master had run up the bank he didnt know whether he hadnt caught the flying figure of a man  i had the poor boys head on my knees captain clayton and how is a poor man to look much about him then  in this condition stood captain claytons mind in regard to peter when he heard for the first time a word about the widow dolan and the widow dolans daughter  the woman swore by all her gods that she knew nothing of lax but then she had already fallen into the difficulty of having been selected as capable of giving evidence it generally happens that no one first person will be found even to indicate others so that there is no finding a beginning to the case but when a witness has been indicated the witness must speak  the big blackguard exclaimed mrs dolan when she heard of the evil that had been brought her to have the imperence to mention my name  it was felt all the country through to be an impertinencefor anybody to drag anybody else into the mess of troubles which was sure to arise from an enforced connection with a law court most unwillingly the circumstances were drawn from mrs dolan and with extreme difficulty also from that ingenious young lady her daughter but still it was made to appear that lax had taken refuge in their cottage and had gone down from thence to a little brook where he effected the cleansing of his pistol the young lady had done all in her power to keep her mother silent but the mother had at last been tempted to speak of the weapon which lax had used  now there was no further question of letting lax go loose from prison that very irate barrister mr odonnell who was accustomed to speak of all the landleague criminals as patriotic lambswhose lamblike qualities were exceeded only by their patriotismdid not dare to intimate such a wish any further but he did urge with all that benevolence for which he was conspicuous that the trial should come on at that immediate spring assizes a rumour had however already reached the ears of captain clayton and others in his position that a great alteration was to be effected in the law this together with mrs dolans evidence might enable him to hang mr lax therefore the trial was postponednot indeed with outspoken reference as to the new measure but with much confidence in its resources  it would be useless here to refer to that bill which was to have been passed for trying certain prisoners in ireland without the intervention of a jury and of the alteration which took place in it empowering the government to alter the venue and to submit such cases to a selected judge to selected juries to selected counties the irish judges had remonstrated against the first measure and the second was to be first tried so that should it fail the judges might yet be called upon to act  such was the law under which criminals were tried in 1882 and the first capital convictions were made under which the country began to breathe freely but the tidings of the law had got abroad beforehand and gave a hope of triumph to such men as captain clayton let a man undertake what duty he will in life if he be a good man he will desire success and if he be a brave man he will long for victory the presence of such a man as lax in the country was an eyesore to captain clayton which it was his primary duty to remove and it was a triumph to him now that the time had come in which he might remove him three times had mr lax fired at the captains head and three times had the captain escaped i think he has done with his guns and his pistols now said captain clayton in his triumph     chapter xl  yorke clayton again makes love   i am not quite sure about peter yet said clayton to mr jones but if we could look into his very soul i am afraid he could not do much for us  i never believed in peter as a witness replied mr jones  i should like to know exactly what he did seewhether it was a limb or a bit of his coat but i think that young lady crept out and saw him cleaning his pistol and i think that the old lady had a glimpse of the mask i think that they can be made to say so  i saw the mask myself and the muzzle of the rifleand i saw the man running as plainly as i see you  that will all be wanted mr jones but i trust that we may have to summon you to dublin as things are at present if lax had been seen in broad daylight firing at the poor boy by a dozen farmers it would do no good in county galway there is miss edith out there she is awfully anxious about this wretch who destroyed her brother i will go and tell her so captain clayton rushed out anxious for another cause for triumph  mr jones had heard of his suit and had heard also that the suit was made to edith and not to ada there is not one in a dozen who would have taken edith said he to himselfunless it be one who saw her with my eyes but yet he did not approve of the marriage they were poverty stricken he said and clayton went about from day to day with his life in his hand a brave man he said to himself but singularly foolhardyunless it be that he wants to die he had not been called upon for his consent for edith had never yielded she too had said that it was impossible if ada would have suited it might have been possible but not between yorke and me they had both come now to call him by his christian name and they to him were ada and edith but with their father he had never quite reached the familiarity of a christian name  mr jones had in truth been so saddened by the circumstances of the last two years that he could not endure the idea of marriages in his family of course if you choose my dear you can do as you like he used to say to edith  but i dont choose  what there are left of us should i think remain together i suppose they cannot turn me out of this house the prime minister will hardly bring in a bill that the estates bought this last hundred years shall belong to the owners of the next century he can do so of course as things go now there are no longer any lords to stop him and the house of commons who want their seats will do anything he bids them its the first lieutenant who looks after ireland who has ideas of justice with which the angels of light have certainly not filled his mind that we should get nothing from our purchased property this century and give it up in the course of the next is in strict accordance with his thinking we can depend upon nothing my brotherinlaw can of course sell me out any day and would not stop for a moment everybody has to get his own except an irish landlord but i think we should fare ill all together your brother is behaving nobly and i dont think we ought to desert him of course you can do as you please  then the squire pottered on wretched in heart or rather down in the mouth as we say and gave his advice to his younger daughter not in truth knowing how her heart stood but a man when he undertakes to advise another should not be down in the mouth himself equam memento rebus in arduis servare mentem non secus ac bonis if not your thoughts will be too strongly coloured by your own misfortunes to allow of your advising others  all this edith knewexcept the latin the meaning of it had been brought home to her by her own light poor papa is so hipped she said to herself that he thinks that nobody will ever be happy again but still she resolved that she would not marry yorke clayton there had been a mistake and she had made ita miserable blunder for which she was responsible she did not quite analyse the matter in her own mind or look into the thoughts of ada or of yorke himselfthe hero of her pillow but she continued to tell herself that the proper order of things would not admit it ada she knew wished it yorke longed for her more strongly even than for lax the murderer for herself when she would allow her thoughts to stray for a moment in that direction all the bright azure tints of heaven were open to her but she had made a mistake and she did not deserve it she had been a blind fool and blind fools deserved no azure tints of heaven  if she could have had her own way she would still have married ada to yorke clayton when ada told her that she had got over her foolish love it was the mere babble of unselfishness feel a passion for such a man as yorke clayton look into the depth of his blue eyes and fancy for herself a partnership with the spirit hidden away within and then get over it edith was guilty here of the folly of judging of her sister as herself and as for yorke himselfa man she said always satisfies himself with that which is lovely and beautiful and with ada he would have such other gifts as so strong a man as yorke always desires in his wife in temper she was perfect in unselfishness she was excellent in all those ways of giving aid which some women possess and some not at allbut which when possessed go so far to make the comfort of a houseshe was supreme if a bedroom were untidy her eye saw it at once if a thing had to be done at the stroke of noon she would remember that other things could not be done at the same time if a man liked his egg halfboiled she would bear it in her mind for ever she would know the proper day for making this marmalade and that preserve and she would never lose her good looks for a moment when she was doing these things with her little dustingbrush at her girdle no eyes that knew anything would ever take her for aught but a lady she was just the wife for yorke clayton  so edith argued it in her own bosom adding other wondrous mistakes to that first mistake she had made in thinking of it all she counted herself for nothing and made believe that she was ugly in all eyes she would not allow the man to see as his fancy led him and could not bring herself to think that if now the man should change his mind and offer his hand to ada it would be impossible that ada should accept it nor did she perceive that ada had not suffered as she had suffered  i wanted to catch you just for one moment said yorke clayton running out so as to catch his prey she had half wished to fly from him and had half told herself that any such flight was foolish  what is it yorke she said  i thinki do think that i have at last got lax upon the hip  you are so bloodyminded about lax  what are you going to turn round and be merciful he was her hero and she certainly felt no mercy towards the murderer of her brother no mercy towards him who she now thought had planned all the injury done to her father no mercy towards him who had thrice fired at her beloved this wretched man had struggled to get the blood of him who was all the world to her and had been urged on to his black deeds by no thought by no feeling that was not in itself as vile as hell lax was to her a viper so noxious as to be beyond the pale of all mercy to crush him beneath the heel of her boot so as to make an end of him as of any other poisonous animal was the best mercy to all other human beings but she had said the word at the spur of the moment because she had been instigated by her feelings to gainsay her hero and to contradict him so that he might think that he was no hero of hers she looked at him for the moment and said nothing though he held her by the arm if you say i am to spare him i will spare him  no she answered because of your duty  have i followed this man simply as a duty have i lain awake thinking of it till i have given to the pursuit such an amount of energy as no duty can require thrice he has endeavoured to kill me firing at me in the dark getting at me from behind hedges as no one who has anything of the spirit of man in his bosom will do when he strives to destroy his enemy all that has been nothing i am a policeman in search of him and am the natural enemy of a murderer of course in the ordinary way i would not have spared him but the ordinary way would have sufficed had he escaped me i could have laughed at all that but he took that poor lads life here he looked sadly into her face and she could see that there was a tear within his eye that was much but that was not all that lad was your brother him whom you so dearly loved he shot down the poor child before his fathers face simply because he had said that he would tell the truth when you wept when you tore your hair when you flung yourself in sorrow upon the body i told myself that either he or i must die and now you bid me be merciful then the big tears dropped down his cheeks and he began to wail himselfhardly like a man  and what did edith do she stood and looked at him for a few moments then extricated herself from the hold he still had of her and flung herself into his arms he put down his face and kissed her forehead and her cheeks but she put up her mouth and kissed his lips not once or twice was that kiss given but there they stood closely pressed to each other in a long embrace my hero she said my hero it had all come at lastthe double triumph and there was he felt no happier man in all ireland than he he thought at least that the double battle had been now won but even yet it was not so captain clayton she began  why captain why clayton  my brother yorke and she pressed both his hands in hers you can understand that i have been carried away by my feelings to thank you as a sister may thank a brother  i will not have it he exclaimed fiercely you are no sister nor can i ever be your brother you are my very own now and for ever and he rushed at her again as though to envelop her in his arms and to crush her against his bosom  no she exclaimed avoiding him with the activity of a young fawn not again i had to beg your pardon and it was so i did it  twenty times you have offended me and twenty times you must repeat your forgiveness  no no it must not be so i was wrong to say that you were bloodyminded i cannot tell why i said so i would not for worlds have you altered in anythingexcept she said in your love for me  but have you told me nothing  i have called you my heroand so you are  nay edith it is more than that it is not for me to remind you but it is more than that  she stood there blushing before him over her cheeks and up to her forehead but yet did not turn away her face  how am i to tell you why it is more than that you cannot tell me she replied  but edith  you cannot tell me there are moments for some of us the feelings of which can never be whispered you shall be my hero and my brother if you will or my hero and my friend or if not that my hero and my enemy  never  no my enemy you cannot be for him who is about to revenge my brothers death no name less sweet than dearest friend will suffice my hero and my dearest friend  then she took him by the hand and turned away from the walk and escaping by a narrow path was seen no more till she met him at dinner with her father and her brother and her sister  by god she shall be mine said clayton she must be mine  and then he went within and finding hunter read the details of the evidence for the trial of mr lax in dublin as prepared by the proper officers in galway city     chapter xli  the state of ireland   it will be well that they who are interested only in the sensational incidents of our story to skip this chapter and go on to other parts of our tale which may be more in accordance with their taste it is necessary that this one chapter shall be written in which the accidents that occurred in the lives of our three heroines shall be made subordinate to the political circumstances of the day this chapter should have been introductory and initiative but the facts as stated will suit better to the telling of my story if they be told here there can be no doubt that ireland has been and still is in a most precarious condition that life has been altogether unsafe there and that property has been jeopardised in a degree unknown for many years in the british islands it is i think the general opinion that these evils have been occasioned by the influx into ireland of a feeling which i will not call american but which has been engendered in america by irish jealousy and warmed into hatred by distance from english rule as far as politics are regarded ireland has been the vassal of england as poland has been of those masters under which she has been made to serve she was subjected to much illusage and though she has readily accepted the language the civilisation and the customs of england and has in fact grown rich by adopting them the memories of former hardships have clung to her and have made her ready to receive willingly the teachings of those whose only object it has been to undermine the prestige of the british empire in no respect has she more readily taken to her bosom english practices than in that of the letting and the hiring of land in various countries such as italy russia france and the united states systems have grown up different from that which has prevailed in england whether the english system or any other may be the best is not now the question but in answering that question it is material to know that ireland has accepted and at any rate for two centuries has followed that system the landlord has been to his tenants a beneficent or occasionally a hard master and the tenants have acknowledged themselves as dependent generally with much affection though not unfrequently with loud complaint it has been the same in england questions of tenantright of leases and of the cruelty of evictions have from time to time cropped up in ireland but rents were readily paid up to 1878 and 1879 though abatements were asked foras was the case also in england and there were men ready to tell the irish from time to time since the days of oconnell downwards that they were illtreated in being kept out of their ould properties by the rightful owners  then the american revolt growing out of smith obriens logic and physical force gave birth to fenianism the true fenian i take to be one desirous of opposing british power by using a fulcrum placed on american soil smith obriens logic consisted in his assertion that if his country wished to hammer the british crown they could only do it by using hammers smith obrien achieved little beyond his own exilebut his words acting upon his followers produced fenianism that died away but the spirit remained in america and when english tenants began to clamour for temporary abatements in their rent the clamours were heard on the other side of the water and assisted the views of those americanirish who had revivified ribandism and had given birth to the cry of home rule  during the time that this was going on a long unflagging series of beneficial acts of parliament and of consequently ameliorated circumstances had befallen the country i was told the other day by an irish judge whose name stands conspicuous among those who are known for their wisdom and their patriotism by a roman catholic judge too that in studying the latter laws of the two countries the laws affecting england and ireland in reference to each other he knew no law by which england was specially favoured though he knew various laws redounding to the benefit of ireland when the cry for some relief to suffering ireland came up at the time of the duchess of marlboroughs fund it was alleged in proof of irelands poor condition that there was not work by which the labourers could earn wages i have known ireland for more than forty yearssay from 1842 to 1882 in 1842 we paid five shillings a week for the entire work of a man as far as i can learn we now pay on an average nine shillings for the same the question is not whether five shillings was sufficient or whether nine be insufficient but that the normal increase through the country has been and can be proved to be such as is here declared  i will refer to the banks which can now be found established in any little town almost in any village through the country fifty years ago they were very much rarer banks do not spring up without money to support them the increase of wagesand the banks also in an indirect mannerhave come from that decrease in the population which followed the potato famine of 1846 the famine and its results were terrible while they lasted but they left behind them an amended state of things when man has failed to rule the world rightly god will step in and will cause famines and plagues and pestilenceeven poverty itselfwith his own right arm but the cure was effected and the country was on its road to a fair amount of prosperity when the tocsin was sounded in america and home rule became the cry  ireland has lain as it were between two rich countries england her near neighbour abounds in coal and iron and has by means of these possessions become rich among the nations america very much the more distant has by her unexampled agricultural resources put herself in the way to equal england it is necessarynecessary at any rate for englands safetythat ireland should belong to her this is here stated as a fact and i add my own opinion that it is equally necessary for irelands welfare but on this subject there has arisen a feud which is now being fought out by all the weapons of rebellion on one side and on the other by the force of a dominating government restrained as it is found to be by the selfimposed bonds of a democratic legislature but there is the feud and the battle and the roaring of the cannons is heard afar off  i now purpose to describe in a very few words the nature of the warfare it may be said that the existence of ireland as a province of england depends on the tenure of the land if the land were to be taken altogether from the present owners and divided in perpetuity among any possible number of tenants so as to be the property of each tenant without payment of any rent all englands sense of justice would be outraged the english power of governing would be destroyed and all that could then be done by england would be to give a refuge to the present owners till the time should come for righting themselves and they should be enabled to make some further attempt for the recovery of their possessions this would probably arrive if not sooner from the annihilation of the new proprietors under the hands of their fellowcountrymen to whom none of the spoil had been awarded but english statesmena small portion that is of english statesmenhave wished in their philanthropy to devise some measure which might satisfy the present tenants of the land giving them a portion of the spoil and might leave the landlords contentednot indeed with their lot which they would feel to be one of cruel deprivation but with the feeling that something had at any rate been left to them a compromise would be thus effected between the two classes whose interests have always been opposed to each other since the world beganbetween the owners of property and those who have owned none  the statesmen in question have now come into power by means of their philanthropy their undoubted genius and great gifts of eloquence they have almost talked the world out of its power of sober judgment i hold that they have so succeeded in talking to the present house of commons and when the house of commons has been so talked into any wise or foolish decision the house of lords and the whole legislating machinery of the country is bound to follow  but how should their compromises be effected it does not suit the present writer to name any individual statesman he neither wishes to assist in raising a friend to the gods or to lend his little aid in crushing an enemy but to the liberal statesmen of the day men in speaking well of whomat a great distancehe has spent a long life he is now bound to express himself as opposed we all remember the manner after which the coercion bill of 1881 was passed the hoarse shrieks with which a score of irish members ran out of the house crying privilege when their voices had been stopped by the salutary but certainly unconstitutional word of the speaker is still ringing in our ears then the government and the irish score were at daggersdrawn with each other to sit for thirtysix hours endeavouring to pass a clause was then held by all men to be an odious bondage but when these clauses had thus roughly been made to be the law the sugarplum was to follow by which all ireland was to be appeased the second bill of 1881 was passed which with various additions has given rise to judge ohagans land court that with its various subcommissioners is now engaged in settling at what rate land shall be let in ireland  that judge ohagan and his fellow commissioners are well qualified to perform their taskas well qualified that is by kindness by legal knowledge and general sagacity as any men can bei have heard no one deny in the performance of most difficult duties they have hitherto encountered no censure but they have i think been taxed to perform duties beyond the reach of any mortal wisdom they are expected to do that which all the world has hitherto failed in doingto do that against which the commonest proverbs of ancient and modern wisdom have raised their voice there is no proverb more common than that of caveat emptor it is judge ohagans business to do for the poorer party in each bargain made between a landlord and a tenant that against which the above proverb warns him the landlord has declared that the tenant shall not have the land unless he will pay £10 a year for it the tenant agrees then comes judge ohagan and tells the two contracting parties to take up their pens quickly and write down £8 as the fair rent payable for the land and it was with the object of doing this of reducing every £10 by some percentage twenty per cent or otherwise that this commission was appointed the government had taken upon itself to say that the greed of irish landlords had been too greedy and the softness of irish tenants too soft and that therefore parliament must interfere parliament has interfered and £8 is to be written down for a term of years in lieu of £10 and the land is to become the possession of the tenant instead of the landlord as long as he may pay this reduced rent in fact all the bonds which have bound the landlord to his land are to be annihilated so also are the bonds which bind the tenant who will sell the property so acquired when he shall have found that that for which he pays £8 per annum shall have become worth £10 in the market  it is useless to argue with the commissioners or with the government as to the inexpediency of such an attempt to alter the laws for governing the world which have forced themselves on the worlds acceptance many such attempts have been made to alter these laws the romans said that twelve per cent should be the interest for money a feeling long prevailed in england that legitimate interest should not exceed five per cent it is now acknowledged that money is worth what it will fetch and the interests of the young the foolish and the reckless who are tempted to pay too much for it are protected only by public opinion the usurer is hated and the hands of the honest men are against him that suffices to give the borrower such protection as is needed so it is with landlords and tenants injury is no doubt done and injustice is enabled to prevail here and there but it is the lesser injury the lesser injustice which cannot be prevented in the long run by any attempt to escape the law of caveat emptor  it is however vain to talk to benevolent commissioners or to a government working by eloquence and guided by philanthropy regardless of political economy would you have the heart asks the benevolent commissioner to evict the poor man from his small holding on which he has lived all his life where his only sympathies lie and send him abroad to a distant land where his solitary tie will be that of labour the benevolent commissioner thus expresses with great talk and with something also of the eloquence of his employers the feeling which prevails on that side of the question but that which he deprecates is just what i could do and having seen many irishmen both in america and in ireland i know that the american irishman is the happiest man of the two he eats more and in much eating the happiness of mankind depends greatly he is better clothed better sheltered and better instructed though his women wail when he departs he sends home money to fetch them this may be for the profit of america there are many who think that it must therefore be to the injury of england the question now is whether the pathetic remonstrance of the tearladen commissioner should be allowed to prevail i say that the tenant who undertakes to pay for land that which the land will not enable him to pay had better gounder whatever pressure  let us see how many details how many improbabilities will have to be met before the benevolence of the commissioner can be made to prevail the reductions made on the rent average something between twenty and twentyfive per cent let us take them at twenty if a tenant has to be evicted for a demand of £10 will he be able to live in comfort if he pay only £8 shall one tenant live in comfort on a farm the rent of which has been reduced him from £100 to £80 and another the reduction having been from £20 to £16 in either case if a tenant shall do well with two children how shall he do with six or eight a true teetotaller can certainly pay double the rent which may be extracted from a man who drinks shall the normal tenant earn wages beyond what he gets from the land under his own tillage shall the idle man be made equal to the industriousor can this be done or should it be done by any philanthropy statesmen sitting together in a cabinet may resolve that they will set the world right by eloquence and benevolence combined but the practices to which the world have been brought by long experience will avail more than eloquence and benevolence statesmen may decree that land shall be let at a certain rate and the decree will prevail for a time it may prevail long enough to put out of gear the present affairs of the irish world with which these statesmen will have tampered but the long experience will come back and bargains will again be made between man and man though the intervening injuries will be heartbreaking  but the benevolence of the government and its commissioners will not have gone far the land law of 1881 has as i now write been at work for twelve months and the results hitherto accomplished have been very small it may be doubted whether a single reluctant tenanta single tenant who would have been unwilling to leave his holdinghas been preserved from american exile by having his £10 or £20 or £30 of rent reduced to £8 or £16 or £24 the commissioners work slowly having all the skill of the lawyers on one side or the other against them it is piteous to see the hopelessness of three subcommissioners in the midst of a crowd of irish attorneys and the law as it exists at present can be made to act only on holdings possessed by tenants for one year and the skill of the lawyers is used in proving on the part of the landlords that the land is held by firm leases and cannot therefore be subjected to the law and then by proving on behalf of the tenants that the existing leases are illegal and should be broken the possession of a lease which used to be regarded as a safeguard and permanent blessing to the tenant is now held to be cruelly detrimental to him as preventing the lowering of his rent and the immediate creation for him of a tenancy for ever it is not to be supposed that the subcommissioners can walk over the land and straightway reduce the rents though the lands would certainly be subject to such reduction did not the law interfere in a majority of casesa majority as far as all ireland is concerneda feeling of honesty does prevail between landlord and tenant which makes them both willing to subject themselves to the new law without the interference of attorneys and many are preparing themselves for such an arrangement the landlord is willing to lose twenty per cent in fear of something worse and the tenant is willing to take it hardly daring to hope for anything better such is the best condition which the law has ventured to anticipate but in either case this is to be done as tempering the wind to the shorn lamb the landlord is anxious if possible to save for himself and those who may come after him something of the reality of his property and the tenant feels that though something of the nobility of property has been promised to him by the landleaguers he may after all make the best bargain by so far submitting himself to his shorn landlord  but on estates where the commissioners are allowed their full swing the whole nature of the property in the land will be altered the present tenant paying a tax of £8 per annum which will be subjected to no reduction and on which no abatement can be made in lieu of a £10 rent will be the owner the small man will be infinitely more subject to disturbance than at present because the tax must be paid the landlord will feel no mercy for him seeing that the bonds between them which demanded mercy have been abrogated the extra £2 or £4 or £6 will not enable the tenant to live the life of ease which he will have promised himself if his interest has been made to be worth anythingand it will be worth something seeing that it has been worth something and is saleable under its present conditionit will be sold and the emigration will continue there are cruel cases at present there will be cases not less cruel under the régime which the new law is expected to produce but the new law will be felt to have been unjust as having tampered with the rights of property and having demanded from the owners of property its sale or other terms than those of mutual contract  but the time selected for the measure was most inappropriate if good in itself it was bad at the time it was passed home rule coming across to us from america had taken the guise of rebellion i have met gentlemen who as homerulers have simply desired to obtain for their country an increase of power in the management of their own affairs these men have been loyal and patriotic and it might perhaps be well to meet their views the channel no doubt does make a difference between liverpool and dublin but the latterday homerulers of whom i speak brought their politics their aspirations and their money from new york and boldly made use of the means which the british constitution afforded them to upset the british constitution as established in ireland that they should not succeed in doing this is the determination of all at any rate on this side of the channel it is still i believe the desire of most thinking men on the irish side but parliamentary votes are not given only to thinking men and consequently a body of members has appeared in the house energetic and now well trained who have resolved by the clamour of their voices to put an end to the british power of governing the country these members are but a minority among those whom ireland sends to parliament but they have learned what a minority can effect by unbridled audacity england is still writhing in her attempt to invent some mode of controlling them but long before any such mode had been adoptedhad been adopted or even plannedthe government in 1881 brought out their plan for securing to the tenants fair rents fixity of tenure and freedom of sale  as to the first it will of course be admitted by all men that rents should be fair as also should be the price at which a horse is sold it is however beyond the power of parliament to settle the terms which shall be fair caveat emptor is the only rule by which fair rents may be reached by fixity of tenure is meant such a holding of the land as shall enable the tenant to obtain an adequate return for his labour and his capital and to this is added a romantic and consequently a most unjust idea that it may be well to settle this question on behalf of the tenant by granting him such a term as shall leave no doubt let him have the land for ever as long as he will pay a stipulated sum which shall be considerably less than the landlords demand that idea i call romantic and therefore unjust but even though the beauty of the romance be held sufficient to atone for the injustice this was not the poetical rearrangement of all the circumstances of land tenure in ireland freedom of sale is necessarily annexed to fixity of tenure if a man is to have the possession of land in perpetuity surely he should be allowed to sell it whether he be allowed or not he will contrive to do so freedom of sale means i take it that the socalled landlord shall have no power of putting a veto on the transaction we cannot here go into the whole question as it existed in ulster before 1870 but the freedom of sale intended is such i think as i have defined it  whether these concessions be good or bad this was at any rate no time for granting them they seem to me to amount to wholesale confiscation but supposing me to be wrong in that can i be wrong in thinking that a period of declared rebellion is not a time for concessions when the land bill was passed the landleague was in full power boycotting had become the recognised weapon of an illegal association and the homerulers of the daythe party that is who represented the landleaguewere already in such possession of large portions of the country as to prevent the possibility of carrying out the laws  at this moment the government brought forward its romantic theory as to the manipulation of land and before that theory was at work commenced its benevolent intentions by locking up all those who were supposed to be guilty of an intention to carry out the government project further than the government would carry it out itself it is held as a rule in politics that coercion and concession cannot be applied together ireland was in mutiny under the guidance of a mutinous party in the house of commons and at that moment a commission was put in operation under which it was the intention of the government to transfer the soil of the country at a reduced price to the very men among whom the mutineers are to be found how do the tidings of such a commission operate upon the ears of irishmen at large he is told that under the fear of the landleague his rent is to be reduced to an extent which is left to his imagination and then that he is to be freed altogether from the incubus of a landlord he is in fact made to understand that his cherished landleague has become allpowerful and yet he hears that odious men whom he recognises only as tyrants are filling the jails through the country with all his dearest friends demanding concessions and the continued increase of them and having learned the way to seize upon them when they are not given he will not stand coercion abated rent soon becomes no rent when it is left to the payer of the rent to decide on which system he will act it is probable that the norent theory will prevail  so it was in 1882 tenants were harassed by needy landlords and when they were served with forms of ejectment the landlords were simply murdered either in their own persons or in that of their servants men finding their power and beginning to learn how much might be exacted from a yielding government hardly knew how to moderate their aspirations when they found that the expected results did not come at once they resorted to revenge why should these tyrants keep them out from the good things which their american friends had promised them and which were so close within their grasp and their anger turned not only against their landlords but against those who might seem in any way to be fighting on the landlords side did a neighbour occupy a field from which a landleaguing tenant had been evicted let the tails of that neighbours cattle be cut off or the legs broken of his beasts of burden or his sheep have their throats cut or if the injured one have some scruples of conscience let the oppressor simply be boycotted and put out of all intercourse with his brother men let no wellintentioned landleaguing neighbour buy from him a ton of hay or sell to him a loaf of bread  but as a last resource if all others fail let the sinner be murdered we all know alas in how many cases the sentence has been pronounced and the judgment given and the punishment executed  such have been the results of the land law passed in 1881 and under the curse so engendered the country is now labouring it cannot be denied that the promoters of the land laws are weak and that the disciples of the landleague are strong in order that the truth of this may be seen and made apparent the present story is told     chapter xlii  lord castlewells farewell   poor mr omahony had enemies on every side there had come up lately a state of things which must be very common in political life the hatreds which sound so real when you read the mere words which look so true when you see their scornful attitudes on which for the time you are inclined to pin your faith so implicitly amount to nothing the right honourable a has to do business with the honourable b and can best carry it on by loud expressions and strong arguments such as will be palatable to readers of newspapers but they do not hate each other as the readers of the papers hate them and are ready enough to come to terms if coming to terms is required each of them respects the other though each of them is very careful to hide his respect we can fancy that the right honourable a and the honourable b in their moments of confidential intercourse laugh in their joint sleeves at the antipathies of the public in the present instance it was alleged that the right honourable a and the honourable b had come to some truce together and had ceased for a while to hit each other hard knocks such a truce was supposed to be a feather in the cap of the honourable b as he was leader of a poor party of no more than twenty and the right honourable a had in this matter the whole house at his back but for the nonce each had come off his high horse and for the moment there was peace between them  but mr omahony would have no peace he understood nothing of compromises he really believed that the right honourable gentleman was the fiend which the others had only called him to him it was a compact with the very devil now the leader of his party knowing better what he was about and understanding somewhat of the manner in which politics are at present carried on felt himself embarrassed by the honesty of such a follower as mr omahony mr omahony when he was asked whether he wished to lead or was willing to serve declared that he would neither lead nor serve what he wanted was the good of ireland and he was sure that that was not to be obtained by friendship with her majestys government this was in itself very well but he was soon informed that it was not as a freelance that he had been elected member for cavan that is between me and my constituency said mr omahony standing up with his head thrown back and his right hand on his heart but the constituency soon gave him to understand that he was not the man they had taken him to be  he too had begun to find that to spend his daughters money in acting patriotism in the house of commons was not a fine rôle in life he earned nothing and he did nothing unless he could bind himself hand and foot to his party he had not even a spark of delegated power he was not allowed to speak when he desired and was called upon to sit upon those weary benches hour after hour and night after night only pretending to effect those things which he and his brother members knew could not be done he was not allowed to be wrathful with true indignation not for a moment but he was expected to be there from question time through the long watches of the nighttaking indeed his turn for rest and foodalways ready with some mock indignation by which his very soul was fretted and no one paid him the slightest respect though he was indeed by no means the least respectable of his party he would have done true work had it been given him to do but at the present moment his own party did not believe in him there was no need at present for independent wrathful eloquence there seldom is need in the house of commons for independent eloquence the few men who have acquired for themselves at last the power of expressing it not to empty benches not amidst coughings and hootings and loud conversation have had to make their way to that point either by long efficient service or by great gifts of pachydermatousness mr omahony had never served anyone for an hour and was as thinskinned as a young girl and though his daughter had handed him all her money so that he might draw upon it as he pleased he told himself and told her also that his doing so was mean youre welcome to every dollar father only it doesnt seem to make you happy  i should be happy to starve for the country if starving would do anything  i dont see that one ever does any good by starving as long as there is bread to eat this isnt a romantic sort of thing this payment of rents but we ought to try and find out what a man really owes  no man owes a cent to any landlord on behalf of rent  but how is a man to get the land she said over in our country a rough pioneering fellow goes and buys it and then he sells it and of course the man who buys it hasnt to pay rent but i cannot see how any fellow here can have a right to the land for nothing then mr omahony reminded his daughter that she was ill and should not exert herself  it was now far advanced in may and mr omahony had resolved to make one crushing eloquent speech in the house of commons and then to retire to the united states but he had already learned that even this could not be effected without the overcoming of many difficulties in himself in his eloquence in the supply of words he trusted altogether but there was the opportunity to be bought and the speakers eye to be foundhe regarded this speakers eye as the most false of all luminariesand the empty benches to be encountered and then drowsy reporters to be stirred up and then on the next morningif any next morning should come for such a reportthere would not be a tithe of what he had spoken to be read by any man and in truth very little of what he could speak would be worthy of reading his words would be honest and indignant and finesounding but the hearer would be sure to say what a fool is that mr omahony at any rate he understood so much of all this that he was determined to accept the chiltern hundreds and flee away as soon as his speech should be made  it was far advanced in may and poor rachel was still very ill she was so ill that all hope had abandoned her either as to her profession or as to either of her lovers but there was some spirit in her still as when she would discuss with her father her future projects let me go back she said and sing little songs for children in that milder climate the climate is mild down in the south and there i may perhaps find some fragment of my voice but he who was becoming so despondent both for himself and for his country still had hopes as to his daughter her engagement with lord castlewell was not even yet broken lord castlewell had gone out of town at a most unusual periodat a time when the theatres always knew him and had been away on the exact day which had been fixed for their marriage rachel had done all that lay in herself to disturb the marriage but lord castlewell had held to it urged by feelings which he had found it difficult to analyse rachel had in her sickness determined to have done with him altogether but latterly she had had no communication with him she had spoken of him to her father as though he were a being simply to be forgotten he has gone away and as far as he is concerned there is an end of me it could not have finished better but her mind still referred to frank jones and from him she had received hardly a word of love further words of love she could not send him during her illness many letters or little notes rather had been written to castle morony on her behalf by her father and to these there had come replies frank was so anxious to hear of her welldoing frank had not cared so much for her voice as for her general health frank was so sorry to hear of her weakness it had all been read to her but as it had been read she had only shaken her head and her father had not carried the dream on any further to his thinking she was still engaged to the lord and it would be better for her that she should marry the lord the lord no doubt was a fool and filled the most foolish place in the worldthat of a silly fainéant earl but he would do no harm to his daughter and the girl would learn to like the kind of life which would be hers at present she was very very ill but still there was hope for recovery  by the treasury of the theatre she had been treated munificently her engagement had been almost up to the day fixed for her marriage and the money which would have become due to her under it had been paid in full she had sent back the latter payments but they had been returned to her with the affectionate respects of the managers since she had put her foot upon these boards she had found herself to be popular with all around her that she had told herself had been due to the lord who was to become her husband but rachel had become and was likely to become the means of earning money for them and they were grateful to tell the truth lord castlewell had had nothing to do with it  but gradually there came upon them the conviction that her voice was gone and then the payment of the money ceased she and the doctor and her father had discussed it together and they had agreed to settle that it must be so  yes said the girl smiling it is bitter all my hopes and such hopes it is as though i were dead and yet were left alive if it had been smallpox or anything in that way i could have borne it but this thing this terrible misfortune  then she laughed and then burst out sobbing with loud tears and hid her face  you will be married and still be happy said the doctor  married rubbish so much you know about it am i ever to get strong in my limbs again so as to be able to cross the water and go back to my own country  here the doctor assured her that she would be able to go back to her own country if it were needed  father she said as soon as the doctor had left her let there be an end to all this about lord castlewell i will not marry him  but my dear  i will not marry him there are two reasons why i should not i do not love him and he does not love me there are two other reasons i do not want to marry him and he does not want to marry me  but he says he does  that is his goodness he is very good i do not know why a man should be so good who has had so bad a bringing up think of mehow good i ought to be as compared with him i havent done anything naughty in all my life worse than tear my frock or scold poor frank and yet i find it harder to give him up merely because of the grandeur than he does to marry me the poor singing girl who can never sing again no my good looks are gone such as they were i can feel it even with my fingers you had better take me back to the states at once  goodbye rachel said the lord coming into her room the day but one after this her father was not with her as she had elected to be alone when she would bid her adieu to her intended husband  this is very good of you to come to me  of course i came  because you were good you need not have come unless you had wished it i had so spoken to you as to justify you in staying away my voice is gone and i can only squeak at you in this broken treble  your voice would not have mattered at all  ah but it has mattered to me what made you want to marry me  your beauty quite as much as your voice said the lord  and that has gone too everything i had has gone it is melancholy no my lord she said interrupting him when he attempted to contradict her there is not a word more to be said about it voice and beauty such as it was and the little wit are all gone i did believe in my voice myself and therefore i felt myself fitting to marry you i could have left a name behind me if my voice had remained but in truth my lord it was not fitting i did not love you  that indeed  as far as i know myself i did not love you you have heard me speak of frank jonesa man who can only wear two clean shirts a week because he has been so boycotted by those wretched irish as to be able to afford no more i would take him with one shirt tomorrow if i could get him one does not know why one loves a person of course hes handsome and strong and brave i dont think that has done it but i just got the fancy into my head and there it is still and he with his two shirts working every day himself with his own hands to earn something for his father would not marry me because i was a singing girl and took wages he would not have another shirt to be washed with my money oh that the chance were given to me to go and wash it for him with my own hands  lord castlewell sat through the interview somewhat distraught as well he might be but when it was over and he had taken his leave and kissed her forehead as he went home in his cab he told himself that he had got through that little adventure very well     chapter xliii  mr moss is finally answered   some days after the scene last recorded rachel was sitting in her bedroom partly dressed but she was as she was wont to declare to her father as weak as a cat with only one life she had in the morning gone through a good deal of work she had in the first place counted her money she had something over £600 at the bank and she had always supplied her father with what he had wanted she had told her future husband that she must sing one month in the year so as to earn what would be necessary for the support of the member of parliament and singularly enough her father had yielded but now the six hundred and odd pounds was all that was left to take them both back to the united states i think i shall be able to lecture there mr omahony had said wait till i express my opinion about queens and lords and the speaker i think i shall be able to say a word or two about the speakerand the chairman of committees a poor little creature who can hardly say bo to a goose unless he had got all the men to back him i dont want to abuse the queen because i believe she does her work like a lady but if i dont lay it on hot on the speaker of the british house of commons my name is not gerald omahony  you forget your old enemy the secretary  him we used to call buckshot im not so sure about him at any rate he has had a downfall when a mans had a downfall i dont care about lecturing against him but i dont think it probable that the speaker will have a downfall and then i can have my fling  rachel had dismissed her brougham and she had written to edith jones that no doubt had been the greatest effort of the morning we need not give here the body of her letter but it may be understood that she simply declared at length the nature of the prospect before her there was not a word of frank jones in it she had done that before and frank jones had not responded she intended to go with her father direct from liverpool to new york and her letter was full chiefly of affectionate farewells to edith and to ada and to their father there were a thousand written kisses sent but there was not a kiss for frank there was not a word for frank so that any reader of the letter knowing there was a frank in the family would have missed the mention of him and asked why it was so it was very very bitter to poor rachel this writing to morony castle without an allusion to the man but as she had said he had been right not to come and live on her wages and he certainly was right not to say a word as to their loss when neither of them had wages on which to live it would have suited in the united states but she knew that it would not suit here in the old country and therefore when the letter was written she was sitting wornout jaded and unhappy in her own bedroom  the lodging was still in cecil street from which spot she and her father had determined not to move themselves till after the marriage and had now resolved to remain there till rachel should be well enough for her journey to new york as she sat there the servant whom in her later richer days she had taken to herself came to her and announced a visitor mr moss was in the sittingroom mr moss here the girl declared that he was in the sittingroom and in answer to further inquiries alleged that he was alone how he had got there the girl could not say probably somebody had received a small bribe mr omahony was not innor was anybody in rachel told the girl to be ready when she was ready to accompany her into the parlour and thus resolving that she would see mr moss she sent him a message to this effect then she went to work and perfected her dressing very slowly  when she had completed the work she altered her purpose and determined that she would see mr moss alone you be in the little room close at hand she said and have the door ajar so that you can come to me if i call i have no reason to suspect this man and yet i do suspect him so saying she put on her best manners as it might be those she had learned from the earl when he was to be her husband and walked into the room she had often told herself since the old days as she had now told the maid that no real ground for suspicion existed and yet she knew that she did suspect the man  rachel was pale and wan and moved very slowly as though with haughty gesture mr moss no doubt had reason for knowing that the marriage with lord castlewell was at an end the story had been told about among the theatres lord castlewell did not mean to marry miss omahony or else the other and stranger story miss omahony did not mean to marry lord castlewell though few believed that story it was often told theatrical people generally told it to one another as a poetical tale the young lady had lost her voice and her beauty the young lady was looking very old and could never sing again it was absolutely impossible that in such circumstances she should decline to marry the lord if he were willing but it was more than probable that he should decline to marry her the theatrical world had been much astonished by lord castlewells folly and now rejoiced generally over his escape but that he should still want to marry the young lady and that she should refusethat was quite impossible  but mr moss was somewhat different from the theatrical world in general he kept himself to himself and kept his opinion very much in the dark madame socani spoke to him often about rachel and expressed her loud opinion that lord castlewell had never been in earnest and she was of opinion that rachels voice had never had any staying property madame socani had once belittled rachels voice and now her triumph was very great in answer to all this mr moss almost said nothing once he did turn round and curse the woman violently but that was all then when the news had he thought been made certain either in one direction or the other he came and called on the young lady  well mr moss said the young lady with a smile that was intended to be most contemptible and gracious  i have been so extremely sorry to hear of your illness my dear young lady  her grandeur departed from her all at once to be called this mans dear young lady was insufferable and grandeur did not come easily to her though wit and sarcasm did  your dear young lady as you please to call her has had a bad time of it  in memory of the old days i called you so miss omahony you and i used to be thrown much together  you and i will never be thrown together again as my singing is all over  it may be so and it may not  it is over at any rate as far as the london theatres goas far as you and i go  i hope not  i tell you it is i am going back to new york at once and do not think i shall sing another note as long as i live im going to learn to cook dishes for papa and we mean to settle down together  i hope not he repeated  very well but at any rate i must say goodbye to you i am very weak and cannot do much in the talking line  then she got up and stood before him as though determined to wish him goodbye she was in truth weak but she was minded to stand there till he should have gone  my dear miss omahony if you would sit down for a moment i have a proposition to make to you i think that it is one to which you may be induced to listen  then she did sit down knowing that she would want the strength which rest would give her the conversation with mr moss might probably be prolonged he also sat down at a little distance and held his shining new hat dangling between his knees it was part of her quarrel with him that he had always on a new hat  your marriage with lord castlewell i believe is off  just so  and also your marriage with mr jones  no doubt all my marriages are off i dont mean to be married at all i tell you im going home to keep house for my father  keep house for me said mr moss  i would rather keep house for the devil said rachel rising from her chair in wrath  vyvymr moss was reduced by his eagerness and enthusiasm to his primitive mode of speakingvat is it that you shall want of a man but that he shall love you truly i come here ready to marry you and to take my chance in all things you say your voice is gone i am here ready to take the risk lord castlewell will not have you but i will take you now he had risen from his chair and was standing close to her but she was so surprised at his manner and at his words that she did not answer him at all that lord cared for you not at all but i care that mr jones who was to have been your husband he is gone but i am not gone mr jones then he threw into his voice a tone of insufferable contempt  this rachel could not stand  you shall not talk to me about mr jones  i talk to you as a man who means vat he is saying i will marry you tomorrow  i would sooner throw myself into that river she said pointing down to the thames  you have nothing if i understand rightnothing you have had a run for a few months and have spent all your money i have got £10000 you have lost your voicei have got mine you have no theatrei have one of my own i am ready to take a house and furnish it just as you please you are living here in these poor wretched lodgings why do i do that and he put up both his hands  you never will do it said rachel  because i love you then he threw away his new hat and fell on his knees before her i will risk it allbecause i love you if your voice comes backwell if it do not come back you will be my wife and i shall do my best to keep you like a lady  here rachel leant back in her chair and shut her eyes in truth she was weak and was hardly able to carry on the battle after her old fashion and she had to bethink herself whether the man was making this offer in true faith if so there was something noble in it and though she still hated the man as a woman may hate her lover she would in such case be bound not to insult him more than she could help a softer feeling than usual came upon her and she felt that he would be sufficiently punished if she could turn him instantly out of the room she did not now feel disposed to stick a knife into him as she had told her father when describing mr moss but he was at her knees and the whole thing was abominable  rachel say the word and be mine at once  you do not understand how i hate you she exclaimed  rachel come to my arms  then he got up as though to clasp the girl in his embrace she ran from him and immediately called the girl whom she had desired to remain in the next room with the door open but the door was not open and the girl though she was in the room did not answer probably the bribe which mr moss had given was to her feeling rather larger than ordinary  my darling my charmer my own one come to my arms  and he did succeed in getting his hand round on to rachels waist and getting his lips close to her head she did save her face so that mr moss could not kiss her but she was knocked into a heap by his violence and by her own weakness he still had hold of her as she rose to her feet and though he had become acquainted with her weapon before he certainly did not fear it now a sick woman who had just come from her bed was not likely to have a dagger with her when she got up she was still more in his power she was astray scrambling here and there so as to be forced to guard against her own awkwardness whatever may be the position in which a woman may find herself whatever battle she may have to carry on she has first to protect herself from unseemly attitudes before she could do anything she had first to stand upon her legs and gather her dress around her  my own one my life come to me he exclaimed again attempting to get her into his embrace  but he had the knife stuck into him she had known that he would do it and now he had done it  you fool you she said it has been your own doing  he fell on the sofa and clasped his side where the weapon had struck him she rang the bell violently and when the girl came desired her to go at once for a surgeon then she fainted  i never was such a fool as to faint before she told frank afterwards i never counted on fainting if a girl faints of course she loses all her chance it was because i was ill but poor mr moss had the worst of it  rachel from the moment in which she fainted never saw mr moss any more madame socani came to visit her and told her father when she failed to see her that mr moss had only three days to live rachel was again in bed and could only lift up her hands in despair but to her father and to frank jones she spoke with something like good humour  i knew it would come she said to her father there was something about his eye which told me that an attempt would be made he would not believe of a woman that she could have a will of her own by treating her like an animal he thought he would have his own way i dont imagine he will treat me in that way again and then she spoke of him to frank i suppose he does like me  he likes your singingat so much a month  thats all done now at any rate he cannot but know that it is an extreme chance he must fancy that he really likes me a man has to be forgiven a good deal for that but a man must be made to understand that if a woman wont have him she wont i think mr moss understands it now     chapter xliv  frank jones comes back again   these last words had been spoken after the coming of frank jones but something has to be said of the manner of his coming and of the reasons which brought him and something also which occurred before he came it could not be that mr moss should be wounded after so desperate a fashion and that not a word should be said about it  of what happened at the time of the wounding rachel knew nothing she had been very brave and high in courage till the thing was done but as soon as it was done she sent for the servant and fainted away she knew nothing of what had occurred till she had been removed out of the room on one side and he on the other she did not hear therefore of the suggestion made by mr moss that some vital part of him had been reached  he did bleed profusely but under the aid of the doctor and mr omahony who was soon on the scene he recovered himself more quickly than poor rachel who was indeed somewhat neglected till the hero of the tragedy had been sent away he behaved with sufficient courage at last though he had begun by declaring that his days were numbered at any rate he had said when he found the power of ordinary speech dont let a word be whispered about it to miss omahony she isnt like other people then he was taken back to his private lodging and confided to the care of madame socani where we will for the present leave him soon after the occurrencea day or two after itfrank jones appeared suddenly on the scene of course it appeared that he had come to mourn the probable death of mr moss but he had in truth heard nothing of the fatal encounter till he had arrived in cecil street and then could hardly make out what had occurred amidst the confused utterances  frank jones she exclaimed father what has brought him here and she blushed up over her face and head to the very roots of her hair come up of course he must come up when a man has come all the way from castle morony he must be allowed to come up why should you wish to keep him down in the area then frank jones soon made his appearance within the chamber  it was midsummer and rachel occupied a room in the lowest house in the street looking right away upon the river and her easychair had been brought up to the window at which she sat and looked out on the tide of river life as it flowed by she was covered at present with a dressing gown as sweet and fresh as the morning air on her head she wore a small net of the finest golden filigree and her tiny feet were thrust into a pair of bright blue slippers bordered with swansdown am i to come back her obedient father had asked but he had been told not to come back not quite at present it is not that i want your absence she had said but he may he can tell me with less hesitation that he is going to set up a pigkilling establishment in south australia than he could probably you and me together so the father simply slapped him on the back and bade him walk upstairs till he would find no 15 on the second landing of course you have heard he said as frank was going of what she has been and done to mahomet m moss  not a word said frank what has she done  plunged a dagger into him said mr omahonyin a manner which showed to frank that he was not much afraid of the consequences of the accident you go up and no doubt she will tell you all about it then frank went up and was soon admitted into rachels room  oh frank she said how are you what on earth has brought you here then he at once began to ask questions about poor moss and rachel of course to answer them well yes how was i to help it i told him from the time that i was a little girl long before i knew you that something of this kind would occur if he would not behave himself  and he didnt asked frank with some little pardonable curiosity  no he did not whether he wanted me or my voice thinking that it would come back again i cannot tell but he did want something there was a woman who brought messages from him and even she wanted something then his ideas ran higher  he meant to marry you said frank  i suppose he didat last i am very much obliged to him but it did not suit thento make a short story of it frank i will tell you the whole truth he took hold of me i cannot bear to be taken hold of you know that yourself  he could only remember how often he had sat with her down among the willows at the lake side with his arm round her waist and she had never seemed to be impatient under the operation  and though he has such a beautiful shiny hat he is horribly awkward he nearly knocked me down and fell on me by way of embracing me  frank thought that he had never been driven to such straits as that  to be knocked down and trampled on by a beast like that there are circumstances in which a girl must protect herself when other circumstances have brought her into danger in those daysyesterday that is or a week agoi was a poor singing girl i was at every mans disposal and had to look after myself there are so many white bears about ready to eat you if you do not look after yourself he tried to eat me and he was wounded you do not blame me frank  no indeed not for that  what do you blame me for  i cannot think you right he answered with almost majestic sternness to have accepted the offer of lord castlewell  you blame me for that  he nodded his head at her  what would you have had me do  marry a man when you love him but not when you dont  oh frank i couldnt how was i to marry a man when i loved himi who had been so treated but sir she said remembering herself you have no right to say i did not love lord castlewell you have no business to inquire into that matter nobody blames you or can or shall in that affairnot in my hearing you behaved as gentlemen do behave gentlemen who cannot act otherwise because it is born in their bones and their flesh ii have not behaved quite so well open confession is good for the soul frank i have not behaved quite so well you may inquire about it i did not love lord castlewell and i told him so he came to me when my singing was all gone and generously renewed his offer had i not known that in his heart of hearts he did not wish itthat the two things were gone for which he had wooed memy voice which was grand and my prettiness which was but a little thing i should have taken his second offer because it would be well to let him have what he wanted it was not so and therefore i sent him away well pleased  but why did you accept him  oh frank do not be too hard how am i to tell youyou of all men what my reasons were i was alone in the world alone with such dangers before me as that which mr moss brought with him and then my profession had become a reality and this lord would assist me do all the girls refuse the lords who come and ask them  then he stood close over her and shook his head  but i should have done so she continued after a pause i recognise it now and let there be an end of it there is a something which does make a woman unfit for matrimony and the tears coursed themselves down her wan cheeks now it has all been said that need be said and let there be an end of it i have talked too much about myself what has brought you to london  just a young woman he whispered slowly  a pang shot through her heart and yet not quite a pang for with it there was a rush of joy which was not however perfect joy because she felt that it must be disappointed  bother your young woman she said who cares for your young woman how are you going on in galway  sadly enough to tell the truth  no rents  he shook his head  nothing but murders and floods  the same damnable old story running on from day to day  and have the girls no servants yet  not a servant except old peter who is not quite as faithful as he should be  andand what about that valiant gay young gentleman captain clayton  everything goes amiss in love as well as war said frank between the three of them i hardly know what they want  i think i know  very likely everything goes so astray with all of us so that the wanting it is sufficient reason for not getting it  is that all you have come to tell me  i suppose it is  then you might have stayed away  i may as well go perhaps  go no i am not so full of new friends that i can afford to throw away my old like that of course you may not go as you call it do you suppose i do not care to hear about those girls whom i lovepretty nearly with all my heart why dont you tell me about them and your father you come here but you talk of nothing but going you aint half nice  can i come in yet this belonged to a voice behind the door which was the property of mr omahony  not quite yet father mr jones is telling me about them all at morony castle  i should have thought i might have heard that said mr omahony  the girls have special messages to send said rachel  ill come back in another ten minutes said mr omahony i shall not wait longer than that  only their love said frank upon which rachel looked as though she thought that frank jones was certainly an ass  of course i want to hear their love said rachel dear ada and dear edith why dont you tell me their love  my poor sick girl he said laying his hand upon her shoulder and looking into her eyes  never mind my sickness i know i am as thin and as wan as an ogre nevertheless i care for their love  rachel do you care for mine  i havent got it oh frank why dont you speak to me you have spoken a word just a word and all the blood is coming back to my veins already  dearest dearest dearest rachel  now you have spoken now you have told me of your sisters and your father now i know it all now my father may come in  do you love me then  love you that question you know to be unnecessary love you why i spend every day and every night in loving you but frank you wouldnt have me when i was going to be rich i ought not to have you now that i am to be poor but by this time she was in his arms and he was kissing her till as she had said the blood was once again running in her veins oh frank what a tyrant you are did i not tell you to let poor father come into the room you have said everything now there cannot be another word to say frank frank frank i have found it out at last i cannot live without you  but how are you to live with me there is no money  bother money wealth is sordid washing stockings over a tub is the only life for meso long as i have you to come back to me  and your health  i tell you it is done i was merely sick of the jones complaint oh heavens how i can hate people and how i can love them then she threw herself on the sofa absolutely worn out by the violence of her emotions  mr omahony was commissioned and sat down by his girls side to comfort her but she wanted no comforting so you and frank have made it up have you said mr omahony  we have never quarrelled so far as i am concerned said frank the moment i heard lord castlewell was dismissed i came back  yes said she raising herself half up on the sofa do you know his story father it is rather a nice story for a girl to hear of her own lover and to feel that it is true when i was about to make i dont know how many thousand dollars a year by my singing he would not come and take his share of it then i have to think of my own disgrace but it enhances his glory because he was gone i brought myself to accept this lord  now rachel you shall not exert yourself said frank  i will sir she replied holding him by the hand i will tell my story he had retreated from the stain and the lord had come in his place but he was here always and she pressed his hand to her side he could not be got rid of then i lost my voice and was utterly dished as the theatrical people say then the lord wentbehaving better than i did howeverand i was alone oh what bitter moments there came thenlong enough for the post to go to ireland and to return and now he is here once more at my feet again old man once more and then he talks to me of money what is money to me i have got such a comforting portion that i care not at all for money then she all but fainted once again and frank and her father both knelt over her caressing her  it was a long time before frank left her her father going in and out of the room as it pleased him the while then he declared that he must go down to the house assuring frank that one blackguard there was worse than another but saying that he would see them to the end as long as his time lasted rachel insisted that frank should go with him  i am just getting up from my deathbed she said laughing and you want me to go on like any other mans young woman i can think about you without talking to you and so saying she dismissed him  on the next morning when he came again she discussed with him the future arrangement of his life and hers  of course you must stay with your father she said you do not want to marry me at once i suppose and of course it is impossible if you do i shall go to the states with father as soon as this parliament affair is over he is turned out of the house so often that he will be off before long for good and all but there is the mail still running and remember that what i say is true i shall be ready and willing to be made mrs frank jones as soon as you will come and fetch me and will tell me that you are able to provide me just with a crust and a blanket in county galway whatever little you will do with i will do with less  then she sat upon his knee and embraced him and kissed him and swore to him that no other lord castlewell who came should interfere with his rights  and as for mr moss she added i do not think that he will ever appear again to trouble your little game     chapter xlv  mr robert morris   one morning a little later in the summer about the beginning of august all galway were terrified by the tidings of another murder mr morris had been killedhad been dropped as the language of the country now went from behind a wall built by the roadside it had been done at about five in the afternoon in full daylight and as was surmised by the police with the consciousness of many of the peasantry around he had been walking along the road from cong to his own house and had been dropped and left for dead by the roadside dead indeed he was when found not a word more would have been said about it but for the intervention of the police who were on the spot within three hours of the occurrence a little girl had been coming into cong and had told the news the little girl was living at cong and was supposed to be in no way connected with the murder  its some of them boys this side of clonbur said one of the men of cong  no one thought it necessary after that to give any further explanation of the circumstances  mr robert morris was somewhat of an oddity in his way but he was a man who only a few months since was most unlikely to have fallen a victim to popular anger he was about forty years of age and had lived altogether at minas cottage five or six miles from cong as you pass up the head of lough corrib on the road to maum he was unmarried and lived quite alone in a small house trusting to the attentions of two old domestics and their daughter he kept a horse and a car and a couple of cows and a few cocks and hens but otherwise he lived alone he was a man of property and had indeed come from a family very long established in the county people said of him that he had £500 a year but he would have been very glad to have seen the half of it paid to his agent for mr morris of minas cottage had his agent as well as any other gentleman he was a magistrate for the two counties galway and mayo and attended sessions both at cong and at clonbur but when there he did little but agree with some more active magistrate and what else he did with himself no one could tell of him  but it was said in respect to him that he was a benevolent gentleman and but a year or two since very many in the neighbourhood would have declared him to be especially the poor mans friend with £500 a year he could have done much with half that income he could do something to assist them and something he still did he had his foibles and fancies but such as they were they did not tread on the corns of any of his poorer neighbours he was proud of his birth proud of his family proud of having owned either in his own hands or those of his forefathers the same few acresand many more also for his forefathers before him had terribly diminished the property there was a story that his great great grandfather had lived in a palatial residence in county kilkenny all this he would tell freely and would remark that to such an extent had the family been reduced by the extravagance of his forefathers but the name and the blood they can never touch he would remark they would not ask as to his successor because they valued him too highly and because mr morris would never have admitted that the time had come when it was too late to bring a bride home to the western halls of his forefathers but the rumour went that minas cottage would go in the female line to a second cousin who had married a cloth merchant in galway city to whom nor to her husband did mr morris ever speak there might be something absurd in this but there was nothing injurious to his neighbours and nothing that would be likely to displease the poorer of them  but mr morris had been made the subject of various requests from his tenants they had long since wanted and had received a considerable abatement in their rent hence had come the straitened limits of £250 a year they had then offered the griffiths valuation to explain the griffiths valuation a chapter must be written and as no one would read the explanation if given here it shall be withheld indeed the whole circumstances of mr morriss property were too intricate to require or to admit elucidation here he was so driven that if he were to keep anything for himself he must do so by means of the sheriffs officer and hence it had come to pass that he had been shot down like a mad dog by the roadside  county galway was tolerably well used to murders by this time but yet seemed to be specially astonished by the assassination of mr morris the innocence of the man for the dealings of the sheriffs officer were hardly known beyond the town land which was concerned and then the taciturnity of the county side when the murder had been effected it was not such a deed as was the slaughtering of poor florian jones or the killing of terry carroll in the court house they had been more startling more alarming more awful for the tradesmen and such like to talk of among themselves but the feeling of mystery there had been connected with the secret capacity of one individual everyone in fact knew that those murders had been done by lax and all felt that for the doing of murders lax was irrepressible but over there in the neighbourhood of clonbur or in the village of cong lax had never appeared there was no one in the place to whom the police could attribute any laxlike properties in that respect the slaughtering of mr morris had something in it more terrible even than those other murders it seemed as though murder were becoming the ordinary popular mode by which the people should redress themselvesas though the idea of murder had recommended itself easily to their intellects and then they had quietly submittedall of themto taciturnity they who were not concerned in the special case the adjustment that is of mr morriss rent accepted his murder with perfect quiescence as did those who were aggrieved nobody had seen anything nobody had heard anything nobody had known anything such were the only replies that were given to the police if mr morris then why not anotherand anothertill the whole country would be depopulated in mr morriss case a landlord had been chosen but in other localities agents and sheriffs officersand even those keepers on a property which a gentleman is supposed to employwere falling to the right and to the left but of mr morris and his death nothing was heard  yorke clayton of course went down there for this too was in his district and hunter went with him anxious if possible to learn something they saw every tenant on the property and indeed they were not over numerous there was not one as to whom they could obtain evidence that he was ever ferocious by character theyve got to think that they have the right to it all the poor creatures are not so bad as them that is teaching them if i think as the farm is my own of course i dont like to be made to pay rent for it that was the explanation of the circumstances as given by mrs davies of the hotel at clonbur and it was evident that she thought it to be sufficient the meaning of it according to captain claytons reading was this if you allow such doctrines to be preached abroad by members of parliament and landleague leadersto be preached as a doctrine fit for the peoplethen you cannot be surprised if the people do as they are taught and hold their tongues afterwards  this mr morris had been the first cousin of our poor old friend black tom daly  good god he exclaimed as soon as he read the news sitting in his parlour at dalys bridge there is bob morris gone now  bob morris of minas cottage exclaimed peter bodkin who had ridden over to give tom daly some comfort in his solitude if it might be possible  by george yes bob morris did you know him  i dont think he ever came out hunting  hunting indeed how should he when he hadnt a horse that he could ride upon and bob knew nothing of sport the better for him seeing the way that things are going now no he never was out hunting poor fellow but for downright innocence and kindness and gentleness of heart there is no one left like him and now they have murdered him what is to be the end of it there is persse telling me to hold on by the hounds when i couldnt keep a hound in the kennels at ahaseragh if it were ever so  times will mend said peter  and raheney gorse fired so as to drive every fox out of the country persse is wrong and i am wrong to stay at his bidding the very nature of mankind has altered in the old country there are not the same hearts within their bosoms to burn a gorse over a foxs head there is a damnable cruelty in it of which men were not guiltyby g they were not capablea year or two ago these ruffians from america have come and told them that they shall pay no rent and their minds have been so filled with the picture that its magnificence has overcome them they used to tell us that money is the root of all evil it proves to be true now the idea that they should pay no rent has been too much for them and they have become fiends under the feelings which have been roused only last year they were mourning over a poor fox like a christiana poor fox that had been caught in a trapand now they would not leave a fox in the country because the gentlemen they think are fond of them the gentlemen are their enemies and therefore they will spite them they will drive every gentleman out of the country and where will they be then here tom daly sat quiet for a while looking silent through the open window while peter sat by him feeling the occasion to be too solemn for speech after a while tom continued his ejaculations gladstone gladstone there are those who think that man to be great and good but how can he be great and good if he lets loose such spirits among us they tell me that hes a very amiable man in his own family and goes to church regular but he must be the most ignorant human being that ever took upon himself to make laws for a people he can understand nothing about money nothing about property nothing about rents i suppose he thinks it fair to take away one mans means and give them to another simply because one is a gentleman and the other not a fair rent theres nothing i hate so much in my very soul as the idea of a fair rent a fair rent means half that a man pays now but in a few years time it will mean again whatever the new landlord may choose to ask and fixity of tenure every man is to get what doesnt belong to him and if a man has anything hes to be turned out that is fixity of tenure and freedom of sale a man is to be allowed to sell what isnt his own he thinks that when he has thrown half an eye over a country he can improve it by altering all the wisdom of ages a man talks and talks and others listen to him till they flatter him that another god almighty has been sent upon earth it was thus that tom daly expressed himself as to the prime minister of the day but tom was a benighted tory and had thought nothing of these subjects till they were driven into his mind by the strange mortality of the foxes around him  poor mr morris was buried and there was an end of him the cloth merchants wife in galway got the property and as far as we can hear at present is not likely to do as well with it as her husband is with his bales of goods no man perhaps more insignificant than mr robert morris could have departed he did nothing and his figure as he walked about between cong and clonbur could be well spared but his murder had given rise to feelings through the country which were full of mischief and full of awe he had lived most inoffensively and yet he had gone simply because it had occurred to some poor ignorant tenant who had held perhaps ten or fifteen acres of land out of which he had lived upon the potatoes grown from two or three of them that things would go better with him if he had not a landlord to hurry him for rent then the tenant had turned in his mind the best means of putting his landlord out of the way and had told himself that it was an easy thing to do he had not of his own much capacity for the use of firearms but he had four pound ten which should have gone to the payment of his rent and of this four pound ten fifteen shillings secured the services of some handy man out of the next parish he had heard the question of murder freely discussed among his neighbours and by listening to others had learned the general opinion that there was no danger in it so he came to a decision and mr morris was murdered  so far the question was solved between this tenant and this landlord but each one of the neighbours as he thought of it felt himself bound to secrecy pro bono publico there was a certain comfort in this and poor bob morriss death seemed likely to be passed over with an easy freedom from suspicion any man might be got rid of silently and there need be no injurious results but men among themselves began to talk somewhat too freely and an awe grew among them as this man and that man were named as objectionable and the men so named were not all landlords or even agents this man was a sheriffs officer and that a gamekeeper the sheriffs officers and gamekeepers were not all murdered but they were named and a feeling of terror crept cold round the hearts of those who heard the names who was to be the keeper of the list and decide finally as to the victims then suddenly a man went and no one knew why he went he was making a fence between two fields and it was whispered that he had been cautioned not to make the fence at any rate he had been stoned to death and though there must have been three at least at the work no one knew who had stoned him men began to whisper among each other and women also and at last it was whispered to them that they had better not whisper at all then they began to feel that not only was secrecy to be exacted from them but they were not to be admitted to any participation in the secrecy  and with such of the gentry as were left there had grown up precautions which could not but fill the minds of the peasantry with a vague sense of fear they went about with rifle in their hands and were always accompanied by police they had thick shutters made to their windows and barred themselves within their houses those who but a few months since had been the natural friends of the people now appeared everywhere in arms against them if it was necessary that there should be intercourse between them that intercourse took place by means of a policeman a further attempt at murder had been made in the neighbourhood and was so talked of that it seemed that all kindly feeling had been severed men began to creep about and keep out of the way lest they should be suspected and indeed it was the fact that there was hardly an ablebodied man in three parishes to whom some suspicion did not attach itself  and thus the women would ask for fresh murders and would feel disappointed when none were reported to them craving as it were for blood and all this had come to pass certainly within the space of two years a sweetertempered people than had existed there had been found nowhere nor a people more ignorant and possessing less of the comforts of civilisation but no evil was to be expected from them no harm came from thembeyond a few simple lies which were only harmful as acting upon their own character as tom daly had said these very men were not capable of it a few months ago the tuition had come from america that no doubt was true but it had come by irish hearts and irish voices by irish longings and irish ambition nothing could be more false than to attribute the evil to america unless that becomes american which has once touched american soil but there does grow up in new york or thereabouts a mixture of irish poverty with american wealth which calls itself democrat and forms as bad a composition as any that i know from which either to replenish or to create a people  a very little of it goes unfortunately a long way it is like gin made of vitriol when mingled with water a small modicum of gin though it does not add much spirit to the water will damnably defile a large quantity and this gin has in it a something of flavour which will altogether deceive an uneducated palate there is an alcoholic afflatus which mounts to the brain and surrounds the heart and permeates the veins which for the moment is believed to be true gin but it makes itself known in the morning and after a few mornings tells its own tale too well these democrats could never do us the mischief they are not sufficient either in intellect or in number but there are men among us who have taught themselves to believe that the infuriated gin drinker is the true holder of a new gospel     chapter xlvi  cong   in those days captain clayton spent much of his time at cong and frank jones was often with him frank however had returned from london a much altered man rachel had knocked under to him it was thus that he spoke of it to himself i do not think that she spoke of it to herself exactly in the same way she knew her own constancy and felt that she was to be rewarded  nothing i think would ever have made me marry lord castlewell  it was thus she talked to her father while he was awaiting the period of his dismissal  i dare say not said he of course he is a poor weak creature but he would have been very good to you and there would have been an end to all your discomforts  rachel turned up her nose an end to all her discomforts  her father knew nothing of what would comfort her and what would discomfort  she was utterly discomforted in that her voice was gone from her she would lie and sob on her bed half the morning and would feel herself to be inconsolable then she would think of frank and tell herself that there was some consolation in store even for her had her voice been left to her she would have found it to be very difficult to escape from the castlewell difficulty she would have escaped she thought though the heavens might have been brought down over her head when the time had come for appearing at the altar she would have got into the first train and disappeared or have gone to bed and refused to leave it she would have summoned frank at the last moment and would submit to be called the worst behaved young woman that had ever appeared on the london boards now she was saved from that butbut at what a cost  i might have been the greatest woman of the day and now i must be content to make his tea and toast  then she began to consider whether it was good that any girl should be the greatest woman of the day  i dont suppose the queen has so much the best of it with a pack of troubles on her hands  but frank in the meantime had gone back to galway and mr robert morris had been murdered soon after the death of mr morris the man had been killed as he was mending the ditch and captain clayton found that the tone of the people was varied in the answers which they made to his inquiries they were astounded and as it were struck dumb with surprise nobody knew anything nobody had heard anything nobody had seen anything they were as much in the dark about poor pat gilligan as they had been as to mr robert morris they spoke of pat as though he had been slaughtered by a direct blow from heaven but they trembled and were evidently uncomfortable  that woman knows something about it said hunter to his master shaking his head  no doubt she knows a good deal about it but it is not because she knows that she is bewildered and bedevilled in her intellect she is beginning to be afraid that the country is one in which even she herself cannot live in safety  and the men looked to be dumbfoundered and sheepfaced they kept out of captain claytons way and answered him as little as possible whats the good of axing when ye knows that i knows nothing this was the answer of one man and was a fair sample of the answers of many but they were given in such a tone that clayton was beginning to think that the evil was about to work its own cure  frank he said one day when he was walking with his friend in the gloom of the evening this state of things is too horrible to endure the faithful hunter followed them and another policeman for the captain was never allowed to stir two steps without the accompaniment of a brace of guards  much too horrible to be endured said frank my idea is that a man in order to make the best of himself should run away from it life in the united states has no such horrors as these though were apt to say that all this comes from america i dont see american hands in it  you see american money  american money in the shape of dollar bills but they have all been sent by irish people the united states is a large place and there is room there i think for an honest man  ill never be frightened out of my own country said clayton nor do i think there is occasion these abominable reprobates are not going to prevail in the end  they have prevailed with poor tom daly he was a man who worked as hard as anyone to find amusementand employment too he never wronged anyone he was even so honest as to charge a fair price for his horses and there he is left high and dry without a horse or a hound that he can venture to keep about his own place and simply because the majority of the people have chosen that there shall be no more hunting and they have proved themselves to be able to have their own way it is impossible that poor daly should hunt if they will not permit him and they carry their orders so far that he cannot even keep a hound in his kennels because they do not choose to allow it  and this you think will be continued always asked clayton  for all that i can see it may go on for ever my father has had those water gates mended on the meadows though he could ill afford it i have told him that they may go again tomorrow there is no reason to judge that they should not do so the only two menor the man rather and the boywho have been punished for the last attempt were those who endeavoured to tell of it see what has come of that  all that is true  will it not be better to go to america to go to africa to go to asia or to russia even than to live in a country like this where the law can afford you no protection and where the lawgivers only injure you  i know nothing about the lawgivers said clayton but i have to say a word or two about the law do you think this kind of thing is going to remain  it does remain and every day becomes worse  an evil will always become worse till it begins to die away i think i see the end of things approaching evildoers are afraid of each other and these poor fellows here live in mortal agony lest some lax of the moment should be turned loose at their own throats i dont think that lax is an institution that will remain for ever in the country this present lax we have fast locked up law at present at any rate has so much of power that it is able to lock up a laxwhen it can catch him as for this present man i do hope that the law will find itself powerful enough to fasten a rope round his neck no galway jury would find him guilty and that is bad enough but the lawgivers have done this for us that we may try him before a dublin jury and there are hopes when lax has been well hung out of the world i can turn round and take a moment for my own happiness  yorke clayton as he said this was alluding to his love affair with edith jones he had now conquered all the family with one exception even the father had assented that it should be so though tardily and with sundry misgivings the one person was edith herself and it had come to be acknowledged by all around her that she loved yorke clayton as she herself never now denied it it was admitted on all sides at morony castle that the captain was certainly the favoured lover but edith still held out and had gone so far as to tell the captain that he could not be allowed to come to the castle unless he would desist  i never shall desist he had replied as to that you may take my word then edith had of course loved him so much the more  i dont think this kind of thing will go on he continued still addressing frank jones the people are so fickle that they cannot be constant even to anything evil it is quite on the cards that black tom daly should next year be the most popular master of hounds in all ireland and that mr kit mooney should not be allowed to show his face within reach of moytubber gorse on hunting mornings  theyd have burned the gorse before they have come round to that state of feeling look at raheeny  it isnt so easy to destroy anything said the philosophic clayton if the foxes are frightened out of raheeny or moytubber they will go somewhere else and even if poor tom daly were to run away from county galway as youre talking of doing the county would find another master  not like tom daly said frank jones enthusiastically  there are as good fish in the sea as ever were caught tom daly is a firstclass man i admit and he had no more obedient slave than myself when i used to get out hunting two or three days in the session but he is a desponding man and cannot look forward to better times for myself i own that my hopes are fixed hang lax and then the millennium  i will quite agree as to the hanging of lax said frank but for any millennium i want something more strong than irish feeling youll excuse me old fellow  oh certainly of course im an irishman myself and might have been a lax instead of a policeman if chance had got hold of me in time as it is ive a sort of feeling that the policeman is going to have the best of it all through ireland then there came a sudden sound as of a sharp thud and yorke clayton fell as it were dead at frank joness feet  this occurred at a corner of the road from which a little boreen or lane ran up the side of the mountain between walls about three feet high but here some benevolent enterprising gentleman wishing to bring water through lower lough cong to lough corrib had caused the beginnings of a canal to be built which had however after the expenditure of large sums of money come to nothing but the ground or rather rock had so been moved and excavated as to make it practicable for some men engaged as had been this man to drop at once out of sight hunter was at once upon his track with the other policeman both of whom fired at him but as they acknowledged afterwards they had barely seen the skirt of his coat in the gloom of the evening the whole spot up and behind the corner of the road was so honeycombed by the works of the intended canal as to afford hidingplaces and retreats for a score of murderers here as was afterwards ascertained there was but one and that one had apparently sufficed  frank jones had remained on the road with his friend and had raised him in his arms when he fell they have done for me this time clayton had said but had said no more he had in truth fainted but frank jones in his ignorance had thought that he was dead it turned out afterwards that the bullet had struck his ribs in the front of his body and having been turned by the bone had passed round to his back and had there buried itself in the flesh it needs not that we dwell with any length on this part of our tale but may say at once that the medical skill of cong sufficed to extract the bullet on the next morning  after a while one of the two policemen came back to the road and assisted frank jones in carrying up poor clayton to the inn hunter though still maimed by his wound stuck to the pursuit assisted by two other policemen from cong who soon appeared upon the scene but the man escaped and his flight was soon covered by the darkness of night it had been eight oclock before the party had left the inn and had wandered with great imprudence further than they had intended at least so it was said after the occurrence though had nothing happened they would have reached their homes before night had in truth set in but men said of clayton that he had become so hardened by the practices of his life and by the failure of all attempts hitherto made against him that he had become incredulous of harm  they have got me at last he said to frank the next morning thank god it was not you instead of me i have been thinking of it as i lay here in the night and have blamed myself greatly it is my business and not yours and then again further on in the day he sent a message to edith tell her from me that it is all over now but that had i lived she would have had to be my wife  but from that time forth he did in truth get better though we in these pages can never again be allowed to see him as an active working man it was his faultas the galway doctor said his egregious sinto spend the most of his time in lying on a couch out in the garden at morony castle and talking of the fate of mr lax the remainder of his hours he devoted to the acceptance of little sickroom favours from his hostessi would say from his two hostesses were it not that he soon came to terms with ada under which ada was not to attend to him with any particular care if i could catch that fellow he said to ada alluding to the man who had intended to murder him i would have no harm done to him he should be let free at once for i could not possibly have got such an opportunity by any other means  but poor edith the while felt herself to be badly used she and ada had often talked of the terrible perils to which yorke clayton was subjected and as the reader may remember had discussed the propriety of a man so situated allowing himself to become familiar with any girl but now captain clayton was declared to be safe by everybody the doctors united in saying that his constitution would carry him through a cannonball but edith felt that all the danger had fallen to her lot  in the meantime the search for the double murderersunless indeed one murderer had been busy in both caseswas carried vainly along the horror of poor mr morriss fate had almost disappeared under the awe occasioned by the attack on captain clayton it was astonishing to see how entirely mr morris with all his family and his old acres and with minas cottagewhich to the knowledge of the entire population of cong was his own peculiar propertywas lost to notice under the attack that had been made with so much audacity on captain yorke clayton he as one of four all armed to the teeth was attacked by one individual and attacked successfully there were those who said at first that the bars of galway jail must have been broken and that lax the omnipotent lax the omnipresent had escaped and it certainly was the case that many were in ignorance as to who the murderer had been probably all were ignorantall of those who were in truth well acquainted with the person of mr morris murderer and in the minds of the people generally the awe became greater than ever to them it was evident that anybody could murder anybody and evident also that it was permitted to them to do so by this new law which had sprung up of late in the country almost enjoining them to exercise this peculiar mode of retaliation the bravest thought that they were about to have their revenge against their old masters and determined that the revenge should be a bloody one but the more cowardly and very much the more numerous on that account feared that poor as they were they might be the victims no man among them could be much poorer than pat gilligan and he had been chosen as one to be murdered for some reason known only to the murderer  a new and terrible aristocracy was growing up among themthe aristocracy of hidden firearms there was but little said among them even by the husband to the wife or by the father to the son because the husband feared his wife and the father his own child there had been a feeling of old among them that they were being ground down by the old aristocracy there must ever be such an idea on the part of those who do not have enough to eat in regard to their betters who have more than plenty it cannot be but that want should engender such feeling but now the dread of the new aristocracy was becoming worse than that of the old in the dull dim minds of these poor people there arose gradually indeed but quickly a conviction that the new aristocracy might be worse even than the old and that law as administered by government might be less tyrannical than the law of those who had no law to govern them so the people sat silent at their hearths or crawled miserably about their potato patches speaking not at all of the life around them  when a week was over tidings came to them that captain clayton though he had been shot right through the bodythough the bullet had gone in at his breast and come out at his back as the report wentwas still alive and likely to live hes aspending every hour of his blessed life amaking love to a young lady who is anursing him this was the report brought up to cong by the steward of the lake steamer and was received as a new miracle by the cong people the fates had decreed that captain clayton should not fall by any bullet fired by lax the landleaguer for though lax the landleaguer was himself fast in prison when the attempt was made such became more than ever the creed of the people when it was understood that captain clayton with his own flesh and blood was at this moment making love to mr joness youngest daughter at morony castle     chapter xlvii  kerrycullion   captain clayton was thoroughly enjoying life now perhaps for the first time since he had had a bullet driven through his body it had come to pass that everything almost everything was done for him by the hands of edith and yet ada was willing to do everything that was required but she declared always that what she did was of no avail unless you take it to him you know he wont eat it she would still say no doubt this was absurd because the sick mans appetite was very good considering that a hole had been made from his front to his back within the last month it was still september the weather was as warm as summer and he insisted on lying out in the garden with his rugs around him and enjoying the service of all his slaves but among his slaves edith was the one whom the other slaves found it most difficult to understand  i will go on she said to her father and do everything for him while he is an invalid but when he is well enough to be moved either he or i must go out of this  her father simply said that he did not understand it but then he was one of the other slaves  edith said the captain one day speaking from his rugs on the bank upon the lawn just say that one word i yield it will have to be said sooner or later  i will not say it captain clayton said edith with a firm voice  so you have gone back to the captain said he  i will go back further than that if you continue to annoy me it shall be nothing but plain sir as hard as you please you might as well let go my hand you know that i do not take it away violently because of your wound  i knowi knowi know that a girls hand is the sweetest thing in all creation if she likes you and leaves it with you willingly then there was a little pull but it was only very little  of course i dont want to hurt you said edith  and therefore it feels as though you loved me of course it does your hand says one thing and your voice another which way does your heart go  right against you said edith but she could not help blushing at the lie as she told it my conscience is altogether against you and i advise you to attend more to that than to anything else but still he held her hand and still she let him hold it  at that moment hunter appeared upon the scene and edith regained her hand but had the captain held the hand hunter would not have seen it hunter was full of his own news and as he told it very dreadful the story was there has been a murder worse than any that have happened yet just the other side of the lake and he pointed away to the mountains and to that part of lough corrib which is just above cong  another murder said edith  oh miss no other murder ever told of had any horror in it equal to this i dont know how the governor will keep himself quiet there with such an affair as this to be looked after there are six of them downor at any rate five  when a doubt creeps in one can always disbelieve as much as one pleases  you can hardly disbelieve this sir as i have just heard the story from sergeant malcolm there were six in the house and five have been carried out dead one has been taken to cong and he is as good as dead their names are kelly an old man and an old woman and another woman and three children the old woman was very old and the man appears to have been her son  have they got nobody asked clayton  it appears not sir but there is a rumour about the place that there were many of them in it  looking after one another said clayton so that none should escape his share of the guilt  it may be so but there were many in it sir i cant tell much of the circumstances except the fact that there are the five bodies lying dead and hunter with some touch of dramatic effect and true pathos pointed again to the mountains which he had indicated as the spot where this last murder was committed  it was soon settled among them that hunter should go off to the scene of action cong or wherever else his services might be required and that he should take special care to keep his master acquainted with all details as they came to light for us we may give here the details as they did reach the captains ears in the course of the next few days  hunters story had only been too true the six persons had been murdered barring one child who had been taken into cong in a state which was supposed hardly to admit of his prolonged life the others who now lay dead at a shebeen house in the neighbourhood consisted of an old woman and her son and his wife and a grown daughter and a son all these had been killed in various wayshad been shot with rifles and stoned with rocks and made away with after any fashion that might come most readily to the hands of brutes devoid of light of mercy of conscience and apparently of fear it must have been a terrible sight to see for those who had first broken in upon the scene of desolation in the course of the next morning it had become known to the police and it was soon rumoured throughout england and ireland that there had been ten murderers engaged in the bloody fray it must have been as captain clayton had surmised one with another intent upon destroying that wretched familyor perhaps only one among its numberhad insisted that others should accompany him a man who had been one of their number was less likely to tell if he had a hand in it himself and so there were ten of them it might be that one among the number of the murdered had seen the murder of mr morris or of pat gilligan or the attempted murder of captain clayton and that one was not sure not to tellhad perhaps shown by some sign and indication that to tell the truth about the deed was in his breastor in hers some woman living there might have spoken such a word to a friend less cautious in that than were the neighbours in general then we can hear or fancy that we can hear the muttered reasons of those who sought to rule amidst that bloody community they were a family of the kellysthese poor doomed creaturesbut amidst those who whispered together amidst those who were forced to come into the whispering there were many of the same family or at any rate of the same name for the kellys were a tribe who had been strong in the land for many years though each of the ten feared to be of the bloody party each did not like not to be of it for so the power would have come out of their hands they wished to be among the leading aristocrats though still they feared and thus they came together dreading each other hating each other at last each aware that he was about to put his very life within the others power and each trying to think as far as thoughts would come to his dim mind that to him might come some possibility of escape by betraying his comrades  but a miracle had occurredthat which must have seemed to be a miracle when they first heard it and to the wretches themselves when its fatal truth was made known to them while in the dead of night they were carrying out this most inhuman massacre there were other eyes watching them six other eyes were looking at them and seeing what they did perhaps more plainly than they would see themselves think of the scene there were six persons doomed and ten who had agreed to doom them and three others looking on from behind a wall so near as to enable them to see it all under the fitful light of the stars nineteen of them engaged round one small cabin of whom five were to die that nightand as to ten others it cannot but be hoped that the whole ten may pay the penalty due to the offended feelings of an entire nation  it may be that it shall be proved that some among the ten had not struck a fatal blow or it may fail to be proved that some among the ten have done so it will go hard with any man to adjudge ten men to death for one deed of murder and it is very hard for that one to remember always that the doom he is to give is the only means in our power to stop the downward path of crime among us it may be that some among the ten shall be spared and it may be that he or they who spare them shall have done right  but such was not the feeling of captain yorke clayton as he discussed the matter day after day with hunter or with frank jones upon the lawn at castle morony it would be the grandest sight to seeten of them hanging in a row  the saddest sight the world could show said frank  sad enough that the world should want it but if you had been employed as i have for the last few years you would not think it sad to have achieved it if the judge and the jury will do their work as it should be done there will be an end to this kind of thing for many years to come think of the country we are living in now think of your fathers condition and of the injury which has been done to him and to your sisters and to yourself if that could be prevented and atoned for and set right by the hanging in one row of ten such miscreants as those would it not be a noble deed done these ten are frightful to you because there are ten at onceten in the same villageten nearly of the same name people would call it a bloody assize where so many are doomed but they scruple to call the country bloody where so many are murdered day after day it is the honest who are murdered but would it not be well to rid the world of these ruffians and remember that these ten would not have been ten if some one or two had been dealt with for the first offence and if the ten were now all spared whose life would be safe in such a golgotha i say that to those who desire to have their country once more human once more fit for an honest man to live in these ten men hanging in a row will be a goodly sight  there must have been a feeling in the minds of these three men that some terrible step must be taken to put an end to the power of this aristocracy before life in the country would be again possible when they had come together to watch their friends and neighbours and see what the ten were about to do there must have been some determination in their hearts to tell the story of that which would be enacted why should these ten have all the power in their own hands why should these questions of life and death be remitted to them to the exclusion of those other three and if this family of kellys were doomed why should there not be other families of other kellyswhy not their own families and if kerrycullion were made to swim in bloodfor that was the name of the townland in which these kellys livedwhy not any other homestead round the place in which four or five victims may have hidden themselves so the three with mutual whisperings among themselves with many fears and with much trembling having obtained some tidings of what was to be done agreed to follow and to see it was whispered about that one of the family the poor mans wife probably had seen the attack made upon poor pat gilligan and may or may not have uttered some threat of vengeance may have shown some sign that the murder ought to be made known to someone was not pat gilligan her sisters husbands brothers child and he was not one of the other the rich aristocracy against whom all mens hands were justly raised some such word had probably passed the unfortunate womans lips and the ten men had risen against her the ten men each protecting each other had sworn among themselves that so villainous a practice so glaring an evil as this of telling aught to the other aristocracy must be brought to an end  but then the three interfered and it was likely that the other the rich aristocracy should now know all about it it was not to save the lives of those unfortunate women and children that they went there would be danger in that and though the women and children were at any rate their near neighbours why should they attempt to interfere and incur manifest dangers on their account but they would creep along and see and then they could tell or should they be disturbed in their employment they could escape amidst the darkness of the night there could be no escape for those poor wretches stripped in their bed none for that aged woman who could not take herself away from among the guns and rocks of her pursuers none for those poor children none indeed for the father of the family upon whom the ten would come in his lair if his wife had threatened to tell he must pay for his wifes garrulity pat gilligan had suffered for some such offence and it was but just that she and he and they should suffer also but the three might have to suffer also in their turns if they consented to subject themselves to so bloody an aristocracy and therefore they stalked forth at night and went up to kerrycullion at the heels of the other party and saw it all now one after another the six were killed or all but killed and then the three went back to their homes resolved that they would have recourse to the other aristocracy  between galway and cong and kerrycullion hunter was kept going in these days so as to obtain always the latest information for his master for though the neighbourhood of morony castle was now supposed to be quiet and though the captain was not at the moment on active service hunter was still allowed to remain with him and indeed captain claytons opinion was esteemed so highly that though he could do nothing he was in truth on active service they are sticking to their story all through he asked hunter or rather communicated the fact to hunter for his benefit  oh yes sir they stick to their story there is no doubt about them now they cant go back  and that boy can talk now  yes sir he can talk a little  and what he says agrees with the three men there will be no more murders in that county hunter or in county galway either when they have once learned to think it possible that one man may tell of another there will be an end to that little game but they must hang them of course  oh yes sir said hunter id hang them myself the whole ten of them rather than keep them waiting  the trial is to be in dublin before that day comes we shall find what they do about lax i dont suppose they will want me or if they did for the matter of that i could go myself as well as ever  you could do nothing of the kind captain clayton said edith who was sitting there it is absurd to hear you talk in such a way  i dont suppose he could just go up to dublin miss said hunter  not for life and death roared the sick man  i suppose you could for life and death said hunterwith a little caution  for his own death he could said edith but its the death of other people that he is thinking of now  and you what are you thinking of  to tell the truth just at this moment i was thinking of yours you are here under our keeping and as long as you remain so we are bound to do what we can to keep you from killing yourself you ought to be in your bed  tucked up all roundand you ought to be giving me gruel then hunter simpered and went away he generally did go away when the lovescenes began  you could give one something which would cure me instantly  no i could not there are no such instant cures known in the medical world for a man who has had a hole right through him  that bullet will certainly be immortal  but you will not if you talk of going up to dublin  edith a kiss would cure me  captain clayton you are in circumstances which should prevent you from alluding to any such thing i am here to nurse you and i should not be insulted  that is true he said and if it be an insult to tell you what a kiss would do for me i withdraw the word but the feeling it would convey that you had in truth given yourself to me that you were really really my own would i think cure me though a dozen bullets had gone through me  then when ada had come down edith went to her bedroom and kissed the pillow instead of him oh if it might be granted to her to go to him and frankly to confess that she was all all his own and she felt as days went on she would have to yield though honour still told her that she should never do so     chapter xlviii  the new aristocracy fails   from this moment the mystery of the new aristocracy began to fade away and get itself abolished men and women began to feel that there might be something worse in store for them than the old course of policemen juries and judges it had seemed at first as though these evil things could be brought to an end and silenced altogether as far as their blessed country was concerned a time was coming in which everyone was to do as he pleased without any fear that another should tell of him though a man should be seen in the broad daylight cutting the tails off half a score of oxen it would be recognised in the neighbourhood as no more than a fair act of vengeance and nothing should be told of the deed let the policemen busy themselves as they might and the beauty of the system consisted in the fact that the fear of telling was brought home to the minds of all men women and children though it was certain that a woman had seen a cows tail mangled though it could be proved beyond all doubt that she was in the field when the deed was done yet if she held her peace no punishment would await her the policeman and the magistrate could do nothing to her but thady oleary the man who had cut a cows tail off could certainly punish her if nothing else were done she could be boycotted or in other words not allowed to buy or sell the necessaries of life or she could herself be murdered as had happened to pat gilligan the whole thing had seemed to run so smoothly  but now there had come or would soon come a change oer the spirit of the dream the murder of pat gilligan though it had made one in the necessary sequence of events one act in the course of the drama which as a whole had appeared to be so perfect seemed to them all to have about it something terrible no one knew what offence pat gilligan had given or why he had been condemned each man began to tremble as he thought that he too might be a pat gilligan and each woman that she might be a mrs kelly it was better to go back to the police and the magistrates than this  i do not know that we need lean too heavily on the stupidity of the countrys side in not having perceived that this would be so the countrys side is very slow in perceiving the course which things will take these ten murderers had been brought together each from fear of the others and they must have felt that though they were tena number so great when they considered the employment on which they were engaged as to cause horror to the minds of all of themthe ten could not include all who should have been included had the other three been taken in if that were possible how much better it would have been but the desire for murder had not gone so farits beauty had not been so perfectly acknowledged as to make it even yet possible to comprise a whole parish in destroying one family  then the three had seen that the whole scheme the mystery of the thing the very plan upon which it was founded must be broken down and thrown to the winds and we can imagine that when the idea first came upon the minds of those three that the entire family of the kellys was to be sacrificed to stop the tongue of one talkative old woman a horror must have fallen upon them as they recognised the duty which was incumbent on them the duty of saving those six unfortunates they did not recognise they could not screw themselves up to the necessary pitch of courage to enable them to enter in among loaded pistols and blackvisaged murderers the two women and the children had to die though the three men were so close to them so close as to have been certainly able to save them or some of them had they rushed into the cabin and created the confusion of another advent to this they could not bring themselves for are not the murderers armed but an awful horror must have crept round their minds as they thought of the selfimposed task they had undertaken they waited until the murders had been completed and then they went back home and told the police  from this moment the mystery by which murders in county galway and elsewhere were for a short period protected was over in ireland men have not seen as yet how much more lovely it is to tell frankly all that has been done to give openly such evidence as a man may have to police magistrates and justices of the peace than to keep anything wrapped within his own bosom the charm of such outspoken truth does not reconcile itself at once to the untrained mind but the fact of the loveliness does gradually creep in and the hideous ugliness of the other venture on the minds of those men of kerrycullion something of the ugliness and something of the loveliness must have made itself apparent and when this had been done it was not probable that a return to the utter ugliness of the lie should be possible whether the ten be hangedto the intense satisfaction of hunter and his masteror some fewer number such as may suffice the mitigated desire for revenge which at present is burning in the breasts of men the thing will have been done and the mystery with all its beauty will have passed away  at castle morony the beginning of the passing away of the mystery was hailed with great delight it took place in this wise a little girl who had been brought up there in the kitchen and had reached the age of fifteen under the eyes of ada and editha slip of a girl whose feet our two girls had begun to trammel with shoes and stockings and who was old enough to be proud of the finery though she could not bear the confinementhad gone under the system of boycotting when all the other servants had gone also peter who was very stern in his discipline to the younger people had caught hold of her before she went and had brought her to mr jones recommending that at any rate her dress should be stripped from her back and her shoes and stockings from her feet if you war to wallop her sir into the bargain it would be a good deed done peter had said to his master  why should i wallop her for leaving my service  she aint guv no notice said the indignant peter  and if i were to wallop you because you had taken it into your stupid head to leave me at a moments notice should i be justified in doing so  there is differences said peter drawing himself up  you are stronger you mean and feemy carroll is weak let her go her own gait as she pleases how am i to take upon myself to say that she is not right to go and for the shoes and stockings let them go with her and the dress also if i am supposed to have any property in it fancy a landleaguer in parliament asking an indignant question as to my detaining forcibly an unwilling female servant let them all go the sooner we learn to serve ourselves the better for us i suppose you will go too before long  this had been unkind and peter had made a speech in which he had said so but the little affair had taken place in the beginning of the boycotting disarrangements and mr jones had been bitter in spirit now the girls had shown how deftly they could do the work and had begun to talk pleasantly how well they could manage to save the wages and the food its my food youll have to save and my wages said captain clayton but this had been before he had a hole driven through him and he was only awed by a frown  but now news was brought in that feemy had crept in at the back door drat her imperence said peter who brought in the news its like her ways to come when she cant get a morsel of wholesome food elsewhere  then ada and edith had rushed off to lay hold of the delinquent who had indeed left a feeling in the hearts of her mistresses of some love for her little foibles oh feemy so youve come back again said ada and youve grown so big but feemy cowered and said not a word what have you been doing all the time said edith miss ada and i have had to clean out all the pots and all the pans and all  the gridirons though for the matter of that there has been very little to cook on them then ada asked the girl whether she intended to come back to her old place  if im let said the girl bursting into tears  where are the shoes and stockings said ada  but the girl only wept  of course you shall come back shoes or no shoes i suppose times have been too hard with you at home to think much of shoes or stockings since your poor cousin was shot in galway courthousefor feemy was a cousin of the tribe of carrollsi fear it hasnt gone very well with you all but to this feemy had only answered by renewed sobs she had however from that moment taken up her residence as of yore in the old house and had gone about her business just as though no boycotting edict had been pronounced against castle morony  and gradually the other servants had returned falling back into their places almost without a word spoken one boy who had in former days looked after the cows absolutely did come and drive them in to be milked one morning without saying a word  and who are you you young deevil said peter to him  im just larry obrien  and what business have you here said peter how many months ago is it since last year you took yourself off without even a word said to man or woman who wants you back again now i wonder  the boy who had grown halfway to a man since he had taken his departure made no further answer but went on with the milking of his cows  and the old cook came back again from galway though she came after the writing of a letter which must have taken her long to compose and the saying of many words  honoured miss the letter went ive been at peter corcorans doing work any time these twelve months and glad ive been to find a hole to creep into but peter corcorans house isnt like castle morony and so ive told him scores of times but peter is one of them landleaguers and is like to be bruk horse foot and dragoons bekaise he wouldnt serve the gentry may the deevil go along with him and with his pollytiks sure you know miss they wouldnt let me stay at castle morony wasnt one side in pollitiks the same as another to an old woman like me who only wants to arn her bit and her sup i dont care the vally of a tobaccopipe for none of them now so if the squire would take me back again may god bless him for iver and iver say i then this letter was signed judy corcoranfor she too was of the family of the corcoransand became the matter for many arrangements in the course of which she once more was put into office as cook at castle morony  then edith wrote the following letter to her friend rachel who still remained in london partly because of her health and partly because her father had not yet quite settled his political affairs but that shall be explained in another chapter      dearest rachel     here we are beginning to see daylight after having been    buried in cimmerian darkness for the best part of two    years i never thought how possible it would be to get    along without servants to look after us and how much    of the pleasures of life might come without any of its    comforts ada and i for many months have made every bed    that has been slept in in the house till we have come to    think that the making of beds is the proper employment for    ladies and every bit of food has been cooked by us till    that too has become ladylike in our eyes and it has been    done for papa who has i think liked his bed and his    dinner all the better because they have passed through    his daughters hands but dear papa im afraid he has    not borne the cimmerian darkness as well as have we who    have been young enough to look forward to the return of    something better     what am i to say to you about frank who will not talk    much of your perfections though he is always thinking    of them i believe he writes to you constantly though    what he says or of what nature it is i can only    guess i presume he does not send many messages to lord    castlewell who however as far as i can see has behaved    beautifully what more can a girl want than to have a lord    to fall in love with her and to give her up just as her    inclination may declare itself     what i write for now specially is to add a word to what    i presume frank may have said in one of his letters papa    says that neither you nor mr omahony are to think of    leaving this side of the water without coming down to    castle morony we have got a cook now and a cowboy what    more can you want and old peter is here still always    talking about the infinite things which he has done for    the jones family joking apart you must of course come    and see us again once before you start for new york is    frank to go with you that is a question to which we can    get no answer at all from frank himself     in your last you asked me about my affairs dear girl    i have no affairs i am in such a position that it is    impossible for me to have what you would call affairs    between you and frank everything is settled between    me and the man to whom you allude there is nothing    settledexcept that there is no ground for settlement    he must go one way and i another it is very sad you will    say i however have done it for myself and i must bear    the burden     yours always lovingly     edith     chapter xlix   it is not to be supposed that mr jones succumbed altogether to the difficulties which circumstances had placed in his way his feelings had been much hurt both by those who had chosen to call themselves his enemies and by his friends and under such usage he became somewhat sullen having suffered a grievous misfortune he had become violent with his children and had been more severely hurt by the death of the poor boy who had been murdered than he had confessed but he had still struggled on saying but little to anybody till at last he had taken frank into his confidence when frank had returned from london with his marriage engagement dissolved and the reengagement had not at all interfered with the renewed intimacy between frank and his father because the girl was absolved from her singing the father had feared that the son would go away from him and lead an idle life enjoying the luxuries which her rich salary would purchase frank had shared his fathers feelings in this respect but still the squire had had his misgivings all that was now set to rights by the absolute destruction of poor rachels voice  poor mr jones had indeed received comfort from other sources more material than this his relatives had put their heads together and had agreed to bear some part of the loss which had fallen upon the estate not the loss that is from the submerged meadows which was indeed mr joness own private concern but from the injury done to him by the commissioners indeed as things went on that injury appeared to be less extensive than had been imagined though the injustice as it struck mr joness mind was not less egregious where there was a shred of a lease the subcommissioners were powerless and though attempts had been made to break the leases they had failed and men were beginning to say that the new law would be comparatively powerless because it would do so little the advocates for the law pointed out that taking the land of ireland all through not five per centand again others not two per centwould be affected by it whether it had been worth while to disturb the sanctity of contracts for so small a result is another question but our mr jones certainly did feel the comfort that came to him from the fact certain fragments of land had been reduced by the subcommissioners after ponderous sittings very beneficial to the lawyers but which mr jones had found to be grievously costly to him he had thus agreed to other reductions without the lawyers and felt those also to be very grievous seeing that since he had purchased the property with a parliamentary title he had raised nothing there was no satisfaction to him when he was told that a parliamentary title meant nothing because a following parliament could undo what a preceding parliament had done but as the arrangements went on he came to find that no large proportion of the estates would be affected and that gradually the rents would be paid they had not been paid as yet but such he was told was the coming prospect pat carroll had risen up as a great authority at ballintubber and had refused to pay a shilling he had also destroyed those eighty acres of meadowland which had sat so near mr joness heart it had been found impossible to punish him but the impossibility was to be traced to that poor boys delinquency as the owner of the property turned it all over within his own bosom he told himself that it was so it was that that had grieved him most that which still sat heavy on his heart but the boy was gone and pat carroll was in prison and pat carrolls brother had been murdered in galway courthouse lax too was in prison and yorke clayton swore by all his gods that he should be hanged it was likely that he would be hanged and yorke clayton might find his comfort in that and now had come up this terrible affair at kerrycullion from which it was probable that the whole mystery of the new aristocracy would be abandoned mr jones as he thought of it all whispered to himself that if he would still hold up his head life might yet be possible at castle morony it will only be for myselfonly for myself and ada he said still mourning greatly over his fate and ada will go too the beauty of the flock will never be left to remain here with her father but in truth his regrets were chiefly for edith if that bloodthirsty captain would have made himself satisfied with ada he might still have been happy  in these days he would walk down frequently to the meadows and see the work which the men were doing he had greatly enlarged them having borrowed money for the purpose from the government land commissioners and was once again allowing new hopes to spring in his heart though he was a man so silent and appearing to be so apathetic he was intent enough on his own purposes when they became clear before his eyes from his first coming into this country his purport had been to do good as far as the radius of his circle went to all whom it included the necessity of living was no doubt the same with him as with othersand of living well he must do something for himself and his children but together with this was the desire nearly equally strong of being a benefactor to those around him he had declared to himself when he bought the property that with this object would he settle himself down upon it and he had not departed from it he had brought up his children with this purpose and they had learned to feel one and all that it was among the pleasures and the duties of their life then had come pat carroll and everything had been embittered for him all ballintubber and all morony had seemed to turn against him when he found that pat carroll was disposed to be hostile to him he made the man a liberal offer to take himself off to america but mr jones in those days had heard nothing of lax and was unaware that lax was a dominant spirit under whom he was doomed to suffer  i did not know you so well then said captain clayton to mr jones now some weeks hence or i could have told you that pat carroll is nobody pat carroll is considered nobody because he has not been to new york mr lax has travelled and mr lax is somebody mr lax settled himself in county mayo and thus he allowed his influence to spread itself among us over here in county galway mr lax is a great man but i rather think that he will have to be hanged in galway jail before a month has passed over his head  mr jones usually took his son with him when he walked about among the meadows and he again expressed his wishes to him as though frank hereafter were to have the management of everything but on one occasion towards the latter half of the afternoon he went alone there were different wooden barriers having sluice gates passing between them over which he would walk and at present there were sheep on the upper meadows on which the luxuriant grass had begun to grow in the early summer he was looking at his sheep now and thinking to himself that he could find a market for them in spite of all that the boycotters could do to prevent him but in one corner where the meadows ceased and pat carrolls land began he met an old man whom he had known well in former years named con heffernan it was absolutely the case that he the landlord did not at the present moment know who occupied pat carrolls land though he did know that he had received no rent for the last three years and he knew also that con heffernan was a friend of carrolls or as he believed a distant cousin and he knew also that con was supposed to have been one of those who had assisted at the destruction of the sluice gates

completed he had intended that yorke clayton should marry edith jones that frank jones should marry rachel omahony and that lax should be hanged for the murder of florian jones but no other coming
